These Patterns have opened my eyes to elegent and flexible ways to approach problems. In order to benefit from this book I believe it is necessary to have a solid grasp of Object Oriented concepts (in any language) and to have at least a basic understanding of the Java language.

I believe the truth is somewhere in between.I'm using the book as a course text for a final year undergraduate course I'm teaching which focusses on patterns. It's far from ideal, but there's nothing out there better as far as I know. There are many typos and thing which could be explained better, but I disagree with those reviewers who claim that the author doesn't understand the subject - in my opinion he clearly does. With one exception (the bizzare characterisation of Marker Interface as a fundamental design pattern) I don't believe there's anything fundamentally wrong.I'd like to encourage those people who are complaining that it's rubbish to either write a better book, or contribute detailed comments to the author, so he can produce an improved second edition (I'll be doing the latter). It has the potential to be a very good book.I agree with those who are saying that that volume 2 is very disappointing, but reviews of that shouldn't be contributing to the &quot;score&quot; of volume 1."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"I was really excited for a Java-slanted version of the famous Design Patterns book. This should have been an easy home run but Grand let us down on the details. I went into this book knowing some about Patterns and was eager to learn more. However, after wasting my time hacking my way through incorrect diagrams and inconsistencies between code and text I am about ready to through the book out, learn C and read Gamma's book. I don't know who edited this book but they obviously didn't know much about UML or Code.You want detail examples: Chapter Eight (Chain of Responsibility GoF95). A pretty simple pattern made difficult because of the incorrect UML diagram in the context (association arrows going the wrong direction), and the incorrect text conflicting with the code. I figured the pattern out by comparing it to Gamma's example, it is really quite simple.The there are many more examples, especially frustrating on some of the more abstract patterns. Grand should have hired a better editor.If you buy this book and know little about patterns I suggest you also get Gamma's book and refer to it often."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Having written several Java books myself and being a self confessed design pattern addict, I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately I was immensely disappointed with the content. I agree with most of the negative comments written here about both Vols 1 and 2 and only add my own voice to the crowd to ensure the weight of numbers prevails.The big problem with this book is that it is _so_ inaccurate, both syntactically and semantically, you cannot _trust_ the content.Some of the text is accurate: for example the description of the Visitor pattern is semantically fairly accurate although there are numerous typos and diagramming errors. However, the accompanying code is not a Visitor pattern. Since the key benefit of this book over other design pattern books is that the code is in Java, the usefulness of the book is lost.The net effect is that the beginner will not learn design patterns correctly.Given that a major benefit of design patterns is the common understanding of certain coding idioms, this is a very damaging book. It is like learning to play the piano the wrong way - once the damage is done to the technique it can take years of hard work to repair. You are much better off learning to play properly from the beginning. In the context of design patterns, this means reading the GoF, Siemens, and Doug Lea books."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Like others, I eagerly anticipated an encyclopedia of design patterns implemented in Java. Alas...I've hosted a bimonthly design pattern discussion group for just over a year. We recently began studying patterns from Grand's book which we had not yet covered. I acknowledge that I hold my opinions more strongly and am more vocal than most, and I would never try to speak on behalf of others. Even so, I think it would be fair to say that our study circle's concensus is &quot;Patterns in Java, Vol 1&quot; is a poor book.I, of course, have a much stronger opinion: I think &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; is actually detrimental to both the design pattern and Java communities. The writing is terrifically bad. The errors are countless. The intepretation, context, and presentation of the patterns are misguided at best. The example implementations are remarkably sophomoric. As one wag put it, &quot;This book is an excellent source of anti-patterns.&quot; An item by item critique of &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; would be roughly twice as long as the book itself; certainly not a task I would relish.I've been advised to take the good with the bad. Sure, no book is perfect. For instance, our circle was less than satisfied with the presentation of both Flyweight and Intepreter in &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by Gamma et al. But I think we all agree that &quot;Design Patterns&quot; is an excellent book overall. I also accept that patterns appearing in the PLoP books are sometimes formative. Schucks, I even value most pattern articles and features in the various magazines.Having said all that, I have found NOTHING whatsoever of value in &quot;Patterns in Java&quot;. I strongly recommend that you NOT buy this book. All of the patterns presented in &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; are covered better elsewhere.

However, it turns out to be a nightmare to most. The material in the book was so poorly explained that I got lost reading it even after a few times. Sometimes, the author tried to illustrate the implementation of the Pattern by presenting a Java Code fragment. the code was so incomplete that I had no idea what is going on. Furthermore, in the chapter about Snapshot Pattern. The author first describes the pattern by mentioning a typical computer game example which is an interesting introduction. He should have explained more based on this example instead he confused readers by mentioning about serialisation and jump straight to game model class without any class diagrams."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Nowhere near the GoF treatment.

(The Gof book is based on SmallTalk &amp; C++ and uses through out the book, the long-winded &quot;Maze game&quot; example which I lose interest quickly and hard to understand. I think The GOF book needs updating with different examples for each patterns and also with Java code.). One thing I found is typos and errors in this book. Also, author needs to be very clear and precise about what he is referring to in a pattern as there are several interacting classes around. Use the class name if he needs to. At times, I found that he is not clear..and I lost him.Other than that, it is probably the best book after GoF.

This is not it. All the good stuff that Java can do is ignored in this book. I took a look at 2 classic patterns which have been crying out for a nice clean interpretation in Java using Interfaces - Composite and Visitor! Neither pattern in this book makes use of Interfaces. The author almost points it out directly when explaining Composite Pattern when he suggests that it is useful for Tree structured data - you mean like &quot;TreeModel&quot; interface in Swing? Yeh, of course. So why aren't you using interfaces in your implementation? I get irked by the constant justification of the implementations because they were used in the JDK or the JFC. Does that mean the Sun people are infalible? How many Swing developers have wished that JComponent was an Interface and not an essential super class? The truth is that such an implementation on Composite Pattern is a hinderance and not a help in Java. You only have one go at Inheritance in Java and the implementation shown wastes it.

Both books are a must for the serious seeker and student. This author has done tremendous research and supports modern numerology from its ancient roots. She provides the most comprehensive explanations, meanings, and coverage of the numbers and the alphabet/letters that I have ever seen. Further, she details the evolution of the ancient alphabet from the Phoenician and Hebrew times to present day, as well as introducing linkages with gematria, temurah &amp; notariqn; the Tree of Sephiroth; and the Tarot. There are many examples and interpretations; charts; and reference tables. Compound, master, and mystic numbers are covered as well as a host of other information. Even after years of study, once I read both of her books, I now feel that I have only just begun....there is so much depth to this subject if one is so inclined to pursue it.

As long as birds are flying, and not sitting or walking on the ground, I see nothing wrong with hunting.

As I read further I still felt the parallels but the plot and characters are truly individuals. The insights into life near the border are eye-opening and tragic at times but seem realistic (although I have had no exposure to that part of the country except in books). It is a part of the country, a way of life that I have no exposure to and I felt as if I was truly a witness to all that happend in Larry's Elvia, and Sarafina's lives. I could not put this book down - it is the first book by Susan Straight that I have read. I also felt some similarities in style (?) to T.

The main character tries to learn about her biological mother who left her when she was a small child.The setting is in the California desert and Mexico."},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"Susan Straight's &quot;Highwire Moon&quot; is a very earnest, factual, precisely written novel of what is a very emotional, pathos-filled subject: a mother and her daughter's quest to be reunited after having been torn apart through no fault of their own. What makes this story different is that Sarafina, the mother, is a &quot;Mixtec&quot; or native Mexican woman from Oaxaca, Mexico and her daughter Elvia is an American, born of Larry Foley, a day laborer a couple steps above Sarafina in the social stata. It is this clash of cultures, to quote an old phrase, which adds depth and resonance to this already emotional situation. Sarafina, an illegal alien, is deported as a result of a freak traffic accident and Elvia, asleep in the car at the time is erroneously placed in foster care as a result. Larry searches for Elvia but it takes 10 years for him to find her. Sarafina spends the same amount of time trying to to make it back to the USA from Mexico while also having to deal with her mother's declining health. Unfortunately, Straight tells this story in an almost bloodless manner, dry of emotion...a sociology tract. Straight is using this novel as a way of informing us of the plight of the illegal alien and thus is more interested in the &quot;world view&quot; rather than the specifics. It is only in Elvia's scenes with a foster mother, Sandy Narlette that Straight loosens up the sociology and writes with candor and feeling. Sandy is Elvia's anchor, her home the only place where she always felt/feels wanted and loved and Sandy returns this love in kind. If only the entire novel would have the same emotional weight as these scenes between Sandy and Elvia. An interesting note is that &quot;Highwire Moon&quot; has been nominated for a National Book Award in Fiction. And to the National Book Award committee this subject matter must have seemed as foreign as a novel set in Greenland..maybe more so. But for those of us living in a border state this is a situation that we face every day..it is a part of our lives. Susan Straight has the writing chops to produce a novel of emotional weight and resonance. Sad for us in &quot;Highwire Moon&quot; her interests lay elsewhere."},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"This is a vivid, intense, and ultimately overwrought book, about a Mexican Indian girl who is forcibly separated from her three year old daughter. Susan Straight has a whole lot to say about the plight of the illegal immigrant and those that live on the fringes of our society. She plunges the reader into the horrors of migrant labor with examples of violence, prevalent drug use, and sexual predation. Her characters are great-hearted people, with big dreams, but instead of focusing on the plot (how about some interaction between the main characters?!?!), Susan Straight instead chooses to hit us over the head with her thoughts on love, race, and class."},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"This is a riveting novel of a mother and daughter's search for each other through time, distance and dreams. The book describes in heartbreaking detail the lives of undocumented farm workers, foster children, and others on the margins of our society.

To read Susan Straight's novels is to enter a world unique in American fiction."},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"WOW! I liked Straight's earlier novel, I Been in Sorrow's Kitchen, so I bought this right away when I saw it on the shelf. It's the story of Serafina, an indigenious Mexican woman, and Elvia, the half-American daughter she was forced to leave behind during an immigration raid. The two spend years searching for each other throught Mexico and Southern California. Straight does a great job of portraying the region's beauty and heartbreak. The characters are so flawed, yet so compelling, and the pacing and suspense makes this hard to put down. Warning, though: really packs an emotional whallop. A must for mothers and Steinbeck-lovers. Why hasn't Oprah picked this yet?"},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"An Indian woman from Mexico travels to the U.S. for work. She meets an American and has a child with him.

Serafina, an illegal immigrant, is mistakenly separated from her toddler daughter and sent back to Mexico where she gets trapped caring for her ailing mother. Her daughter treks through the CA welfare system, one foster home to another, and emerges as a pregnant teenager.The majority of the book parallels Serafina's trek north, across the border once again to search for her child, while Elvia does the same in the opposite direction, searching for her mother.Frankly, I loved the story and the writing."},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"Susan Straight delivers a tremendous novel which deals with a wide range of current social issues.

The reading felt choppy with points of view just popping up for no apparent reason, with chapters hinging on unbelievable details (like a guy having sex with his girlfriend and not noticing she is five months pregnant.), with main characters acting deliberately dumb. It was painful to read.

I came into the book a little suspicious. I came away a lot less so, and that was because I didn't think it was either too bad or very good. Though to a certain degree the protagonists were supposed to be an undocumented Mexican woman and her daughter, fathered by a poor Anglo, the novel doesn't try to go too deep inside their head. Rather, the simple plot's most interesting details are about the Anglos the daughter grows up with; otherwise it does not go beyond what's already well-known to everyone except apparently those on the east who must still find the story of crossing the Mexican border fascinating and new. Straight didn't add anything unique to that. I found the sentimental story of the daughter and mother longing to meet up with each other after so many years very romanticized and hard to follow. If you want to read about the border, read Ruben Martinez's new one, which is powerful. If you want to read the best book of fiction published last year, as this one was, but inside a Chicano experience, read Dagoberto Gilb's beautiful &quot;Woodcuts of Women.&quot;"},{"Title":"Highwire Moon","review":"Susans Straight's writing is exquisite and the story of Serafina, Elvia, Larry and the others is heartrending.

It's author Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) is a poetic master of hardboiled noir crime fiction. His metaphoric and colorful language; fascinating characters and sparkling prose make Chandler an American original. His works leap the high wall between mystery fiction and true literary art.The High Window opens at a house in the Oak Noll Section of Pasadena. An obese, obtuse and cruel double widow with the name of Elizabeth Bright Murdock has called Marlowe to her home. The grotesque woman wants Marlowe to locate a rare coin known as the \\"Brasher Doubloon\\" which belonged to her late husband. The doubloon has been stolen. Murdock wants Marlowe to locate her former showbiz girl daughter-in-law Linda Conquest whom she suspects is guilty of the heist. Linda has been recently divorced from Lester Murdock the weak little Uriah Heepish cipher who is Mrs. Murdock's son. Marlowe also meets the intriguing Miss Merle Davis who is the virginal secretary of Mrs. Murdock. What lurks beneath the surface? Who stole the coin? What dirty secrets are being hid from the eyes of the police? Answers await as we join Marlowe on a dive into the inferno of sin which lies at the belly of the beast of Los Angeles.This is the opening scene in a novel filled with all the twists and turns we expect in a Chandler novel. Along the way there are three murders as wheel spins within wheel in the shady, cruel, cynical and convoluted morality of the characters inhabiting the Chandlerian universe.We remember Chandler for his skill in realistic dialogue and word paintings of Los Angeles and its 1940s environs. The plots are hard to follow and forgettable. Pick up a Chandler novel for pure reading pleasure as your eyes scan the lines penned by a master of American fiction!"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler is that rare sort of novelist who creates a world that sings with individuality while inviting others to join the fun. That, perhaps, is Chandler's greatest talent--he makes his world inviting while never pandering to prurient or common tastes. In A High Window, Philip Marlowe, Chandler's famous American icon of cynicism and subtle honor, is tasked with finding a rare coin and the person who stole it. His client is a bossy, asthmatic, hulk of a woman who downs glass after glass of port and who doesn't mind telling Marlowe her low opinion of his character and skills. Of course, she's wrong. And she's hiding all sorts of secrets of her own. As in all Philip Marlowe adventures, the ride is always more fun than the destination. When you read Raymond Chandler, you're lovingly dumped into a landscape filled with bums, dames, rich psychotics, corrupt cops, and sleazy hotel managers. And those are the ordinary people in his novels. Read A High Window. Get out your trenchcoat. Be sure to pack a .45. You're going to \\"noir\\" town.Donald Gallinger is the author ofThe Master Planets"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"In this one, Marlowe seems to have gotten a lot smarter than he was in FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, a novel in which he was so drunk most of the time that you had to wonder how he managed to survive, let alone adequately \\"investigate\\" anything. But in THE HIGH WINDOW, Marlowe is on the ball. He takes a job for a wealthy, twice-widowed matron, to track down her missing daughter-in-law who, the matron believes, absconded with a precious gold coin from her deceased second husband's collection. The widow's son, abandoned husband of the missing woman, is in the dark and wants to know what gives. He chases Marlowe, as does another detective who is apparently on another, related case. Marlowe out-slicks these guys, along with a semi-tough actor-turned-gangster and his menacing bodyguard, managing to figure out what it's all about, with the murders piling up and the cops breathing down his neck. He even uncovers a murder he wasn't supposed to and proves his good-heartedness in the process by straightening out a very unhealthy family situation. Although he continues to down his liquor as he pushes through the mires of this case, it feels more like social drinking this time, rather than the obsessively self-destructive bingeing seen in the earlier novel. In fact, though Marlowe's employer may be dissatisfied with the result of the investigation she has initiated in a moment of pique, we are not, for he solves the crime he was called in for and sets things that have been very much askew to rights in a most un-Marlowe like manner, leaving matters better than he found them, despite three murders and a darkly tangled familial history. -- SWM"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective stories, while never dull, can sometimes have almost hysterical, over-the-top plots which become terribly confusing to decipher. Fortunately the cracking dialogue and bizarre characters compensate nicely. In The High Window the author takes a breather, and delivers a story which is relatively simple ... and enjoyable to read.Like in many Marlowe stories, our naughty private eye is hired by a rich recluse. This time the recluse is a rich widow who believes her trashy daughter-in-law has stolen a rare coin inherited from her deceased hubby. As Marlowe investigates we understand that the daughter-in-law keeps some rather nasty company, and before long Marlowe is tangled in multiple homicide situation. Of course in the end it is all resolved in a surprisingly uncontrived way (..at least by Raymond Chandler standards).My only real complaint, or rather disappointment, is the general absence of Marlowe's normally razor-sharp sarcasm. In other books Marlowe can be extremely brutish with the ladies, and the ladies all fall in love with him. In The High Window we do not see this side of Marlowe, and so he seems somewhat two-dimensional in this story.Bottom line: most definitely not a Chandler classic, but certainly a very enjoyable read. Recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Marlowe goes to Pasadena to meet a client about a job. First he has to get past the secretary. Miss Davis is a rather meek soul, who asks for his references, and once they check out, she takes him to see the client--Mrs. Elizabeth Murdock. Mrs. Murdock is a large, hard woman with an unpleasant attitude, one that isn't above haggling Marlowe about what his expenses consist of. The situation is this--something of value has been stolen from her, and she suspects the culprit to be her daughter-in-law, the item in question being a very rare and valuable coin known as a Brasher Doubloon.Mrs. Murdock didn't know the coin was missing until she received a suspicious phone call from a dealer named Morningstar making inquiries as to whether the coin was for sale. The thing is that any reputable dealer would know the coin isn't for sale, per the stipulations of the late Mr. Murdock's will. Then she checked and found out the coin was missing. She figures it was an inside job, as those are the only people who would have access to it. Mrs. Murdock wants the coin back, but she doesn't know where her son's wife went--plus she wants a divorce arranged. Marlowe agrees to take the case, and is handed back to the secretary to get his retainer--along with a little information, some voluntary, some not so. He learns that Linda Murdock, formerly Linda Conquest, once roomed with another girl named Lois Magic. And he learns that the secretary, Merle, has quite a thing, in her own quiet way, for Mrs. Murdock's son, which includes keeping his monogrammed handkerchief in a drawer, as well as a small caliber pistol.As Marlowe leaves the Murdock residence, he notices a sand-colored coupe that seems to be following him. But he could be wrong about that.Marlowe returns to his office, and while he's thinking about the case, he receives a visitor--Mr. Leslie Murdock, the son. He's trying to find out why Marlowe's been hired, but the PI is too cagey to divulge that bit of information. Murdock reveals more than he learns--namely, that he still loves his wife, and that he is into a guy named Morny for some big money, maybe twelve grand. Marlowe sends him on his way, and calls up Morningstar, making an appointment to see him at his office at 3 o'clock.He can't find Lois Magic in the phone book, so he uses a connection to learn what he can about Morny. Turns out he married Lois Magic. Small world indeed. He gets an address and heads over there, but the hired help say she isn't at home. Well, there's more than one way to do things, so Marlowe does it his way, and finds out from the chauffeur that Mrs. Morny is indeed at home, in the backyard, along with Mr. Vannier.Marlowe runs into the sand-colored coupe and its driver again, and confronts him. The guy breaks down and admits he's been following Marlowe. His name is Phillips and he's also a PI, working a case. Maybe they can work it together, since the cases seem to be related. He makes a time for Marlowe to come over to his place, and just for insurance, he gives him a key, in case he arrives first.Marlowe shows up, but it's too late for Phillips.And he's only the first stiff.Fake coins, missing wives, cheating wives, terrified secretaries, and a body count that just won't quit. All in the job description for Phillip Marlowe.The High Window is the third book in the Philip Marlowe series. I liked it as much as I did the others. Chandler has a way with words that is truly unique, and he paints a vivid picture of the times and the people, drawing memorable characters. I like that Marlowe has layers, and we see more and more of those layers as time goes on. In this story, he's a real gentleman. We already knew he was honest. The story has all the ingredients of a good mystery--dead bodies, people with secrets, lies, and mysteries.

The High Window may not be high profile, but it's still top of the game. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Having read The Big Sleep and Farewell, My Lovely, I dove eagerly into the next Raymond Chandler novel in queue. The High Window offers the standard Chandler fare of murder, blackmail and general malefaction, though its characters don't form quite as well. Philip Marlowe, the archetypical 40's investigator, is reliably entertaining, but Merle Davis, the flighty personal assistant of Marlowe's client, is so neurotic she defies description. Ultimately, she also defies the plot.It's important to point out that I appraise in relative terms. The author's previous novels were so entertaining that even the slightest Chandler misstep would resound. But, Merle Davis is a difficult proposition to get past and she eventually becomes the heart of the story.Still, it's an engrossing story and, while it might not hit the heights of previous efforts, it is classic Raymond Chandler: 40's-era LA, mystery and menace, and a cunning private eye. Because of this, it deserves to be read. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"I love Raymond Chandler.

It's flawed the way America's underbelly is flawed but it's always clear where Marlowe's sympathies lie...with the poor, the lost, the wicked, the desperate doing all they can to get out of poverty's trap. But he takes everyone as he finds them and gives them their due.

As always there are plots within plots and it is many a false lead and bump on the noggin' before the intrepid Marlowe puts this one to rest. As usual there is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the motives of the parties involved. And where does this novel stand in relationship to the other Marlowe epics? Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. Nevertheless, as always with Chandler, you get high literature in a plebian package.

The book is classic Chandler: beautifully descriptive prose almost wasted on the seedy characters that populate the storyline. The plot kicks off with a wealthy but crotchety old woman hiring Marlowe to recover a valuable gold coin she is sure was stolen by her now missing daughter-in-law. As Marlowe learns more about the matter, a young guy starts tailing him, then admits to being a fellow private dick who might need Marlowe's help with a case. Soon that guy turns up dead; in fact, throughout the tale Marlowe has a nasty habit of finding dead bodies, which only serves to exasperate the police, whom our leading man tends to frustrate by refusing to part with what he knows about whom.In the end, of course Marlowe figures it all out, but not before some surprises bend the plot this way and that. [We won't spoil what the novel's title implies...] One would not suspect this novel is some 60 years old; that it so readily entertains is certain testimony to its withstanding the aging process. Chandler's fine writing skills, bordering on literature, as usual tend to create a screenplay in our heads for us, which adds to the enjoyment.

The woman assumes that a misbehaving family member has run off with it, but of course the story ends up far more complex than that and Marlowe wends his way through gritty LA streets in search of the truth.Marlowe's penchant for doing the right thing is even more in evidence here, as he works to help out characters that many times don't realize they need help. He does it not for fame or fortune, but because it's the right thing to do.Chandler's writing style shines with its usual brilliance, and he crafts his characters with an easy hand. He has brought Marlowe along from his initial hard-drinking despair into a detective who - buoyed with past successes - is now more comfortable with himself and taking better care of himself. The wit crackles, and the novel is as enjoyable and entertaining as anything Chandler has written."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Chandler wrote his first four novels in rapid succession, then went to Hollywood for four years before writing the fifth Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;The Little Sister.&quot; These first four are &quot;original recipe&quot; Chandler -- the novels that defined high-brow hard-boiled.&quot;The High Window&quot; (the third) is the anomaly of the first batch because it is the only novel prior to &quot;The Little Sister&quot; that was written as a novel; &quot;The Big Sleep,&quot; &quot;Farewell My Lovely,&quot; and &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot; were all built using three to four of Chandler's earlier pulp short stories. Chandler called this practice &quot;cannibalizing.&quot;Chandler actually put aside the third cannibalized novel, &quot;Lady in the Lake,&quot; to work on &quot;The High Window.&quot; It's plot is only slightly less convoluted than the other three early novels, and it is slightly contrived, but what is interesting is the way in which it deliberately re-emphasizes concerns developed in its predecessor, &quot;Farewell, My Lovely.&quot; Chandler was pressed to make sense of a detective with so much cultural capital and the ability to turn such a fantastic phrase, and in these two novels the emphasis is on developing Marlowe's class animosities and his determination to preserve the free-agency afforded him by his vocation. He comes across as a relative high-brow determined to take out his sense of failure on those who pretend to be his betters, and who employ him, but who are phonies. It is a novel about class and about Marlowe working to control the exploitation inherent in hiring himself out.It may not be the best of the early four novels, but &quot;The High Window&quot; provides a clear and deliberate vision of Chandler's original conception of Marlowe. After the hiatus in Hollywood, he would begin to loosen the detective conventions and develop Marlowe as a man in existential crisis (in &quot;The Little Sister&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;)."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler wrote 4 noir novels in the late 30s and early 40s that defined the Southern California hardboiled thriller forever after. I first discovered them 41 years ago and instantly fell in love with them. The High Window, though, I thought at the time, and through several subsequent rereadings, was by far the least of the four. I hadn't reread it in at least 20 years now, but, based on some of the favorable Amazon comments, I read it again yesterday. My opinion of it, I'm sorry to say, hasn't changed in 41 years....Why do I think it's only a mediocre book? Forty-one years ago I couldn't have articulated it. Now, however, it's obvious:Because, basically, it's a boring story.As an earlier reviewer in these columns told us, The High Window was the only one of the first 4 Chandler books that was plotted as an entirety and not cobbled together from earlier short stories that Chandler had written for the pulp magazines. This, however, instead of being a virtue, actually turns out to be the major fault in the book.Philip Marlowe, the first-person narrator and hero, is as beguiling as ever but the story he tells -- basically the search for a missing coin of great value -- is dull and listless. Each individual character is nicely sketched, as only Chandler could do at the height of his powers, and the writing sparkles and pops. But -- and this sounds strange but is absolutely true -- the story itself could equally well have been written by Agatha Christie with Hercule Poirot as the main character. An investigation is mounted; the detective moves from one character to the next; a couple of bodies are discovered; the detective exchanges banter with the police; he talks with a few more characters; he wraps up the case and tells us who murdered whom -- probably.There is no menace directed at Marlowe, there is no suspense, there is no interest in finding out what is going to happen to any of the other characters, there is no action at all (unless you can call finding a couple of bodies action), and the plot itself is pretty dull if you stop and think about it for a few moments.Why is this?The short stories that Chandler wrote in the 30s for the pulp magazines (mostly Black Mask, I believe) were just that: pulp stories. They had action, violence, movement. Things happened to Marlowe (in his various incarnations) and Marlowe made things happen to other people. Guns went off, Marlowe got bopped on the head, he -- and other people -- were frequently in danger for their lives.When Chandler cobbled these stories together into three of his first four novels, he brought all of these elements into the freshly created books. Guns fired, Marlowe was bashed on the head, locked up in padded cells, beaten up by crooked cops, menaced by *real* gangsters. There was danger and suspense -- even if you (and Chandler) didn't always know exactly what was happening or who was doing what to whom -- or why. Chandler's exquisite writing and marvelous evocation of Los Angeles of that time was laid over these pulpish elements and transformed these gothically plotted books into literature. But literature that was exciting and impossible to put down. What *is* going to happen next in The Lady in the Lake? And why? And how is Marlowe going to get out of *this* predicament? In these three books you really want to know.In High Window there are none of these elements and the only reason you turn the pages is because of the wizardry of Chandler's writing and the picture he draws of 1941 Los Angeles and Pasadena during a few hot summer days. Here the cops are more friendly than threatening, all violence is off-page, the semi-gangster nightclub owner and his supposedly deadly bodyguard are minor characters who manifest nothing more than a few lines of tough-guy dialogue -- which then disappears when Marlowe is hired by them to do a job....The transportation back to this vanished era of South California is well worth reading this book for (at least for me); but as a thriller up to the standards of the other early Chandlers it is simply a non-starter.Beware...."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"The High Window is a fast paced, intricately plotted story inhabited by an abundance of interesting and colorful characters.Once again, Raymond Chandler has succeeded in painting very vivid pictures of the various locales depicted with his unique brand of highly descriptive prose.

It has all the noirish elements needed to be a great read: a rare coin is the perfect MacGuffin; a sultry, adulterous blonde provides the jaded sexual appeal; an emotionally-abused young lady is the damsel in distress; a psychotic villain is flawlessly despicable and the labyrinthine plot is well-nigh impossible to predict until the very last page.The above having been said, this well-written novel is not without its faults. My three qualms lie with what essentially was the waste of a spectacular character (Eddie Prue), the retread of \\"The Big Sleep\\" formula and the lack of suspense.Addressing the first qualm, a subtle tension builds between the one-eyed Eddie Prue -- an emotionless bagman -- and wise-cracking Marlowe for the latter half of the novel. This mounting tension is left entirely unresolved and, thus, is dissatisfying.The second qualm is that the Mrs. Murdock character seems to be carbon copy of General Sternwood from \\"The Big Sleep.\\" They share far too many characteristics: a very wealthy recluse, physically disabled, world-wearily disillusioned, hampered by ailments, grim outlook, wayward offspring, etc. It seems that Chandler could have fleshed her character's uniqueness out just a tad more.Lastly, the lack of suspense throughout the novel may bore the casual reader. If it was not for Chandler's lively prose, I would have nodded off. The only time in which I was worried as to Marlowe's well-being was when he first hears Prue's voice in a very well-written piece.Despite these trivial flaws, it is a first rate novel and well-worth picking up."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"I decided to give this Raymond Chandler novel a shot after a vexing round of midterm examinations. If I didn't read something light and entertaining, my head would have exploded! I'd never read noir before, but I found this book to be pretty representative of what one pictures when one thinks of noir: seedy characters and snappy dialogue in a big, dark city teeming with danger. Chandler apparently gave new life to this genre when he wrote a few (an unfortunate few) crime novels starring Phillip Marlowe, a private detective who has since become immortalized in film and T.V. Chandler didn't even start writing these books until he was in his late 50's. Thank goodness he did write them, because this book is a real hoot!The High Window finds Marlowe on the trail of a missing coin called the Brasher doubloon. Within a few pages we begin to see an endless parade of seedy and suspicious characters, such as Mrs. Murdock, a port-drinking hothead who hires Marlowe to find the coin. Other characters include a scummy nightclub owner, a couple of dirty dames, and a cast of supporting characters both wicked and wise. At the center of it all is Marlowe, doggedly pursuing the truth through all the deceits and danger. I really can't go into the story because doing so would probably ruin the suspense for anyone who hasn't read the book. Just be prepared to see some wacky characters and great scenes.This book wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it weren't for the dialogue. The language in this book is so clever and snappy that it literally makes the story. You'll howl out loud at some of the smart quips Marlowe tosses off as he tries to track down the doubloon. Another interesting aspect of the book is that everything occurs in the present tense. There is almost no history to know or anything in the future to worry about. This makes the story scream along at a fast pace; so fast that you won't want to put the book down. I never really thought I'd care for crime noir, but this book makes me want to read more! Recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"To be honest, it seems kind of silly giving this book only four stars. If you compare it to the vast majority of hardboiled or detective novels ever written, it would deserve five stars. It is only when it is compared to Chandler's other books that it falls short. This was his third novel, published after THE BIG SLEEP (which started the vogue for starting books and movies with the words \\"The Big\\") and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. In none of those books is plot and story as important as Chandler's exquisite prose, his wonderfully detailed descriptions, or his magnificently decadent characters. But even so the plots of those two look brilliant compared to this one.The number of problems with the plot of THE HIGH WINDOW is legion, but I'll highlight only two. Chandler wants Philip Marlowe to discover a body. There are a million ways to do this, but instead of something elegant and simple, Chandler creates incredibly unlikely scenarios whereby the future corpse gives Chandler a key to his apartment so that he won't be forced to wait around if he somehow doesn't happen to be there. This is such a cheap device that it is almost as if Chandler were trying to parody storytelling. Perhaps even sillier is a bizarre gun swap, in which the killer goes into a nearby apartment, finds a gun under the pillow of the tenant, and switches it with his own. Much of the subsequent story hinges on the strange gun swap.So, as an example of plot, THE HIGH WINDOW is a failure. Nonetheless, there is still the prose. Although Chandler is unquestionably one of the most imitated writers in literary history, no one has quite been able to match his power with words. Marlow enters a club. \\"A check girl in peach-bloom Chinese pajamas came over to take my hat and disapprove of my clothes. She had eyes like strange sins.\\" He prepares to question someone. \\"From thirty feet away she looked like a lot of class. From ten feet away she looked like something made up to be seen from thirty feet away.\\" He describes the residents of Bunker Hill: \\"Out of the apartment houses come women who should be young but have faces like stale beer; men with pulled-down hats and quick eyes that look the street over behind the cupped hand that shields the match flame . . . people who look like nothing in particular and know it.\\"And there are the characters. Though the best characters in THE HIGH WINDOW are not as memorable as the many, many memorable characters in THE BIG SLEEP or FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, there are still several so striking as to not easily slip out of mind.But substandard Chandler or not, he is one of those writers so brilliant and original that he deserves to be read in toto. One should read not this or that novel, but all of it, short stories included. He is one of the few writers to have played a major role in shaping our culture as a whole. But besides that, his books -- even the lesser ones -- are just a great, great read."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Having read a lot of Raymond Chandler through the years and now, finally going back and re-reading everything with a more widened perspective on the genre, The High Window easily stands out as his finest work.The High Window, unlike a lot of genre Private Detective stories, which so many other authors have spent lifetimes struggling to copy and coming up short, keeps you guessing until the very end. Some authors give you a nibble about half way through a story and it falls apart in your lap and you figure it out. The High Window defies that solidly. You will be guessing about this one until the very end. Nothing is done ham-handedly or over-quick just to wrap it up either. This book could serve as a role model to other authors about how to write an ending, as I'm sure it has -- even if you don't write Detective Noir fiction.If you're reading this review and a certain Humphrey Bogart film brought you here, and you don't know much about Raymond Chandler, just know that he was and is considered one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. During his lifetime however he was dismissed as just a regular struggling hack novelist, because of the Genre, and not given a lot of attention. A lot of other authors, like Philip K. Dick for instance, another Angelino, suffered greatly under this prejudice during their lifetime because of supposed conventionalities. Sometimes, looking back you just have to wonder if it really was a West Coast prejudice, where anything outside of the New York circle of authors was thought worthless, or the critics just didn't have enough insight into life. Probably both.The High Window moves very quickly, very smoothly, never misses a beat or falls flat for a single page. Chandler did drink a lot and it sometimes shows in his other novels, but with this effort you can see a lot of genius, planning and careful, methodic work ... just like the protagonist Philip Marlowe working a case.The dialogue is as witty as Farewell, My Lovely and the wisecracks are even sharper than The Big Sleep. This book is also absent of the one problem that I have Chandler and that is his disconnection of information from novel to novel. Some of his stories never mention a single word about anyone or anything from his other books, however, in The High Window, I underlined five direct references to his other works. These are nice touches and just things I like, because it's like going to a friends house and being able to recognize the furniture. The Little Sister does a better job with bringing out a familiar cadre of Policemen, but this book is seriously where it's at.The main thought regarding the story though is all about protection of the client and their anonymity. Marlowe knows that if he has to turn over and talk, he's pretty much out of a job. This is a story about just that and Marlowe goes to great lengths to protect that trust and Chandler does a deft job in making it a subtle undercurrent throughout the book, giving The High Window a sort of 'Moralist' back-drop. While he takes on only one paid client, it feels as if he makes an exercise in proving that his word is his bond with just about everyone he meets.Personally, this is easily my favorite Chandler novel to date.There's a few youtube links in the comments regarding some documentary footage concerning Chandler as well a Chandler interview with James Bond author Ian Fleming, where Chandler states that he believes himself to be one of the greatest living American writers -- and Fleming agrees. Fantastic stuff...."},{"Title":"99% Inspiration: Tips, Tales, and Techniques for Liberating Your Business Creativity","review":"I admit, I'm a technogeek, and I wondered if a book over a decade old could really teach me anything new about business creativity.If the book is Bryan W.

A lot, in fact.Bryan Mattimore is a creativity consultant. While to me \\"creativity consulting\\" conjures images of brainstorming software and \\"creativity\\" web sites, Mattimore writes primarily about low-tech creativity-boosting techniques.My second-favorite technique is called \\"The Gray Box\\" and involves having your group ask yes or no questions about the contents of a box until they determine what's in it. What actually was in Mattimore's box might surprise you, after you read the questions and responses.Mattimore's Idea Hooks (R) concept is nothing short of remarkable (and my favorite technique, by the way). He has developed a way to actually look at the idea \\"hooks\\" that led to great inventions and discoveries. This alone was worth the price of the book, which I actually just checked out of the library but intend to buy.The third technique I really like involves cutting-and-pasting, something I'm very familiar with as a writer. Except this is the kind I did as a kid, not the kind I'm used to now. In the book, marketing execs cut out magazine pictures and compared their product to their favorite things. Sounds kind of hokey here, but in the book, it's fascinating.I'm a creative person by nature, but 99% Inspiration really helped me think more creatively.

Granpappy and grandson Micah are approached by Mr. Hill of Hill's Tractor Sales with a tempting offer to buy a shiny new tractor. But Granpappy has farmed using his rusty but trusty tractor, ever since his old plow horse died. There is no way the old tractor should last another season, and Mr. Hill even bets 20 jelly donuts (one for every acre Granpappy plants in hay) that it will break down before the end of the summer. It doesn't. Mr. Hill pays up, and in a humorous conclusion that ol' rusty tractor even rescues Mr. Hill when he's bogged down in mud. This book is a lovely story about valuing people and things for their true worth, not their looks. All children are tempted by the &quot;new,&quot; especially when it's bright and shiny and offers all the bells and whistles. But just as Granpappy cares for Micah and for the land, he cares lovingly for his old but reliable tractor. When he burdens it with nearly impossible chores, he talks to it and coaxes it to perform. The language of the story is just as delightful as the message. It is perfect for read-alouds or storytime. The characters come to life with their dialogue (&quot;Wang-a-dang, sir! You got more good luck than a hound dog in a butcher's shop!&quot;). I recommend this book 100% for young readers and non-readers. The illustrations are lovely, with the old-fashioned farm warmly created in glowing tones. Joy Cowley has created another wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Rusty, Trusty Tractor, The","review":"This book is a very nice book for keeping children aware of the fact that sometimes &quot;old is best&quot; and maybe more reliable in some cases. Also it teaches that you don't have to have everything new in life to be happy. The relationship between the boy and his grandfather is wonderful. My 5 year old grandson is well aware of these facts, and this book reinforced these feelings. Thank you for a well-written children's book."},{"Title":"Rusty, Trusty Tractor, The","review":"Boy, is this a cute book! Little Micah and his grandfather are constantly being bugged by a pesky salesman who laughs when he first sees grandpappy's rusty old tractor. The salesman, Mr. Hill, swears that the old thing won't make it another season and begs grandpappy to come on down and look at his new tractors. It's quite funny to see how grandpappy has an answer for eac one of Hill's sales pitches, i.e. \\"this one has air conditioning,\\" said Mr. Hill. \\"Mine has air conditioning,\\" said Grandpappy. \\"When the air gets a little fresh, I just put on a jacket.\\" Hill eventually bets Grandpappy a jelly donut for each acre grandpappy farms with the old tractor. He makes it through and teaches Micah a lesson about being true to your friends. Grandpappy calls the old tractor his friend and sticks by it through and through. Pretty funny ending too - Hill has to be pulled out of the mud by the old tractor!What's also neat is that although she lives in New Zealand, the author nicely captured the \\"farmer slang\\" in this book. It's very well written and very entertaining, especially if you have a \\"tractor boy\\" in your house. There's a photo of each brand of tractor too on the beginning pages and it's fun to see if they can name them all. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Rusty, Trusty Tractor, The","review":"Great book according to my 2 year old son! I have to agree with him but probably our reasons differ -- he loves the colorful, fun pictures of tractors, a small boy and his grandfather's farm. The story is not his main draw yet although it does keep him listening. I love the idea presented by the author that an old tractor has value and is maybe even worth more than a newer piece of farm equipment. It's one of those stories with a moral that doesn't scream &quot;Important!

The salesman tries as hard as he can to sell the farmer a brand new shiny tractor and even has the farmers grandson on his side. But no matter what he says the farmer sticks with his old tractor saying it was his old friend and \\"friends don't let each other down\\". In the end the saleman loses a bet he makes with the farmer and needs the farmer and his tractor to help him out of a mess.In this day and age when NEW is better than OLD this book can help teach us all a lesson; just because something has lost it's shine does not make it less useful."},{"Title":"Rusty, Trusty Tractor, The","review":"In this story, a small boy watches as his grandfather steadfastly refuses the overtures of a new tractor salesman who claims that their rusty old tractor won't make it through another season.

But Granpappy stands firm, saying \\"this is my old friend, and friends don't let each other down. You remember that.\\" Throughout the plowing, planting, mowing, and baling of the hay, Micah watches Granpappy treat his fifty-year old tractor with kindness and respect, talking to it and whistling songs and - even though \\"plain and simple, no way is that tractor going to tow a hay baler\\" - the old tractor comes through. The enduring children's book theme of the power of friendship here receives a new unexpected treatment and the results are outstanding.

No chills, no thrills, but plenty of silly vignettes make GHOST HOUSE a hoot. The author may be clueless in making a scene work but, boy, what an ace she is in creating unintentional laughter !Take Gary, for example, the heroine's husband but also the main focus of the ghost's wrath. From being \\"pushed\\" down the stairs to falling down a window, McNally makes sure nothing is spared for him. So much repeatedly so you'll wish she'd put him out of his misery for good. What's even worse is the heroine's uncharacteristic nature. She's described as an overly sensitive artist (she paints), yet she can't even sense that she's making passionate love one night to an English accent speaking (!) ghost, not to her husband. The only character saved (well, almost) from all this nonsense is the librarian. She comes about being a judicious career gal with a heart--up until McNally puts her in a unlikely situation : who in their right mind would nonchalantly still go disco dancing after witnessing a supernatural near-death experience ?Thank heavens, this form of hilarity goes on and on, up until the ultimate braindead but perfect ending where not's all well that ends well.

How strange, then, to see him in this, his first major play, to see him attempting something very close to a kitchen sink drama.Indeed, there is a smack of Ibsenesque drawing-room realism so far removed from the 'total theatre' of Equus and Royal Hunt that some readers may find disconcerting. But, nevertheless, Shaffer's tender understanding of the emotional pressures of middle-class family life make this play just as extraordinary and gripping as any of the later, more popular successes.The play does exhibit Shaffer's characteristic love of linguistic versatility and, as with all his plays, is extremely relevent. I for one cannot but feel moved by the characters' tender denunciation of love and sexuality.A must for anyone wanting to find new layers to an original and penetrating writer."},{"Title":"Five finger exercise;: A play in two acts and four scenes","review":"If you loved Amadeus and Equus then honestly you probably won't like this play.Unlike either Amadeus or Equus the characters are decidedly NOT larger than life, the issues treated are likewise lacking in stature and unlike even his later Private Ear/Public Eye couplet and one of my personal favorites Lettice and Lovage there isn't even fun dialogue presented to pass the time.In other words, it's a non Peter Shaffer Peter Shaffer play but still it is an early effort by a guy who would be called the reincarnation of Shakespeare for the strength of his later works and for that reason it's worth a look. Now when I saw worth a look I mean for people who are interested in Shaffer.Even at this early stage in his career fascinations that would become all too current are on full display: Shaffer's ability to create gripping dialogue, his delight with music and his fascination with young and old men in crisis that would become the leit motif of Equus and to a lessor but still significant degree, Amadeus.Honestly I can't tell you that I actually liked this play but with what Shaffer would go on to do, I couldn't help but be fascinated by it watching as I did in its ambling rumanitions signs of Shaffer's later genius. How he went from this to his later greatness is beyond me, no less a riddle than the ones he would later create."},{"Title":"Five finger exercise;: A play in two acts and four scenes","review":"What is a Five Finger Exercise? Perhaps it is an allusion to the hands unique members, each with a different shape and function, frequently working together yet separate and able to be isolated? Perhaps it is a reference to a musical practice for the mastery of individual fingers within the complexity of a piano score. Maybe it is an overt symbol for a story of five people, bound by a home, a palm, in which they branch off and come together in differing combinations to quarrel and agree-a family.Whatever the case, the Peter Shaffer play Five Finger Exercise is a unique and interesting early work by the master behind The Royal Hunt of the Sun, Equus and Amadeus. The Harrington family is decidedly upper middle class English. Father Stanley is the self-made bread winner through his successful furniture business, while mother Louise is a continental Francophile, concerned with culture and liberal ideals. They are the \\"saloon and the salon,\\" respectively. Son Clive, 19, is a burgeoning man, newly at Cambridge, whose adolescent angst reflects his own internal hormonal coming of age and his lifelong presence amidst his parent's rows. Daughter Pamela is fourteen and the apple of all eyes, without the cynicism and hurt of the others, unknowing of the bad world outside and coming into romantic notions through her new tutor Walter, a German expatriate. Walter is a few years older than Clive, but worldly and understanding like none of the Harrington's.Without going into the arch of the tale, Five Finger Exercise is a vision of post WWII England's concerns for it future, whether conservative labor or liberal sensitivities can satisfy the progress (and horrors) of the 20th Century, women's pressing need to be more than mindless servants or children's hopes for their own identities-even when they conflict with a parents ideals-are possible. Walter is the key finger here, the outsider who is more understanding, able to see the trauma of family life and capable of loving it, he knows the world all too well, and serves as an agent of awareness for the closed minded Stanley, the dreamy Louise, the pained Clive and the blossoming Pamela.Unlike his famous works, which have traces of Clive and his sexual awakenings (Alan in Equus and Amadeus in Amadeus), or Stanley's stagnant middle aged professional (Dysart in Equus), this piece is smaller in scope, but only if one considers \\"family life\\" to be anything but epic."},{"Title":"AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HUMOR","review":"If you can't find a humourous anecdote here you can't find one anywhere. Perfect for the reference shelf of speakers and writers."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"Nepotism is an undue preference for a relative where fair and open competition should prevail. Kinship, per se, is not illegitimate. The Rothschilds and Joseph Kennedy had dynastic plans. The Rothschilds were at their zenith in the 1830's. They knew how to take advantage of a crisis.The election of 2000 triggered Bellow's, (he is the son of a literary star), consideration of nepotism when Gore and Bush, two sons of politically distinguished families, opposed each other. Economists view nepotism as an obstacle to healthy change. In the case of what observers call the New Nepotism, it is noted that the American environment has become more competitive. Privileges of birth are combined with merit. Perhaps the new sort represents a trend toward class stratification. Sicily, the model for Mario Puzo's GODFATHER is a low trust society. The political scientist Edward Banfield has theorized that it suffers from amoral familism. The question arises as to whether the Mafia is a family or a criminal gang. Arguably Americans have a restricted view of kinship. Families are bound together through affection and trust. Marriage is an alliance of kinship and groups.Kinship structures everyday actions in tribal societies. Nepotism is tolerated in many parts of the developing world. Confucius developed his ethics in response to a clan-based feudal system. It was an ethos of legitimate authority, filial piety. The basis of clan in China and in Africa is the ancestral cult. It was difficult to separate clan from civil service. The role of the eunuchs' in service to the Chinese monarchs came to be a solution to the pressure of the clans.In Hindu society a man is born with a debt to his ancestors, a debt to the sages, and a debt to the Gods. Indian society is organized at the level of caste. Nepotism has always been practiced in India.Athenian democracy arose in a familial context. The focus of Athenian life was the individual household. There was a patterm of late marriage and delayed inheritance. Patriarchal power was harsher in Rome than it was in Athens. The sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries was the golden age of nepotism. Napoleon had a primitive sense of kinship. America claims to be open to talents. Real and fictive kinship ties were of enormous importance to Puritan New England where education and discipline were stressed. The nepotism of the Adams family was inward and self-devouring."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"This is a highly original and interesting book that capturedmy attention from beginning to end.

The author writes in an engaging way and has a good grasp of the biological foundation of nepotism. The definition of nepotism can be slightly confusing. Nepotism in a broad sense refers to favoritism for relatives (genetic AND marital) and can be narrowly defined as favoritism for genetic relatives. The author, however, expands nepotism to refer to favoritism for non-relative friends as well, which is normally used and interpreted under a very different scenario (reciprocal altruism). So, one has to pay attention to the author's broadened definition.I understand that it's part of human nature that most of us would do favors to our relatives. So, as the author cogently argues, the complete elimination of nepotism would result in a world without humanness. The author tries to find a fine line between \\"good\\" nepotism and \\"bad\\" nepotism, but readers are left wondering where the demarcation is. In fact, this is not a solution at all because, as long as nepotism is allowed, it will be abused, as history has shown repeatedly. Nepotism in the government is particularly damaging to a democratic society, because, practically, it diverges taxpayers' money to serving the relatives and cronies of people in power, and, morally, it sustains the injustice that people are born unequal. Hence, nepotism is exactly the evil we want to fight against in the government. Some would argue that nepotism, if used appropriately, would promote loyalty, trust, and thus working efficiency. This is a wrong argument. A democratic government is built for fairness; it is not meant for efficiency. Military systems are built for efficiency, but never has there any that is democratic. Even if there are \\"successful\\" cases of governmental nepotism in the US history, as the author highlights in the book, one may wonder whether there were nobody else in the nation who could have done an equally good or even better job when given the opportunties to serve.Although nepotism may be allowable or even desirable in other situations for weaving together a harmonious family or society, it should nevertheless be absolutely avoided in the government. To do so, there are two solutions I can think of. One is to introduce an explicit policy for government officials to avoid nepotism as the US government has been doing, and the other is to establish a punitive system that can hold those who egregiously promote their own relatives or friends accountable for any bad consequence of their nepotism. The removal of nepotism will make our government one step closer toward the ideal of a government of, for, and by the people. The removal of nepotism in the government will also promote justice to advance our society to be truly meritocratic."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"The historical sections which make up the bulk of the book are very good. The author does a fine job of describing the biological imperatives of nepotism, classical nepotism, colonial nepotism, etc. Those chapters detailing the successes and failures of different practitioners of nepotism through the ages are fascinating to read.The specifically American version of modern nepotism is described by Bellow as being forgiving toward nepotism for providing entr&eacute;e into social, employment and power positions so long as the beneficiary subsequently proves themselves by merit. Family fumblers are appropriately punished in the author's view and family dynasties which fail the individual/generational meritocracy test do indeed go \\"from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations\\".The conclusion seemed like a cheap eraser jammed onto the end of an expensive mechanical pencil. It appears to have been cobbled together in a hurry and does not read like carefully reasoned inferences drawn from the historical sections of the book. The conclusion provides prescriptive attitudes regarding nepotism in modern society and this is by far the weakest part of the book.The irony of writing about nepotism as the son of a famous author is not lost on Bellow. This book will be a boon to nephew-hiring dynasts everywhere."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"Adam Bellow is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with nepotism. His writing is terrible, yet he got a book deal over hundreds of stuggling authors out there. Go Figure."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"Adam Bellow can't be denied the right to take his own stance on social and historical matters. Certainly not when he is so well placed in the publishing industry. If only all interested laypersons had the connections needed to get their theorizing into print.And a layperson he is. There is nothing in point of research or development of ideas that is not thoroughly amateurish. The writing quality is such as one would expect from an indifferent English major, tolerable for ten or twenty pages and no more. Why could these inchoate ruminations not be imparted to friends and family in a restaurant or barroom, if they cared to listen?I must confess that a great fondness for his late father led me to purchase this work. I suppose I deserve what I got."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the Booknotes interview of author Bellow. I mean: how can you possibly end up praising nepotism? What's he got to say about it? The historical material is fascinating in the way that Bellow can show a different side or point-of-view for some famous (and some less famous) historical figures and how nepotism played into their successes (or failures). Less convincing is the set of conclusions he makes from his research. But I still enjoyed the book pretty well. It'll make a good paperback someday."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"Bellow's book is a fascinating read; partially because the subject is infuriatingly destructive to any business and partially because Bellow managed to trade on his father's name to get it published. It doesn't mean that I respect Jaimie Wyath or Arlo Guthrie any less -they've cut their own paths successfully with skill and self-reliance.Listen: Nepotism is handing the reigns to family, buddies and cronies. Integrity is when nepotism gets avoided, which is what you may want to do here, unless you need a reason to boil over."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"I found this book in the bargain bin for $1.00. Think the little rich kid will give me my dollar back? I sure want it. To bad &quot;Daddy&quot; can't buy him talent!"},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"It has been said that some things are so common that no one ever bothers to notice it. One of these things is probably nepotism; the topic of this book. Adam Bellow, son of the famous author Saul, looks at the practice, both accepted and expected, over the centuries in multiple societies. Through it all, the author argues the point that nepotism is one of the primary forces that holds societies together; and should not be looked down upon as it commonly is. The book also shows that the US is quite exceptional in its dedication to remove nepotism from public and business life. All in all, a great book to read."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"This is an outstanding study of a highly interesting subject. Before reading this I had a sense of nepotism playing a part in the world, but now I have a far stronger sense of how real this phenomenom is even today. One only has to take a look at present day popular culture to see the scions of the famous becoming all out of proportion to the average, famous themselves. Bellow provides an excellent historical analysis of nepotism in different periods and among different kinds of population. There is a strong suggestion that nepotism is a universal of human life and culture, given the fact that parents often care more about their children than they do about anything else in the world.However one important point Bellow repeatedly makes is that ' being a close relative is not alone enough'. If one lacks the talent and ability then in time one loses the power and place.I myself take a special interest in the passing of spiritual legacies generation to generation, and dynasties of great 'minds'. One interesting point which does not particularly relate to this book. None of the great philosopher as far as I know has a child who is a great philosophers. But in the world of Jewish spiritual life, and Torah learning, there are great dynasties like for instance the Soloveitchik family. Here the heritage and the education within the family are crucial. A parallel might be made in the world of music with the Bach family, with their one overwhelming genius, their two top flight composers and their hundreds of musicians through many generations.This book should be of interest to everyone who cares about people, and about the way the world works. It is an outstanding study."},{"Title":"In Praise of Nepotism : A Natural History","review":"Bellow's &quot;Nepotism&quot; casts a new light on family preferences. Most will simply judge nepotism to be an evil of sorts, an unethical practice that injures others who are more qualified. While there is some validity to this opinion, it ignores Part I of Bellow's book and his main argument that nepotism has occurred throughout history with beneficial results. In Part II, Bellow focuses on nepotism in the USA from settlement to the country's founding and to the present day with a discussion on nepotism in the arts, business, and politics.Bellow takes a subject that often produces an automatically negative reaction and clarifies the air a bit with facts and rational arguments. While nepotism can be harmful, Bellows shows that it can (and has) produced much good for humanity for centuries."},{"Title":"Conan the Wanderer (Conan #4)","review":"The four tales in &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot; cover most of the main aspects of the career of Robert E. Howard's character: raider, thief, pirate, and mercenary. (1) &quot;Black Tears&quot; by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter is one of several pastiches written by the duo based upon hints in Howard's note and letters to fill up gaps in the saga. It takes place after the classic story &quot;A Witch Shall Be Born&quot; (in &quot;Conan the Freebooter&quot;) as Conan leads his band of Zuagirs eastward to raid the cities and caravans of the Turanians. King Yezdigerd reacts by sending out a strong force to entrap Conan. (2) Shadows in Zamboula&quot; by Robert E. Howard has Conan destitute after a week of guzzling, gorging, roistering, ... and gambling. This is an above average Conan the Thief story. (3) &quot;The Devil in Iron&quot; by Howard has Conan returning the seas as a pirate, putting together a crew from among his old friends the kozaki and the Red Fellowship of Vilayet Sea. Conan and his crew stumbled upon an inhuman creature and mayhem ensues. (4) The longest story in this collection, &quot;The Flame Knife&quot; was one of four uncompleted manuscripts by Howard completed by de Camp. This novella was originally an adventure in modern Afghanistan entitled &quot;Three-Bladed Doom&quot; staring Francis X. Gordon, Howard's brawny, brawling Irish adventurer. De Camp transformed the story into a Conan tale. After King Yezdigerd crushes the Kozak host, Conan retreats southward with a sizeable band and joins the army of Kobad Shah, king of Iranistan and one of Yezdigred's strongest rivals. These stories are rather standard fare, evidencing in part the problems de Camp and Carter had in filling all the gaps in the Conan saga. Certainly these are stories you would read out of a sense of completeness rather than because there are any real gems to be found within."},{"Title":"Advances in Written Text Analysis","review":"If you're looking for a general book about TESOL, or how to teach English then this book is probably not for you. In my opinion, this book was written for Master's and Doctoral students in one of the TESOL or lInguistics fields, who need to study or teach about how to analyze written discourse. However, with all that said, it is a fine book, but dense."},{"Title":"Advances in Written Text Analysis","review":"The book was brand spanking new just as advertized, and the shipping - although lengthy due to distances involved - was reasonable.Well pleased with order, will do business with you again."},{"Title":"A life in our times : memoirs","review":"When I borrowed this book at the library, I had never read Galbraith before, and intended to read just a few chapters. Now I am still reading his books.Galbraith is funny. You learn a lot from him, he makes you see under the surface of things. He is never boring. His writing style is exceptionally elegant. And he obviously is a very good man."},{"Title":"A life in our times : memoirs","review":"Those who seek a captivating 20C journey need look no further. One travels from the author's Canadian roots through academia (OAC, UC Berkeley, Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard), public service (farm policy, the New Deal, the wartime Office of Price Administration, the US Strategic Bombing Survey in Germany and Japan, Indian Ambassadorship), politics (FDR, Truman, Ike, JFK, LBJ, Vietnam opposition, McGovern, Nixon), and influential authorship. Each candid chapter is a pleasure.Galbraith, as always, is consistently sagacious. Like his friend George W. Ball Jr (\`The Past Has Another Pattern,' Norton 1982), he's a welcome contrast to subsequent public servants who use their experience to amass personal fortunes by promoting special interests.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Summoning the Fates: A Woman's Guide to Destiny","review":"Z Budapest's new book &quot; Summoning The Fates&quot; is a thought provoking look at each of our lives. This great story teller weaves her messages through inspirational stories as she explains the Fates and the effect they have on each of us. She explains destiny, what part it plays in our lives, and how to communicate with the Fates to find our own destiny. A hard to put down book for all who question their purpose, Z looks at age cycles, rituals, astrology always tying in her exquisite stories to teach us of the Fates and help answer our deep inner questions.As I read Z's words, a great calming came over me. I watched as my life unfolded before me in the passages of the life cycles or fate dates. &quot;On these fate dates you can see how certain issues come to the fore in your life and need to be addressed for you soul's progress. Being able to look back on the fate dates of your life will help you see the unfolding of the larger pattern of the story of your life.&quot; I compared these fate dates with my own life and saw at 30 I changed careers, at 33 I took a new lover, at 36 I started building on a dream, at 42 I found the Goddess, and at 47 I have had a soul retrieval and have made great strides in the healing of myself. I was awe struck as I came to understand why I was pulled to make many of my choices in life. &quot;To work with the Fates, you need to connect with them at the deepest level, the level that goes beyond words, the level of ritual...we have to surrender ourselves into her hands and stop hanging on to the past...there is a magic moment when everything comes into focus, and we know who we are and why we are here...she sets us to become the individuals we really are...she rules over our inner transformations and reveals their connections to the changes that take place in the outer world.&quot; This book has given me the strength to stand proud and walk my path with conviction. &quot;It is written. It is woven. It is spoken. Blessed be.&quot;The last chapter on the hist! oric cycles of time was difficult to connect to the rest of the book. This chapter is a history of time, rather then of individual cycles covered in the rest of the book. This is too large a topic for one chapter. Z should consider using this chapter as an outline for an entire book.I highly recommend this as a must read book for anyone connected with the Goddess, as well as anyone looking for answers to the simple question of &quot; why am I here?&quot;Z.

This is easily one of Z's best and most accessible, and she shares well-researched ideas that others often overlook, despite their importance. Her map of what happens in what years of your life... well, that proved amazingly accurate. Almost spooky. I wish I'd had this info fifteen years ago.This book relies heavily on Pagan and Wiccan themes, as well as astrological cycles. If you're offended by them, even slightly, this isn't the book for you.Likewise, though this information is often as true for men as it is for women, most men won't warm to Z's attitudes or writing style.However, if you're a woman who embraces diverse spiritual references and contexts, and can accept the logic (if not the science) of cyclical influences in our lives, this book is compelling. If you're approaching age 30 or 50, this is the road map."},{"Title":"Summoning the Fates: A Woman's Guide to Destiny","review":"Z's book gives women a new view on destiny and strength.

We can also begin to understand the vital role that planetary influence really has on our lives. A must read for ANYONE on a spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Summoning the Fates: A Woman's Guide to Destiny","review":"Although this book is aimed at being a guide for women, I truly believe the information and stories are accessible for everyone, no matter their sexual identity. In typical Z fashion, the Goddesses are invoked and worked tas words on the page. The Fates, no matter which culture they are experienced in, will always have a similar attitude towards mortals. Z expresses this point, almost as if the Fates are speaking THROUGH her:\\"Guess what? The Fates don't do details. Wiping things off the Earth is not their beat. They only do the big picture, turn the wheel of the ages, and facilitate our souls' choices. The Fates don't create evil. Evil is a perception from our point of view. It belongs to the small picture. To us it is overwhelming, but cosmically it is the bat of an eyelash. It is a knot, a rough thread in the Fates' hands, but they don't tangle it. Despite everything we can do to snarl up the works, they turn the wheels and keep everything moving, flowing, spinning. Surviving\\" (p.51).So when Urdh hands over the reigns to Verdandi around the age of 29-32, we return to the crossroads. Some people go back to school, others divorce or have babies, start a new career... there's a multitude of changes that occur during this tumultuous time. Everything up to this point was in preparation for what our life's work is to be and now we get to be more of who we truly are. Z offers up prayers, small rituals, and reflections that give hope and meaning to difficult periods in our lives. In helping us to understand these cosmic energies, Z is giving us the tools in an age when information empowers.As someone who has JUST passed through my first \\"Saturn Return\\" (as they call it), I can attest to the transforming energies which take over things. My life completely changed; I got married, had a baby, stayed home and went back to school for a Master's... I also gained weight, lost some friends, and moved far away from family. It was at this time Hekate came into my life as well. By accepting what was presented to me, I have opened up more potentialities and opportunities for spiritual and financial growth in BIG ways; everything with Saturn is larger than life. With Verdandi in charge, we hone our talents... blooming under the immense pressure of the crown as we become masters of our selves, or buckling under it's weight.

It is possible the author captured them accurately, of course, he could be way off. Who knows? For the most part, I felt a sense of realism. But that's just my perception. It's a matter of taste. As far as the story goes, some parts drag and some parts were very exciting. But by the end though, I realized that this is just like real life.One complaint is that Douglas neglects to explain how the white captive feels living among a people who killed her father, whose scalp she sees hanging from her captor's lance. And when her captor gives her away to his father later in the book, Jones once again neglects to explain how Chosen (the white captive) feels about this.Despite this, by the end of the book, I felt that I had been on a journey with these people. Also, it should be noted that Jones is very fair to both cultures. The atrocities were a two-way street.In closing, I highly recommend this book. I believe the follow up to this book is called Gone the Dreams and Dancing. I look forward to reading this book, too."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"I knew for a long time that Douglas C. Jones was a well-liked author, as I worked in a public library and I shelved books for a living. One day, though, \\"Season of Yellow Leaf\\" happened to get into my hands, probably by someone else checking it out. I read the flyleaf and held onto it.\\"Yellow Leaf\\" is the fictionalized story of a young girl in a remote Texas settlement who is captured by the Comanche tribespeople, adopted and named \\"Chosen.\\" When \\"returned\\" to white culture as a married mother, she pines for the family she has been torn away from.Loosely based on the story of Cynthia Ann Parker, it is a well-written story of the trials of the culture clash that has been going on for 500 years on this continent. The story is only repeated and repeated, families torn apart, then torn apart again.Like so many tales involving native people, there is a \\"golden\\" time to Chosen's life, as there seems to have been to the lives of the tribes as well, that is to say, just before white culture influenced every circumstance.I never read another book by this author, but I cherish this book for Chosen's viewpoint, albeit fictionalized.I also do not know if this represents the Comanche viewpoint well, or is total supposition, but it's a very good read."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"It would be hard to discuss one of Douglas C. Jones' books without mentioning the others. I have read all of his novels and found them to be well-researched, historically relevant and entertaining. Season of Yellow Leaf is one of my favorites, but Jones is at his best when writing about historical life in his native Arkansas (Weedy Rough, Winding Stair, others). I would recommend his books to anyone. He really knows how to bring history to life."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"In the two existing reviews the date is off by 100 years.

Mr. Stormer conclusively shows how our long-cherished American Principles have been subverted by Communistic methodology which utilizes the press, court rulings, the labor movements, the education system, tax-exempt foundation grants, government influence, and (believe it or not) even religious publications to exert pressure from above and below in order to reconfigure our framework and adapt existing structures to accomodate Socialistic goals.The person who tells you that this is all just paranoid delusion and innuendo unsupported by any verifiable documentation is DELIBERATELY misleading you! 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER' is one of the most thoroughly researched books I have ever encountered during my lifelong reading addiction! The exhaustive reference section spans a full 25 pages of minuscule print that cites countless books, textbooks, articles, Congressional records, administrative reports, official bulletins, treaty protocols, sworn testimony from government hearings, and most significantly, myriad Communist publications and reviews. It's not that there is just a \\"mountain of evidence\\" to support every one of Stormer's charges - that mountain is the size of Everest!Let me assure you that the scenario presented in this magnificent masterpiece of research is as relevant to us today as the day it was first published - this despite the \\"appearance\\" of Communism's collapse in the Soviet Union. (You should know that this democratic \\"false front\\" and even the demolition of the Berlin Wall was foretold as far back as 1982 by the top-level KGB defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn in his book, 'NEW LIES FOR OLD.' This book is still in print and so you can verify for yourself his accuracy in revealing the Communist ploy years in advance.)Why has the United States government made a pretense of fighting Communism all the while giving aid to Socialist States; securing their infrastructure and feeding their people at American tax-payer expense? As Stormer so accurately points out on page 66: \\"EVERY COMMUNIST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD LITERALLY HAS A 'MADE IN THE USA' STAMP.\\"Think about this: Isn't just the idea that the world's great superpower could not manage to emerge victorious from the \\"police actions\\" in Korea and Vietnam simply ridiculous on its face? \\"Winning\\" was never the objective of our \\"leaders\\", and Stormer proves this beyond all doubt! Reading this book for the first time years ago and thinking about all of our service men killed overseas and their families torn apart and scarred forever, there were many times that I slammed it down in rage - really not sure that I could bear to read on. Although it's a moot point for me, if I had a son who was contemplating enlisting in the armed forces (or facing conscription), I would consider it my obligation as a responsible parent, to insist that he read John Stormer's book before making any decision. What I would give to have been able to get this book into the hands of Pat Tillman before he sacrificed his NFL career and then his life in Afghanistan! God bless and keep that noble man.You can be sure that there are many individuals out there who DO NOT want you to read 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER.' They are hoping that the American People will continue to sit lobotomized before the boob tube and let sleeping dogs lie. Except these dogs aren't really asleep; It is we who snooze while they plot our demise! If a self-professed Communist was to frantically insist that \\"Nobody should read this book!....Do not buy this book!\\" then that is all the confirmation that you should need in order to ascertain that, in fact, EVERYBODY should read this book, and that YOU should buy this book. I urge you to do that NOW!To summarize: NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER is the heartbreaking and nauseating truth about our government's love affair with Communism. For those who lost loved ones in the Korean or Vietnam \\"police actions\\" this book will be particularly disturbing. Without a trace of hyperbole I tell you that Five Stars does not come remotely close to doing justice to the merits of this great work. It is of nearly singular distinction and unquestionably one of the most important books I have ever read. 'NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON: 25 YEARS LATER' would still be standing if I was forced to clear my bookshelves of every political tome save three. A highlighted and well-worn copy of it should be found in the personal library of virtually EVERY true American patriot....right alongside G. Edward Griffin's, 'THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND.' People, we had better wake up pretty darn quick otherwise the MOURNING will soon be upon us!"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason - 25 Years Later","review":"None Dare Call It Treason--25 Years Later is an update of John Stormer's 1964 bestselling book, None Dare Call It Treason. Stormer's book was a bestselling book in 1964 because many individuals and organizations bought boxes of his book and distributed them at no cost. By 1964, Americans were aware that Fidel Castro imposed communist rule in Cuba with the help of the dishonest American media (especially, the New York Times) and treasonous American political leaders. President John Kennedy's blunders included calling Castro the Simon Bolivar of Cuba, guarantees of communist rule in Cuba to end the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the betrayal of Cubans who returned to Cuba for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Details of the assassination of President Kennedy included possible links to Cuba and to the Soviet Union. Another 1964 book detailed the unsavory past of President Lyndon Johnson: A Texan Looks at Lyndon by J. Evetts Haley. Senator Barry Goldwater, 1964 Republican presidential candidate, an anti-communist, and author of The Conscience of a Conservative, posed a threat to those in the American media and even in the Republican Party who were not anti-communist.Stormer's update is important reading today, especially for Americans duped by the neo-conservatives (neo-Trotskyites) into believing that communism died with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stormer has documented how communism remains strong in many countries, including in supposedly former communist countries with the same political leaders in power.Unfortunately, Stormer's updates are lacking, incomplete, or wrong on many issues. For example:1. The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) is no longer an anti-communist organization (page 311). When Castro was waging his communist revolution, the DAR was one of the few honest organizations in America exposing Castro as a communist. On April 14, 2005, a new generation of DAR leaders permitted supporters of the Iranian Communist MEK (MKO, PMOI, NCRI, Rajavi Cult, Pol Pot of Iran) to hold an annual convention in its convention hall in Washington, DC. Does John Stormer dare to call this treason?2. The John Birch Society (JBS) is no longer primarily an anti-communist organization. Named for an American who was murdered by communists in China, JBS exposed truthfully Castro's communist revolution. While the American Opinion Book Service lists some anti-communist books, the recent focus of articles in The New American magazine has been upon the threats to the loss of American sovereignty, such as: United Nations, North American Union, and NAFTA. JBS authors view as a more immediate threat the loss of the American Constitution and dollar to a new constitution with the union of Mexico, Canada, and America and with a new currency, the Amero. While Stormer was critical of the political activities of the Rockefeller brothers, he needs to address in future updates posted claims by Eustace Mullins and others that Nelson Rockefeller provided the initial funding for the John Birch Society. Did Nelson Rockefeller hope that the loss in the presidential election of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964 would pave the way for a Nelson Rockefeller victory in 1968?3. While Human Events claims to be a conservative magazine and Web site and quotes former President Ronald Reagan as saying that it is essential reading, Human Events has become a neo-conservative (neo-Trotskyite) magazine and Web site. On July 11, 2007, Human Events posted \\"Unleashing the Iranian Opposition\\" by Daniel Pipes. Pipes has been supporting the Iranian Communist MEK for years. His latest article was about his recent trip to France to attend a major rally of the Rajavi Cult. Also attending was Congressman Bob Filner (Democrat--California and son of a communist party candidate for Congress). The MEK murdered American military officers, Rockwell International employees, and large numbers of Iranians, and of Iraqis. On July 13, 2003, the New York Times Magazine published \\"The Cult of Rajavi\\" by Elizabeth Rubin. Even the New York Times, with its long history of promoting communists, reported correctly that the MEK is a cult whose leader many Iranians call the \\"Pol Pot of Iran\\".4. Stormer's explanation of the misuse of tax-exempt foundations (Chapter 11) needs to be updated. Neo-conservative supporters of communist terrorists and of Trotsky's dreams of endless wars rely upon tax-exempt foundations to move money with little or no disclosures. While 501 (c) (3) public charities must make Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 disclosures, a review of such disclosures at GuideStar's Web site will reveal that many of the political charities supporting America's terrorist enemies are not making disclosures. See, for example: Iran Policy Committee. While the American government closed the Holy Land Foundation for giving contributions to Hamas, the American government has not closed public charities promoting another organization on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations: Iranian Communist MEK.5. Stormer documented many of the activities of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). An important update is that the CPUSA has not had any candidates for President in recent elections. While the CPUSA denies claims that it is satisfied with recent Democratic Party candidates for President, its claims appear weak that running a candidate for President is a poor use of its scarce resources.6. Stormer's update did not include an explanation of how the admirers of Trotsky were able to move to the Democratic and Republican parties using the neoconservative label.While Stormer or others need to write more books about American treason since 1964, most Americans would benefit greatly from reading Stormer's book."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason - 25 Years Later","review":"This book, especially the revised introduction, should be an ephiphany to anyone who has attended college since 1960. However, I fear few will read it.....but it will resound amongst those who a troubled about the America we've seen develop since the \\"beat\\" generation.HOW could Alger Hiss, a reknowned Communist, have participated in decision-making at Yalta that would enslave hundreds of millions under Communism? Did you know that Josef Stalin once studied for the Orthodox priesthood? Or that Hollywood-beloved Fidel Castro is not a product of the working class, but the University of Havana? Or that Karl Marx' Das Kapital is a conglomeration of once-rejected theories of dialectics and conflict, hardly original, and read by few who have committed mass atrocities in his name? Why were the Germans so afraid of Communism, even the Fascists? Could it be, that in such close proximity, they knew the foe better than we ever would?Did you know that Gorbachev's new \\"perestroika\\" and \\"glasnost\\" were terms used in the early 20th century to soften the image of communism THEN, by Lenin and others, to encourage foreign investment and charity.The core of this book, written in the 1970s, rings true today. How could avowed Communists infiltrate our highest levels of governments? Why are they (in America especially) rarely OF the people, but from the upper classes?This is an astounding book, which should cause you to reevaluate terms used constantly, such as Capitalism, Communism, Democracy.

These same questions remain today, and are of a far more serious nature.He knows that the American problem and solution is not political, or economic -- it is moral and spiritual. Rev.

Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist. The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument.the sad thing is, because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched, it is far too dry to be amusing, even when read ironically. and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda.in closing, i would take Communism over John A.

What he learns in the diary puts him on the trail of the camp's commanding officer, Eduard Roschmann. Roschmann managed to disappear after the war with the help of his fellow officers in the SS, now known as the Odessa. As the story unfolds we learn that Roschmann is currently the linchpin in a plan to destroy the still young and fragile state of Israel. While Miller's dogged pursuit of the man began as a personal mission but the fate of a country hinges on his success.The Odessa File is Frederick Forsyth's second novel and continues the pattern began inThe Day of the Jackalas it integrates highly detailed research with fiction to create the feeling one is reading a historical account rather than a novel. The pace is deliberate but steady and the tension builds continuously. As with virtually every other spy novel, the book is clearly story driven first and foremost and those longing for a deep character study should look elsewhere. But the characters are not two-dimensional and serve more than adequately to hold the reader's interest.The only complaint I have regarding The Odessa File is a plot development in the final act. Miller has methodically pursued his quarry in a careful way and after training for weeks to go undercover as a baker to infiltrate the Odessa, he suddenly throws all caution and common sense to the winds and starts driving around in his Jaguar even as he's pretending to be a poor common man. This was so unbelievable that I could only imagine Forsyth wrote it in to push the plot to the crisis point and bring the story to a close. It is the one sour note in the whole novel and while it tarnished the climax of the book, it did not ruin it.In summary, The Odessa File is a compelling read virtually every step of the way. While I found one major plot twist to be a ham fisted mistake, that doesn't negate the rest of the novel which is top notch."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"In this great book, Forsyth packs a punch on several levels. This book is one my favorites, one which I have read over the years again and again. Why?1. Intricate plotting - the plot interweaves with events in the past and the present in a fine tapestry.2. Intriguing \\"What If\\" - the Odessa network was proven to exist with the insidious characters like Eichmann, Priebke, Mengele and others who were smuggled to Argentina and South America.3. Wiesenthal Type Character - the Taubman character is intricately weaved into the story to remind us of the crimes of the SS. That time should know no bounds as to capturing and punshing these animals.Michael Mandaville, Author \\"Stealing Thunder\\""},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I hadn't read any Forsyth books but had three waiting to be read (this one,The Day of the JackalandIcon) and decided to read this one first. Wow. Written in 1972, set in 1963-64, \\"The Odessa File\\" is a perfect mix of fact and fiction. Young West German journalist Peter Miller finds the diary of a jewish holocaust survivor who committed suicide, and decides to track down Eduard Roschmann, the SS man in charge of the Riga ghetto. Roschmann, meanwhile is heading a project to build nuclear and bacteriological weapons for Egypt. The novel depicts a post war West Germany were former nazis are still very much present, even in the police force that's supposed to find war criminals. Miller's search for Roschmann is not met with much enthusiasm, but he gets help from among others Simon Wiesenthal, while the Odessa network of former SS men tries to kill him.\\"The Odessa File\\" is a pageturner, but also a book that makes you wonder what's fiction and what's reality, and makes you want to learn more about the post-war activities of the nazis."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The depths of pain inflicted on others have been described more graphically elsewhere.I was intrigued by the depth of focus and energy by a single individual: An individual who will risk everything searching and using his wits to find the truth.Not a pleasant read, but a worth the time."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"This was my favorite book as a young teenager, and it inspired me to want to be a writer.

This author always seams to deliver a well thought out plot with a good amount of detail and short side stories that entertain and keep the story going. The book is much better then the movie and I would suggest you read the book weather you have or have not watched it. This book can really be called a suspense thriller and keeps your attention all the way to the end i.e. plot twist. I actually think this is one of his better books. I also read a good amount of World War 2 nonfiction and the facts presented in the book are dead on.

Ppl don't read anymore, it's too hard (that's what she said)."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Frederick Forsyth is a brilliant writer with an uncanny ability to build a plot while weaving in well-researched facts of the world of politics, power and culture cogently into developed fictional characters. Prior to writing novels, Forsyth was a journalist and it shows; I assume he was very talented in this field as, like inThe Day of the Jackal, he gives sharp, lucid descriptions of various fields laypeople are most likely ignorant of. In \\"The Odessa File,\\" Forsyth crafts a masterful thriller. The novel center around Peter Miller, a German journalist who receives an interesting book from a friend and contact in the local police department. This book is actually a journal belonging to a Jewish Holocaust survivor named Salomon Tauber, who recently committed suicide. Miller becomes fascinated with Tauber's account of the Riga Ghetto, which was led by the cruel and monstrous Eduard Roschmann. Everyone in Miller's circle dismisses this story, including his editor, but he continues to pursue it including seeking advice from famous war crime investigator Simon Wiesenthal. His investigation to find the wanted Roschmann leads him to discover a secret society known as O.D.E.S.S.A (\\"Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angeh&ouml;rigen,\\" which translates to Organization of Former Members of the SS). An escalating series of events and threats pushes Miller into danger but he has an unwavering determination to find the whereabouts of Roschmann and the secrets of Odessa.Forsyth has an impeccable ability to bait a reader's interest, create suspense and force you to turn the page while not playing cheap dramatic tactics or creating bloated exposition. This mystery is exciting and Forsyth brings readers into the dark world of criminal networks and hired killers. Peter Miller is an intriguing protagonist with an ability to genuinely surprise readers when we discover his actions, decisions and motivations. Forsyth's own career in journalism, again, gives him insight on the mind of a reporter, unsurprisingly. The details of so many technical aspects, such as forgery, are told in clever, accessible and, most importantly, non-distracting fashions. Take note, Tom Clancy. If you enjoying reading history, you will appreciate these efforts by Forsyth; his meticulous attention to detail pay off for curious readers and, ultimately, the conclusion of the story. This novel is more prosaic than Forsyth's previous novelThe Day Of The Jackalbut it still has a great deal of cleverness and memorable characters. This is not a novel to be missed."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"This Forsyth novel is set in Germany in 1963, right after the assassination of President Kennedy. It follows the story of Peter Miller, a German newspaper reporter attempting to discover the whereabouts of a former SS concentration-camp commander that is of particular interest to his personal history. There is lots of intrigue and suspense along the way, one main Nlotline involves the Nazi association \\"ODESSA\\" and its attempts to find safe haven for ex-SS members in the aftermath of WWII. Forsyth even manages to work in the Mossad and the real life Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Supposedly the movie version resulted in the arrest of the true \\"Butcher of Riga,\\" Eduard Roschmann, by the Argentinian police. According to reports he then skipped bail and died in 1977 in Paraguay.

The plot degenerated into a cheap thriller. Such a cleverly researched book should never have been coupled with such a poorly written plot.The horrors of The Riga Ghetto recently made news because of an investigation by The Latvian Holocaust Commission.

In the diary he tells his story of the atrocities made by the SS Nazi commandant. Intrigued, after an investigation the reporter discovers the Nazi is still alive.......the man-hunt begins. Later we will find there are deeper reasons for his relentless pursuit of this mass killer.Forsyth will keep you riveted with the characters he creates, especially the reporter as he transforms himself into a former SS sergeant in order to infiltrate the Odessa (the Odessa is a web of Nazis created to protect their own). That is, until the author begins speeding things up to where it leaves you feeling empty or wondering why he did that; it is if he just wanted the story to end.

He infiltrates the Odessa organization (which was the post-war Nazi escape and support network) to learn the truth.The \\"hidden message\\" - even though its not so hidden - is to tell the world about how many of these horrible Nazis went unpunished and how thusly, the war isn't quite over at least as far as the war against Fascism/Naziism is concerned...This is very readable book. There is a minor love interest, but fortunately it does not take over the plot. The book was written at a time when the world was ready to \\"re-examine\\" WW2, unlike the late 40s and 50s when everyone wanted to rebuild our world and forget the horrible immediate past....I'd credit the book with helping start a renewed popular interest in prosecuting old Nazis who walked away from their crimes.Its not a happy book due to the subject, but in the end the Hero does win and the villain (Roschmann) is vanquished. The film is fairly true to the book's details, too.I highly recommend it...."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Forsyth has written a believable thriller. The book move along with very little padding. The characters are interesting. The interrogation of Miller by the Odessa Chief could have been improved. The questions asked by the interrogator to see if Miller was really a former SS soldier (instead of someone else) appeared to correlate very highly with the training he received. Other than this the book is suspenseful and is hard to put down. Excellent read at 1 AM on a Saturday or Sunday morning."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I bought this novel after reading Uki Goni's THE REAL ODESSA, which is a book you MUST purchase. One of the characteristics of this book is that the setting constantly evolves. Not only includes the perspective of Miller, but it also includes the perspective of foreign secret agents that are also working on the case of the Nazi underground business. As you read the novel, you'll be able to figure out the evolution of the events.. However, Miller's decision to chase Roschmann will eventually surprise you.. A book that's worth reading, and for the price that's sold... Buy it, because it'll keep you on your feet...

His writing is extremely realistic and devoid of the goofy intelligence/military community hero-worship that Clancy dumps on his readers. I've probably read The Odessa File half a dozen times.

Keep writing Mr. Forsyth!"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"This book has a little bit of everything. A secret order that was established to protect former members of the SS as well as a plot to destroy the Israeli with one of the hunted SS members being a key player.

One of the better books that I have read in some time. A must read."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"A very well written book. A lot of the characters and the text are very close to being historically accurate. The young German journalist who comes into possesion of the dairy is an interesting character. The network of the Odessa, stretching from Argentia to Germany sounds accurate because of some of the discoveries found after the war years. The Werewolf as well as the hired executioner were the ultimate villains. The way that Forysthe brought about a plot of devastaion against Israel made the story more readable. All in all an outstanding book."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Even the start of the novel is gripping, and it is fraught with coincidences. If John F. Kennedy hadn't been shot, Peter Miller would not have pulled over to listen to the radio announcement. He would have missed the ambulance that he eventually followed. As an investigative journalist he thought he might be following a story. The ambulance's destination was the suicide of an old Holocaust survivor. \\"No story here,\\" the detective advises him. Shortly thereafter the detective calls to tell him that the old man left behind a diary that describes the unspeakable cruelty he experienced in a concentration camp. Miller reads the story into the night. His attention is turned to one incident he reads over and over again. The diary ends with the old man's plea that someone please say Kaddish, the Jewish Prayer for the dead, for the sake of his soul. The coincidences build from here. The next day Miller decides to hunt a Nazi camp commandant, but not for the reasons we suspect. The story takes Peter Miller through other parts of Germany and Austria where he is being chased by the people he is pursuing. The journalist eventually finds and confronts the Nazi. The ultimate coincidence is revealed. His personal mission has far-reaching consequences.In the end we learn about the fate of the characters, some fateful and some ordinary. This was the most stirring part for me. A young Israeli paratrooper enters the Hall of Remembrance in Jerusalem. His red beret satisfies the requirement of a yarmulka, and he fulfills the request of the old man whose soul died years earlier in a concentration camp near Riga.With Forsythe's ability to mix fact with fiction, 1964 was a year in which a number of Nazis were found and brought to justice. Stirring.This novel is lesenvergnuegen.Alles Gute!ECP"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"After reading &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, I thought that there couldn't be a better suspense thriller than this, but I still hadn't read &quot;The Odessa File&quot;. Its set in the early 1960's, where a young freelance German journalist comes across the personal diary of an old German Jew who's committed suicide. Reading the diary through the night, the journalist, Peter Miller finds out that the Jew was a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camp at Riga, Latvia during World War II. As he reads on, he's shocked by the graphic description by the Jew of the atrocities committed on the camp inmates by the camp commandant, Eduard Roschmann. Millers vows to track down Roschmann and bring him to justice. But while doing so, he comes across a super-secret organization known as Odessa, which protects Nazi ex-SS members from being captured and brought to justice. When Miller starts getting too close to the Odessa, his life is in grave danger. But he decides that it will end with him bringing Roschmann to justice for his crimes, or with his death.&quot;The Odessa File&quot;, as with all other Forsyth books, has a super-shocking twist in the end, where we get to know the real motive behind Miller wanting to find Roschmann. In the process, Forsyth manages to include The Beatles' short stint in Hamburg, the background of the brief Arab-Israeli war and last but not the least, Kennedy's assasination. As usual, Forsyth's factual knowledge is accurate to the point, and his research is deep and minute. &quot;The Odessa File&quot; is undoubtedly Frederick Forsyth at his very best."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"THE ODESSA FILE is one of Frederick Forsyth's classics. Cleverly written, meticulously researched, and absolutely readable, THE ODESSA FILE recounts the story of Peter Miller, a young German crime reporter who decides to infiltrate the secret Nazi support network in the early 1960s in order to discover the whereabouts of Captain Eduard Roschmann, \\"The Butcher of Riga,\\" who sent some 80,000 people to their deaths in the Riga Ghetto.While Miller's outrage at the twisting of Germany by the Nazis is real and intense, his motivations are unclear...until the O. Henry ending.This is fine historical fiction, melding historical figures (like Roschmann)and fictional characters (like Miller) together seamlessly.THE ODESSA FILE is an intense thriller, and rates as one of the finest and most memorable works of its genre anytime and anywhere."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Master thriller writer Forsyth delivers big-time in this story of an intrepid freelance journalist tracking down an ex-Nazi in postwar Germany. Grounded heavily in research and reality, the story is based upon the disappearance of hundreds of wanted SS war criminals. As plenty of historians have since documented, there were organized efforts to help wanted Nazis disappear, especially to South America (see, for example, Uki Goni's book The Real Odessa). Here, Forsyth imagines the Odessa, a well-funded organization of former SS men who are taking the reins of German industry as it rebuilds, and helping Egypt with rocket technology with which to destroy Israel.One day freelance German photojournalist Peter Miller comes into possession of the diary of an old concentration camp survivor who has recently committed suicide. The diary details the man's physical and mental torture in Riga, and claims that the camp commandant is still alive and living in Germany. Miller is simultaneously appalled at the atrocities described and eager for a big scoop, and so sets out to track down SS Captain Roschman (the real life \\"Butcher of Riga\\"). He quickly discovers to his surprise that the newsmagazines aren't interested in the story, it's explained to him that no one wants to pay to read about horrors perpetrated on Jews in some other country.Miller decides to proceed on his own, and the book turns into a kind of procedural thriller as he doggedly pursues sources of information across Germany and it starts to dawn on him that no one is particularly interested in hunting down ex-Nazis. The combination of former Nazi influence in the police, along with the the realpolitik of the situation (live ex-Nazis vote, dead Jews do not), mean that the official channels are largely window dressing. Turning to other sources, like Simon Wiesenthal, Miller eventually finds himself in the company of a vigilante group of Jews dedicated to eliminating ex-Nazis. They, and their Mossad masters, want him to infiltrate Odessa by posing as an former SS man. What he doesn't know is that Odessa is on to him, and has assigned their \\"cleaner\\" to take care of him.The final part of the book is stuffed with high tension as Miller gets possession of a blockbuster piece of intelligence about the Odessa, and closer and closer to Roschman. Meanwhile, the SS killer gets closer and closer to Miller... It all culminates in a nail-biting finale with one of the best twists at the end I've ever come across. The core story is top-level thriller stuff, absolutely outstanding. I could have done without Miller's girlfriend character, who seemed to exist mainly as a bit of T&A; and an attempt to give Miller a little dimension. I also could have done without the subplot involving the rockets for Egypt, as it distracted from the more interesting story of Miller's hunt. Still, these are minor quibbles about an outstanding book."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"In the 1960's German Journalist Peter Miller stumbles upon the diary of a German Jew who had been shipped to a concentration camp in Riga, Latvia during World War Two. Reading the diary Miller is enraged at the abuses of the sadistic camp commandant and vows to find him and bring him to justice. What Miller finds instead is the organisation known as Odessa, a super-secret society made up of former members of the SS to protect their own. As Miller gets closer and closer to the truth, his life is put in jeoperady. Finally, with the aide of Jewish Nazi-hunters, he begins a plan that will end either with the Riga commandant at the end of a rope, or his own grisly death. Thrilling from the first page, 'The Odessa File' contains the same heart-pounding suspense that filled Forsyth's earlier work, 'The Day of the Jackel,' and has one of the greatest twist endings in modern fiction. For anyone who enjoys thrilling fiction mixed with historical fact, 'The Odessa File' will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The first two chapters of \\"The Odessa File\\" are as brilliant as spy fiction has ever gotten; after that, it's just very, very good.The opening chapter sets into motion a world of underground Nazis and underworld reporters against the compelling backdrop of the assassination of President Kennedy; Forsyth even finds a way of getting the Beatles involved.The second chapter, a recounting of the diary of a former concentration camp inmate, offers some of the most stunning testimony of man's inhumanity to man. Yet the dead man, Salomon Tauber, still can write: \\"With the passing of the years I have learned again to love; to love the rocks and trees, the sky above and the river flowing past the city, the stray dogs and cats, the weeds growing between the cobblestones, and the children who run away from me in the street because I am so ugly.\\"From there, the novel may slide a bit, but how can it be otherwise? A reporter who reads the journal, Peter Miller, takes it upon himself to find the man behind Tauber's tortures, former SS officer Eduard Roschmann A.K.A. \\"The Butcher of Riga,\\" and bring him to justice. Yes, people are right when they say \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" worked better as a story from front-to-back. Maybe the book could have done more with Miller's plan to infiltrate the Nazi underworld, the \\"ODESSA\\" of the novel's title, an idea developed more in the 1974 film adaptation starring Jon Voight. There are a couple of contrivances, not as egregious as are found in some other Forsyth books I can mention, but they are there.It's still a brilliant story, delivered with a minimum of sentiment and a feeling of lived-in journalistic accuracy. Most of all, it's exciting from chapter-to-chapter, a brisk gallop of a narrative. The final confrontation between Miller and Roschmann is justly famous and well-known; I suspect George Lucas was taking notes.I've read the book three times now since 1981, and while it's a little less than I remember, it's still tops in its genre in so many ways. People who think spy fiction is all about James Bond and Tom Clancy owe it to themselves to read \\"Odessa File;\\" they will be edified, or at the very least, highly entertained."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I picked this up to read again, after having read it almost twenty years ago. It did not disappoint! This is how all &quot;what-if&quot; thrillers should be written. Once you pick this story up it grabs you and won't let go until the end. Forsyth does a great job of detailing the Odessa organization, how it was formed, and the fear it engendered in Germany almost twenty years after the war. The plot is very exciting, but best of all believable. Refreshingly, the hero is not a one dimensional character. Peter Miller is a complex figure who has his own reason for pursuing Eduard Roschmann. If you've never read this book, pick it up! If you've read it before, consider picking it up again. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The Odessa FileFrom the moment the diary of a broken and desolate concentration camp survivor lands up in the hands of reporter Peter Miller, the reader is pulled along into a world of crazed Nazi revanchists, wily and vengeful Mossad infiltrators, obstructionist German bureaucrats, and a pathetic, browbeaten printer who's just a little too clever for his own good. Miller is warned off, shoved around, ambushed, and almost blown up, but he manages eventually (with a little help from Simon Wiesenthal) to find his way into the heart of the shadowy organization known as the ODESSA.THE ODESSA FILE plays off in Germany during the 60's and examines the persistent rumors and tempting evidence that points to the existence of a secretive organization that masterminded the escape of Nazi war criminals and perpetuated Nazi ideals the world over. The story revolves around a cache of documents known as The Odessa File that protected the identities of former members of Hitler's dreaded SS since shortly before the end of World War II. The book is of course a piece of fiction, but many of the characters aren't fictitious at all. SS Captain Eduard Roschmann, for instance, really was the Butcher of Riga, and he really did sneak past the mob of tribunals and other judiciary apparatuses that sprung up after the war (at least as far as anyone knows). Peter Miller, is the reporter who hunts him down, we may assume him to be completely fictious, but as for everyone in between - who knows?Therein lies much of the novel's suspense. What really happened to the German-designed rockets that Nasser was supposed to have ready in time for the Six Day War? How did the SS acquire new identities for its members so quickly after the war's end and where did it get the money needed to do so? Could the head of the company that made your coffee machine be a former officer of the SS and a wanted war criminal? Frederick Forsyth has truly mastered the art of intertwining reality with fiction and vice versa and his ability to do so is what gives this book it's thrilling atmosphere.THE ODESSA FILE is the novel that established Forsyth as the heavyweight champion of his genre, political espionage. The story's characters are vividly imagined (if they are imagined at all), and in the 27 years since its first publication, they've lost none of their energy. The book is compact, credible, as politically sophisticated as his first novel, The Day of the Jackal, skillfully researched and much more neatly written. Assuming peace doesn't unexpectedly arrive in the Middle East, The Odessa File will still be delivering knockout punches long after the average thriller has called off the fight."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"This novel makes me wish I had discovered Forsyth sooner (this is the first Forsyth I have read). He writes with a crisp, concise style that combined with his considerable skill in pacing and character development makes this book a first-rate thriller. Add to that the historical insight that emerges throughout this book and the result is a truly fine novel. Occasionally the narrative slows down when Forsyth expends too much description on the protagonist's cross-country drives, but even those interruptions fail to break the suspense that mounts throughout this story. This is one of the best thrillers I have read - I give it an A."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"As we follow the exploits of a most determined reporter, The Odessa File becomes an espionage novel that quite successfully delivers a thrilling adventure amidst a Cold War European backdrop. While much of the novel is written in a tone typical of genre literature, it does contain a few interesting plot twists and an excellently descriptive portrayal of the primary antagonist during his years as and SS officer. Not a landmark piece of fiction, containing a few implausible discrepancies hidden within the plot, it does certainly entertain. For those who are fascinated by the Third Reich and the subversive exploits of the myriad of second-rate war criminals who escaped prosecution after World War II, this will be a quite enjoyable read and a fun insight into some real-world personalities."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Good Stuff, not as good as The Day of the Jackal, yet one of the greatest novels i have ever read."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Forsyth comes up with a passionate story of post WWII Nazi criminals and one man's fight to find justice.A good read."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Libro que trata sobre una organizaci&oacute;n nazi que se supone aun colea hasta nuestros dias, y que con el dinero obtenido en la Segunda Guerra Mundial provocan actos de terrorismo a escala intercacional.Sea verdad o mentira, es una historia que muy muy entretenida, engancha, y adem&aacute;s aprendes historia.puntuacion=8"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"A true page-turner!A young West-German journalist, Peter Miller, chances upon policemen investigating a suicide.

Five stars all the way."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The second book by Forsyth still is one of his best. It's better written than &quot;DAY OF THE JACKAL&quot;, for sure. The main character Peter Miller is very credible. The funny thing is that, with passing years, almos all Forsyth's characters seemed like robots withou personality or feelings.

He tried with &quot;The Odessa File&quot;. It started off really well. Like his first novel, the action is on throughout almost all the novel, taking you into unexpected directions and at unexpected times. Neat plot twists here and there make this a factual, riveting and quick read. Yet, not on the same rank as The Day of the Jackal, which I think is his best effort yet (from the books I have read)"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"A great read... the 300+ pages went by in no time flat. I don't read too many novels, but this one was a great read.

Odessa is a secret organization dedicated to furthering the interests of the Nazi regime in the post-World War II era, and the book is about one German's encounters with that group. Both how that German becomes drawn into pursuing Odessa and the revelation of his motivation for doing so make this book an excellent thriller. It is not quite on par with The Day of the Jackal, but it does come awfully close."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I have just completed Frederick Forsyth's 'The Odessa File' and I never thought that I would say this but in my opinion it eclipses 'The Day of the jackal'. Forsyth takes you back to pivital times in World history from the death camps of Riga to the shooting of Kennedy and touches the background to the 6 day Israeli/Arabic war. He even manages to include the Beatles legandry stint in Hamburg. Forsyth manages to weave a magical thread through all these pieces of history to keep the reader totally engrossed. I have never felt compelled to write a review but I really wish to share my feelings on reading this most brilliant of Forsyth's novels.Mr Forsyth, I cannot wait for your next published work."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"One of first and best offerings in the Fourth Reich genre. If you like that kind of stuff you'll like this. This is at the same level as &quot;Boys from Brazil&quot;. Plus there's a really cool movie of it starring Jon Voight."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I fished out my ancient copy of Frederick Forsyth's THE ODESSA FILE because I wanted to read about a time when evil was simpler and villians were much easier to comprehend. THE ODESSA FILE is one of the most clever books I read as a young person, and it holds up well. The bad guys are Nazi sympathizers, and the hero seems to be a crusader for world justice. Forsyth spins quite a tale here. His characters seem real. He captures the essence of his setting perfectly. I still love his final plot twist. As I crime fiction author, I especially admire the hidden plot that exists just beneath the surface story that reader thinks she is absorbed within. THE ODESSA FILE is a terrific book, even today."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The Odessa File was my introduction to history-based thrillers many years ago. I went back to read it again and was equally impressed. Frederick Forsyth introduces a character, Peter Miller, who leads the reader through the maze of past and present. The death of an elderly man kicks off the story, leaving clues that Miller follows all the way to the end. The Nazis are the bad guys, this time a network established at the end of WWII to help leaders escape post-war Germany to new locations. Forsyth weaves people real and fictional into this story, blurring the lines between imagination and reality in a story that keeps the reader moving. If you like your thrillers well plotted and entirely believable, start with the Odessa file."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I found \`The Odessa file' very engrossing and interesting to read. By reading Fredrick books, one always get to know much about spies, gangsters, assassins, mercenaries, diplomats, inside work of businessman, politicians, secret agencies and many other interesting facts that will always amaze the reader. And this book is not an exception. In fact, I found Odessa file more informative compared to his other work I have read. It is mainly because it introduces reader to the horrific history behind SS. \`SS' was a major organization under Adolf Hitler and Nazi party and it was primarily responsible for many of the crimes against humanity during World War II.I should say, Mr Fredrick has played a brilliant part in establishing a neat story that blended with the history skilfully.

After reading The Day of the Jackal and now The Odessa File, I'm officially a fan. Seeing as how you can get plot summaries here, I'll skip that part. What I will say is that this book had me hooked from the beginning and I hated to have to put it down. If it weren't for work and sleep, this book would've been a two-day affair, if that.

As a teenager, I usually dislike books, but this one was different and it amazed me how different."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"What makes &quot;The Odess File&quot; a great novel is the elements that are not present therein. Having read many novels of this kind, I find them all very similar and somewat overdone. These are the elements that you do not find in &quot;The Odessa File&quot;: 1.No macho American hero rescuing his brat tomboy daughter. 2.No macho Army &quot;talk&quot; (hell this...damn that...) 3.No nosy German-American yuppy peddling with other's nations affairs. 4.No old fashion Southern politician critizing openly and cynically current government. 5.No lesbians 6.No excess of violence and/or casualties. This novel is a break from all these elements and it really stands out form the rest. Forsyth tells a very engaging story and relies only in pure literature. The story itself is short and concise. No endless details or unseemly long character developement. The story is not &quot;an onion&quot; and therefore easy to read and very exciting without having to include anything lame. This novel is an example of good fiction literature!"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I loved this book and it kept me on the edge of my seat during the whole book.

This is my first Frederick Forsyth novel. For years, my father had had almost all his books in his private collection, but I never thought of touching them, thinking to myself, \\"Just another pulp writer...\\" Oh, was I wrong!Forsyth delved extensively into the Nazi mythos and came up with a brilliant thriller that could almost pass off as non-fiction. The whole book chronicles the long and wild chase across the whole of Germany for a Nazi war criminal.The chase is intertwined with a convulated plot involving biological weapons, the Mossad, the Waffen-SS and of course, the shadowy Odessa. Thoroughly researched and the explanations in each background are vivid and clear.Nevertheless, if you are in a mood for an exciting thrill ride from start to finish, this is the book for you. Forsyth fans were equally thrilled when this book was released. You might also want to check out the movie version of the novel, starring Jon Voight."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"One of the things I like about Frederick Forsythe's writing is that it is not overly florid. It is very detailed, matter-of-fact, and filled with suspense. I read the Odessa File as research for a book I'm interested in writing (which would be my fifth book) about the differences between African American and Jewish culture. The book interested me because of its revelations about the concentration camps. Of course, plenty other books give more detail about that subject. And the Odessa File is primarily about the organization formed to help former Nazi SS officers escape prosecution for war crimes. But I wanted to read it anyway. I think Forsythe is one of the few novelists who know how to combine all the proper elements -- style, characterization, and suspense -- in just the right proportions, to write fascinating suspense fiction."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Set in the early 1960's in West Germany with some scenes from Israel and Nasserite Egypt , this electrifying book has all the elements of a good historical spy novel - suspense,danger,action,human drama as well as a lot of food for thought.We come across a lot of interesting real figures from the time such as Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the head head of MOSSAD Meir Amit as well the evil psycopathic SS Officer Eduard Roschmann who in the novel is hunted by a young German journalist , Peter Miller We also read about statesmen and nation builders at the time such as West German Chancellors Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhardt , Israeli leaders David Ben-Gurion , Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir as well the warlike Egyptian dictator Gamel Abdel Nasser.The novel itself begins with the news of the assasination of John F Kennedy But the ordinary grassroots characters too are equally believable from Millers simple but good hearted and beautiful girlfriend Sigrid Rahn to the Israeli agent Uri Ben Shaul alias Josef to doctors and nurses,civil servants ,secretaries and housemaids. The novel is largely based on a true story and includes several important lessons from history.It lays bare the satanic evil of the Nazi SS while also oulining that ordinary Germans are good people ,as described in the novel by excerpts from the diary of holocaust survivor Salomon Tauber which is a very instructive and insightful piece in itself.It also shows the high level of cooperation between Nazi exiles and Arab states in their evil plans to destroy the tiny state of Israel The attempt to do so still continues today and should be exposed for what it is -naked anti-semitism and hatred"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I won't review the storyline as it's been done already, and all I want to add is that this is a fantastic book. It's incredibly well researched, the author clearly knows his war history, and because several of the characters are actual wartime figures, the whole thing is a mix of fiction and non-fiction. The central characters are all really believable, and the writer is very good at describing a place so well you feel like you're there. I read this book in about two days because I became so engrossed in it. For a couple of dollars you can't go wrong with this one. An interesting climax too, not how I thought it would end. A great read, especially if you are interested in WW2 and what happened to the Nazis afterwards."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"A classic mystery suspense set in 1960s Germany. A journalist gets involved in hunting down a Nazi war criminal (the Butcher of Riga) who is being aided by a shadow organization called The Odessa (name an acronym, not geographical). With a plot that links to arab terrorists, Israel, and ex-SS men, it's thrilling and tightly crafted. Fantastic, and apparently based on much fact in the generals."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Freddie Forsyth is clearly one of the best and this could be his best effort along with Jackal. Story takes place in Germany after WWII and involves the hunting of a particular ex-nazi who ran the Rigi death camp in Latvia. The pursuer is a free lance writer who has his own special reasons for the hunting. Two interesting things (1) The reason the German government was not diligent looking for nazis (natzii ?) after the war was because dead people don't vote but ex-nazis did (2) Tom Clancy said on C-Span booknotes he thought Forsyth was \\"the best\\". Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"Thankfully there are writers like Frederick Forsyth, all of whose books are captivating. His novels are placed realistically in a developed historical context, so there is a real possibility of actually learning something from reading them. He has a knack for melding his fiction into this context, so that it is often hard to tell one from the other. The edition I read (not the one pictured here) had a note from the publisher saying that they intentionally would not clarify the distinction, with the one exception of affirming that the person of Eduard Roschmann did in fact exist. Presumably we would not have believed that the disgusting horrors attributed to this officer of the SS could in fact have been committed.Because, obliquely, The Odessa File is a novel about the German SS (and to a lesser extent, the Arab-Israeli conflict) as seen through the eyes of a young German reporter of the post-WWII generation. It is so refreshing that Forsyth does not permit himself the usual gross characterizations, instead indicating distinctions in the acts of the SS, the German Wehrmacht, and Latvian collaborators. At the same time, it is not an historical novel per se. There is a palpitating story that takes place in the early sixties, that unfolds surely, without dwelling or stalling, before coming to a dramatic close. But again, the story, surreptitously, brings one that much closer to beginning to understand how the horrors of the Second World War might have happened.It is hard to appreciate just how much research must have gone into the writing, as Mr Forsyth calls seemingly effortlessly on details of geography, history, language, the German political system, culture, automobiles, and weaponry. It is in some way similar to Tom Clancy's style, except that Forsyth's knowledge extends beyond weaponry alone and it is not what the novel is about. The detail is all beautifully woven into the story and contributes to it.This truly is one of those books that will be very hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"The Odessa File is an amazing novel. The story is great, the characters are strongly developed, and the finale, I think, is just as strong as the rest of the novel.If you read The Day of the Jackal, you will find The Odessa File to be very similar in style, which is a great one with an intriguing plot, edge-of-your-seat action, and clever twists.Another thing which I had previously noted in my review for The Afghan is also relevant with this novel; many parts of the story are based on facts, while many other parts are completely fictional. The line between fact and fiction in Forsyth's novels are blurred in such a way that the novel will have you start questioning history books.I'd like to end on a 'Publisher's Note', which I found very interesting before beginning Chapter One of The Odessa File:\\"As in the case of Mr. Forsyth's first novel, The Day of the Jackal, many characters in The Odessa File are real people. Some will be immediately recognized by the reader; others may puzzle the reader as to whether theyare true or fictional, and the publishers do not wish to elucidate further because it is in this ability to perplex the reader as to how much is true and how much false that much of the grip of the story lies.\\""},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I'd read Day of the Jackel and Dogs of War years ago, but somehow missed this one. What a great read. Too few authors today take the time and have the talent to write an engaging work like this. I was amused by a later reviewer who considered Frederick Forsyth an unknown author. Can you imagine that? Too much TV watching must be to blame, but better late than never!"},{"Title":"The Odessa File","review":"I had to read this book for school and enjoyed it. i thought the writing was crisp and easy and that the plot kept you reading. Some parts were a bit unrealistic but it is fiction. There is a lot of information about what happened to the former dreaded SS members after world war II which is fascinating and the chapter about the holocaust is very sad. You can't see the twist coming, and I think the author cheated a litle by not divulging some needed information, but it is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English (Spectrum)","review":"Words are the currency used in all types of human interactions, but in mathematics they have more precise meanings than in most others. However, while this book is valuable as a reference concerning the definitions of the words, the greatest point of interest is in the origins of their mathematical meanings. I have always been interested in word origins, particularly how the meaning is modified over time. Languages are very dynamic entities, as even the passing of a few generations can lead to significant alterations in both structure and vocabulary.For these reasons, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, making it one of the few dictionaries that I have read nearly cover to cover, although not in that order. Many of the mathematical words have unexpected origins, reflecting in many ways how ubiquitous mathematics is in life. Also, since it is largely an abstract discipline, some of the words had to be \\"invented\\", as there was no real-world analog that adequately describes them.If you have an interest in the linguistic derivation of mathematical words, then this is one book that you should possess. I occasionally open it at random, and I have never been disappointed in the interesting facts uncovered. Reading them also builds an appreciation for how mathematics has evolved over the centuries.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English (Spectrum)","review":"This book is one of the best mathematical resources I've come across in a long time.

The stories in volume 1 are all excellent except \\"the children of black mound\\". Which seemed not related to the Hellboy series. All the art are distinct in styles but the characters are consistent. Not only Hellboy but Liz Sherman, Abraham, Roger, Katie Corrigan, other members are great too. Hellboy is tough and raunchy but also compassionate and a good leader. His right hand symbolizes his mythical power. The left hand, the gun. All together there are thirteen stories. Funny stories, puzzling stories, scary stories, realistic stories, symbolic stories. Everything is here. (After reading this one I was curious about Roger which had only comical role in the story. So, I went for next book.)"},{"Title":"Hellboy: Weird Tales, Vol. 1","review":"as some of the other reviews stated already, mike mignola didn't do any of the art or stories in this collection. that being said, this is a great collection of stories that have different takes on the characters, and the art especially but all still have the hellboy feel. the artwork is awesome. there is a variety of styles and mediums. i especially liked the colored pencil. there are some old lobster johnson comics in the back, along with pencil sketches from two artists, an afterword by mike mignola and some extra hellboys pics from the other artists. the stories are really entertaining and some parts made me laugh out loud. all in all if you are a hellboy fan you will enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Hellboy: Weird Tales, Vol. 1","review":"You reaction to the Hellboy compendium will have a lot to do with when you realize that none of the work included is Mike Mignola's. If you are simply a Hellboy fan and knew what you were buying when you bought it, you will most likely enjoy this effort by Dark Horse Books. If you didn't look closely (or failed to read the reviews), and specifically like Mignola's work, you may be disappointed. Unfortunately, I fall in the second category, having grabbed this off the shelves during a buying spree.I'm not going to launch into an oration about publishers who profit by imitating (even if it is imitating themselves). There is a special place in hell for them and that will suffice. But behind the nicely done cover art there are only a few cases where the art is up to Mignola's standard - Jim Starlin, Simeon Wilkins, and Kia Amasiya. The others are pretty original, and one, done by J. H. Williams is interesting on its own right. But if you are looking for Mignola's severe, dark graphics, there isn't much here.Writing varies considerably as well. I liked Love Is Scarier Than Death, Theater Of The Dead, and Toy Soldier the best. You get stories, some extra sketches, a long inclusion - A Lobster Johnson story - that left me cold, and some obligatory explanation about why this really is a Mignola comic book even if it isn't. Obviously there are people who would disagree with me, but this just falls short of the Mignola magic, proving, if nothing else, why he is as respected as he is."},{"Title":"The Bears: A 75-Year Celebration","review":"Whittingham's book gives a wealth of information on one of the most historic franchises in sports history.

The other crucial components are the better known Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and the On Miracles Section of the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Ideally, it would be best to read all these together, a relatively easy task as the individual essays are relatively short and contain some of Hume's clearest and most entertaining writing. In Natural History, Hume examines the essentially irrational character of religious belief, with its foundation in human anxieties and the human tendency to personify human characteristics in the natural world. Hume goes on to describe the emergence of monotheism not as a rational process based on a philosophic appreciation of the necessity of accepting the existence of a Designer (an argument he will demolish in the Dialogues) but on the further extension of human irrationality. In a typically ironic approach, Hume then argues that polytheism is more likely to produce social benefits than monotheism and argues strongly against the idea that religion is actually useful for cultivating true morality. Among other things, Natural History exhibits Hume's remarkable command of classical literature and his incisive writing style."},{"Title":"Natural History of Religion","review":"This work is essential reading for students of Philosophy and Religion, and important for it's implications on society and politics.I strongly recommend reading this work."},{"Title":"Natural History of Religion","review":"David Hume's \\"The natural history of religion\\" is a very valuable text.

I think it's a subject worth addressing in our world today.A word about Mr. Howard's review--he evidently doesn't have children in school today because what I'm seeing, there isn't any 16 year old, much less adult, that can write as eloquently as Mr. Zachary did in this book. Maybe he didn't like the subject matter, maybe he's never been divorced--whatever. The writing and editing of this book is exceptional and I asked a local English teacher to read for that reason.

Zachary touches ALL of the unspoken innuendoes of men going through a divorce and having their children used as weapons against them. He covers all of the things that most men only dare to think! A very bold stroke on the author's part to write such a piece of work. It brings the malicious women that do these horrible damaging things to their innocent children to justice and exposes them for what they truly are. This gives men being victimized a voice. The way Mr. Zachary does this is stunning and quite thrilling! He gives new meaning to the old saying &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;!!! IT is a unique blessing to the literary world to have such a fresh new author break ground this way.&quot;Scorn This&quot; IS the other half and or side to a MALE VERSION of &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; with murderously clever twists and turns that will haunt your thoughts days after reading the novel. His character Skip Martin is the modern day CLINT EASTWOOD for all men victimized monetarily and outright wronged in this manner. Skip is bold, tender, vicious, daring, and has a tortured heart of gold. He is also a bit of a stand up comedian in his own right. This excerpt where Skip is thinking to himself properly displays this with flying colors:&quot;What would happen if the authorities started finding women hung up in trees with cardboard signs stapled to their foreheads? The signs might say something like: &quot;I got the house, the car, the boat, the furniture, and the kids. I got the rope and the staple gun too.&quot; Another blood drenched sign might read: &quot;I turned my children against their father. See what it got me?&quot; How many examples will be needed to change women's minds throughout the country?&quot;This book cleverly takes you inside the minds of the children, men and women involved in such ridiculous chaos such women can create. There is no possible way that you can read this book with a dry eye. Especially Chapter 13. It is the pivotal chapter that takes you inside of a young girl's mind that has been a victim of a woman scorned. Exceptionally moving work! At the end of the book when Skip cries a tear, he is crying a tear for humanity in justice, help and truth. Everyone has their breaking point. The author displays this with elegance.If this were to be a movie, it would be a box office hit. Any movie maker would be a fool to turn it down! I'd go see it twice AND buy the DVD too! This book belongs in all supermarket check out aisles and FINE FINE book stores. This is a book that will not get dusty on shelves. This is something men all over the world can relate to. Even women too. I demand a movie! It is more than deserving of one. It took me two days to read the entire book. I simply could not put it down. After I read it in such a hurry, I had to read it again to make sure if my eyes were being blessed with such fine literature! Definitely an A LIST BOOK! A MUST HAVE BOOK!Scott D. Zachary is a new author that has sailed brilliantly into the literary world to take it over with his outstanding talent and creativity. A writer with heart and soul like this does not come along very often. Readers...hurry and get yourselves a copy! I found myself not wanting to lend the copy I have but buying copies for the men I know that have been done this way. Truly poetic justice for these victims of a woman scorned!

You won't find a virginal and innocent heroine within these pages. And you won't find an honest and selfless hero ready to sweep her off her feet. What you will find is an unusual woman named Rachel. At the age of 14, Rachel ran away from her last of many foster homes toward what she believed was her savior. Instead, Christian Lazar took away any remnants of her childhood, any joy, any pleasure out of life and turned her into a deadly weapon, an expert thief, or a machine as he called her.Ten years later, Rachel finally jumps at a desperate chance to escape and creates a new life for herself in the U.S. She lives in relative solitude, learning how to live her life away from the man she had loved and hated for years. While working as a security expert for a museum, an expensive ruby is stolen and Rachel chases after the thief before she herself is blamed for its loss and her new life is ruined. While struggling to recover the ruby, Rachel must confront Lazar and reclaim some sort of peace for her life. In a moment of desperation, she turns to the only man she has ever kissed, a master thief named Jason. For Rachel, any intimacy is new after a childhood where sex was a tool and love was a prison. They've both lived hard lives and their romance isn't cute or funny. It's a fascinating struggle between two seemingly tough but vulnerable people whose feelings for the other run very deep.Once a Thief certainly isn't your typical romance. It's better."},{"Title":"Once a Thief (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"The premise is good.

Using the skills he trained for as a security consultant.Then a job goes wrong and brings her back to France following a jewel. Then she finds out that she never was really independent of Christian. Who can she trust and can he master her again?Although it's an interesting premise it just didn't flow for me, I kept being jarred out of the story and my eyebrow spent a fair amount of time near my hairline as one more unbelievable thing happened.

The action is non stop throughout the entire novel, providing many taut, suspense-filled moments. We are given a glimpse in to a society many of us can't even begin to imagine, as secrets are revealed about the tight-knit yet highly competitive ring of thieves where members will guard others with their lives, only to turn around and stab them in the back the next moment. Rachel's shock at learning about \\"The Network\\" sets the precedent for more stories to follow about this intriguing but dangerous world.This novel is by no means easily classified as a romance, though it does have some leanings in that direction by the end of the story. Rachel is one tough broad without being a bitch, who can seduce the unwary with one move or dish out a beating one won't soon forget. On the flip side, these very same things can happen to her, and do, more than once. She may pack a healthy punch, but she receives far more than her share in some fast paced fight scenes.

She has the coveted talent of story-telling down to an art. She knows just when to draw out the lines for maximum shock value and when to speed them up to match the hurtling pace of the action she's portraying with her voice. There was never any doubt as to who was speaking when, for Debbie Irwin makes each character distinct enough to follow along, even when several are involved in one scene. I look forward to listening to more narrations she's performed.In short, whether reading for yourself, or following along with the narrator, Once a Thief is full of pulse pounding adventure sure to get the adrenalin pumping and leave readers eager for more exciting tales from author Michele Hauf.Kelley A.

But I confess Rachel Blu left me cold. As a heroine I just had no empathy for her. I know she was raised to be an uber-thief, have no emotions, be self-sufficient etc. But somehow all this training left me with a heroine I just didn't care about. Likewise I'm not a big fan of stories involving thievery an occupation. Perhaps if Blu had been several years into her new career and developed some humanity I could be interested in her. But, her lack of emotional development, actual age, and inexperience in human relations made her sexual encounters uninteresting and virginal.I do think Hauf's writing is technically quite good. She does a great job with description and plot...

She also concludes she needs help from a specialist when she begins her quest to regain the stolen gem. Thus she goes to friend and thief Jason Marland not knowing that turning to him in her hour of need will prove even more complex to her heart than stealing back the gem.This intriguing romantic suspense will grip readers with its cat and mouse contest between the teacher and the student. Rachel is a terrific protagonist who chose the right side of the law over the morality of her instructor. Jason is her perfect foil as she grants to herself that she loves him but also detests him due to his profession. Christian steals the show though his appearances are comparatively brief as he is not evil yet stealing is in his blood except when he suffers the severe head pains.

Handsome, suave, sophisticated, he offered her travel to Paris, a home, food, clothing and love. Though she didn't know then that it would come with a price, or that the love would be so twisted. Rachel would realize too late that the careful grooming were all part of her training to create the perfect thief, an international cat burglar extraordinaire, a machine conditioned to show no emotion, and a prisoner with no way to escape but to be the best - performing at will for the beautiful but sinister master thief Christian Lazar.Ten years later during their morning workout ritual her Machiavellian master, Christian is struck down.

While there, she would have to confront an evil from her past and discover a love that would bring her back into a world of feeling she thought was lost to her forever.*** This was an absorbing and totally mesmerizing read that I simply could not put down. Rachel was amazing as she tried to live a normal life after being so cruelly manipulated, brain-washed, and tortured when she didn't perform perfectly to Christian's ideal. The writing was so superb and the intensity of the action so vivid that I could almost believe I was watching a movie. Christian was skillfully portrayed as a mesmerizing sinister manipulator that will have even the reader both loving and hating him. Any HOLLYWOOD producer would do well to snap the rights on this up to make one brilliant action packed movie! This story was so impressive, I almost find myself at a loss for words.

Set at the tail end of 1950s, the story is told by Billy Fisher, who lives with his parents in the fictional Yorkshire town of Stradhoughton. Billy can't cope with his tedious clerking job at a local funeral parlor, living at home, or really anything about his life, and so, spends a great deal of time escaping into fantasy world in his head called Ambrosia. When he's not imagining life as prime minister of his make-believe country, he's spinning mostly purposeless lies to almost everyone he meets. Sometimes he's lying to cover up real misdeeds, such as his smalltime embezzling, other times, his lies are completely pointless, such as telling a friend's mother about his fictional sister.At first, his carefree, devil-may-care insouciance is amusing and the reader is drawn into Billy's bizarre self-vision as lively raconteur and comic wit. However, as the story progresses, he becomes a more troublesome figure. He's engaged to two different girls, and apparently in love with a third. More problematically, he has no emotional connection to reality&oacute;every episode in his life takes on the aspect of a sketch or scene in which he struggles to determine what role to play, what accent to adopt, or what pose to strike. It becomes heartbreaking to witness Billy's belief that he's smarter than everyone around him and destined for great things, when everyone else can see right through his poses and tired routines. (It'd be interesting to know what a psychiatrist's diagnosis of Billy would be.) As the lies pile up, Billy finds himself painted into a corner from which only drastic action will free him. His only avenue of escape is to actually pursue his longstanding claim of a job offer in London writing scripts for a standup comic. The reader is torn between wanting Billy to stay and face up to his misdeeds, and wanting him to get on that train to the Big Smoke and realize his dreams. Of course, the outcome is inevitable.Waterhouse grew up in Leeds, and like Billy, worked as a clerk in an undertakers. The prose is liberally sprinkled with Yorkshire dialect, and does a brilliant job of capturing the small town atmosphere, from the grubby disco, to the local cafe, and claustrophobic house. The book was turned into a play the year after publication and into an excellent film several years later, a TV miniseries in the early 1970s, and an insipid American TV series called Billy. A sequel called Billy Liar on The Moon appeared in 1977, and more recently there are allegedly plans for an American feature film remake, although I'm not sure who thought that would be a good idea.."},{"Title":"Muslim Resistance to the Tsar","review":"This book is a splendid analysis of the Russian conquest of Chechnya and Daghestan between the late 1820s and early 1850s. Its central theme is the collision between imperial Russia and the Muslim peoples of the Caucasus. Gammer traces the origins of the 'Islamic revival' that occurred in the Caucasus in the second quarter of the nineteenth century and shows how, under the leadership of Imam Shamil, that revival assumed a military dimension that challenged Russia's presence in the region. Gammer insists that Shamil and his followers were by no means the 'fanatics' or 'terrorists' imagined by the Russians. He argues that Shamil was a genuine believer in God and in Islamic law; that Shamil first sought accommodation with the Russians but soon became aware that the Russians were only interested in establishing imperial hegemony in the region; that Shamil was a shrewd politician who very nearly succeeded in unifying the ethnically diverse peoples of Chechnya and Daghestan under a common Islamic banner. The book is based on profound scholarship, but it is written in a lively narrative style. The text is accompanied by helpful maps and suggestive illustrations. Although Gammer's book focuses on the nineteenth century, its subject is timely in light of the two recent wars between post-Soviet Russia and the Chechens who, since Shamil's rebellion, may never have accepted Russian rule."},{"Title":"Muslim Resistance to the Tsar","review":"An indepth look at an Amazing personality and the conditions surrounding his times.

At the start of the era he covers, Britain still ranked below France, Spain and Portugal. But Britain then went on to consolidate itself, as Great Britain from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The national unity was also aided by generally wise policies of the government. A key idea in the book is that the Restoration of the Monarchy was predicated on the Monarch acknowledging the primacy of Parliament. Well ahead of any other major nation of the time. Though Parliament was dominated by the House of Lords and the well to do in the Commons, it gave enough feedback about policies to ensure that they would often be reasonable. A vast contrast to the autocracies in the rest of Europe.An American reader can see clearly the roots of American society being formed here. Not just in the literal sense of the British colonies in North America. But in the deeper meaning of elected government and no divine right of kings."},{"Title":"Desert Knights","review":"Windy and Long Jim weren't looking for trouble, they just wanted to hand over a corpse to the local law. But the law in Goliath didn't seem too interested, and when it turned out the dead man was a friend of Windy's nephew, Quincy, they decided to take the matter into their own hands. Suddenly they found themselves in the middle of Mexican bandit, El Porcito's, plans for a revolution.From Windy and Long Jim's discovery of a corpse strapped to the back of a camel you know you're in for an entertaining read. Barry Cord writes a fast paced and tough story that I found impossible to put down, in fact finished it the same day I picked it up.As the mystery surrounding Quincy and why he was in Goliath gets more and more complex, more characters are introduced and it begins to look like Windy and Long Jim will never find Quincy. Even the local law want them out of town.Cord seems to be a master of letting the reader think he knows what's going on and then introducing someone else to further complicate matters. Here this is dramatically done with the arrival of Quincy's wife Linda whose attitude is superbly written, her comments and treatment of those around her having me laughing out loud.Linda isn't the only strong woman in the book, there's Maria, but what is her role in the story? And what of Felipe, the boy thief? All of Cord's characters will play important roles in the outcome of the book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The New Golden Rules","review":"Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D. wrote a genuine and beautiful guide.

To really listen, however, requires cultivating concentration and learning to pay attention. It involves being patient, and perhaps most important, suspending judgment about what you hear. As you become a good listener, you become aware of the message beyond the words and learn how to tune in to the heart of the individual speaking...These attributes are also critical when you listen for the voice of God and want to appreciate His will for you...The best way to comprehend - be it another person or your Higher Power is to listen carefully, which requires discovering what lies inside our deepest self...Sometimes you may hear the voice of God, but you don't want to accept it. That's why you must not only listen, but also agree to follow the instructions and not judge, overanalyze, or label...This is truly a wonderful book to help humanity evolve.

He cautions that once bitten by the astronomy bug, serious complications can ensue -- and he happily warns how to avoid the pitfalls of the \\"jungle\\" that's out there.The title tells all about Fulton and his happy-go-lucky attitude toward life and astronomy. He writes with a light heart, and with gentle humor to get his points across. Astronomers are a strange breed according to him. \\"Strange things turn them on\\", he says; \\"dismal points of light . . . playing cosmic peek-a-boo . . . quiet parties on a starlit mountaintop,\\" and more. For some, astronomy is a science; for others, an escape from everyday life.He cautions newbies who start out to beware of the temptations and snares in the astronomy jungle. Don't run out and buy a telescope, and above all don't buy one in a department store. He says to do your homework, read magazines, books, talk to other astronomers, and don't believe all the advertisements. Don't be bamboozled by the hype and the colorful pictures.He describes the different types and sizes of telescopes and compares relative costs, and why they may vary. He suggests you go easy on buying accessories. Start out with a couple of decent eyepieces and a Barlow lens, and decide later what else you really need. \\"Beware of telescope fever,\\" he says, and gives eight \\"survival tips\\" on how to brave the wilds of the jungle.The author warns, with a twinkle in his eye, \\"You do not need that set of 64 eyepieces.\\" He advises, \\"Face it, unless you're gonna use them for chess pieces, you don't need that many.\\"The chapters are short, and the book is thin, only 115 paperbacked pages, but he covers a lot of ground. Like deciding what type of astronomer you really want to be; a do-it-yourselfer, into amateur telescope making, or a gadget-lover, or a shutterbug, an aesthetic, or a casual scientific astronomer. And the question of whether to specialize . . . on planets, deep-sky objects, meteors . . . ? \\"You don't have to make a decision right away, just go out and have fun.\\"With easy humor he tells of mistakes, like money spent foolishly, things broken and lost, getting in trouble with the spouse, and says, \\"I can laugh now -- even while crying -- at my blunders and bloopers.\\" Fulton advises, \\"Get mad, and kick and spit -- but don't quit. And don't forget to laugh.\\"He sums up the book with some final thoughts. Be patient and understanding -- with yourself and your neighbors and family. Don't feel guilty for NOT observing on a clear night; and don't become an astroholic and lose your family. Cut your family and your neighbors some slack, even when they leave lights on and do not appear to appreciate your passion. Even when things that didn't bother you \\"B. T.\\" (before telescope) really bug you now. Take it easy, lighten up. \\"No one ever said astronomy was easy,\\" he concludes, \\"Go gently into that good night. Happy star trails, and God speed!\\""},{"Title":"Light Hearted Astronomer","review":"This is the book that kept the hobby in perspective for me when I first was captured by the wonders of the night sky.

Extremely helpful information to the newcomer wanting to buy a telescope, even useful for the experienced observer thinking of buying a second scope.

Its practical, sound advice is delivered in a most enjoyable read. This is a must have for any astronomer's bookshelf. I have given quite a few copies to friends who ask, \\"what kind of telescope should I get?\\".If you don't own a copy, you should get one."},{"Title":"Light Hearted Astronomer","review":"I revisited The Light Hearted Astronomer after reading it some 20 years ago. I'm pretty sure I passed it on to another person who was in the early stages of becoming enamored with the night sky. In this current time with \\"go-to\\" scopes and aperture fever run rampant, I hoped to get back in touch with the simple pleasure of looking up with modest equipment, involving the mind as much as the eye. Fulton's book is very conversational and I guess I'd even say dated, but the advice rings true and I got what I wanted: a rekindling of my early days of observing. The book has me even more fond of my 80mm Refractor, though I also have 6 and 10-inch reflectors to observe with. Halloween 2009, my neighborhood was having a post trick-or-treat party with hot chocolate and a fire. The moon and Jupiter were well situated in the night sky. I had been observing the moon a lot in the previous few days so it was on my mind. The party was a few blocks away and slung the scope and tripod (all attached) over my shoulder, a la the image I remembered from Fulton's book. I sauntered to the party, smiling all the way. After 10-seconds to set-up, I shared the views with people who may have glimpsed these objects for the first time. Hooks were set. Many modern books will discuss telescope purchasing and observing in greater detail with more specific info. Fulton's does it with an attitude and easygoing method that I found comfortable and useful, then and now. Casual astronomy at it's best."},{"Title":"Freshwater fishes of the world (A Studio book)","review":"I have used this copy for years.

I've not found any other source with this level of information."},{"Title":"Human Sexuality: An All-Embracing Gift","review":"In this book the author discusses the contemporary issues that face the ethics of human sexuality. In recent times, many questions have been raised about human sexuality. These questions demand a clear moral answer. The author has successfully done this in the book beginning by looking at the scientific, historical and psychological background of each topic and using the scriptures, the moral teachings of the Church to answer them. He does this in nine chapters.In the first and second chapters, he describes sexuality as a gift from God which we need to accept and rejoice over. The main purpose of this gift is love. It is not just physical but also profoundly psychological and spiritual. He refers to Pope John Paul II symbolic use of sex as the language of the body and argues that sexuality is essential both to our becoming fully human and to our human becoming. Thus, our authentic humanness must be found in relationships, and to be fully human, sexuality must have the elements of sensuality and tenderness. The task therefore of the human person is to integrate sensuality and tenderness into a truly human conversation.In chapter three through four, he discusses the question of birth control and the different methods used. He extensively uses the teachings of Humanae Vitae to affirm that contraceptives are morally evil. The conjugal act is unitive and procreative in meaning, and the use of contraceptives prevents the procreative meaning of conjugal act. He however advances the Billings method of family Planning arguing that it is personalist and integralist.Chapters five, six and seven discusses homosexuality, non-marital sex and masturbation. He argues that homosexual activity as distinguished from homosexual orientation is unnatural and thereby morally wrong. He however mentions that homosexuals should not suffer prejudice against their basic life, but the Church should minister with love to them. He condemns all forms of sex outside of marriage in that, sex finds it true meaning within marriage. He argues that without the commitment of marriage, genital relationship loses its communicative character by disengaging itself from the persons of the lovers, and reduces into mere genital contact and surface sensations. For masturbation, he says it is neither procreative nor unitive in any interpersonal sense, so it is not morally right.In chapters eight and nine, he discusses the respect for human life and the church's respond to HIV/AIDS. He argues that life is sacred from the very moment of conception and uses this position to show that abortion is morally evil. He also argues that it is morally wrong to use condoms as a protection against HIV/AIDS.The author made logical and consistent arguments throughout the book. He supports his thesis with authoritative facts drawn from the scriptures, Church teachings, and reputable authors. The major weakness with his book is the repetition of facts gathered from different sources. He also tends to repeat himself most times. He made pastoral suggestions only in the case of masturbation and non for other chapters.I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires to know more about human sexuality and most especially to all students of pastoral programs.Bekeh Utietiang writes from Washington, DC."},{"Title":"Conversations with Pinter","review":"In a series of interviews between 1971 and 1993 Gussow (longtime _New York Times_ drama critic, who also coaxed a fascinating set of comments from Tom Stoppard) got Pinter to talk about how he works. Pinter refuses to comment on what his work &quot;means,&quot; but is eager to clear the air about misperceptions about himself (such as being in a chronic state of outrage). Pinter comes across as generous as well as politically committed, suspicious of audiences, but grateful to (fellow) actors. And he clearly has a sense of humor (too rarely appreciated in his plays)."},{"Title":"The use of poetry and the use of criticism,: Studies in the relation of criticism to poetry in England","review":"Most of us are afraid of poems because as we read it, we can't seem to make head or tails as to what we have read. Therefore, for those of us who have &quot;poem-phobia,&quot; I recommend this delightful little work.In this work, Eliot ask the question of what is poetry and the use of criticism in poetry as well as the relationship between the former and the latter.Eliot proposes to start the enquiry by reviewing the history of criticism starting from Elizabethan era untill that of his time. Through the course of the exploration, I was enthralled by Eliot's insightful opinion of critics and their opinion as to what is poetry and its uses.I was particularly drawn to the final chapter of his work which does not offer any final word to the questions which he posed but rather giving us advice as to how to read poems (in particular the modern poets, i.e., 20th century). I was very glad to have read this work because it sure beats reading a heavy college text on how to read poetry."},{"Title":"The use of poetry and the use of criticism,: Studies in the relation of criticism to poetry in England","review":"When very young, being the first child, I have to admit I was selfish.

In contrast with Lichtenberg and Lieberman, which preceded it (and was for a few years the only modern book on chaos available), it did not ignore driven-dissipative systems but rather emphasized them. Still provides a good introduction for a beginner (when one supplements it by going to the orginal literature), although I would of course recommend my own books on the subject, especially with regard to understanding what is meant by integrability/nonintegrability, what is meant by a 'chaotic orbit', and to avoid confusing randomness with deterministic chaos. It is a disease with all books on chaos that the writers do not advise the student to do backard in time integration to check the validity of forward time numerical integrations. therefore, the cookbook recipe given in those texts for calculating Liapunov exponents is wrong and misleading. Another way to say it is that deterministic chaos is not developed from the systematic standpoint of symbollic dynamics in those texts, but rather from the standpoint of meaningless numerical integrations packed full with machine errors."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Yes, you too can time travel as well, if only in your imagination to a day that many have no doubt wished they could be present for,if just a fly on the wall.A witness to one of the most dramatically moving and mystically perplexing events in history. One that led to the advent of a new religion, Roman Catholicism.Just what did happen during those fateful, agonizing last 24 hours to a young, Jewish man who knew what he did and what was coming.Well, of course no one will ever know for sure. We have a scattering of supposed eyewitness accounts gathered and passed down via the gospels to guide the curious but can we say that they are absolute in their interpretation, that throughout history there was no alteration or editing by monk revisionists or perhaps Vatican input?.Who can say that what was written, is,or was.Well this book by Jim Bishop will take you there and like a countdown will expose you to a 24 hour period broken down practically hour by hour of the last day Christ walked the earth as a man.A master of the as if \\"you were there\\" type of reporting something he was known for and mastered as in his treatment of Lincolns' last hours he takes you back to the temple of Jerusalem, the towns and the people as well as the men and areas Christ traveled to and with.He incorporates the spirit of the times and gives you a feel for what was going on with the Jews, the Romans and the high priests who managed quite cleverly to take this dangerous man down.After all he threatened not only their power but their purses and that was simply too much pressure to allow this man who was gaining power through alleged acts of healing, only one truly gifted by God could perform.They were scared, nervous, plotted and planned, in the end caught and killed him.Utilizing Pontius Pilate's own fear of Caesar, they, mainly a priest called Caiphas,his main arch enemy, conspired to assassinate Jesus, with a little help from the groups money man Judas.In this book you get a brief but rich historical feel and you follow Christ through the last supper, the agony in the garden and his last few hours of making sure his merry band of misfits got his message right.You relive the torture, not quite the Gibsonian treatment but nonetheless painful and hard on the body.You can see how his beatings, loss of blood coupled with dehydration led to his state of shock as he was nailed to the wood and left to the sun and time to slowly die.Bishop will let you travel, hear and evaluate for yourself the last moments of Jesus, what he tried to accomplish and if you close your eyes and let yourself believe, be truly transported to a very good depiction in modern terms,based on what evidence we have, to a seminal event that changed the world.Yes, its just a story, and no, what he wrote can never be checked but if one had to give an event this kind of treatment then Bishop does it with grace, class and a sense that if it did happen this way then it probably did as Bishop wrote it.His version couldn't be that far from the way in which it could have reasonably,logically occurred given what we know of that day.Not being a religious person in general I enjoyed this book more from a historical perspective than a religious one but found it inspiring giving me a new appreciation of what this young man was trying to say,what he gave up to ensure its lasting message and for that alone he is to be commended and remembered in our hearts.His simple message of love is easily felt in the pages of this 55 year old work of creative art.Read it."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"A hard copy of this book was given to me as a Confirmation gift, inscribed by my father, on March 21, 1965. It is quite the phenomenol work. I read it as an eleven-year-old but did not read it again in its entirety until Easter season 2009--two years after my father's death. After 44 years it has become an annual tradition to read this book during the Easter Season.What is so remarkable about this book is the writing style of this author. He brings Jesus Christ and the world in which he lived to life in such a way that you yourself are there. The book is remarkably well researched even though the author takes no credit for himself. Instead he informs us before he even starts the book that FOR THE RECORD: \\"This book...is the product of the intelligence of others. The fundamental research was done a long time ago by four fine journalists: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The rest has been added, in bits and pieces and slivers of knowledge from many men whose names span the centuries in indelible challenge of the written word...added to the sum of knowledge between these covers.\\" The author, however, early on and throughout the book admits that in writing it \\"Most of all, I wanted to see Jesus the man during the time he chose to suffer as a man.\\"The book itself is an hour-by-hour account of the time immediately preceding the death of Jesus Christ. It begins on 6 P.M. the night of the Lord's Last Supper and ends at 4 P.M., the hour after his death. There are three very important background sections entitled \\"The Jewish World\\", \\"Jesus\\" and \\"The Roman World\\". I learned so much especially from reading about The Jewish World. It describes in detail the culture of the Jewish people and the world into which Jesus was born, raised and died. Not only did it paint Jesus as a real man who suffered profoundly in the hours anticipating his capture, was tortured and died a horrible and slow death but it also painted the apostles as real men who wavered from truth faith to having doubts that Jesus was indeed the redeemer. The author writes of the twelve: \\"...a group of bearded men, averaging about thirty years of age, men of assorted sizes and coloring, simple men who were certain, now and then, that they were in the presence of the Son of God, although at other moments they became frightened and their belief wavered. Their faith in Jesus was full so long as it was not overburdened....They had heard Jesus discuss his impending death with obvious sadness. And each feared to ask the question they all wanted to ask: \\"Can you not call upon your father's angels and destroy the city and the world and then let us sit with you today and judge the souls of men?\\" No one asked it.\\"In the final chapter of the book the author continues: \\"They did not understand. (For a moment in time, at least, they could not understand.) To their way of thinking, this was now a tragic defeat. It was not. It was a victory beyond their most exalted imaginings. He had come to tell man that the way to everlasting life was love--each for the other, each for him, and his love for all--and he had proved this by laying down his life in a torrent of torment--for them. He did not die particularly for the Jews, or for the Gentiles. He died for man. All mankind. He came to Palestine to lay the foundations of new convenant because he and his Father were dissatisfied with the old. The Father had never made a covenant with the Romans, or the Greeks or the Egyptians. He had made it, through Moses, with the Jews. And the leaders of Judea had, over the centuries, perverted that covenant until worship became a matter of externals in which all inner love was missing. If a new covenant was to replace the old, it would be negotiated with the same people. That is why he had to die in Palestine; that is why, of all the cities in Palestine, he had to die in the Holy City--the city of his Father. The high priests rejected him and plotted against him and killed him. The people didn't. The people were looking for the Messiah, waiting eagerly. And, although Jesus did not fit their conception of a resplendent Messiah clothed in clouds of glory, they were willing to listen. They did listen. And many of them gave up their worldly possessions to follow him. The people were of good heart.\\"The book has a way of touching the reader deep down, evoking subdued emotions and really getting one to appreciate the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ in a world that did often did not recognize him as a Savior, that taunted him, abused him, betrayed him and finally hung him on a cross, an innocent man, to suffer horribly and to die. He did this out of the deep love he had for humanity, to redeem the very world that had mistreated him and instead ensure for them, who could never be worthy of his love, everlasting life."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"This was quite a good book.

This is a vibrant and wonderfully crafted story of the last day of the life of Jesus Christ, painstakingly weaving gospels with other works to paint as complete a portrait as I have ever read.

This is a bold text for anyone to undertake write because there exists some uncertainties when detailing with these events. One great thing about this text is that it is a simple and quick read. Not a thousand page history and doctrinal treatise. Good for all ages.Bishop makes his approach a thoughtful one and employs great writing and research to present his chronology and case. One can not read this text and get a better idea of what it was like in the last hours and days, alongside a better perspective for the times and people of this period, for Christ.

And the leaders of Judea had, over the centuries, perverted that covenant until worship became a matter of externals in which all inner love was missing. If a new covenant was to replace the old, it would be negotiated with the same people. That is why he had to die in Palestine; that is why, of all the cities in Palestine, he had to die in the Holy City--the city of his Father. The high priests rejected him and plotted against him and killed him. The people didn't. The people were looking for the Messiah, waiting eagerly. And, although Jesus did not fit their conception of a resplendent Messiah clothed in clouds of glory, they were willing to listen. They did listen. And many of them gave up their worldly possessions to follow him. The people were of good heart.\\"The book has a way of touching the reader deep down, evoking subdued emotions and really getting one to appreciate the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ in a world that did often did not recognize him as a Savior, that taunted him, abused him, betrayed him and finally hung him on a cross, an innocent man, to suffer horribly and to die. He did this out of the deep love he had for humanity, to redeem the very world that had mistreated him and instead ensure for them, who could never be worthy of his love, everlasting life."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"My dad has this book years ago and lost it. I purchaced him a new one. I likes it very much!"},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"This is a wonderful book about Jesus. Although the title implies that you will only read about his last day on earth, you will actually read about much more than that. There is one section that skips clear back to the day he was born and other sections that cover other times in his life. There are sections that give descriptions of the geographical area, the lifestyle of the people, the rulers and the religious leaders of the time, and much more. All descriptions are factual and very interesting. Only recently I discovered that this book has a description of the scourge that is very similar to the scourge as depicted in the movie \\"The Passion\\". Bear in mind this book was written nearly 50 years ago, so it is not \\"copied\\" from the movie."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"I was very impressed with ordering this book thru Amazon. I had been looking for this title for years! I love to read Bishop's book during Lent..... especially during Holy Week. I've never read anything else that comes close to giving the historical detail in such a fascinating way.I thought the book had been out of print for years. No bookstore could find it for me. I was extremely pleased with how fast the book arrived (within a week). The price was low..... the service was great!I will do business again with Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"This was a very timely book for the Easter season. It was received two weeks before Easter, and it made the Passion Story very real, and followed the Bible version closely. Even thought I believe it was written as a work of fiction, it was true to the Gospel in most every way."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"I love this book. I read it every year during the Easter season. It has improved my prayer life and makes me feel more grateful for what Jesus did for us. The detail that Mr. Bishop uses makes you feel that you are right there. With the chapters being broken down into hours allows you to take all the time you need to fully comprehend and feel the story. I have given many copies to friends and I always try to keep a couple extra on hand for that purpose."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Using the accounts of the four Gospels and other texts written at the time of Christ, the author writes about the last day of Jesus Christ. He starts at the beginning of the Hebrew Day at 6 P.M. with Jesus and ten of the apostles coming through the pass between the Mount of Olives and the Mount of Offense en route to Jerusalem and the Last Supper. And we follow an hour-by-hour narrative of this day until it ends at 4 P.M. the following afternoon, when Jesus was taken down from the cross.The book also has three chapters that give us the historical context in which to understand the words and actions of those involved that day. The chapters cover a background on Jesus Christ himself, and on Roman and Palestinian life and history.The narrative style of the book is very engaging and gives us a view of that day as Mel Gibson tried to do in his movie 'The Passion of the Christ'. And Jim Bishop as able to give you great insight about the deeper history of the reasons and actions regarding Christ's last day, as he understands it."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Jim Bishop has a way of making history come alive.I'm not usually a fan of historical fiction, liking the stories of mankind straight up and as they happened. Jim Bishop does not fictionalize his stories the way a Vidal of Sharra does -- what he does is add color and texture to actual events and actual dialogue to make two dimensional histories come alive.In this book, Bishop, as I understand it, took only the dialogue and scenes appearing in the Gospels to tell the story of Christ's final day on earth. The book is broken down into hour by hour chapters. Three background chapters -- one on Jesus? life; one on the Jewish world and one on the Roman -- give the &quot;greatest story ever told&quot; context and allow the reader to more easily slip back into a world 2,000 years old.As I understand the Gospels -- and I am by no means an expert -- Bishop remains true to the Jesus story and the biblical account. While the Gospels are moving in themselves, having such a skilled writer describe the scenery, the points in Jerusalem where Jesus was taken and traveled and the characters who inhabit the drama enlivens an already supremely rich story."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Jim Bishop writes a book that is not only Biblically accurate, but it is also entertaining. Although I do have a word of caution, remember this is fiction! He has taken Biblical fact and blended them together with fiction to create an understandable flow events during the ministry of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, Jim does a great job bringing the reader into the Age of Jesus' time using historical research. He reviews the Jewish background (e.g., Law, customs, and more), as well as articulating the structure, politically and religiously, of the Roman Empire. Again, Jim Bishop writes an outstanding book that will educate everyone, and give all Christians who read it a deeper sense and appreciation of what Jesus did for all people."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a student of the scriptures. The narrative style the book in which the book is written lends to easy reading. The language of the text draws the reader on an ancient journey and place you in the garden, in Herod's palace, on the cross, with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I also found the background history on the Roman and Jewish cultures very helpful with understanding why things happened the way they did. Reading &quot;The Day Christ Died&quot; will help you understand why Christ died, which is the ultimate point."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Anyone interested in a thoroughly engrossing book should read The Day Christ Died. This book covers more than just the day Christ was crucified. It gives a perspective of ancient Roman and Jewish life in the first centry. Bishop gives excellent insight into the personalities of those involved in this drama that continues to effect all of humanity 2000 years after the event."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"'The Day Christ Died' tells the story of the 24 hours leading up to the death of Jesus Christ.It takes the familiar story from the Gospels and adds details from everyday life of the time. There are chapters on the Jewish and Roman worlds of the time that further add insight.This book is similar to Mel Gibson's movie 'The Passion of the Christ' in the way that it focuses things on the last day. There is also a lengthy chapter entitled 'Jesus' which tells much of the story of His earlier life.It is very good at helping to explain the background and cultures of the times. For instance, it adds lots of insight into the political maneuverings of Annas and Caiphas and the way their positions interacted with the Roman authorities.This is a quick read packed with lots of information. It is very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"A truly remarkable well written book on the last hours of the world's most famous man. Mr.Bishop's time and efforts are well applauded in this beautiful book. I read it three times then hesitantly loaned it out. I first borrowed it from the local library then had to buy a copy to have for myself."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Jim Bishop seemlessly weaves his biblical scholarship and anthropological knowledge with scripture to create a full accounting of the last days Christ's life. Divorced from the realities of life under Roman rule, modern Christians may lack an understanding of the visceral realities of the crucifixion-which Bishop provides. Altogether a beautifully spiritual book."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Jim Bishop does an excellent job of pesonalizing humanities Saviour. It makes the reader privy to Jesus &quot;the man&quot; as well as the disciples and the dynamics of them as a group. Who knew that two of the disciples were Jesus' cousins? I didn't but I do now thanks to Jim Bishop. In a time when the world asks, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;, Jim Bishop lets us know what Jesus really did."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Using the accounts of the four Gospels and other texts written at the time of Christ, the author writes about the last day of Jesus Christ.

At times moving, very moving...Fundamentalists looking for aura and glory will not find it here. Instead, readers will find a carefully written account of life in the Palestine of that day and, as carefully as can be researched, the reactions, thoughts, hopes, fears and dreams of the the Apostles, Priests and Roman officers as they lived that day, not knowing what it was, where it would lead or what it was all about. A very, very, very good effort.While there is no groundbreaking theology here--there was never intended to be any--the reader can learn a lot about ancient Palestine and come to a greater and deeper understanding and appreciation of life in Jesus' time...For example, few would know or imagine that the Jews were doing brain surgery in this time, removing cataracts, too. False teeth and dental work were common. It was all part of Jesus' world, a world we never think about or comprehend.What we learn about his world alone is worth the read. And for Christians, it adds a richness and fullness to the age-old story."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"Using the accounts of the four Gospels and other texts written at the time of Christ, the author writes about the last day of Jesus Christ.

Nonetheless, even allowing for the fictional elements, Jim's research would be contradicted by the findings of scripture scholars during the past three decades. His book would not serve for an accurate picture of first century Palestine, the authorship of the gospels, and so forth for serious study in 2001."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"a good read--not as well done, in my opinion, than THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT but that might be that I was more interested in that subject matter."},{"Title":"The Day Christ Died","review":"This sounds like an intriguing book--especially for one's Lenten reading.I wonder, though, from which version of the Bible Mr. Bishop got his information.

It also shows what to do if the teacher has too many objective faults (or has gone astray) so that one may not harm oneself by following either a wrong guru or by following someone whose personality does not allow to rely on him any more. This could mainly happen when one jumps too quickly in a teacher student relationship in Tibetan Buddhism. All such cases are addressed and solutions are shown.I recommend this precious book for any follower of Tibetan Buddhism, including those who feel to be \\"advanced\\" or \\"experienced\\" practitioners."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I have read several of her books and enjoyed this the most, it'sa quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"It was a new experience, reading a novel through without once caring one way or another about the protagonist. Alice Thrift has so little personality of any kind, it's difficult to think of her at all, either with affection or ill-will.However, this book is being marketed as a comic novel, and I don't believe I found any of it amusing in any way at all. The only emotion I recall registering was mild melancholy (because Alice Thrift seems to represent a banal mean seen in too many people these days who mistake a job for a life). Perhaps I prefer a bit more aggression in my comic novelists (Patrick Dennis, Dawn Powell, Jonathan Coe, P.G. Wodehouse), but I don't think this is comedy."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Elinor Lipman has not lost her touch. Although I was Deeply Disappointed with her Dearly Departed, her latest book gets us Lipman fans back on track. I enjoyed Alice Thrift tremendously, and unlike some people have said, she doesnt really give away the story at the beginning. Alice's being a resident in surgery at a big city teaching hospital makes for an interesting background and sets the scene for some wild incidents, as well as introducing a large supporting cast that keep things moving. These characters and the setting make up for the fact that Alice may not have quite as much pizzazz as some earlier Lipman heroines. However, Alice is capable of growing and learning, and that is a big part of what the book is about. I think Lipman actually took a step forward with this book, moving to a more serious story that still is laced with her humor. I also found the medical scene from the viewpoint of an overworked intern was interesting enough in itself. I'm sure there are some arrogant doctors like Charles around. I'm looking forward to Lipman's next book. Go for it."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This is the first book I've read by Lipman, but I'll certainly read more after this.Poor Alice, she lacks social skills, confidence, tact and sleep. Educated in academics, but devoid of any female intuition, she follows the path of least resistance and enters into a relationship with the crass Ray Russo. Uncouth, a pathelogical liar and cheapskate, he is the type of character that you love to despise.Lipman's skill in the slow thaw of Alice's resistance to Ray, her development of social skills and her awakening of her potential as a physician and woman is what makes the character of Alice so believable.It is an enjoyable read, with enough depth to satisfy a discerning audience."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"this book was a little anti-climactic in the end. Still reading Elinor Lipman is a real treat! her conversations and characters are great and so real - the lines from the men in this book and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; are ones I can actually see coming out of the mouths of some men I have met. Even if this particular book didn't hook you, read another one or two and you will fall in love with Elinor Lipman's writing!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This was a thoroughly enjoyable read until the very end; I kept expecting to get something more --to find out what the future husband is up to or at least more insight into him and his motives. unfortunately the answer seems to be very two-dimensional and rushed compared to the care put in to the rest of the story. btw if they ever make this into a movie, i can see sandra bullock playing the klutzy female lead."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Did you like The Dearly Departed? Well then, you'll love The Pursuit of Alice Thrift. Alice is socially inept and therefore utterly endearing - but get this: she's a Boston intern, hoping to do plastic surgery not on the blue-nosed matrons of Beacon Hill but on the city's poor. But Alice has problems in social situations and has trouble learning how to navigate the political hurdles of inner-hospital communication. Her roommate, a hunk of a pediatric nurse named Leo, tried to help. Then add to the mix a creepy Lothario and a truly vicious senior doctor - and it's a winner. I've worked in hospitals all my life, and Lipman knows her stuff. This book rings with realistic scenarios."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This was my first Lipman novel and I loved it. As a physician fairly recently finished with residency, I couldn't get enough of Alice's trials within the medical field. And there was not an inaccuracy in the whole thing, which is unusual when non-MD authors try to write about MDs. And the portrayal of Ray was perfect. I listened to the audio version, which was great since it was read by Lipman herself -- the tone was perfect. A really enjoyable story. Spent a lot of time in my car just to hear more."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This is my favorite Elinor Lipman. My review will not dissect characters, plot or message. It is her most ridiculously funny book ever. I am in the medical profession so perhaps this added to an inside laugh about the ludicrous characters and relationships which are truly unique. I was in the blackest of moods when I read this book including surliness and sleepless nights. Blame the bleakness of winter and SAD. This book made me laugh out loud. I ordered this book to add to a very small collection of favorite books which number &lt;5!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"In addition to being peppered with funny plot twists, I found this book to be very honest about relationships in general (making friends, parental relationships, etc. in addition to the romantic ones). The book also accurately depicts Boston and its denizens, particularly the various enclaves that generally stick to their own kind. I was a little annoyed at first by Elinor Upman's seemingly over-portrayal of the main character as a socially inept intern at a Boston hospital. I found it hard to believe since no matter how socially inept a person may be, most people do have manners, even socially inept ones; I thought of the main character as really more rude than inept. However, the progression of the story as it became funnier and funnier won me over. And OK, I do know a few doctors who lack in conversational skills and are completely tactless...This book is entertaining and will have you laughing."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"A great story about how a simple, even foolish, passion can change a shy, unsociable person for the better. The story comes to life, is always entertaining, never flags and feels real. But it could have gone so much further if the hidden depths to the characters suggested initially, and carried through, were kept going at the end. Opposites don't just attract - they make each other complete, and solve each others quandries. I felt there was too much here to just accept the unsatisfying ending. Elinor: toss out the last few pages and write another 200 pages please. Isn't everyone a little bit of a con man? And isn't it the case that a con man is only persuasive if there's something real there as well? Plenty of interesting characters whose further adventures we need to hear about. Still, I found it a rewarding read with vivid details that have lingered."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"What a great afternoon I had - stuck on the runway at Logan Airport, then stuck at the gate during my connect in Milwaukee. Thanks to Elinor Lipman's most recent novel, it was all good. There are so many great things about The Pursuit of Alice Thrift, including Lipman's trademark snappy dialogue and sharp first-person perspective. And when Alice begins to transform, the story really begins to fly (even when my planes were earthbound). One tiny shortcoming: It all seems to wrap up a bit too rapidly in those final 20 pages. But by that point, I was sorry to leave the story, so maybe the rapid-fire conclusion was tainted by my own regrets. Elinor Lipman is one of my very favorites, and Alice Thrift is now one of my very favorite Lipman creations."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I hilariously laughed so many times while reading this book. Alice Thrift is a marvelous character, so wrapped up in the world of medicine and accomplishment that she doesn't know how to interact socially. To her parents' dismay, she comes to her grandmother's funeral with a fudge salesman Ray Russo, who seems to be the only person taking an interest in her. Since her sister is gay, Alice is the hope for family and grandchildren; but because of her social skills, it's a complete long shot. I was sitting in my doctor's office when I was reading about Alice's orgasm and laughed so hard that the receptionist had to know what I was reading. Perhaps it's unbelievable that she marries the guy without ever being to his house; but Alice seems so swamped with work as the intern and so pressured that we believe it's possible. The supporting characters are equally endearing. Roommate Leo Frawley, the blond nurse hunk who knows everyone is a great friend. His pregnant midwife girlfriend Meredith who keeps most of her charm for her job is terrific and well developed. The birth of FIR with Alice saving him from being born in the toilet is hysterical. Dr. Hastings who never has any kind words for anyone is a great character; the scene where Alice has to treat his ruptured disc is a riot. Sylvie Schwartz the spike-haired chief resident is a great foil. I found myself tearing through page after page, almost always surprised by the twists and turns that Elinor Lipman puts us through. The ending was not quite as happy as I'd hoped things would turn out, but this book is a real gem! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I flipped open The Pursuit of Alice Thrift and when I saw the reference to the NYTimes &quot;Vows&quot; feature there on the first page, I knew I was going to love this story. I devour &quot;Vows&quot; each Sunday, and only wish I could have a new Lipman book to read as often - even if it weren't about an improbable couple (wallflower medical intern and oafish travelling fudge salesman to New England souvenir shops) who meet when he seeks an opinion about getting a nose job. Lipman 's combination of smart, funny, unpredictable storytelling and unforgettable characters never fails. &quot;Vow&quot; to do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"My book club selected this book because we wanted something funny to read. With the turn of every page I wondered if this is where the laughs would begin. They never came. Alice is a depressed character, and perhaps it's a tribute to Lipman's writing that she manages to depress the reader. There is delight to be found in the cast of supporting characters, even though more of them are despicable than likable.On a technical note about the writing style, I found it very difficult to read the conversations when only about half of the spoken dialogue is in quotes. Backing up and rereading whole paragraphs was required to discern actions from thoughts from speech.Despite the drawbacks, &quot;The Pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; is actually a good story that draws you in. A fast read that keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next and in the end. Overall I give it three stars: I'd recommend it in paperback for beach reading this summer."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I was going to like it, but the more I read, the more hooked I became. Elinor Lipman is a marvelous writer--skillful, clever, and witty. Moreover, she writes with sophistication and honesty. Her characters, no matter how odd, always seem real. They are three-dimensional, complex, and interesting. Alice is one of her best characters yet. Even when you wanted to shake her, you understood exactly why she was acting the way she was acting. I won't synopsize the story; others have already done that. What I will say is this -- buy this book. You won't be sorry. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"What a lovely book. Snappy, well written and provocative. It's interesting how the author portrays the character as a social misfit who never quite \\"Gets it.\\" Yet she develops a romantic relationship with a man who is quite the opposite: no character at all, but able to BS with the best of them. The ironic thing is that, despite the failure of the relationship (a conclusion that is revealed in the first pages of the book), her suitor does end up helping her to grow. This book is well crafted, extremely funny, and is cloaked in one big silver lining."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I am currently listening to this book on cd and I am so thrilled to have finally found such a great witty writer. Often, it is a challenge to find books that are funny, witty, uplifting, fun and also exquistedly crafted with a marvelous use of the language. I can hardly wait to find out how this book ends and to read her other books. Ms. Lipman, I am so impressed with your creativity and writing skill!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Can an upper-middle-class doctor find love with a shady, fast-talking fudge salesman?Quirky characters and sharp wit highlight Elinor Lipman's The Pursuit of Alice Thrift.Alice Thrift, a surgical intern at a Boston hospital, is high of IQ but low in social graces. She doesn't mean to be acerbic, clinical, or blunt. Into Alice's workaholic and wallflower life comes Ray Russo, a slick traveling fudge salesman in search of a nose job and well-heeled companionship, but not necessarily in that order. Is he a con man or a sincere suitor? Good guy or bad?I enjoyed Alice and am looking for more books by Lipman. If you're tired of the same old same old, I suggest that you give Alice a try."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"You pretty much know at the beginning how the story will end. The book is more about how the characters got there.Alice is technically smart, but she's also naive and tends to take an anthropological approach to people. She's capable of developing a few social skills, but she never really had an incentive to try to before her career was threatened. She's not that much different at the end of the book, but the small gain in social skills and her attempts to reach out eventually move her from complete-outcast to nice-but-kooky.Ray, her pursuer, is a bit of a Rorschach test. My cynical husband found Ray to be horribly obnoxious all around. My naive self found Ray to be slightly irritating, but also caring and somewhat charming. You may or may not understand how Alice eventually ends up walking down the aisle with him. On one hand, he only carries around $50 bills (and so can't pay for small items) and demonstrates attitude/emotions that seems a bit weird when compared to the story he's telling. But he buys her things she needs, brings food to her, helps her make friends, and is generally very nice to her.Since it's from Alice's perspective, you don't always get all the facts, because only Alice's observations and what she finds interesting are passed along. Since you're stuck in her head and she has no self-esteem at first, the book's depressing and amusing at the same time. Although a number of events occur in the book, the drama's fairly low key (what do you expect from Alice?), so there's a sense of not much happening sometimes. I thought the second half moved a lot faster and was more interesting and funnier than the first half."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Dull, dry, depressing, and devoid of any point.

They have settled into a comfortable routine when, after a consultation with a would-be patient, Alice realizes that the man, Ray Russo, is apparently pursuing her. At first, she seems to resist his attentions, but maybe for someone like Alice, any kind of attention seems wonderful.At any rate, this widowed chocolate fudge salesman, who seemingly has lots of time on his hands, shows up with just the right kind of attention: little gifts, food, and lots of charming words.A woman more practiced in social skills might see red flags everywhere, but not Alice. Then, suddenly, after a social event with her friend Leo and a neighbor Sylvie, Alice feels vulnerable and more lonely than usual. And agrees to marry Ray.What happens over the next few weeks will tell the tale. What do we discover next? And what will those in Alice's immediate circle conclude when a big post-wedding celebration is underway? Will Alice finally discover what she needs and wants?Great characterizations and humorous situations set this novel apart from the average \\"chick lit\\" tale.The Pursuit of Alice Thriftcarries the reader along in a journey toward a greater understanding of the inner strength of a character who seems fragile.

I felt that the outcome (if not the journey there) was predictable, the characters were ALMOST quirky, and the humor was ALMOST funny.There are no flaws with Lipman's writing, her characters, or her story; I just found myself watching &quot;the pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; (both literally by Ray, and metaphorically with Alice's pursuit of her self) from the outside, hovering above the story. I was not immersed in it or emotionally attached to it. I just watched the plot unfold ambivalently.My only other criticism is that I felt, despite her social ignorance, Alice should have felt suspicious of her mysterious, over-the-top beau because she wasn't a stupid person. I felt like her naivety was too contrived, however, I was still willing to go along with the story."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"For fans of Elinor Lipman's brilliant novels, this one might well be a disappointment. I couldn't find much to root for in her protagonist, a brainy surgical intern with zero social skills, and there wasn't enough about the more interesting secondary characters to redeem the novel for me. As for Alice's unorthodox fudge salesman suitor, Ray Russo, it seemed as if Lipman couldn't decide how she felt about him. One minute he was showing incredible thoughtfulness toward Alice, and the next minute he was portrayed as a hopeless cad. Based on my past experiences with the author, however, I've given the book one more star than it really deserves. For those unfamiliar with Elinor Lipman, don't hold this one against her. Try any of her other novels, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This was my first Elinor Lipman book. It was cute and lighthearted. The central character, Alice Thrift, has a dry humor that I enjoyed. Yet it doesn't pull you in. I felt like an observer. The characters aren't 3-dimensional enough to bond with. However, that shouldn't stop you from reading it. It's entertaining and was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"What a small, dreary book! The author gives away the ending in the first few pages, so there is zero suspense. The main character is a charmless victim who doesn't drive the action - just lets events unfold. And too many of the others are stereotypes. If there were any plot I could forgive the dull characters, or if there were exciting characters the dull plot, but the combination was uninspiring. Too bad, because Lipman can write, but her readers deserve better."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I would have liked some more character development and a little more about how Alice felt about Ray and their relationship after the fact. It seems Alice gets over her social challenges rather quickly and this seems a bit unrealistic. The author could have gone a bit deeper and a bit longer and this would have made for a more well rounded reading experience. Otherwise, it is a fun, funny, at times clever and quick paced book that I read in a day and enjoyed very much."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Started reading this book and thought it was adorable - really light and fun...just when it was getting really good the story seemed to stop. What happened? I loved Inn at Lake Devine and Lipman's writing is delightful, but I was really disappointed that the last 1/3 of the book seemed to miss something."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Alice Thrift, a surgical intern, is definitely not your typical &quot;chick lit&quot; heroine. She's not gorgeous; she doesn't have a close group of girlfriends to chat about men with, in fact, she's not really actively looking for a man. When Alice meets Ray Russo one day and manages to talk him out of a nose job, she never guesses he will want to start a relationship with her. Can Alice trust Ray? Does she even like him? And why would someone outgoing like Ray like someone who's basically a social misfit like her? While I admit sometimes it was difficult to read about a main character with so little self-esteem, the others around Alice kept the book from being dragged down too much in Alice's depressed moods. Not bad, not great, but different nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Joe Keenan meets Susan Issacs in this charming novel about a likable but socially inept surgical intern who meets the man of not quite her dreams. Her suitor, a middle aged fudge salesman, pursues her with hilarious vigor, but it's her reactions to her circumstances that make the story so funny. This was the first book I've read by Elinor Lipman, and if her other books are as enjoyable as this one, I'll certainly be reading them!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I can't quite figure out what's wrong with Elinor Lipman's novels. Nothing has touched The Inn at Lake Devine. She's clearly an intellectual, as evidenced by her language, but her characters all sound the same. They're fairly intellectual too, with lots of clever wordlplay. But the plots are predictable and the characters all sound entirely the same. Lipman falls just short of being a truly comedic writer."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"If you're over the age of, say, twenty, THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT probably won't tell you anything you haven't already learned in the demanding School of Relationships.Alice Thrift, M.D., is a hapless first-year surgical resident at a Boston teaching hospital. Expected to work a zillion-hour week, she doesn't have a life outside her scrubs. She's the epitome of boring. Her only contact with the outside world is her platonic male roomy and friend, Leo, an extremely popular pediatric RN at the same institution. Alice doesn't have a boyfriend, much less a pet goldfish.One day while rotating through Plastic Surgery, Alice is consulted by a forty-year old widower, Ray Russo, seeking advice about a nose job. After being talked out of it, Ray embarks on his romantic pursuit of Thrift. Russo is a fudge salesman. Or so he says. He's also extraordinarily glib, and, obviously to everyone but Alice, up to something.The problem with THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT is threefold. The ending is revealed on page 6 when Thrift tells the reader that Ray is a &quot;LIAR&quot;, and that they had a failed marriage. One only reads further in hope of learning the sordid details. Secondly, Alice is numbingly ordinary. Having that goldfish, or even a tabletop ant farm, might have made her more interesting. And her social interactions with more socially developed friends and colleagues are only marginally amusing. Finally, since this is a story about the poor decisions a person makes to escape the throes of loneliness, it shouldn't be revelation to any reasonably contemplative individual beyond adolescence. Indeed, on finishing this novel, the average reader should be able to state, &quot;Yup. Been there; done that; will likely do it again.&quot;THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT isn't a bad book, just decidedly so-so."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This is my first Elinor Lippman novel. I perused it while waiting in line to buy Harry Potter and ended up buying it as well. It's fun, intelligent, and most of all, real. I'll try to explain.This story is a cut above the usual \\"chick lit\\" novels because the author makes such interesting choices for her characters, the setting, the plot, the tone, everything!Alice Thrift is like no other heroine and the author's technique in portraying her is one of the finest examples of the craft of showing without telling. Alice scores quite low on the emotional intelligence scale. She's lonely, isolated from herself and others, a veritable automaton. She does, however, nurse a secret crush on her roommate, a guy who everybody loves (and who loves everyone else at least for one night). This is never blatantly stated, you really have to know how to read and pick up on the clues. How refreshing!At the same time, Alice is wry and incredibly honest, ill-equipped to deal with others who are not as forthcoming and above-board. However, never fear, she is not a wilting lily needing rescue from a white knight. OH no. After bull-headedly careening into a relationship with a cad, she figures out how to make him show his true colors by the end of the story in a very satisfactory way.The details of her residency, a run-in with a prima-donna surgeon, smack of realism. You can practically smell the betadine. Unlike most fictional doctors, Alice realistically suffers from sleep deprivation and makes a mistake that isn't too bad but her overweaning desire for perfection makes it seem horrendous. I can't think of another novel that gets across the humiliation of making an unprofessional mistake so accurately.The cad, Ray Russo, reminds me of several guys that almost made it past the first date with me and went on to wreak havoc in the lives of my friends. Guys with a certain amount of charm that can't disguise the icky energy they exude. It doesn't take a bloodhound to smell the lies, but it does take some experience, something that poor Alice Thrift just doesn't have. Add to that a large dose of loneliness and it completely makes sense that Alice would get mixed up with a guy who *says* all the right things (he really does) while somehow his actions never add up. How many times have you asked your girlfriends which they believe, words or actions? Ms. Lipman portrays this dilemna with surety and finesse. She never gets heavy handed and injects a lot of fun with the quirky supporting characters such as Alice's iconoclastic neighbor.All in all, this is a fine, funny story of contemporary people dealing with human issues as old as humanity by an author who really knows her craft. She manages to take these themes of love, friendship and career to new and underused areas. I look forward to reading the rest of her novels."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Alice Thrift, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, is an unhappy intern in a Boston hospital. Her ineptitude with people is legendary. She says whatever pops into her head, no matter how inappropriate. This is not a good characteristic for a doctor, who is expected to be tactful with her patients. In addition, her romantic life has been on the back burner for years, while she works brutal hours in her pursuit of a career in medicine.Alice lives platonically with her roommate, a male nurse named Leo Frawley. Leo is extremely popular with everyone and he is thoroughly at ease with himself, qualities which Alice sorely lacks. Suddenly, a new man enters Alice's life. Ray Russo, a chocolate fudge salesman, comes to Alice for a consultation, and it soon becomes apparent that Ray may have romantic designs on the harried intern. Will Ray bring Alice out of her shell at last? Will Alice learn to think before she speaks?&quot;The Pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; is a winner. The characters, dialogue, and plot are sharp and witty, and at times I laughed out loud at a particularly amusing line. What makes this book stand out is that the reader grows to care about Alice and roots for her to succeed both in medicine and in love. Lipman brings every character to hilarious life. These include Alice's frustrated parents, her cynical friend, Sylvie Schwartz, and her unctuous and opportunistic boyfriend, Ray Russo.&quot;The Pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; is one of Elinor Lipman's best. From the first page to the last, it is fast-paced, brisk, sophisticated, sexy, and thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Thank God, more Elinor Lipman! Her latest gem is the story of the initiation into simple humanity of Alice Thrift, a brilliant but socially-challenged surgical resident who has all the instinctive people skills of a chilly stethoscope. The paradoxical inversion of Lipman's usual lucidly insightful heroines works to perfection here; Alice's cluelessness is itself a kind of x-ray vision and Lipman is as hilariously wise about men and women as ever. Alice's insanely persistent suitor, the sublimely slimy Ray Russo, is a perverse delight; watching the twists and turns of the courtship is like watching a car wreck in slow motion, but it dawns on us slowly that this is precisely the car wreck Alice needed. The novel's minor characters are realized wonderfully, and the delicious unfolding process of naive Alice's education in the intricacies of actual human beings is pure joy. I can't agree that this falls short of Lipman's usual wonders; it's simply a delightful read, laced with laugh-out-loud dialogue pitched to perfection and all the treasures of Lipman's effortlessly graceful style. She is our Jane Austen and hurray there's more of her now to read."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I have tried for a while in my mind to define just what it is that is so different about Lipman's characters in this book and her others. It's hard to define, but it's something like this: She writes about the kind of people that exist so often in real life but so rarely in books---people who are not always witty, popular, gorgeous or rich, but people with interesting and meaningful lives nontheless. So many authors seem to write about the kind of people they have probably met in writer's workshops---those who are very used to analysing their feelings and writing about them! Alice Thrift is a socially inept person, very alone in the world and very lonely. We come to understand her attraction to the slimy Ray Russo very well. And to Lipman's great credit, I think we even understand Russo a little, and are able to see him as not all bad. In addition to the wonderful characters, this book is just plain funny! So many scenes are so well done---for example, dinner at Leo's house or the birth of baby Fir. I can't remember enjoying a book more lately!"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Boston surgical intern Alice Thrift is a genius with an IQ in the stratosphere and a Harvard degree. Ray Russo is street educated dropped out. They meet when Ray pursues rhinoplastic surgery (a nose job).For a reason only he knows, sweet talking Ray courts the caustic Alice, known for her terrorist bedside manner. Shockingly, the brilliant Alice, after shunning Ray's pitch as nonsense, finally capitulates. They have sex leading to her realizing that there is more to life than work. Yet ironically her work improves and she even makes a friend Sylvie Schwartz at the hospital. When her platonic former roommate registered nurse Leo Frawley and Sylvie flirt with one another, Alice feels lonely. Vulnerable, she elopes with Ray only to learn he conned her out of cash and his \\"deceased\\" first wife lives with him. Leo and Sylvie are there for Alice, who bitterly knows she failed her first life lesson.Though Alice is not a likable character, fans will feel her loneliness and hope she makes it with someone who cherishes her and she treasures in return. Ray is a mean man while Leo and Sylvie are people the audience would like as friends. The bittersweet story line may seem rough to romance readers, but actually salutes friendship when one thinks a friend in need is a pest and prefers not to become involved, but does so anyway.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I've read several of Lipman's other novels (The Inn at Lake Devine, The Dearly Departed), but this was by far the best. The main character is Alice Thrift, M.D., medical resident and social misfit. In the first page of the book, Alice gives away the ending by reporting that her marriage didn't last and that her husband was a liar. Although these facts are disclosed up front, all is not revealed, as Alice's full story slowly unfolds over the course of the book. What really makes this novel shine is the truly clever and positively comical dialogue between Alice and the various people who show up in her life: her mother, her roommate Leo, Leo's family, Leo's girlfriend Meredith, her new-found friend Sylvie, and of course, her acquaintance, boyfriend, fiance, and eventual husband, Ray. Although I knew what would happen with Alice and Ray in the end, I thoroughly enjoyed journeying with them from the very beginning to that point."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This was my second Elinor Lipman novel (Dearly Departed was my first). Her prose is witty and effortless. Her humor is unforced but ever present. An absolutely delightful, light yet literate read."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I love the way Elinor Lipman uses the academic setting of Boston in her novels. In this particular novel, we meet Dr. Alice Thrift, a serious and smart intern who needs some help in the social department. She is wooed by a fudge salesman named Ray Russo, who doesn't quite sweet her off of her feet. But...she marries him anyway. Her tale is witty and engaging, and the other characters in the novel all do their best to help Alice become a &quot;normal&quot; woman. Her roommate Leo and neighbor Sylvie make for some clever subplots, as well. This is the best Elinor Lipman book I've read since Isabel's Bed. It's entertaining, interesting, and a delightfully compelling read."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"If you like Jane Austen, you have to read Elinor Lipman. Every reviewer says her books are funny and charming. But more than that, they're very smart. Her stories start where obvious novels end, then twist around and around until the final surprise. Also, she doesn't think a list of brand-name clothing passes for characterization. This one is my favorite, because while the heroine is a complete social klutz she's also totally honest and expects other people to be the same. Fat chance. She hasn't a clue, and it was just as hard for me to tell until the very end if her suitor would turn out to be a Darcy or a Wickham."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I agree that inn at Lake Divine was by far Lipman's best book. The rest have been entertainments that sort of slog on with uninspired dialogue and what I think are improbable scenes that have no ring of truth in them. I did like this story a lot, but using an emotionally frozen character as the point view makes things feel stilted and it's hard to feel any empathy for Alice. I didn't really believe the ending (which I won't give away) but I could see where it was going. All in all, this is an easy, enjoyable read. Better than some of the other crap out there, but not as smart or original as Lipman's finest work."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Don't be fooled by the shiny, cartoonish cover into thinking that this book is pure 'chick lit'. The writing is excellent, the characters are well wrought, the dialog pitch-perfect.So why only 3 stars? The book is too slow. It has plenty of opportunities for conflict but, like the main character Alice Thrift, it's too timid for its own good, it lingers over many silly scenes (stretched-out descriptions of dinners, conversations with assorted family members, etc).The protagonist - and narrator - Alice has a sure, consistent voice. I just didn't find her engaging enough to truly root for her."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I just finished this book I picked it up at my local dumps put and take and I really really enjoyed it!! To think I was going to pass on it I was so glad I did not. Matter of fact I am going to read more by this author. I found it very entertaining easy to read but was disappointed by the ending but oh well....I still highly recommend this read for something entertaining."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I've read some reviews where the reviewer didn't like Alice Thrift. I could not understand. I thought Alice, a first year surgical resident at a Boston hospital, was the most amusing character I've read in a long time. She's so gauche, so left-footed, so lacking in any social skills that I just had to love her. And witnessing her metamorphosis, with the help of her former roommate and her neighbor, was a pure delight. I don't think she'll ever be the world's best conversationalist, but she certainly learned to hold her own throughout the story.Elinor Lipman has written an extremely funny story about Alice Thrift, M.D. She is pursued by the fast-talking Ray Russo and it's pretty obvious from the outset that Mr. Russo is a liar and a cheat. But the story is so humorous and told so well, I just kept turning pages to see how Alice was going to get off probation at the hospital and how Ray Russo was going to get what was coming to him. The ending of the story did not disappoint! I've enjoyed all the books I've read by Elinor Lipman, but I think perhaps this was my favorite"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"In this engaging story, Lipman delves into an honest and amusing portrayal that follows a late-bloomer in her journey toward self-confidence and contentment. Alice Thrift, an unhappy and socially backward surgical resident in Boston brings her head up and out of her shell through a series of odd events--a mistake in surgery, participation in a birth and the central focus of the book: her doomed relationship with an unsuitable salesman. She finds she's not so weird and unlikable with her newfound friendship with two gutsy, dedicated hospital mates. The details about Boston will enchant anyone in the area. It's always entertaining to read about fictional characters that go to real places you've found yourself in once or twice. This fun, light read deals with choices in life and love. Lipman creates genuinely warm and hilariously zany characters just like those you might pass in your daily life. Although she bears a tough outer shell as a brainy doctor who can't seem to make any friends, Lipman makes Alice Thrift someone you grow to root for in the end."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Alice was so boring that it sounded phony. Lipman had a little potential with this story but never expanded on any of it. Probably I won't indulge in any more Lipman stories."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"The characters in this novel are what keep the reader interested. You enjoy hearing about them and at times feel like they are just like people you know. Elinor Lipman has been one of my favorite authors for years. I was not dissapointed with her latest work."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"This is a must for those who can appreciate intelligent characters and plot schemes.We meet Alice Thrift, who is an intern at a hospital in Boston. She eventually wants to work with the underpriviledged doing surgery on those in 3rd world nations, correcting birth defects, burns, and such. She is not like any character I have read about in the chick lit genre. She is very intelligent, but has a low emotional IQ. She can be funny without knowing it and her mother thinks that she has Aspergers Syndrome (a mild form of autism) because she is not very social and doesn't make eye contact very often.She meets Ray Russo, a character who is talked out of Rhinoplasty, by accident. It's not that she didn't think he should have the surgery, it is because she was anti-plastic surgery.. she was waiting to perform surgeries for more noble purposes.He seems taken with her and asks her out. She accepts, but probably doesn't know why. He is not good looking, but he is big on flattery and can be charming. He also has some habits such as calling her &quot;doc&quot; every chance he gets, and constantly bringing up the fact that she is a doctor in mixed company. You would think that he is very proud of that fact.Their strange courtship aside, Alice comes in contact with other interesting people: her roommate Leo and his midwife girlfriend Meredith, her new neighbor Sylvie, who's &quot;hair was spiky, the ends the color of Cheddar Cheese and the roots dark in a fashion I knew was deliberate.&quot; She is also an intern at the same hospital, strangely enough, and they become fast friends. Her only friend besides, Leo, in fact. Sylvie helps her through her strange relationship with Ray, the problems that come about later.The main point is: Ray: is he to be trusted? Can anyone really trust a fudge salesman? Only you can ever know for sure by reading this book, but he has some sketchy habits that would make a normal person doubt him. Is Alice a normal person? Not exactly. Therefore, she is the perfect candidate for the Ray Russo relationship. Craziness ensues!The characters are real as if Elinor Lipman (the author) went through this experience herself. Highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"The typical Elinor Lipman book involves a discovery or rediscovery of a relationship from the main character's past: a missing parent or sibling, old high school friends, acquaintances or enemies. In Alice Thrift, though, she has created a main character without a past--she was too busy studying to have one--and thus Lipman explores an entirely new theme: how to create a personality for the first time in your late 20's.As always Lipman effortlessly creates an environment that feels both familiar and real, here a teaching hospital in Boston. Aware of her lack of bedside manner or really any empathy for other people, Alice is frustrated and alone. She doesn't realize that the people who care about her--first her roommate Leo and then her hallmate Sylvie and a kindly OB--are the ones who are helping her to develop a personality and interests, and instead credits the changes in her to Ray Russo, the obviously evil patient turned suitor (we learn they will marry and the marriage will not last before we learn anything else; Lipman is interested in characters, not plot twists). Nobody loves Raymond (sorry, I couldn't resist), but Alice's huge blindspots where her personality should be give her no defenses to him, and she is unable either to resist him or to ask herself the most obvious questions about his behavior. Yet she runs away first from Leo when he turns out to have a girl friend (who is obviously wrong for him, but--in a twist that shows Lipman is writing about people, not &quot;characters&quot;--nonetheless a good person who helps Alice discover her own strengths as a doctor) and from Sylvie when she flirts with Leo. Yet she only discovers that running from Ray is in her best interests at the last moment. It is a tribute to the self-confidence and self-awareness she has developed over the course of the novel that she is able to turn the tables on Ray even before Sylvie and Leo bust him for his lies.This is a far less crowded novel than Lipman's previous effort, The Dearly Departed, and while not as passionate or fully-realized as The Inn at Lake Devine (which is simply a masterpiece), it is a small, but wonderful achievement in its own right."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"Alice Thrift is beautifully plotted, extremely funny, and shows a real step up in the skill of this already hugely skillful novelist. Lipman restores the dignity and the smarts to the term &quot;light entertainment,&quot; which lately seems to have come to mean bad writing with wide margins and teeny tiny chapters. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh some more."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Alice Thrift","review":"I had no idea it was going to be this good!

An introduction and footnotes strive to clarify references, but the vast bulk of In The Saddle With The Texans simply presents the communications themselves for scholars and amateur or professional historians to contemplate. Most of the actual missives are brief, such as \\"Maj. Thos [Thomas] Johns Brigade Q.M. will turn over to Lieut. E.W.

The maps were so small that I needed a magnifying glass to read. It would have been nice to have had a Texas map showing all of the counties that the soldiers were from.

And what literature exists has largely concentrated on the irregular forces operating in Northern Arkansas. Even most of the Trans-Mississippi forces were used in other places (Such as the Louisiana Tigers fighting at Antietam where they suffered 61% casualties.).After the attack on Fort Sumter in 1861 the Governor of Texas authorized the raising of regiments for the new Confederate Government. The Twelfth Texas Cavalry under Colonel William Henry Parsons was one such unit. Their first battle was against a foraging party on May 19. This was a battle of little overall consequence, but it was the first, and it was a victory.From then on until 1865 the Texans were constantly on the move around Arkansas. The book consists mostly of copies of orders and reports that cover the movements of the unit. It is fascinating to see the level of detail that illustrates what a military unit of the time was doing. An amazing amount of effort was spent on foraging for supplies, buying horses, sending men to perform some task or whatever. A surprisingly small amount of time was actually spent fighting. These combined documents present a direct first hand account of the activities of a unit.These documents are a direct representation of primary sources, transcribed from the original hand written documents."},{"Title":"In the Saddle with the Texans: Day-by-Day with Parsons's Cavalry Brigade, 1862--1865","review":"This book is a simple reproduction of most of the Official Records (OR's) material regarding Parson's.It is a good source for reference material, but does not contain much original material in assessing Parsons.

When I embark on a review with this objective, I almost always find something. In this case, I did not.This doesn't mean this is a bad book, only that it may not have that much to offer to someone who is already steeped in Italian culinary lore. It is inferior to, for example, David Downie's book on Roman cooking as a snapshot of an Italian regional cuisine. It is less genuine on a personal level than Mario Batali's \`Simple Italian Food'. It is less of a cookbook than Lydia Bastianich's two books accompanying her PBS series on Italian food and Italian-American food. I will recommend this book as a source of classic Tuscan recipes over books by Pino Luongo, who clearly states that most of his recipes are original with him or his restaurant staff. They are not Tuscan; they are inspired by the Tuscan cuisine.Part of the problem is that, unlike Lydia's books, this one has recipes in chapters which follow the episodes on the TV show rather than recipes organized by course as is typical of most Italian cookbooks. This awkwardness is not offset by a supplementary table of contents listing all recipes by food or by course.Another part of the problem seems to be that unlike Mario's book, the experiences of Tuscan culture are all second hand. Most life experiences are not of the author but of the owner and employees at the Tuscan villa, Spannocchia, at which the PBS crew is housed. Ms. Espositio's experiences feel like a tourist's experiences.One thing that impressed me about the creation of this book is the number of people it takes to put on a cooking show, even on PBS. There must be a dozen principle contributors at least in the Acknowledgments. In comparison, Julia Child started her show at the Boston PBS station with nothing more than her husband, a cameraman, a soundman, a producer, and herself.I really wish I would have seen the PBS series on which the show is based, as I am sure that would have increased the value of the book for me by two or threefold. My experience with books by the \`Frugal Gourmet', Jeff Smith show that books like this can be very attractive if you are not familiar with the wider world of cookbooks. Twelve (12) years ago, I thought Jeff Smith was something special. Now I know he was simply a decent communicator with a gimmick. I don't even think he was especially frugal. Since this book does accompany a TV show, I am really surprised at the dull photographs. The sepia coloring even seems to obscure some details in the picture.There is no problem with the recipes in this book. Many classic Tuscan dishes are here and all of the recipes give competent instructions on how to prepare them.I would recommend this book to anyone who plans to travel in Tuscany anytime soon. The book has a strong travelogue flavor about it and its recommendations about where to eat in Tuscany are not doing anyone any good unless you go there. The price of the book rescues it from a below average rating. As I stated at the outset, the book provides what is expected and nothing more. My only regret is that unlike many other regions of Italy, I have yet to find a good cookbook that effectively explores this cuisine."},{"Title":"Ciao Italia in Tuscany: Traditional Recipes from One of Italy's Most Famous Regions","review":"I have seen many Ciao Italia shows with Mary Ann and her love of food and easy steps can make anyone an Italian cook.

Cathay Che's literary voice is a bit too gaga for its subject for my taste. She oversells it a bit in other words, which makes it feel like fan magazine stuff and not really a biography for adults. Still, it's Debbie and Blondie, so even a poorly written book is better than none! Sadly however, the photo sections are very skimpy for a band whose appeal was so visual. What the market really needs now is something along the lines of \\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\\", a coffee table book on Blondie that is mostly images by different photographers. Are you listening, Taschen?"},{"Title":"Deborah Harry: Platinum Blonde","review":"Cathay Che is obviously, first and foremost, a Blondie-and more specifically a Deborah Harry-fan who is also a New York scene writer of some accomplishment. She tells the Debbie Harry story about as well as anyone other than Deb herself could. I think it presents an accurate picture of an individual far more influential and musically significant than most people in America, including Deb herself, realize.My disappointments with Che are few: she gives superfans and scenesters a great deal of space, rather than engaging individuals who really should be regarded as Harry's peers and colleagues. Che appears to have made no effort to have spoken with, say, Madonna, or Deb's 'Heavy' costar (and former MM roommate) Shelley Winters. (Che's assertion, in the book's first chapter, of the feelings &quot;all men&quot; have for the original blond bombshell is also mildly offensive to me.)Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, and Pete Townshend have all publicly talked about Debbie and a paragraph from any of them would have been invaluable, as would commentary from, say, cinematographer Sam Shaw (who was still alive then and in NYC) or any of the other 'old schoolers' Harry interacted with in the '70s and '80s at the tail end of their careers.Eventually, Harry has said, she will write herself of her own life, and that will probably be the definitive work on her. Until then, Che's book will stand the most significant book on Deborah Harry, and it has much to recommend it."},{"Title":"Deborah Harry: Platinum Blonde","review":"Before Gwen Stefani, Madonna and Courtney Love, the original and premier rock blonde of the world was Deborah Harry. So it's a given that she would be adored as an icon of rock, punk and pop music -- but does Cathay Che have to adore her quite so much?\\"Platinum Blonde\\" is a useful, interesting look at the life and work of Debbie Harry -- adopted at three months into the New Jersey Harry family, Debbie later went on to the legendary Max's Kansas City, and then to become the frontwoman of the hit punk band called Blondie. (Contrary to legend, SHE is not Blondie herself) Later, when the band broke up, Debbie embarked on a solid solo career as a singer and actress.Biographies are always a lot better when the subject goes along with it, or even helps. Debbie Harry did both, and that means that the details are plentiful and the background is as well-researched as it possibly can be. In addition, Che has some very exclusive interviews with Harry and her bandmate Chris Stein. These interviews are intelligent, insightful, and give a great deal of insight into Harry, her career, and her band, and are without a doubt the best part of the book.What is more, the book has a great deal of other input on Harry and Co., most of which add to the overall \\"feel\\" of the book. (Except for one mildly icky story about a photographer getting a naughty glimpse in one of his photos). And Che has a great deal of enthusiasm for her subject, and the impact Blondie and Harry had on the world.The main problem is Che's rosy lenses -- it's understandable that a fan would get a bit adoring of Harry, especially after interviewing her in person for this. However, it gets a bit tiresome to be told repeatedly what a great band Blondie was, and what a flawlessly amazing human being Debbie Harry is, and so on and so forth. I adore Harry too, yet not quite that much.However, Che's excellent research and solid writing make up somewhat for the gushy tone; most die-hard fans can't write anywhere near this well. \\"Platinum Blonde\\" has one major flaw, but is otherwise an excellent biography of one of rock's first ladies."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This book did a great job explaining to me not only *what* is Web services is and *why* I should use it but also *how* to build it using Weblogic and Axis. This is something I found lacking in the other books. I found the JAXRPC, JAXB, JAXR, SAAJ and JAXM chapters and the case study showing how to make all these API together working in a real web services is &quot;very helpful&quot; for a developer like me. In short: A great book on Java web services,in a style of writing that a developer understands and also making it as a fun read."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"Very nice book. I have been following some great technolgies over the last 10 years. With Web services, I was overwhelmed with the bundle of various APIs, tools, standards, specifications that emerged. I picked up this book since it looked like the right fit for a hard core Java developer wanting to learn web services and I was right on.I think the book is a great handbook for developers who want to program prototypes. I have reused lots of code from the examples, which showed me exactly how things need to be done.This is one of the only books I have seen that had a complete case study using things like UDDI and JAXR, which was the part that puzzled me the most.I am looking forward to more books by this trio. I like your style and clarity. Keep it up."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"I purchased this book along with Java Web Services Architecture and both are of high quality. Written by top-notch Sun employees, this book will teach you everything you need to know about developing web services.While I liked the Java Web Services Architecture book a little better, this one is better priced. Buy this book if you are price sensitive."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"After reading the complete book i got the impression that the only possible audince for this book are students. For getting just basic understanding on Web Services.Despite the volume, size and weight, this book is no more than introductory to the basic concepts of WS. Any themes that are slightly beyond basic usage of standards and APIs are not decribed well.The title does not match contents.Security. This is very little in the book about real security. Again all limited by SAML and other standards. Nothing on .NET WS security, ws-security, 3d party vendors. Difference is that standards in WS security little have with real deployments.Architecture. This is not book about architecture of Web Services. Architecture focuses not how this works but what we build. In this sense this book have nothing in this extent.Describing standards and APIs does not define architecure apparently.Industry domaina are not covered. Generally business part of WS is not covered. Where is BizTalk, ebXML, XML databases?Nothing about RDF and Semantic Web as well.Bottom line is that i can recommend you the book only if you want to study Web Services from academic point of view being a student. This is not a book for professional developer, engineer, manager or software architect."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"I bought this book with less hopes, but this book really excited me with good lot of technologies and examples. Although it discusses about BEA Weblogic and Apache Axis in couple of chapters, this book is very much Pro-SUN Web services book which drives you more in to Sun's JWSDP especially JAX* APIs. The authors tried their best to convince all J2EE Pros including the big crowd of Weblogic and Apache fans before making their introduction to Sun's JAX APIs. I was surprised to see Weblogic 7.0 did'nt have JAX* API support, but the authors are right. The Microsoft .NET chapter shows you how to create .NET Service client but not Microsoft .NET service, this shows the authors interest in promoting Sun technologies. Another surprising thing, In the security chapter the authors illustrate XML Encryption and Signature techniques using IBM Security suite. Now you don't doubt, Why Simon Phipps endorsed this book.With Web services specifications still evolving and changing everyday, no book would be good forever ! And I also believe no book would be good enough to keep for the next 3 years. But if you have a Web services project in the next six months which involves Java/J2EE and Microsoft .NET, this book is your best companion and the code examples are enough to demonstrate your show."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"I call this book quite outstanding than other books because I find examples and useful techniques for all Web services scenerios. Examples are well illustrated with step by step instructions. The examples cover most popular Java Web services servers like Axis, Weblogic, .NET and Tomcat/Java Webservices pack. This book also teaches the complete basics of SOAP, WSDL and UDDI. If you are developing Java/J2EE based Web services using Weblogic or Axis, I am sure the examples will help you. It has a chapter on Microsoft .NEt and building .NET clients for Apache Axis, which helped me a lot. If you are a J2EE developer who want to learn how to build web services, No doubt this book will be a good buy."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"While there are lot of books dealing with Web Services using Microsoft Technoligies, I was looking for a good book which would cover Web Services using Java. I found this book doing a good job to detail out Web Services development using Java."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This book is okay as a starting-point in learning Java web services. It attempts to cover a wide range of topics but fails to expand on some subtleties crucial to the understanding of these topics. One obvious example of this is the distinction between document-literal binding style and document-based web services. The book touchs on both concepts but stops right there without any explanations on how these concepts are related or not related, what are the implications of choosing a binding-style from the perspective of a web services developer or an admin, whether the choice of a binding-style determines the programming model, the API set, etc.The authors tend to be loose from time to time with their use of terminologies and concepts. Admittedly, part of this is due to the state of the art of web services itself. That being said, some of the comments in the book are quite confusing and misleading. One example is found on page 454 of the book \\"JAX-RPC is also a best-fit solution over JAXM ... where high performance ... are defined as the key requirements.\\" This is simply contrary to the common wisdom that loosely-coupled messaging applications usually out-perform their tightly-coupled RPC style counterparts when \\"performance\\" is defined as the system throughput. RPC style apps may offer a more predictable response time at the cost of inferior throughput. However, this point was never expanded on with any further information. Similar comments can be found throughout the book.The writing style of the book is quite verbose and repetitive. Quite often the same point can be found twice or more in one paragraph.With its shortcomings, the book is still a decent introduction to web services. However, I would recommend supplementing with other online sources. There are many wonderful technical articals on SUN's blueprint site, IBM and Oracle's developer communities."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This book is provides a comprehensive overview of creating web services with Java. The first part composed of two chapters is an introduction to web services. It portrays web services as the natural progression of distributed computing. The second part covers architecture and technologies like SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, as well as interoperability with .Net. The third part includes important Java APIs for XML (like JAXB, JAXP, etc.) and the Java Web Services Developer Pack. The fourth part covers web services security. The fifth part is basically an introduction to the Sun Net Open Environment (Sun ONE). For the most part each topic has sufficient depth, but for instructional purposes a somewhat different organization (i.e. progressive concept building) would make it an easier read, but perhaps less valuable as a reference.The book contains numerous code examples and diagrams that depict how things are supposed to work. A couple of interesting pieces are the Case Study using JWSDP from Sun and the Further Reading appendix. Since JWSDP is a free download from Sun, it is a good way to experiment with web services without a large investment. The further reading idea is a good one that is not used frequently enough. Some books have a bibliography, but where do you go to further your knowledge?Overall, I felt that the book was repetitious and wordy. However, it covers many topics that are important to success in Java Web Services. There is so much repetition that a reader could probably just drop into a chapter on a topic of interest and begin reading. While many developers focus on how their particular vendor delivers web services, if you want to know how the technologies are supposed to work together, this book is a good resource, but you may not want to start here. At 700+ pages, this volume could be quite daunting."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This Book was written way back in 2002 and the examples were implemented on Weblogic 7.0.Weblogic server 7.0 does not exist today which means if you are trying to run the examples(on the latest WL server) in the book you will have to change the dependencies in the ANT(provided in the examples) according to the configurations of the current server you will be using.This would mean more Overhead and waste of time changing the ANT files and the configurations of the Server apart from learning the already huge topics of Web services.I wonder what the authors were doing all these days without updating the book.Definetly,NOT recommend this book for those new to Java and J2EE."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This book is a great tool for developing web services for Java users. The authors presumed that their readers has the basic conceptual and programming knowledge of implementing Web applications using Java and XML. A book for all Web services enthusiasts, architects, and developers who perceive Java as their platform of choice for Web services development and deployment.Developing Java Web Services is organized into five parts, with exclusive chapters concentrating on the Web services technologies. Part One introduces the reader to Web services by taking an evolutionary journey of distributed computing and the emergence of Web services, and then it devotes an exclusive overview on Web services, addressing its motivation, characteristics, industry standards and technologies, strategies and solutions, and its benefits and limitations; Part Two walks through the different Web services standards and technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI with real-world examples; Part Three exclusively focuses on Java APIs for Web services: JAXP, JAXB, JAXM, JAX-RPC, and JAX-R, and their reference implemetation on JWSDP; Part Four covers Web services security concepts and various security standards and technologies; and lastly, Part Five introduces the reader to the Sun ONE initiative and provides information on Sun ONE tools and platform servers for implementing Web services.Let me borrow Simon Phipps' foreword on this book, &quot;this book is a great tool for your springboard to the future of how to make the Net work.&quot; Simon Phipps is Chief Technology Evangelist at Sun Microsystems, Nagappan and Skoczykas are both Enterprise Java Architects at sun Java Center, and Sriganesh is a Technology Evangelist at Sun Microsystems."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"The real differentiator of this book is that its focus on how to build Web services from Java and J2EE to solve real-world problems, rather than reproducing the Web services specifications and tutorials itself. As such, it's a much more pragmatic approach to building Web services using popular web services implementations (like Weblogic, Axis and Sun JWSDP) than the other books I've read on the subject.The author starts by taking high-level perspective along with real hands-on examples on the Web services and its building blocks, building web services architecture showing the different design considerations that need to be applied when choosing whichJ2EE technologies to use. A case study (ACME Web services) is described and elaborated at Chapter 11 of the book, showing how can you build a complete Web services solution putting together with JAX APIs (This is missing in other Java web services books).The book also provides a load of examples, which I found useful for my projects. Overall, the book serves well for a Java programmer who wish to build Web services solutions, not just understand the technology."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"There is a lot of hype these days about Web services and using Java Web services, there is also a lot of FUD. I'd been in the fear camp for a while. I tried using diffrent Web services vendors with vendor specific APIs before, but didn't quite understand what was going on. I'd heard differing descriptions of Web services vendors API architecture, and horror stories about performance.This book takes the mystery out of Web services, it clearly lays out the learning path from state of the industry, vendor implementations and emerging standard APIs. This book lays a solid foundation by playing with examples of Web services aND discussing Web services building blocks with ready-to-use examples. The authors are very clever presenting this book to addressing the popular vendor implementations (BEA Weblogic, Apache Axis, Systinet, IBM WSDK, Microsoft .NET) and then anchoring on the new Sun Web services Pack (JWSDP) with JAX APIs (JAX-RPC, JAXM, SAAJ, JAXP, JAXB).This book is a very promising hands-on guide for those want to take a swim on code and wish to demostrate web services. It delivers a step-by-step instructions guide on how-to implement Web services Architecture from J2EE components, how to build security and how to create Java WS Interoperability with .NET.I highly recommend this book for the Java developers who wish to make their hands wet with Java Web services."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"...Of the 12 or so books I have purchased this past year this one is simply the worst. Members of our web services study group have lost interest in part to the overly obtuse, repetitive and boring style of this book.Themes that could be concisely and clearly stated in one or two paragraphs are unnecessarily drawn out over 10-12 repetitive paragraphs. Code examples are sometimes not clear, or othertime simply won't work as written. For example, an example of XSLT makes no mention that it relies on a bit of XML presented [previously in the book.] The authors are equally careless in their use of language : \\"A tag is considered to be an empty tag if it stands by itself without any attributes.\\" This is wrong! An empty tag can have attributes but there is no body text in the element. In addition, many of the XML examples have incorrect indentation, making them difficult to read. And there are so many typographical mistakes that simple passages become challenging to read (e.g. referring to \\"the Price attribute\\" when they mean the \\"currency\\" atribute, and so on).I don't hold the authors fully responsible for the poor writing and inconcise language; it appears that the editors have been lax in their oversight. Perhaps the book was simply rushed out the door in order to be one of the first Java web services books. Many of the other books that I have purchased are now on my bookshelf and are invaluable reference guides. \\"Developing Java Web Services\\" will gather dust in the back of my closet. It has been a disappointment."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This is by far the best book on Java web services published so far. Unlike other books this one doesn't waste any chapters with theoretical content. Almost all the chapters are covered in depth with examples. I especially like the fact that the book does not waste time on explaining the Sun Web services pack repeatedly. This book keeps the focus on web services technologies by doing the coding in a notepad like environment-where you write all the code, make mistakes, stumble, and in the process, learn. If you have a web services project to demonstrate this is a best companion to jump start your work."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"I purchased this book last week and was happy to see the quality of material covered within the book.

This book is good and worth the money."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"I'm only 100 pages into this book so maybe things will change, but Iwanted to post my initial impressions of this book to warn othersconsidering a purchase.This book has two primary problems which make it very difficult toabsorb:1) The authors tend to repeat themselves extensively. For example,pages 28-38 describe various web-services related technologies(XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc.). Pages 46-50 repeat the sameoverview of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI etc. I get the feeling that twodifferent people wrote these two sets of pages with neitherconsulting the other. Thus we have duplicate information thatwastes a reader's time.2)The examples are hard to follow. The first end-to-end web servicesexample begins in chapter 3. From page 41 to 95, it is difficultto keep track of all the steps the authors chose to implement fortheir example. In the end (page 95), we find this quote: \\"If everythingworks successfully, you will get the output shown in ...\\" Thisgives me the impression that the authors themselves had troublegetting their examples to work.When I purchased this book, I was looking for a good, non-repetitiveoverview of web services, related Java techonologies, and an overviewof other applicable technologies. I wanted to see concise examples ofend-to-end systems working together. Unfortunately, this book has notmet these goals."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This is an ideal book - with the right mix of code, examples and detailed explanation of Web services technologies. Books with too much theory drown you with diagrams, whereas you want to hit it asap.

It shows a live example of Web services - showing how to create, publish, locate and invoke web services using JAX APIs - JAX-RPC, SAAJ, JAXR etc.In addition, this book has a wealth of ready to use examples using Weblogic 7.0, Apache Axis 1.0, JWSDP 1.1, IBM Web services security kit and Microsoft .NET. The examples walksthrough from how to set up environment, implement code, ANT build scripts and finally how to deploy and execute them in the target environment.Overall I found this to be the best JAVA WEB SERVICES book on the market.

This book along with Morgan Kaufmann's \\"Java Web Services Architecture\\"(which I also purchased) would provide complete reference for web services.The only drawback is that the book covers JWSDP1.1, but there's no big deal about it 'coz there's little difference between the current & previous versions of JWSDP."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"This book is a straightforward text, which Web services beginners and intermediates should enjoy learning from.

The book has some advanced topics that maybe more appropriate for architects who focus on building web services oriented systems. A great case study is used to demonstrate how the pieces fit together.Other key chapters focus on Web services architecture, JAX APIs and an extensive chapter on security.

Pretty much everything is repeated over and over again. When you repeat something over and over again, it becomes painful to read and comprehend. Repetition also increases the number of pages. May be the publishers feel they are providing value to readers by giving them a thick fat repetitive book? When you repeat something repeatedly, you lose the gist of what the person is trying to convey. Repetition makes the discussion verbose. I don't particularly find verbosity and redundancy as positive qualities of a book. The authors also have not scoped the topics to cover well. They are all over the place trying to touch upon in little depth a wide range of topics.

This is the ONLY JAVA WEBSERVICES BOOK which I read so far which demonstrates a WEB SERVICES ARCHITECTURE with all components together with working code.I am sure Java developers and architects will all get value out of this book because it provides the working content for building Web services using the J2EE platform by walking through the Web services development from architecture, design, implemention and deployment.

Practical. Reliable.&quot; and that is a good description of the book. It covers the current state of Java APIs for web services, it gives plenty of well thought out examples, and it provides enough information to actually make the alphabet soup of acronyms understandable. The book starts with an introduction to web services. The next section covers web services architecture and the standard technologies of SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. Interoperability with non-Java applications is demonstrated with a .NET example. The book is written by three Sun employees so it does tend to be a bit Sun-centric as the next sections shows. The Java Web Services Developers Pack (JWSDP) is given plenty of coverage. JAXP, JAXB, JAXM, JAX-RPC, JAXR, may be just acronyms when you get this book but after reading the six chapters covering the JWSDP they will be technologies that you understand. A case study wraps up the six chapters putting the whole thing together. The book ends with a chapter on security and a look at Sun ONE. The book is full of examples demonstrating how to use each of these technologies. When you read a line such as, &quot;The real fun is understanding how the EncryptDecrypt class works,&quot; you know you are dealing with authors who love code.

I was quite disappointed in this book, which is both repetitive, drawn-out and shallow in its coverage of web services. Although the book covers most aspects of web service development using JWSDP, as a result almost nothing is covered in great detail, and the book's 700+ pages ultimately provide a dreary drawn-out overview of web services better found elsewhere.I am now using Apache Axis to create web services, trying to figure out how to create stateful web services.

I expect them to show much better expertise on web services, even I admit this may not be the book's intension.1. The book is like an aggregation of tutorials on basic stuff of each topic. There is no technical depth and you are far from building practical web services after looking at their examples.2. The concepts are not well explained. Easy topics are repeated while important topics are ignored. It's hard to learn something you don't already know.3. The book is not well reviewed.

This promising book explains the Web services architecture and its core concepts from beginning to end with solid examples. The content and examples are outstanding and the book flow is &quot;paced&quot; perfectly. I felt like I had strong grasp of each concept at the end of each chapter which makes it a nice learning tool, and a good reference for obtaining cut-and-paste sample code for variety of scenarios.This is the only Java Web services book that illustrates a full-featured Web services case study example which demonstrates all core components (SOAP, WSDL and UDDI) working together. This makes a perfect ready-to-use example in a real-world project. This book teaches how to use the core Java Web services APIs (JAX-RPC, JAXM, SAAJ, JAXP, JAXB) in depth with examples and plus more it also illustrates how to build Web services using BEA Weblogic, Apache Axis, CASTOR and IBM Web services Security kit in Web services.In addition to the full-featured Web services architecture case-study using JAX APIs, there are 3 ready-to-use projects, which demonstrates:- How to build Web services from existing J2EE components.- How to create Java Web services Interoperability using Microsoft .NET.- How to build security for Java Web services using IBM security kit.The end result, you will find this book as a solid text on Java Web services today that provides excellent hands-on examples for Web services architecture in a remarkably readable and in a very engaging developer perspective."},{"Title":"Developing Java Web Services: Architecting and Developing Secure Web Services Using Java","review":"With 2 other web services books on my shelves, I think this book is the one that covers most topics and I consider it a great buy.

It's absolutely not for people new to web services. I bought this book after I saw others' review. I have three years of Java programming experience and know basic knowledge of XML. According to the author of this book, I am the right reader. After reading the first few chapters, I was very disappointed. For example, it repeatly explains some web service terms in this chapter, again next section and again next section...using hard-to-understand expression. It seems the authors want to put more pages onto the book. It's really annoying. While when I need more techinical detailed explanation(for example in SOAP chapter), it does not provide but only put there a bunch of sample code. Unless you already have pretty good knowledge about SOAP, you won't be able to understand them. I have to be careful to others' review in the future and better look at the book at bookstore before buying it. Anyway, unless you already have experience in Web Services, this book wastes your time.

It's not a particularly long book, surprisingly, with only 190 some odd pages in it. With that being said, not much is left out here, either. It's by all means complete. There are chapters on the four seasons - on the mountains and the forests. Nature herself.Merton even likens a mountain to sainthood, seeing God\`s creative beauty and wonder all throughout nature. If you have ever been to the Abbey of Gethsemani, you may understand why that is, too. The monastery is surrounded by absolutely stunning and expanding landscape, the perfect spot for the kind of reflection and introspection Merton apparently did in this work. He urges us to be engaged with nature. That probably means for us modernists to get out there off of our sometimes lazy butts and take a walk; go ride our bike. Whatever it is feel your connection to nature in a very raw sense. It opens up the sunshine that is already within. Merton's helpful finger pointing us the way in this work on how wonderful nature really is, serves as truly a great inspiration to do just that."},{"Title":"When the Trees Say Nothing: Writings on Nature","review":"Compiled and edited by Kathleen Deignan ( Sister of the Congregation of Notre Dame), enhanced with drawings by John Giuliani (Founder and Overseer of The Benedictine Grang, a spiritual center in West Redding, Connecticut), and featuring an informative foreword by Thomas Berry, When The Trees Say Nothing: Writings On Nature is an impressively thoughtful and thought-provoking collection of commentaries by the late Thomas Merton (1915-1968), an influential Catholic monk, poet, spiritual writer, and social activist. The commentaries, observations, and writings are superbly organized into eight chapters: Seasons; Elements; Firmament; Creatures; Festivals; Presences; and Sanctuary. These, along with the postscript &quot;Sophia,&quot; a section of notes, a list of abbreviations, and a bibliography, combine in a movingly written, enthusiastically recommended volume of readings that are appropriate and spiritually rewarding for readers of all faiths who seek to experience the sacred and the sacramental in God's handiworks."},{"Title":"When the Trees Say Nothing: Writings on Nature","review":"Kathleen Deignan's When the Trees Say Nothingis a fresh rendition of Thomas Merton's writings evoked from creation.

Anyone, regardless of age, let me qualify that, anyone in Jr. High or older, can learn something about themselves, friend, partner, neighbour or loved one after completing this book. Somers does a masterful job in systematically outlining her life as a young person. She utilizes Sharon W-Cruz' model of the dysfunctional family very well. Anyone in denial should not read this book. The illusions of chemical dependency are stripped and the facades are challenged. We are not talking about some dozzy fake blond we saw on '3's company'. We are talking about the ghosts that Suzanne allowed to come out of her closet. She has the academic ability to do what former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy who was victimized by his Junior hockey coach (Graham James) has not been able to do...yet. Good for her. People, kids and victims need to read this."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"Suzanne Somers' book, Keeping Secrets, is written in a straightforward style that is very easy to relate to and makes the reader feel like hiding in a closet just as Suzanne and her siblings did during their unbearable childhood, suffered at the hand of a rock-bottom alcoholic father. Suzanne is huanted by the sickness of alcoholism and co-dependency well into adulthood. For anyone who is a child of an alcoholic, this book is highly recommended. The triumph of the entire family over alcohol and disfunction is inspiring."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"With an intention to skim this book, I became engrossed in what Suzanne Somers had to say about her life before fame and living with a severely alcoholic parent.She shares vivid details she endured at the hands of her father, low self-esteem, shame, fear, anger, violence, craziness, hostility, chaos and more. As she describes her pain and emotional feelings, she backs up what she says to give the reader some better understanding of her behavior or that of the alcoholic.One example is when her father ripped her nicest clothes she wore while attending school. With a heavy object, she almost cracked his head open and feared he was dead; she blamed herself and begged that he not die. Asking herself why she reacted with violence over simple clothes, her response was that the clothes were a mask that hid who she really was and a mask to the shameful crazy sick homelife. She helps the reader by explaining thoughts and actions taken.The story begins when she was a child and it follows Suzanne after she left home to reveal a chaotic financially struggling young woman with a kid, early marriage, affairs, abortion, therapy, and so on. Fortunately, she and Alan Hamel, a Canadian producer, resolved their edgy relationship combining two families and they lived happily ever after, since she is still married to him as of 2007.Suzanne's mother was not a drinker, but too weak and powerless to intervene. Back in those days it was easier to let drinkers just be drinkers.But I am baffled how a mother allows a man to be cruel to her children, to destroy their spirit and soul? I'm quite sure the mother's esteem is broken down too. To me, there can not ever be any excuse to torment children.The final notes Suzanne Somers shares come from a dinner/entertainment act sponsored by the Alcoholics Anonymous, initiated by her sister Maureen, who has recovered. Two brothers followed the path of their father also. Somers feels grateful that her entire family has recovered or is in the process. This book was published in 1988 and her father had been free of alcohol for 10 years.This is a very well-written book that helps to understand the family dynamics and the troubled alcoholic....

Unfortunately I can't do that so I would like to express my gratitude with this review. I read the book &quot;Keeping Secrets&quot; because it is about being a child of an alchoholic which I am. Little did I know that this book would open my eyes to the disease of alchoholism from which I myself suffer and lead me into the rooms of Alchoholics Anonymous which was what saved her family. I have been sober now for 31/2 years since I finished the last page of her book and went to an AA meeting. I have been given a second chance at life.

Suzanne did a superb job in how she handled the many delicate issues in this book. She spoke very frankly about many aspects of her life. Not just about her alcoholic family, but about her husband Alan Hamel, her two stepchildren, her son Bruce, and her Three's Company co-stars. Suzanne has been through a lot in her life, and it is inspirational in that she is a survivor, she is a smart businesswoman, caring person, loving mother, and most of all, NOT a shallow Hollywood airhead.

Before reading &quot;Keeping Secrets&quot;, I tended to view her as a shallow and superficial Hollywood blond.

Her story is painful at the beginning; she vividly describes her miserable home life with an alcoholic father. Sommers' narrative contains no trace of self-pity or exaggeration. She tells the unfortunate details of her father's alcholism in a stark, honest fashion. As she grows into adulthood, we see her flounder at first, and then gradually make the incredible journey into self-discovery and healing. At the same time, her career begins to take off. I was so pleased to read about her triumphs and successes - I can't think of a more deserving person.

I can live with the disease and know that it is up to him to seek help. It is not my problem to fix, but I do the best I can to love him and give any help that I can. If alcoholism is making your life hell, please read this book."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"By the late 1980's Suzanne Somers was known to most Americans as that funny blond on television's \\"Three's Company\\". That sitcom propelled Somers into international recognition making her one of the most popular female celebrities of the 1970's.By the late eighties Somers found herself jobless after negotiations with \\"Three's Company\\" broke down and she was labelled as money hungry and greedy for wanting a substantial pay hike. This blacklisted Suzanne in Hollywood. The only work she was able to obtain was on the Las Vegas club circuit.In 1988 Somers sat down and wrote a book called \\"Keeping Secrets\\" about the first chapter of her life up to her sitcom stardom. In that book she discusses growing up the child of an alcoholic, what her and her family endured with the violence and shame often associated with alcohol, and how being exposed to such a terrible childhood had a ripple effect on her adult life.This book is really for anyone that has had an abusive childhood for Suzanne gives the reader an insight as to how abusive behavior (in this case her dad's problem with the bottle) affects not only the person with the addiction but affects the entire family, and how if not treated properly can and will destroy an entire family.Somers writes about her adult life, how she became pregnant at a young age, her ultimate loveless marriage, her attempts at making a living raising a child alone, and her eventual love affair with Canadian-born Alan Hamel who helped change her life around.\\"Keeping Secrets\\" was made into a television movie starring Suzanne as herself in the early nineties. The book was followed-up ten years later with \\"After The Fall\\" that dealt with the second phase of Suzanne's life and her turbulent time in front of and behind the scenes of \\"Three's Company\\" and how being on that series nearly destroyed her."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"I'm sure I don't have anything all that new to say about the experience of reading this book...but I'll add my story.

Keeping Secrets is an honest tell-all account of her life beginning with her first recollections of childhood and growing up in an alcoholic family. Living in constant fear of her father's physical and verbal abuse, Suzanne Somers manages to barely survive as a teenage mother in a love-less marriage, her son's near-fatal accident, her siblings falling one-by-one into alcohol abuse, her arrest for cheque fraud, and a torrid love affair with a married man. Suzanne Somers' story is a &quot;must read&quot; not only for those who have experienced alcoholism in some way but to anyone who has the desire to learn from one's mistakes and be a better person. Suzanne Somers is a wonderful example of honesty and strength - the desire to overcome past mistakes and go on to personal and professional success."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"I was advised to read this book since my father was an alcoholic. I was not very interested in it in the begging, but as I kept reading it became very interesting. I would suggest anyone to pick this up and read it."},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"Suzanne Somers gives us amazing insight into the healing process of a relation to an individual with alcoholism.As far back as 1939 we were told (by William D. Silkworth, MD, New York, 1939) that alcoholism is something like an allergy: an organism runs completely wild when a certain toxic substance is taken in. And in case of allergy to alcohol, cascades of neurotransmitters are metabolized in a detrimental way. With the central nervous system affected, we have unbelievable changes in feeling, thinking and behavior. Let alone the impact on physical health. So at least from then on we could have known, it does not make sense to call someone \\"guilty\\" because s/he is being afflicted with a disease.I appreciate Ms. Somers book very much, but feel obliged to add a remark to one paragraph on the penultimate page in her book, where she states that she1. would not have changed anything, and2. won her greatest insights because of this disease.3. owed her success to the disease.There is a logical mistake I want to correct, and for a deeper reason:It is not, BECAUSE her dad was afflicted with this disease, did she gain insight, did she have success, it is ALTHOUGH her dad was afflicted. Such disease sucks energy.Otherwise it would not make sense to alert people and give them a warning about alcohol. It would be logic to tell them: \\"Go ahead, drink alcohol as much as you can, and you and everybody around you will be so happy - after a long long while.\\"It is the residual symptoms of psychosis still there, the re-interpretation of reality, instead of looking in the cruel eye of facts: yes, it was horrible, but nevertheless, I MADE IT!This \\"I made it IN SPITE OF ALL THIS\\" requires self confidence and \\"a kind of pride that pleases God\\" (Thomas the Aquinate) which is difficult to learn for children of individuals afflicted with alcoholism.Ms. Somer's re-interpretation of the disease is a last desperate effort to find some sense in the chaotic happenings. But disease does not make sense, it just overstrains everybody involved, and therefore:PLEASE, DO WHAT YOU CAN FOR PREVENTION! to read Suzanne Somer's precious book might be one step.Katharina Gutsche, auto-thera.com"},{"Title":"Keeping Secrets","review":"After reading her book,&quot;After the Fall&quot;, I was inspired to read &quot;Keeping Secrets&quot;.I was really surprised that she put in writing all of her secrets.

Calaban, a monster, is also allowed to share the island with them.In time, a ship comes by & Prospero is able to extract his revenge on his betrayors, & find a fine suitor for Miranda, forgive his brother and return to Milan.The oil paintings by Ruth Sanderson are finely detailed, and well wrought, for the most part.As a faint criticism, Miranda is very plain, but Sanderson's heroines often are. The sky's, wave & natural scenes are particularly well done - in some scenes the inspiration from Turner is particularly striking (and attractive)."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare's The Tempest","review":"I bought this book to use with my fifth grade class, and I'm very pleased with it.

They had for many years before this passed from hand to hand in manuscript, and copies had been multiplied for the benefit of those who desired to learn from the famous soldier's recollections how battles should be fought or to study the history of the time in which he lived.The object of the Commentaries was not autobiographical, and hence they do not give an account of all the actions in which he took part, but only of some of them. Vere wished to discuss simply those actions in which, as commander or adviser, he played a leading part... his main purpose was to explain the military causes of failure or success for the benefit of soldiers. The number and nature of the details which he gives show this. Look for instance at the account given of the capture of the fort at Wesel, and the minuteness with which Vere describes the preparations for the escalade, and calls attention to a new manner of assaulting which \`well considered, is of wonderful advantage'. In the same way, when he relates the action of Turnhout, he dwells minutely upon the tactics by which, with a small force, he delayed the march of a numerous enemy and gave time for the rest of the forces to come up. He notes also the mistake made by the enemy in drawing up their battalions of pike one behind the other instead of posing them chequerwise or in some other formation which would have enabled them to support each other. Notice also the detailed account of the manner in which the Dutch and English cavalry broke these squares of pikemen; \`We charged their pikes, not breaking through them at the first push, as it was anciently used by the men-of-arms with their barbed horses: but as the long pistols, delivered at hand, had made the ranks thin, so thereupon the rest of the horse got within them.' The picture of the battle in the original edition of the Commentaries shows this process admirably.The most important battle at which Vere was engaged was that at Nieuport in 1600. Before this the Dutch armies had never beaten the Spaniards in the open country in a pitched battle. Their success had been gained in the attack or defence of fortified places. The Spanish foot were still renowned as the best infantry in Europe, and those who fought at Nieuport were \`old trained soldiers and to that day unfoiled in the field.' Their discipline and their solidity were their chief characteristics, while the strength of the infantry who served under the Dutch colours lay chiefly in their superior mobility. \`Unluckily', says Vere, \`by the situation of the country that skill and dexterity we presumed to excel our enemy in (which was the apt and agile motions of our battalions) was utterly taken from us.' Prince Maurice and his army had to fight a defensive battle with an inferior force and in a disadvantageous position. The 4000 infantry forming Maurice's van, under the command of Vere, bore the brunt of the fighting. The task which Vere set himself was to make the enemy expend their strength in the attack upon the van, so that when they were disordered and spent by the struggle they might be easily overthrown by the rest of the Dutch army. He describes the conformation of the ground, the dispositions by which he made the most of it, and the manner in which he used his small force to the best advantage. Through then tardiness of his reserves Vere's force was nearly overwhelmed, but an opportune charge of horse decided the fate of the day and justified his tactics.There are two parts of Vere's narrative which have a special interest for English readers: his account of the capture of Cadiz in 1596, and his account of what was called The Islands Voyage, that is the expedition to the Azores in 1597.The Commentaries end suddenly with the repulse of the attack of the Spaniards on Ostend on July 25, 1601, though Vere's command there lasted until March 7, 1602. It was his last considerable exploit... The history of the portion of Sir Francis Vere's command at Ostend, which he left untold, was supplied by two of his subordinates, Sir John Ogle and Henry HexhamThe two Veres were the heads of a school of soldiers who learned the art of war under their command. A list of the most notable of these officers is given by the editor of the Commentaries, and the most famous name amongst them is that of Sir Thomas Fairfax, the Parliamentary general. Fairfax, who had served under Sir Horace, married in 1637 Anne Vere, the daughter of his old commander, and his memoirs appropriately accompany those of Vere.The third of the military authors whose narratives are here reprinted, is Major General Thomas Morgan. Having learnt war in Germany and the Low Countries, he returned to take part in the war in the north of England, under the command of Fairfax... In 1657 Morgan was sent to Flanders as second in command of the six thousand English, whom Cromwell sent to help the French against the Spaniards.\\"Further reading:The Commentaries of Sr. Francis Vere Being Diverse Pieces of Service, Wherein He Had Command / Written by Himself in Way of Commentary; Published by WA Life of the Great Lord Fairfax, Commander-In-Chief of the Army of the Parliament of EnglandFighting VeresThe Life of General George Monck: For King and CromwellExercise of Arms: Warfare in the Dutch Revolt (1568-1648) (History of Warfare)"},{"Title":"Hammock Camping: The Complete Guide to Greater Comfort, Convenience and Freedom","review":"great book all about hammock camping and the best way to \\"Hang Out\\"when camping in the woods or in hiking situations.

He has obviously learned how to make and use a hammock in the wilderness and this expertise has led him to create a few of his own innovations in hammock camping. Like many wilderness junkies that decide to write a book or two, Speers is at his best when describing his own experiences. There's no lack of such experiences in this book, since Speers often includes personal journal entries or remembered stories to provide examples of the points he is trying to convey. These events are perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the book and leave the reader with the desire to visit the wide array of places the author describes. Mr. Speers is obviously trying to convince the reader to use a hammock rather than a tent and his personal examples are often chosen to show how those experiences were made possible by his use of his hammock. This expertise pays off in the author's own innovations in hammock making and usage, including the interesting \\"Pea Pod\\" concept of staying warm even in cold temperatures. Ed properly devotes a beefy chapter to the concepts and methods of staying warm in a hammock, which is the biggestl challenge facing the hammock user. This provides an excellent application of Speers' long and varied experiences in his hammocks, since the reader can feel confident that they can make their own hammock comfortably warm in cooler temperatures, yet also feel reassured that they can retreat to the ground if faced with even colder conditions than expected.The author's intent to convert the reader into a hammock lover is a bit overdone at times, though. If the reader is already a hammock user, much of the book will be be spent wishing that they could somehow let the author know that they already agree with him, so that he can therefore go on to more interesting topics. However, for the unconverted, there is much to think about. Speers does a very good job of discrediting misconceptions about hammocks and provides enough handholding to get even the most inexperienced reader safely into a comfortable hammock. There are also excellent appendices, including a good discussion of Leave No Trace philosophies and methods.I was rather disappointed by the book's short length. The fairly large print makes the book look and feel fairly substantial, but I read the entire book in only a couple of hours. Admittedly, I read through it pretty fast looking for tidbits of interesting information or new ideas, but I did in fact read the entire book without skipping a paragraph. Still, one might imagine that there's only so much the author can say about \\"Hammock Camping\\" and he would obviously not want to babble on too long or risk losing the interest of the reader in a subject of limited scope. It also helps that there are illustrations where appropriate, though they are sometimes difficult to see. One-color photographs typically don't work very well, especially at the small sizes used in this book. The photos are not useless, though, and sometimes convey a sequence or idea that is very difficult to understand by reading alone. They easily convey the concept of Speers' preferred hammock knot, which is the best knot I know of for the purpose. I'll also note that his flat webbing straps are also easily preferable to the round cords used on some hammocks. The attachment of those straps to the hammock itself is nothing short of ingenious: simple, yet elegantly functional.I was most disappointed by the author's description of currently available hammocks for wilderness use. While Ed does give us a good overview of what does and does not make a good hammock for backcountry use, in my opinion he spends insufficient time discussing hammocks currently for sale. This would not be such a disappointment for many readers, but Mr. Speers' website advertises this as one of the primary features of the book and I expected more from this chapter. While he does describe most, if not all, of the available wilderness hammocks, you are prepared for the disappointment after the chapter opens with Speers admitting that he hasn't personally used many of the hammocks he discusses. I did not expect him to purchase every single hammock on the market and thoroughly test them all, but I did expect greater detail about the popular models. There is very little that a potential hammock buyer can learn from Speers that they couldn't have learned by visiting the manufacturers' websites instead. I wanted to hear about whether the assymetrical design of Hennessey's recent models was a worthwhile innovation or not. I wanted a bit more in-depth comparison between the various manufacturers and models. However, I may have been asking for too much in this area. Speers does indeed describe the major design features and potential downfalls of each option, though the reader is always aware of the author's own preferences for his own design. This is not a bad thing, but it can come across as self-promotion.The author does a good job of helping the reader make their own hammock. Speers' design is simple enough even for the novice to complete and he even makes sure to include sources for all the materials that he discusses. The Speers Hammock design is simple and effective, definitely enticing the reader to borrow a sewing machine and make their own wilderness shelter. I believe that is the best compliment anyone can hope to give this book. Even if the author only succeeds in making the reader realize the limitations of heavily-advertised outdoor gear when compared to customized do-it-yourself gear, he has obviously done something right. I adore virtually any book whose message is, \\"You can do it!\\". Therefore, I simply have to love this book despite any perceived shortcomings."},{"Title":"Hammock Camping: The Complete Guide to Greater Comfort, Convenience and Freedom","review":"Ed Speer is a pioneer in the art of hammock camping in the United States. When he wrote this book, there were few hammock campers. Only a few people promoted hammock camping and there were only two or three manufacturers. I know, because I searched for anything and everything I could find on hammocks and hammock camping.I first got interested in hammocks when traveling to equatorial South America where they are used extensively for sleeping. They are a great idea! In this country about the only camping hammock was the old WWII Jungle Hammock, which you can still buy at the Army Surplus Store.Ed manufactures his own line of hammocks, but in this book and on his web site, he gives complete instructions on how to build your own hammock. It is obvious that his goal is to promote hammock camping. It must have worked because there are now over 21 manufacturers of camping hammocks and the number is rapidly growing!You can't show me a better book on the topic, because I don't there is another book available on this topic. The closest is Ray Jardine's book on ultralight camping, but he is decidedly not a promoter of hammocks.The advantages of hammock camping are so great that I will probably never do any tent camping again. Ed Speer's book taught me a lot. His advice on cold weather hammocking is particularly useful. I do mostly winter hammock camping.If you are at all curious about hammock camping or buying a camping hammock, but this book. It is solid information."},{"Title":"Hammock Camping: The Complete Guide to Greater Comfort, Convenience and Freedom","review":"After finishing Hammock Camping my advice is as follows. Go and check out Ed Speer's website and read all what is there and save your money. All the info that is in the book that is worth anything is posted on the site.

My \\"mosquito jungle hammock (with giant tarp/fly) less than 2 pounds and the size of a one pound coffee can.easy to use - I never really questioned trying to find a good spot for the tent, just grew up with it.

Every night is the same and this book teaches you how to set up anywhere, in any terrain!Comfort - can't compare/will never go back to a tent/can see why in some countries people sleep in hammocks every night - in their own houses! Infinitely adjustable as to height of both ends for personal comfort (elevated legs after a hard days hike!), flipped over for a great camp chair, never lumpy or bumpy, it's really a revolution.This book tells it like it is from (probably) the biggest conntributor to the growth of the industry of hammock camping.I refer to it a lot, don't carry it anymore but did on the first few trips, but certainly review it before a trip.

First, it is written in understandable language(my son first fell in love with it when he was only four years old). Second, it teaches important life lessons, like the give and take nature of friendship, tolerance through understanding, acceptance of others' belief's while still valuing your own traditions, and the need to question in order to reach a greater place. Briefly, this story is about a young Jewish boy, Michael, who is drawn to the barber shop of Elijah, a Christian, because it is filled with the intriguing wooden figures he has carved. Elijah explains that these figures mostly derive from the Bible. Elijah gives him an angel figure as a Christmas gift. Michael feels privately afraid of his parents' possible reaction to this gift, not in line with the Jewish faith. He feels even God may disapprove. Ultimately, all works out for the best, and on Channukah, too! All the adults act like healthy human beings, and the young Michael is a character most children will be able to relate to, especially those who live in very religious families. This book inspires us all to go beyond our own spirituality into the real world, in order to make friends, thereby spreading love, understanding, and tolerance."},{"Title":"Elijah's Angel: A Story for Chanukah and Christmas","review":"I am such a huge Aminah Robinson (the illustrator) fan!

She has taken real life characters such as Catherine de Medici, and given her truly center stage as a player in the conflict that beseiges our heroine, Ariane Cheney and her path to her destiny. Her destiny is none other than Comte Renard.Ariane has become the Lady of the Isle after the death of her mother. Life is hard for her and her sisters since their father has left and bills are mounting. She has been keeping to herself on Faire Isle when trouble comes in the form of the Dark Queen. Catherine De Medici has aspirations that she will see come to light. If this means setting an evil witch hunter after those that live on the Isle of her late friend (Ariane's mother) than so be it. Ariane will do what she must in order to keep her people safe. What she doesn't want to do is be forced to marry Renard. She wants love deep in her heart, despite the pain that she has seen due to \\"love.\\" Still she is drawn helpless to the Renard. Will she allow her heart into his keeping though, or will pride stand in the way?Renard is from humble stock. His grandfather despised him and the feeling were returned. Still, he must marry and when he sets eyes on the calm beauty of Ariane he will do whatever it takes to see this lady his bride. Neither is looking for love, but love will find them anyhow. Will they be able to save their love as well as the people who are counting on them? Or will the Dark Queen win all?Ms. Carroll has taken the aspects of magic, witchcraft, romance, and history and combined them all into a absorbing read that will enthrall the reader. This is the first time I've ever read anything by this author and I have to wonder \\"what have I been doing???\\" I love historical reads that actually have history in them. This is one series I highly recommend. Ms. Carroll has laid the groundwork for the next in this series and I for one can't wait for it to be released. Add this to your summer reading list. You will be well entertained!Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"In this outstanding work we are introduced to three young women, Ariane, The Lady of Faire Isle, and her two sisters Gabrielle and Miri.These ladies are not what we would consider 'normal' women, but are Daughters of the Earth, or those who have inherited different supernatural powers. However, now these gentle women throughout the world are being charged with being sorceresses instead of being the healers that they are. It is a dangerous time for them.After the death of their mother, Ariane became The Lady of Faire Isle and soon her powers were called upon to stop the wicked scheme of The Dark Queen, Catherine.The Dark Queen, also a Daughter of The Earth, dabbled in the black arts which was forbidden, and she was responsible for the death of Ariane's mother. Ariane knew her powers were great and her evil influence was wide spread; she indeed was a dangerous woman.Ariane was unsure of her ability to walk in her mother's footsteps, and feared her power was not developed enough to battle such a powerful woman; but the decision seemed to be made for her as the battle against The Dark Queen for Ariane's very existence, their way of life, and those she loves begins.To add more confusion to her life a nobleman named counte de Renard is determined to have her as his bride; however he hides many secrets and Ariane is unsure if she can trust this nobleman not only with her heart, but with her life.This is an excellent work of mystical power, battles between good and evil, romantic encounters and mysterious happenings. I was glued to the pages and couldn't wait to see what happened to Ariane and her sisters. It is a well written story, flowing evenly throughout the book; the characters are well defined and brought to life through the authors descriptive pen. You definitely are drawn into the storyline and your mind becomes one with the happenings before you. Outstanding.The Dark Queen is indeed a wonderful reading experience, one of those stories you are glad has a sequel you can look forward to reading. Highly recommended.Shirley Johnson"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"This is delightful, summertime fluff. The characters are interesting, the bad guys are creepy and the history (Catherine de Medici and St. Bartholomew's Eve) is real. The fantasy the author spins around the events leading up to the slaughter is an enchantment in itself. Only the language itself falls short of the story. The dialogue is sometimes stilted and the sporadic use of French feels forced. All in all the book is a good bet for a pool side read."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The Dark Queen is an interesting story set in a historical setting with a feminist slant. It's much more than just a romance novel with some historical details thrown in. The main character is coping with the recent loss of her mother and the changing relationships with her younger sisters. Roles of women are examined and questioned is a very modern sense though the story is set in 16th century France. Having said all this, I enjoyed The Dark Queen (though she doesn't appear until the 2nd half of the book) and despite the 500 pages the story kept my attention.I liked the little touches--the heroine is not irritatingly beautiful, the first ever head butt between lovers and this bit of advice for women everywhere: Never trust a man over your cat."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"After Carroll's Bridefinder series, this particular offering falls flat. Ms. Carroll is undoubtedly a decent writer, but I found this book to be little more than cardboard characters moving through the paces of a romance novel. The plot was trite. The characters were juvenile. I love, love, loved the bridefinder series. In that particular series, the situations were always fraught with organic tension and humor. If you want to see what Ms. Carroll can really do, buy that series instead."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"As a huge fan of historical fiction (particularly of the Medieval and Renaissance varieties) as well as of fantasy novels, I was rather excited when I found this book on the \\"new fiction\\" table of my local bookstore. The back cover billed this book as a feminist-historical-fiction-fantasy hybrid. So, I thought \\"what the heck!\\" and purchased.About 2 pages in - upon reading the physical description of the strikingly beautiful main character, Ariane, and the subsequent physical descriptions of her strikingly beautiful younger sisters - I realized I had been tricked! This book is more a Romance novel than anything else, albeit a slightly more substantial and far more engaging read than most \\"bodice rippers.\\" (Of which, admittedly, I'm not widely read. So, perhaps they have more hidden charms than I have been lead to believe.)Most of the other reviewers have labeled this book a decent \\"Summer Read.\\" I'd classify it more in the decent \\"Commuter Read\\" category. If you take noisy public transportation, and want to occupy yourself with some easy-reading fluff, this book is probably ideal. If you're looking to sink your teeth into a solid novel of historical fiction, or even fantasy - this is probably not the best buy."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I stumbled upon this book one day looking for a book to get lost in in between semesters of grad school and I am extremely happy that I did so.

But why do they all stutter???!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Ariane, the Lady of Faire Isle, refuses to wed Comte de Renauld though he is persistent to the point of waiting for her at the altar. When she fails to show up, he comes to see her and is very kind to her younger sisters Gabrielle and Mirabelle though the latter \\"stole\\" his horse. Renauld gives Ariane a magic ring in which he will come to her if she asks for him; but upon the third use they will marry. He leaves.Not long afterward Navarre Captain Remy arrives badly wounded. He gives Ariane proof that Catherine de Medici poisoned his ruler Queen Jeanne D'Albret. By coming here with his evidence of murder, Remy has endangered Ariane and her two siblings from the deadly Dark Queen. To keep her sisters safe, Ariane uses the ring twice and Renard comes to her aid. He frees her from the third time marriage vow although he still wants to marry her for one simple reason; he loves the Lady of Faire Isle.THE DARK QUEEN is a wonderful first of three historical suspense tales (Ariane's sisters to follow) with a pinch of both the otherworldly and romance to spice up the deep look at the Medici era. Ariane is a terrific independent soul worried for her sisters especially the twelve years old Mirabelle who talks with horses, which lead to a declaration of witchcraft that means death. The story line is action-packed but character driven as the noble Renauld knows he must go slower with his beloved and Catherine is Machiavelli's \\"prince\\" with her deadly machinations. Susan Carroll writes a wonderful historical thriller that will have the audience eagerly awaiting Gabrielle's story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I loved Ms. Carroll's Bride Finder series and couldn't wait for new work from the author--it was definitely worth it. This series has it all--a strong heroine, a worthy hero, a formidable villian and all the magic and wonder of a true historical romance. Well done, Ms. Carroll!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It gets you so involved in the story. I was hoping it wouldn't end! I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"It reads like a historical fantasy tale. Or a harlequin romance novel; Susan Carroll has been known to write books of the latter sort. So one would normally expect the heroine to have no character whatsoever, and the hero she falls in love with to be extremely masculine. Although the hero of this story, Count Renard (or Justice Deuville), falls into the stereotype of heroes, our heroine, Ariane Cheney, is a completely unexpected type of heroine.The Dark Queen is the first in a trilogy that takes place in the late 16th century in Brittany, and features the oldest girl, Ariane, as the heroine. Ariane Cheney is the eldest daughter of a witch who inadvertently did the dowager queen of France, Catherine de Medici, a disservice; and a man who has gone missing at sea. Catherine de Medici, the Dark Queen herself, still harbors an intense grudge towards the Cheney family, and would love to see the daughters brought down as well as their mother.One day in the forest on the mainland, Ariane encounters the lusty young count de Renard, who immediately determines that he shall marry her- despite the fact that he's got dozens of other more beautiful and wealthy women waiting for him to court them. His grandmother, who had been a wise woman herself, had told her grandson to \\"look out for the one with the quiet eyes\\"- advice which he ignored until he met Ariane. But Ariane is determined to stay way from the young count, sending a straw bride in her place on her wedding day. However, Renard is still determined to wed Ariane, and he gives her a magic ring. If she wears it, she will be able to ask of him any kind of favor she chooses. After the third time, she must give in and consent to marry him. Sounds far-fetched, doesn't it?Things change when a man comes from Paris, mysteriously shot at and possibly dying. He is a Huguenot, a dissenter and heretic in the eyes of those who live in Brittany. He tells a strange tale: that his mistress, Jeanne of Navarre, had been poisoned by the Dark Queen; but with a glove. Ariane, charged with solving the mystery, is given the names of several powerful wise women in Paris to whom she can turn for help (we learn that Joan of Arc was a wise woman as well, an invention of course on the part of the author). Altogether this is a well-written novel, though perhaps the history is skimpily researched. A good book for those who want something light, fun, and intriguing. The next book in the series features Gabrielle Cheney, the second sister, and is called The Courtesan- its due out in August. I look forward to reading it and finding out more about Gabrille's past, of which we learn a little bit in The Dark Queen. The third book won't be published until 2006, and its about the youngest sister, Miri, who is a lover of animals."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I actually read The Courtesan first and was about 3/4 of the way through before I realized I was actually reading the second book in the trilogy. I loved the Courtesan so much I had to go back and read about Ariane. Even though there were a lot of things I already knew were going to happen, the book was so well written and enrapting that I read most of it in a 7 hr drive home over the holidays. Normally, I get carsick if I read in the car too long, but I was so lost in the story that didn't even notice the ride home. I can't wait for the last book.Rayna"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I haven't finished the book yet(being very busy),but I liked it from page 1 and I am going to read the sequels too,in due time."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Initially I was excited to read an author who (according to other reviews) weaves history in with her plotline; however, although the writing style is \\"okay\\", Carroll succeeds only in boring me. Her plot is dull, characters trite, and attempt at history frankly stupid."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I thought I was getting a historical based book. Not what I expected, but it got me hooked."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The Dark Queen: A NovelIf you are one of those hardcore has to be perfectly accurate historical fans-- then please don't read and rate this book.This book has historical componets, but mostly follows the lives of three sisters: Ariane, Gabrielle, and Miribell Cheney, which are figures of the authors imagination-- hince: historical FICTION.With that out of the way, Carroll writes in such a way, that it is almost impossible to put the book down! There were no \\"laggy moments\\" as I call them-- (you know those parts where your mind wanders and you seriously consider putting down the book and not finishing it) and instead found the book to be very well written and seamless storytelling.I don't usually read novels a second time, but I just might have to start!The book takes place during a time when witchcraft is a frightening notion, and the three sisters find themselves caught up in all the madness, a wedding proposal + an evil witch of a queen + one of the bloodiest nights france has ever seen = one good book.I would encourage any fan of the FICTION genre to give it a go"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Pretty engrossing novel, first in a series of three. I was a fan of her \\"St. Leger\\" series and was not disappointed in this work."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I loved the aspects of this novel that dealt with witchcraft, the supernatural and Catherine de Medici. I think that it would have been just fine without the romance elements however. I was put off by descriptions of the comte de Renard's muscular physique, big strong hands, etc. and Ariane's distraction by thoughts of the same. It was as if the author couldn't decide whether or not to craft this novel as a historical romance or something else and the blending of the two is not entirely seamless. But don't let the romantic subplot put you off, even though it is a bit tedious at times. I still found the book to be enjoyable and well written. I'm hoping that the author's next forays into the historical fiction genre will include less of the romance novel tinge."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"This is a good book and I really appreciate the thrill of the story. I can't say that the author is one of my favorites, but she tells a great story and the book is very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The first of the Cheney sister trilogy is a enthralling novel by an author that expertly entwines history, romance and magic together.I usually read historical fiction, and I found this novel refreshing as it contains factual events (such as the massacre of the Hugenots) but placed them in a fastastical world where anything is possible. The three characters of the Cheney sisters were wonderfully developed by the author, and I enjoyed reading about all three of them. The next two novels are also recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"this is a great book to take to the beach ,sit back and enjoy.it's fill of magic ,romance and historical figures.once pick up this book you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The Dark Queen is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is the first time I've read this author and I am anxious to read more of her works. This is the first of a trilogy followed by The Courtesan and The Silver Rose.I enjoyed everything about this book, encluding the very classy cover. It is easy to read, moves at a good pace, and has well developed characters. The hero and heroine are each fiercely independent and capable people and the reader is rooting for them to fall in love.This novel is historical fiction at its best. Great background in Renaissance France, mixture of magic and sorcery, intrigue, great hero/heroine, good secondary characters, and a superb romance. I was never bored and feel like I discovered a literary gem!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"4.5 stars. I sort of stumbled across this book and decided to give it a go. Ms. Carroll is certainly a great storyteller. I loved her prose and her unique voice. I also liked the fact that the characters in this book aren't ravishing beauties or perfectly chisled hunks. These are heroes and heroines I can relate to. For a five hundred page novel, I must say that was surprised that there was no real sagging middle. The story kept your interest--BUT it could have shaved about 150 pages reflectively. But perhaps laying the ground work for the next two installments are what padded the book. The only time I cringed was when Gabby discovered the gloves. Why would someone place those on when her sister obviously didn't want you to touch them. But in reality as well in fiction people do stupid things. However, the whole plot revolving the gloves was lost on me. What did Remy think Ariane could do? Even if she could figure out the \\"dark\\" magic? How could one even prove the gloves belonged to the Dark Queen? And just for Remy to just show back up at court like nothing happen was--weird. Simon was just an annoyance, but I guess we're supposed to excuse his behavior because he was young--but whatever. He was astute enough to notice and figure out the rings, to pick up that the Queen was a witch, but he couldn't see through Le Vis? He excused the man for attempting to do a witch tribunal on a young girl whom he KNEW was innocent, ignore that the man was trying to drown him to save his hide, and so on and so on. It just wasn't consistant. But overall, this was a interesting read, well written, and I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Hey Kids! Its a Romance Novel! It was one one of the central isles in the store, and I read way to many historical novels, otherwise I would have never picked it up. The cover, please note, has a complete lack of Fabio or Heaving Boobies. Its actually rather nice, with a sparkly red brocade border.Also- the woman in the novel is not a Damsel in Distress. Oh no, she's a 'wise woman' leader of Faire Isle some where in pseudo 1500s Brittany. She does have a Persistent Suitor, however. And she does fall in love with him at the end of the novel. It also, however has plenty of plot in the middle . While a fast read, it was not a mindless one. Plenty of back story was provided, all the main characters were very fleshed out. Actually it has so much back story I wondered if there was another novel with the same characters. Still, combine the characters with the political intrigue- good Olde Fashioned Catholic/Protestant fighting. And the women of Faire Isle are of course in the middle of it.The women seem, in some places, too emotional and flighty but then I realized that the youngest is 13 and the middle is not much older than that. Fairly old in the 1500s but being a member of the landed class, and living on their own island, it seems that they were rather sheltered.A good novel none the less, though the angsting got a little agnst-y after a while. Perfect for the hot summer nights when the A/C is broken."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Wow. When i first got this book i thought it was going to resemble Philippa Gregory's 16th century English Historical books, only in France instead of England. I couldnt have been more wrong! But i am not dissapointed! This novel is more a romance novel than a Historical fiction, although it does teach you a few things here and there. And it actually didnt have much to do with The Dark Queen, as its title suggests. I loved this book. The entire thing! I could hardly put it down. I would deffinitely recomend this book. The love story tugs at your heart and puts a smile on your face!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Susan Carroll did an amazing job of capturing the reader in a romantic and dangerous scenario. I have read all three of the books in this series, and all of them are amazing. The author does an excellent job of describing the love between the two characters, Ariane and Renard. I was awed and amazed at the titilating and thrilling desriptions provided. Carroll provided excellent desciprions of the characters and scenes that makes the reader want to be there and experience the emotions of the characters. The history was intriguing and all of the writing flowed well from one part to the next. I found the main chanracter, Ariane, to be a strong and amazing woman whom I admired. Carroll does a wonderful job describing all of the points of view so the reader is better able to understand the situation and make their own assessments. Overall, I loved this book and I recommend it, and all of the books in the series, for anyone who enjoys romance with adventure all intwined with history. I was not able to stop thinking about the book, and it was difficult to put it down. Wonderful!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I picked this up thinking it would be an historical novel, but found instead an excellent and engaging romance/fantasy novel set in the historical past. If you're looking to learn more about Catherine de Medici, forget it. If you're looking for a fun read, this qualifies. I'll read other books by Susuan Carroll."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The first installment of The Dark Queen series contains the tale of the eldest Cheney sister, Ariane, who has taken the position of the Lady of Faire Isle since her mother's death. A small island off the coast of France, Faire Isle has become a haven for women and girls who seek more from life than becoming wives and mothers, a safe place for learning and owning businesses. Safe until an army captain seeks Ariane's help to expose the Catholic dowager queen for her involvement in the death of the Huguenot queen and ultimately sends the wrath of Catherine, The Dark Queen, down on Faire Isle. Ariane must rely on her mother's training and the sworn protection of the Comte de Rechard to save her family and the residents of the island from the witch-hunters sent by Catherine to destroy them all.Because I had accidently read part three of the series before realizing it was, in fact, a series, it was a little odd going back to the beginning since I knew the fates of many of the characters mentioned. However, I enjoyed the intrigue and magical elements of the story and felt that I had a better understanding of the author's writing style. As a result, I found myself much more absorbed in this book than I had for The Silver Rose, and I'm looking forward to reading the story of the middle sister soon."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The reviewer who said this book was good for a poolside read hit the nail on the head. I have since read all of the books in the Dark Queen series and I found each one very enjoyable, but the fact remains that once you've read one, you've read them all. The story line moves in the exact same way for each book, and though I won't give away anything for those who want to read them, I promise you won't be surprised by any of the endings. There are a number of places in all the books where Carroll brings up a potentially interesting plot point only to have it go absolutely nowhere and then be glossed over at some later time. I also find myself actually liking her side characters even more than her main characters. For example, Catherine de Medici is a wonderfully complex villain. I only wish Carroll's main characters weren't so darn predictable all the time. All that said, the books still fun and enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend them for anyone looking for true historical fiction or for a serious read. I would, however, recommend them for people who want a romance with a dash of history and a peck of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I loved this novel, very smart and it keeps you interested from the first chapter. I have read all three... Dark Queen, Courtesan, and Silver Rose. If you read Dark Queen you will want to read the follow up stories to find out what happens to the sisters."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Along with another reviewer, this is my first Susan Carroll novel and I'm hooked. I won't launch into the contents of the book because plenty of people have given you summaries. The writing flowed well with likeable, yet flawed characters, and an interesting plot line. May be a bit fluffy, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, I thought that made it more enjoyable. Because a book has romance and sex in it doesn't make it not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I adored this book. I wasn't sure what I would get when I picked up this book, but once I began it, it was such a pleasure that it was hard to put down. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like my history blended with romance, so this is a really great read for fans of historical romance.I will agree that this is not the book to learn about the history of Catherine de Medici. This is more like what could have happened than what probably did. Still, it was splendid and did give Catherine a very fearsome countenance which was probably not far off of the mark!Personally, I loved the psychic and spiritual aspects of the book. I am psychic and I have similar experiences in my own life which paralleled the journey of Ariane. I have experienced the eye reading phenomenon that is often talked about in the book, though I will say that I think some of it is embellished for dramatic effect.The book is fun and the characters are engaging. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"If you are fan of historical fiction books with a bit of romance added to me mix then The Dark Queen is the perfect choice for you.Life is quiet for Ariana, one of the Cheney sisters on Faire Isle who is known for her mystical powers until a stranger arrives on her land carrying a secret against The Dark Queen - Queen Catherine of France. At a loss of what to do, Ariana begins to turn towards the comte de Renard, a man whom she is trying not to open her heart to and fall in love with.The Dark Queen is a fast moving story about romance, magic, and power that is sure to keep your attention."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Contrary to a previous review where this book is claimed as a \\"bodice-ripper\\" and \\"a bit of fluff\\" I must put my 2 cents in to this read and inform potential readers of this book and what a gem it is.This is my first Susan Carroll book and I already adore her work. I have bought The Courtesan (2nd book in trilogy) and look forward to the third in the series set to come out in 2006. In The Dark Queen, our heroine is 21 year old Ariane -- who is not a glamourous woman (despite someone's reviewed opinion that she was perfect in the book) and seems very real with the stress and responsibilities of taking care of her sisters (who happen to be the prettier girls in the family.) She inherited the title of being The Lady of Faire Isle from her mother and with it comes great responsibility and readers quickly realize how much a burden it is to Ariane, especially once she takes in a wounded Heugunot knight who claims Catherine de Medici (The Dark Queen) poisened his queen and Ariane is the only wise woman who can save his surviving king.Admist attempting to watch out for the unusual isle of women, the knight and her two sisters, Ariane is also being plagued by le comte Renard -- a man whose \\"brutish size\\" and temperament force all to be inferior. Not knowing how to woo or tempt any lady, he simply tells Ariane they're going to marry. But he quickly realizes his folly in such a thing and seeks out to win her by striking a bargain with her that readers ought to find out about by reading the book.In summary, the book is about Ariane who takes up the title her recently deceased mother left for her as The Lady of Faire Isle and she feels inept to fill in all that calling entails. Admidst it all, she protects a knight called a heretic and could suffer treasonous death should he be found. But the all-knowing Dark Queen knows that Ariane hides the knight and intrigue and wits burst forth in attempt that good prevail over evil (aka: The Dark Queen)This book was a great read and the 500-some-odd pages was over more quickly than I thought. I loved this book, I haven't enjoyed an adventerous book like this in a long time. This is a keeper and other readers will likely think so, too.Characters are so life-like in their opinions and feelings you forget they are just that - characters. Their reactions to everything around them is understandable and you quickly feel for them and the plights they each suffer. You even understand the Dark Queen's attempts for evil and at rare points realize she has reasons that shaped her opinion to take over evil as she suffers from guilt and sorrow.If you are looking for a fluffy read then disregard a certain review for this book and realize that there's more to this novel than the appartent romance going on in the story.My Rating: 5 solid stars for a book that never lagged pace and kept the reader enthralled even beyond the point of finish such marvelous work."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Susan Carroll does a wonderful job of combining history, magic, love, and suspense in this novel (the first of three). The three sisters each have a very different personality, and the men they are attracted to are all different as well. The emphasis in The Dark Queen focuses on the eldest and her internal struggle when dealing with the external battles she's fighting. Great novel!"},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Easily one of the finest books I've read, \\"The Dark Queen\\" holds a hint of mystique along with a delightful taste of deception and plenty of intrigue. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I have, but it's quite simply one of the better fantasy works I've read in years. The book reverts back to the days when magic was forbidden yet misunderstood and women were uncertain of just where to belong. I adored it."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Both the description and the intro to the book had me a little worried that this would be a book where the helpless damsel needs the handsome count's help and then swoons all over him, so let me assure you - this isn't that sort of book. Although Ariane occasionally needs the count's help, it's never a because she's weaker than he is. She only calls on him to help others and often he's only able to do what she cannot because he's fortunate enough to have men-at-arms to call on. She does do a bit of swooning, but never so the count would know it. Both Ariane and the count are clearly strong, stubborn people and a nice, even match for each other.The sex scenes are definitely R rated, but only because they're explicit - nothing kinky. There isn't an emphasis on having sex after your married, but this book and the rest of the series do clearly connect sex with love. While this might still be too scandalous for the more puritanical among us and too uptight for the more promiscuous, I found it just right for the plot. It made the sex an integral part of the plot because the sexual tension has to connect to increasing romantic attraction which comes from shared experiences and adversity (ie the plot). Personally, my own morals don't really enter into it when I'm judging a plot, so the only time I hate sex in a novel is when it's clearly gratuitous (George R. R. Martin, I'm looking at you). That wasn't the case here.The plot and the writing are good enough that I'm having a hard time identifying precisely why I loved them, but here's my best attempt. The plot was fast paced. Despite the romantic focus of the book, there were lots of action scenes too. Something exciting was always going on. The idea for the world wasn't entirely novel, but something which set it apart for me was the science underlying the magic of the daughters of the earth. I really liked that modern medical knowledge, for instance, could look like magic to most people at the time. Some of the magic wasn't completely explicable by today's science, so it wasn't an entirely self-consistent world, but enough of an explanation was hinted at that I was happy with it.I liked Ariane as a protagonist, because she has a strong sense of duty and is willing to do a lot to protect those who depend on her. And the Comte grew on me as we got more snippets from his perspective and as Ariane got to know him better. While he did have some believable character flaws (as does Ariane), he was at heart a likable guy and not at all as chauvinistic as I was afraid he might be after the first few chapters. And the plot itself was unique, as were the plots of the other four books in the series. All five books were of a very similar style, but had different enough plots that they're all definitely worth reading. So if you like romances with steamy sex but want a great plot and fun historical context instead of a lighter chick-lit novel, this is definitely a book series for you."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The first in Carroll's Dark Queen Saga tells the story of Ariane Cheney, the oldest of the three Cheney sisters, who is known as the Lady of Fair Isle. Ariane's priorities are looking out for her sisters, Gabrielle and Miri, and practicing her skills as a \\"daughter of the earth.\\" Unfortunately, Ariane and her sisters manage to provoke the anger of Catherine de Medici, another daughter of the earth who has turned to the darker side of her magic. Catherine sends witch-hunters after the sisters, and Ariane has to rely on her mysterious suitor, the Comte de Renard, for protection.This book started off slowly for me, but I really came to enjoy it. Ariane shows some real growth over the course of the story, and she and Gabrielle both struggle with the question of how to share your life with someone without giving up your independence. I enjoyed that each of the three Cheney sisters has her own unique abilities as a result of her magic. Also, there was also a plot twist near the end of the book that surprised me.The main complaints I've seen about this book in other reviews were that it is not historically accurate about Catherine de Medici and that it's \\"just a bodice-ripper.\\" Neither of these things bothered me while I was reading. I wouldn't have expected a book that claims Catherine was a sorceress to be historically accurate. Also, there is one sex scene in this book, and it is 2 pages long. I hardly think that 2 pages out of 544 qualifies this story as a \\"bodice-ripper.\\""},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"The Dark Queen was an enjoyable novel that took me into the world of Ariane the oldest of the Cheney sisters who, three young girls on the verge of their twenties who having lost their Mother are now facing the debts that their Father left behind when he fled on a sea voyage to escape their Mother's illness and his guilt at having caused part of her heart ache because of his illicit affair in far off Paris.Ariane struggles as she takes her place as the Lady of Fair Isle, who is known for protecting the inhabitants of the Island and passing down the secrets of its healing healing myths and legends to her daughters. She has learned everything she needs to know from her recently deceased Mother, and is struggling to raise her two sisters, as they grieve the total loss of one parent, and the disappearance of another. Gabrielle the middle sister is set on escaping the island, and her past which the book, hints at is not a pleasant one, because of the pain caused by a past suitor. And this is the least Ariane's problem's as an errant soldier comes to stay, the younger sister half nymph in training, invite's stray animal's with a look to come to roost in their home, and the local comte Renard and Ariane, fight on and off, as he vighs, for her hand in marriage with or without her cosent; which she seems more than at times willing to give.This book will keep you turning the pages into the night as the first in a series of truly bewitching novels."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"This book is a pleasant read that has both a romance and a battle of good versus evil wrapped up in a 16th century package of knights and ladies and queens and kings. the good and evil come in the form of witches, or wise women: women who remember the ways of the earth and healing, or on the dark side, poisoning. The romance involves the eldest of three orphaned sisters, Ariane, the Lady of Faire Isle, and Renard, who has recently inherited his grandfather's title and nearby lands. Renard first tries to force Ariane into marriage, which she rejects, and then you can watch as mutual respect grows between these two.But there is lots of adventure too! Catherine de Medici, dowager queen of France, is not a friend of the Huguenots (Protestants), and she uses dark power to try to shape France as she desires. This portion of the story has a basis in fact. Perhaps not her use of the dark power, but her desire to reshape France.There are battles, as Renard saves his Lady over and over again. There is magic as the lady tries to battle dark forces. There are witch hunters, who almost succeed too often in destroying Ariane and her sisters. And in the end, yes, there is love....How they get to that end, I will leave for your to discover when you read this book. But I must repeat that I ordered the rest of the trilogy immediately upon ending this book. The first book stands on its own, but I will be glad to read the rest."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"I love historical fiction, adventure, and romance. This book has it all including a few witches. It takes the historical rumors of Queen Catherine de Medici as being a dark witch and uses it with the Queen being the enemy of some white witches that try to do good and heal those around them. Who can be trusted? Who is in league with the dark Queen? Is the one using a little black magic really doing good?Then there is the intense romance that is between Ariane, a white witch or healer, and the comte de Renard who is determined to have her while keeping his past a secret.Yet, he can't help using a little magic himself if it will give him the woman he desires.Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. You never know what will happen next especially once the witch hunter starts doing his work. There tends to be no peace for anyone.A good read that will keep you entertained."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"Heavy on fiction, light on history. Vaguely interesting plot, but there was absolutely NO reason to drag it on for 500+ pages. I was sucked in by the hints of intrigue and plotting, but unfortunately not enough of the book spent time focusing on that; most of the book spent OODLES of time building up the romance subplot, which I not only found not less interesting than the Katherine de Medici aspect, but I also found less engaging than some of Susan Caroll's romance plots in other books (The Bride Finder, for example.) I will probably not be reading the rest of the series. (But who knows?)3 stars instead of 2 simply because I kept picking it up and read it in 2 1/2 days. But it was ultimately a pretty unsatisfying read."},{"Title":"The Dark Queen","review":"This book is a fast-paced, can't put it down read. The characters are well developed and the plot thick. To the end of the book, the reader is never really sure what will become of the heroine or her reluctance toward a rather aggressive love interest."},{"Title":"Five Little Bunnies Hopping on a Hill Book and Audiocassette Tape Set (Paperback)","review":"Okay, so everything doesn't rhyme in here - unlike its predecessor \\"5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed\\". Once I got over that, I did enjoy the sweet, soft pastel illustrations. The bunnies are adorable, filled with detail that children delight in noticing. Kids also have a fascination with \\"boo-boos\\" and plenty of things happen to these rambunctious cuties. Every time momma calls the doctor, he (or she - we are in the 21st century now) gives the same answer, which kids love to shout out with glee. They don't care that it doesn't rhyme.

OK, there *is* one entire sentence devoted to PHP, and somewhere in this mess I think that I remember seeing several lines regarding jsp. On the plus side -- there is an Appendix devoted to a cursory review of the SANS top 20 security vulnerabilities. Thank goodness -- googling for this list or finding it online at the SANS portal must be outside the abilities of the reviewers who gave this book positive reviews.Testing w/ client-side proxies, as far as I can tell, is not covered; nor is any mention made of SQL insertion techniques, basic authentication mechanism testing, Nikto usage, etc.I purchased this book based upon the initial reviews on this site. Obviously, the earlier reviewers were not reading the same book as the one I received."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"Before I read Steve's book, I thought that testing the security of a Web site required huge amounts of technical knowledge including how certain operating systems, web servers, etc., actually worked. Having read the book, I realise that someone needs to know - but it needn't be me. As a tester, my job is to see if the security measures that have been put into place actually do what they are supposed to and in this context the book exceeds my requirements and expectations.In addition, one of the problems in testing security is trying to ensure that the site does not open itself up to any unauthorised activity - accidental or not. How do you ensure \`complete coverage' of the virtually infinite number of event combinations and therefore test cases? This problem is addressed in the Test Planning and Risk Analysis sections and placed properly and pragmatically into context.Then we get into the meat of test design. I like the way we start with scoping. What are we trying to secure and from what or whom? To answer the latter part of the question, the book delves into types of attacks - which then helps us to think about what and how to test. I particularly like the checklists (OK, I'm a checklist fan) and the lists of software tools which are available to carry out things like IP address sweeps, port scans, etc.This part of the book has separate chapters for networks, system software, client and server-side application software. Each chapter is virtually stand-alone which makes it a good reference as well as a good read. I also like the fact that Steve has not left out the social engineering aspect of security. Finally, Test Implementation addresses the usual practical problems associated with test execution but with all the emphasis on security.Steve Splaine has distilled into one book enough information to give testers and test managers confidence in the planning, design and execution of Web security testing. An excellent read and reference."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"The author's goal is to make managers responsible for Web site security aware that having a super-duper firewall doesn't excuse the organization from conducting tests or exploring additional avenues to supplement the firewall.The book also supports security testers with flexible descriptions and checklists for creating test cases and conducting tests. Each chapter ends with a checklist covering the various aspects of the test process from planning to intrusion detection. Organizations with a process model in place such as CMM (Capability Maturity Model), RUP (Rational Unified Process), and Six Sigma will find the material supportive of such efforts and maybe even making it easier because of the lists of example tools and software products for managing reporting and schedules.The book isn't a read front-to-back book as each chapter is understandable with or without previous chapters. The first two chapters address vocabulary, test plans and planning, and general project management activities. The meat of the book is in Part 3, Test Design, beginning with chapter 3, which addresses scoping and conducting a network assessment. Chapter 4 focuses on system software and related tools.The next two chapters look at client-side and server-side applications to ensure the system is designed to function correctly for its users while guarding its castle to prevent the evil ones from breaking in. Mother Nature might pay a visit or another big blackout could happen and those guards need to be prepared to react, hence Chapter 7 prepares a team for such events as well as various ways the bad guys might do a sneak attack.Mysterious intruders and audit trails sounds like a case for Sherlock Holmes as Chapter 8 directions on detecting unauthorized intruders, responding to an attack, and assessing the damage.Those who haven't formed a team might want to leap into Chapter 9, which provides staffing options for in-house and outsourcing. It also discusses the process of selecting tools. In the last chapter, get the lowdown on doing a risk analysis to be prepared in for the likelihood of changed plans (which we know happens often). Doing such an analysis is a step toward to having a well-planned test schedule ensure the areas that pose the greatest risks are done early in the process while the lesser important items are done near the end of the test period.The appendices provide an overview of network protocols, addresses, and devices; a list of the most critical Internet security vulnerabilities; and example templates for testing documentation. Those who need more in-depth information can reference the resources for further reading via books and Web sites.If the thought of security is daunting, this book is a good introduction to the topic. It's appropriate for organizations creating a new testing team; teams responsible for conducting testing assessments; and testing managers, project managers, and test teams that are new to testing security. Directors, executives, and other top level managers who are responsible for Web site security will also benefit.Any technical terms that pop up are clearly defined without the dull writing that makes eyes glaze over when reading a technical book. The use of sidebars, checklists, headers, examples, and figures provide a nice balance in presenting the material without losing the reader. The book is practical for anyone who needs a general reference on Web security and wants to know how it works.As for the programming issue another reviewer mention, it's true there isn't reference to programming languages. However, that's not the point of this particular book."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"This book is unique in that it focuses more on auditing than on actual web testing techniques, which is an area that is too often overlooked by QA. Because of this niche area, this book can be used in conjunction with any of the more testing-centric books, giving QA a solid security-in-depth approach. This approach also makes this book a solid reference for complying with parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.Splaine thoroughly covers the test/audit process by addressing all layers and threat vectors. He takes a systematic vulnerability assessment and risk management approach, and extensively uses checklists throughout this book to help you to develop a security auditing process that will close most of the vulnerability gaps, as well as to augment other testing approaches.I particularly like the completeness of topic coverage - he goes into network, protocol, client- and server-side application, and attack modes in great detail. For each area he provides advice, checklists and a strategy for dealing with the risks and vulnerabilities represented. I also like the way he addresses configuration management, quality and test case design. These reflect best practices and can be quickly integrated into a web security QA function.Splaine's earlier book, &quot;The Web Testing Handbook&quot; (ISBN 0970436300) nicely augments this one, as does Nguyen's highly regarded &quot;Testing Applications on the Web: Test Planning for Internet-Based Systems&quot; (ISBN 047139470X), both of which are more focused on web testing.If you work in QA or web security this book will be an invaluable resource, and is one that I highly recommend because it spans both disciplines."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"Web Security Testing ReviewI first picked this book up because the subject matter had a \\"new twist.\\" After almost 30 years in Information Security the concept of actually testing the security systems we are paid to maintain interested me. I thought, O.K... get ready, in a few minutes I'll be knee deep in testing jargon and theory. Not so!! To my surprise this book is incredibly readable, partially because the author sprinkles great examples throughout the book and partially because his writing style is NOT \\"from on high to us mortals on earth.\\" I was very pleasantly surprised. Besides readability I think Mr. Splain has covered the issue of content very well. In the section on test plans he includes the idea that system documentation is an integral part of test plan documentation. Not that this is a new concept; it should be second nature to us in the IT field. The point is, he has taken care with the details and it shows in the content of the book. Another key concept in the book is \\"defining the scope of the network testing by identifying an appropriate set of network segments.\\" You can define the scope to anything, servers, buildings, color of the chassis. It's nice to see him make a statement like this, provide the technobabble to human speak definitions in the appendix (for those that need them) and then go forward and treat the components (all of them) as a system, not leaving bits lying around for someone else to deal with. Again, it's not that this is a new concept; it just shows how thorough he is with the subject. Looking at the chapter on Network Security \\"testing\\", the thought occurred to me that this chapter is a great basis for designing a stand alone network security review. It's outside the scope of the book, but all the components are there in one chapter.The organization of the book is also nice. You don't have to read the book through to use the content. Each section (or chapter for that matter) can, if needed, stand on its own. The book is broken up into 5 sections; An Introduction, Planning the Testing Effort, Test Design, Test Implementation, and Appendixes. Each chapter is filled with check lists, concepts, web sites and software recommendations that can be woven into any testing effort. In the appendix you'll find a chapter on Additional Resources. This chapter brings into one place a myriad of books and web sites that would be invaluable to anyone from the seasoned professional to someone just entering the field.I've performed a number of security reviews and the like over the years, but after reading this book I'm thinking of revising my methods. Even though Mr. Splain may not have meant his book to be used this way, I see it as a basis for setting up any security review for any network based system (not just for testing new systems). This may come as a shock to Mr. Splain (although I doubt it), but I think he's laid out the basis for carrying out a security consulting practice (not setting the practice up, but certainly proposing great methods for doing the security reviews).Lastly, I have always been irritated by the popular concept that we \\"test\\" and go on. For my part, in security reviews, this is a blatant misconception that leads to more open systems than secure ones. Mr. Splain has endeared himself to me by proposing the idea throughout the book, that security testing is an ongoing process. I'm pleased to see this expressed in such a practical \\"how to\\" book. Well done."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"I found this book very useful for myself as a dictionary of sorts! Our QA department is buried in client/server testing and basic web page testing, and I don't think we'll ever have enough staff that we'll get to do this much security testing. (others do it, but not us) However, I still hear a lot of these terms bandied about, and now I actually know what they mean and have a better idea of how things work."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"The book is a unique one. True there are many books on security written, but never before has anybody approached it from the testing point-of-view. This book analyzes the different security holes in many web applications, and lists many different hacking tools and methods, then discusses what a tester is to do in order to test securing their web application or site. Written for the testing professional by a testing professional!Steve has done it again... Another great book for the software testing &amp; quality assurance professional."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"A Steven Splaine book is a well-constructed and complete presentation of testing web sites. The book goals are to raise manager awareness and to present the problems to newcomers in web site security testing. I think that this goal is achieved. The book is well balanced between topic presentation, checklists, examples and references. Acknowledging the complexity of Web site security, the book managed to keep a good level of global overview of the topics and to present the concepts with a clear vocabulary. I like the attitude of the author to build on existing knowledge and to refer to more specific books or articles for those who would like to dig deeper in a particular area. In conclusion, I find that this book is an excellent introduction to this complex topic."},{"Title":"Testing Web Security: Assessing the Security of Web Sites and Applications","review":"Interestingly, this is one of the very few commercial guides on testing anything out there that actually provides a test plan and specific tests to perform. It smartly provides straight facts on web security without trying to oversell anything which is why I particularly recommend it.Another point of the book I found helpful and intelligent is the layout which did more than just take one through a step-by-step assessment.Although not overly technical, for instance you won't find specific programming tips on PHP or JSP, its broad coverage of the web presence from physical to Internet is more than enough to provide any organization with a proper risk assessment.I have written the author about a few improvements I would like to see but there is nothing that would detract from the knowledge transfer this book currently offers. It is an excellent complement to the OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual) at [email address]and will assist you in making an OSSTMM certified test as well meeting BS7799 best practice requirements.

For the money this catalog costs, I expected a masterpiece. What I got is far from that. It's great to have all of these images in one place; it would cost far more to assemble these images via dozens of publications, art guides, and catalogs (if at all possible). But the quality of this \\"official catalog\\" is almost criminal, and certainly would not pass muster by the discerning taste of Dali himself. In addition, what is not clear prior to purchase is that this catalog only contains \\"limited edition\\" graphic works. This means that you won't find all of those \\"illustrations\\" Dali did for many books, magazines, and plays throughout the years. If you own this book, your Dali reference source is far from complete. In short, buy the book if you want specimens of many of Dali's limited edition graphic works (not paintings, book illustrations, etc.) in one place, but don't expect high quality, accuracy, or complete information from this publication. The publishers of this catalog should take lessons from Descharnes and Neret whose \\"Dali: The Paintings\\" publication is a masterpiece of accuracy and quality that is 300% bigger than this official catalog and costs 75% less."},{"Title":"The official catalog of the graphic works of Salvador Dali","review":"This is an interesting book if you are looking for information on forgeries and fakes in Dali art, but I found the 2-volume work by Prestell to be more informative on Dali's authentic lithographs and etchings.

I mean I cannot tell you how many times I have seen fakes with a COA a COA is basically worthless piece of paper IMO unless it comes from a handfull of people who I know to be reputable. Albert Field was a close friend of Dali's and this book was his life's work. Yes there are a few errors in the book as some has said.

Brigach? Furtwangen?), to the Black Sea is alternatingly scintillating and impenetrably dense. It is fully possible that many of the stylistic difficulties that occur hear arise out of the translation process.Despite the occasional obfuscation, this is a deeply intriguing book. I picked it up, thinking that it may perhaps successfully do for the Donau (Danube) what Rebecca West's monumental &quot;Black lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; did for Yugoslavia, namely to serve as a marvelous compilation of historical narratives and anecdotes, sort of a &quot;reference point for the ages&quot;. In this, &quot;Danube&quot; does not disappoint. There may be thousands of more readable books, but this one is rare, in that it blends so wonderfully narrative, history, and anecdote. Ultimately even the denseness of the prose may be a virtue...it reduces the reader's speed, allowing us to better digest and reflect upon its contents. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"In this fascinating journey, Magris takes us from the very -and much disputed- sources of the Danube in the Black Forest, in Southern Germany, to the mouth of the river in the Black Sea, in Romanian territory. Along the way, Magris recreates the legends, stories and historical moments of every village and city he visits. The Danube area is, of course, full of history, since most peoples who ever set foot in Europe seem to have crossed it one way or another. Princes, wars, writers, lovers, many interesting and even fascinating stories illuminate for the reader the waters of the Danube. It really makes you want to make the same trip.It would be interesting to read an update by Magris, especially about those places who were then under Soviet rule, now that almost 20 years have passed since the publication of the book. Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia all pass before your eyes like a dream.Every town and story motivates in Magris deep reflections on history, memory, the passage of time, politics, and many other subjects. Magris's prose is dense in the best sense of the term: it is rich and deep, with a poetic quality to it. Very much recommended, it discovers for us many writers from that area who seem worth to read."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"DanubeClaudio Magris2001ISBN 1-86046-823-3I have seen the Danube at Donauwoerth in Germany and Linz and Melk in Austria. When I came across Claudio Magris' book, I was interested enough to buy it. Magris' book about the Danube is an unusual one. It is not a travel book, but more the historical reflections of a man visiting centuries-old towns along the river from where it originates in Germany to where it ends in the Black Sea in Rumania.Since I have visited or read about some of the towns along the Danube in the German-speaking world, I found that part of the book more interesting. I knew less about the other countries -- Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Rumania, and I did not relate as well to that part of the book.On the whole, there are some obstacles to overcome in reading this book. The writer's style is rather wordy and rambling. In one sentence, for example, I counted seventy-five words. There are endless literary and historical references, many of which are somewhat obscure. For me, eventually they grew tiresome. The book, in English, is a translated work. At points, one wonders if the rendering of sentences such as, \\"That life which the photograph fixed in one of its instants is vanished forever\\", could not have been translated in plainer English.Still, some of this book is good reading. Magris' story about the director of the river works at Linz who spent a lifetime marking out the confines of the upper Danube and wrote a three volume work of 2,164 pages about all the aspects of the river from the different types of rafts and barges to the poems, songs, plays, and novels that related to the river is amusing. At the other extreme, Magris' description of visiting the terrible stone quarry at Mauthausen concentration camp that the Nazis set up on the Danube, where 110,000 people died, is disturbing.On the whole, I would say this book is interesting reading in places. Elsewhere, it drags a bit. For example, consider a sentence such as, \\"Are the Istrians therefore Thracians, as Apollodorus thought, or Colchians, according to the view of Pliny and Strabo, or are they Gepids? \\"Perhaps, the main problem with \\"Danube\\" is that the scope and coverage of the book are simply too great. The countries through which the lower reaches of the Danube flow do not have so much in common with those of the German-speaking part of the Danube. Like the Nile, it is a very long river, and, similarly it comes into contact with a number of lands with differing cultural traditions and histories. The Danube as an organizational theme for Magris' reflections about history and literature falters in the face of the great diversity of the material. Also, there is the question of if this book is really about the Danube or more a vehicle for Magris' wide-ranging interests."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"Throughout history, the Danube has meant many different things to many different people: a highway, a playground, a barrier against the Turks, a symbol of eternal life or of life's melancholy. Magris structures this book as a travelogue, following the Danube from its source(s) in Germany through its debouchment into the Black Sea in Rumania. But in every place he visits, from a humble bench on the riverbank to the major cities of Vienna and Bucharest, he paints a vivid picture not only of the place itself, but of the people who have shaped its character and history.I already knew that this region (for which he uses the shorthand term Mitteleuropa) had a complicated history, but I didn't realize how incredibly complicated it was until I read this book. Magris doesn't always untangle the complexities clearly enough for a non-European (and, from living briefly in the region as well as having family roots there, I'm probably better informed than most). On the other hand, his portraits of the people he meets are vivid and memorable -- from the old woman who presides over the 18th-century farmhouse where the Danube (possibly) rises, to the fisher-folk who live at the mouths of the river, to the functionaries and innkeepers who punctuate his journey and the friends who accompany him for parts of it. Writers, living and dead, are evoked as much as politicians and historians; one persistent theme of the book is how literature has reacted to, preserved, and in some instances shaped the history of Mitteleuropa.All in all, the book is a magnificent achievement and well worth reading, even if some of Magris' observations have been rendered obsolete by the breakup of the Soviet Union. The translation is generally fluid and readable, although one can quibble with it here and there (I found a few minor inaccuracies in the sections that describe places I'm familiar with). And, as for the complaint that the regions traversed by the Danube are \\"too different\\" to be treated in one book, that difference *is* part of the story."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"Claudi Magris's work is simply the best travelogue that I have ever read: it is a work of imagination, erudition, and deeply-felt culture, and has been beautifully translated: I have never encountered English prose that better captures the cadence and rhythm of Italian!"},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"This is an excellent book, far from conventional travel writing, a combination of travelogue and philosophical essay, a personal appreciation of the cultural and literary landscape of the Danube. Written with a slightly melancholy tone and extensive knowledge and sensitivity, it is erudite and learned but not academic. With short chapters a few pages long (some are only a paragraph or two), the book is more like a series of thoughts or tableaux than a single essay. This format might reflect how we acquire cultural knowledge in bits and pieces and is well suited to conveying a subject so nuanced and many-layered. Places along the Danube inspire reflections on history, identity, nationalism, fascism, the confrontation between the West and Islam, the abuse of power, ethnic and racial prejudice and hatred, artistic creativity, the nature of time, and our human condition and mortality. Along the way we encounter Goethe, Grillparzer, Napoleon, Kepler, Kafka, Heidegger, Celan, Marcus Aurelius, Ovid, Eliade and other luminaries, as well as a Serbian grandmother and Trieste resident who revisits her home in the Banat and provides insights on the relationships among the many nationalities there. As a professor of German literature, Claudio Magris is especially attentive to the vanished or vanishing German communities of southeastern Europe.Any journey along the Danube inevitably raises unanswerable questions: What is Europe? Where does it begin and end? While Magris might not answer these, he looks beneath shifting borders and changing regimes; since the book was written, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union have been replaced by other political entities. He is able to find beauty (or at least food for thought) in unlikely places and lends credibility to the idea of a shared Danubian culture or civilization. Several place-names are misspelled, no doubt the fault of the editor/publisher, not the author; observations on life under communism are now happily out of date. Many of the intellectual and literary figures Magris discusses may be obscure, but if you have spent time in this part of the world you will find his book meaningful. Anyone seriously interested in the Habsburg Empire or Austria-Hungary should read it. One wants to say thank you to Professor Magris for taking us along."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"This is a delightfully translated, rich and ornate, not so much travelogue as intellectual and literary history, of what Magris is pleased to term Mitteleuropa. Indeed, the reader looking for actual descriptions of the Danube will fine them few and far between, whereas the intellectual - capital I - reader will find a Sm&ouml;rgsbord of poets and writers of all sorts who have dwelt along the banks of the Danube for centuries.Magris, though his prose may come across as dense at times, is actually a bon-vivant with a rather breezy, hedonistic take on life. This is fortunate, for it serves to leaven the sometimes ponderous meditations the reader comes across.This duality of text and attitude is nicely encapsulated in the first two paragraphs of the chapter entitled \\"Believing In Ulm\\".On the one hand, in the first paragraph:\\"But all that is real is being erased each instant, even if luckily not always in the bloodstained theatre of phosphorous bombs. Little by little, however, things are imperceptibly erased, and one cannot do otherwise than believe that they nonetheless exist.\\"On the other hand, in the second:\\"We are happy in the company of people who make us feel the unquestionable presence of the world, just as the body of the beloved gives us the certainty of those shoulders, that bosom, that curve of the hips, the surge of those as incontestable as the sea.\\"In general, there is a tendency to delve to a greater or lesser extent into the life and works of a writer or thinker, whetting the reader's appetite, and then, quite often, drolly cock a snook at said individual before moving on to a writer who dwelt further down the Danube. This is nowhere more evident than in his treatment of the Hungarian writer Georg Luk&aacute;cs, on whom Magris dwells for some time before jauntily quipping in the penultimate paragraph that: \\"From his window he could see the great Danube, but he probably had little appreciation of it, insensitive as he was to nature, which in his eyes was blemished by not having read Kant or Hegel.\\"The result of all this? A bit of a mixed bag, I should say. As Magris says of another writer, \\"The result is that he says too little and too much at the same time.\\" Be this as it may, the author is widely read and the book is quite fun to read for the intellectual traveller who doesn't mind being taken down a Danube of history and ideas, if not the actual river."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"The book is a dense collection of thoughts, experiences, reflections and recollections, which begin at the source of the Danube and end at the terminus with the Black Sea. I picked up this book for a trip in the eastern European region, with many stops along the Danube. While the book is packed with a wide array of historical, literary and artistic references, I found the exposure to new ideas refreshing, even if they disrupt the flow of the book at times. The translation from the artistic Italian prose to English seems to create unnecessarily dense wording at times, but the comprehensive collage of imagery made the book worthwhile in the end. To me, I found the style of writing like the flow of the massive Danube: sometimes it slowly swirls reflectively, but it constantly moves onwards..."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"The best book of an age is a brave new form of imagination and wisdom. \\"Danube\\" is a post-generic transcendence of art and vision to an unknown zodiac of meaning. When a book is a leap of creativity, it is an honor to be a reader.A majestic book of 401 pages and 170 chapters, \\"Danube\\" follows a mighty river(of 2,888km) from beginning to end as a journey of knowledge--of time, space, history and fate--to find not only where the river ends but also where time, space, history and fate end: in \\"God's plans.\\" To know anything fully from beginning to end in an absolute feat of knowledge--the way Magris knows the Danube from the Black Forest to the Black Sea--is to know everything.At the heart of \\"Danube\\" is a visionary outlook on time as a vastness of centuries of meaning that resides like a cosmos in a nutshell in any moment or place of our lives. Every place along the Danube is \\"a corner in which a vanished enchantment has taken refuge.\\" In a memorable metaphor, Magris sees the countless years of time and history that have \\"mysteriously disappeared forever\\" as \\"fallen leaves\\" that accumulate like \\"humus\\" in the places where we live and in whose unknown depths lie the roots of who we are. For Magris, history settles as geography. With a preternatural vision of \\"wave after wave\\" of history--from the dim ancient days of the eighth century B.C. of the Thracians, Cimmerians and Scythians through the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Hapsburgs to the 1981 Nobel Prize for Literature to Elias Canetti--\\"superimposed and deposited one upon another in layer after layer\\" as \\"the multiple, composite substratum\\" of Danubian landscapes and lives, Magris unpacks history out of geography or time out of space. In following a river from place to place across a continent, \\"Danube\\" is a mythic descent into buried lives and races, dynasties and empires, ideologies and movements and epochs and civilizations that becomes a miracle of ascent to an ageless meaning untouched by \\"the incalculable loss of things.\\"Written out of encyclopedic learning radiant with moral lustre and unrestricted by the contracting conventions of a particular genre, \\"Danube\\" is free and \\"abundant\\" as a travelogue, a collection of essays, a handbook of biographies, a journal of meditations, a treatise of human geography, a history of \\"Mitteleuropa,\\" a volume of literary criticism and a book of books all bound with artistic accessories of imagination of the craft of fiction into a post-generic \\"confederation\\" of writing and reality.In \\"Danube,\\" Magris has re-invented the book as a signifying expression and experience. Magris's book brings to mind the history of the book as a form of expression and a structure of experience and strikes us as beyond comparison with any other book.An immaculate unity of heart, mind and spirit as a dignity of truth and beauty in words and a profound composition of selfless surrender to \\"the ultimate and essential things\\" in which a book becomes a state of being, \\"Danube\\" is simply the best book of our time. A soaring act of writing and a sublime structure of wisdom, \\"Danube\\" is an omega of solace. With an epic solidarity with everything from beginning to end in a chorus of faculties of awareness of unknown intellectual, emotional, aesthetic and spiritual synthesis, Claudio Magris is writer as hero of wisdom."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"I bought the book to prepare for a river cruise down the Danube. I expected more of a connection between locations and stories.Too many of the stories are stream-of-conscousness."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"I am only a few chapters into this book but having traveled the general area this past summer I am really looking forward to reading more of this. I love the writing style."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"You really have to be in the right mood to read this. In an odd way, the writing is at the same time dense and spacy. A bit of diarrhea of the thoughts. The description on the back cover refers to Magris' vast knowledge. This may be, but that's no excuse for what might to some seem like an inability to stay on any kind of track. One image leads to ponderings, which leads to more ponderings and it isn't always easy to remember what caused the mild wandering in the first place. That having been said, there really are times when this is precisely what one wants to read. A long afternoon, some tea, time to ponder, this is when this book can shine. At any case, I wouldn't really describe this as a travelogue, travel guide or even social history. Instead, I would suggest a more rhapsodic, less rigid form or genre definition, though I've no idea what that would be."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"This book records one man's journey, but because this man is so many, it's more like the record of a migration."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"This man's mind may be a teeming foam of erudition but, no, that does not mean he can write. Even I scored high on comprehension in english test scores at college and let me tell you there are even paragraphs in this book that are true brain-twisters. No excuses- a good author can convey complex thoughts without sheer verbosity.And he can't make up his mind what he's talking about- spending a page and half tediously illustrating 'Noteentiendo' then dismissing its relevance to him due to a bend in the river.So where is HIS flow then ? In general he seems to write meanings into things for the hell of it then defuse it with the vaguest of contradictions. And abstract refences where i loose track of any Danube relevance.Sometimes he's plain wacky ie; why would Egyptians historically make comparisons of the Danube with the Nile? Since the moslems never invaded past Vienna; only barely and only once. Surely Egypians might wonder about the Oxus in central asia, if ever.Thank you but Rebbeca West did this type of travelogue and overlapping-finely-detailed writing infinitley better in 'Grey lamb black falcon'and with some beautifully poetic asides that this academic is too convoluted be capable of."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"I found the style of this book to be pretentious and blustery, with a strong whiff of academic bluster. The off-putting style was, alas, the only thing that held together this collection of dry, inconsequential and not very amusing anecdotes.Perhaps Margis has journeyed along the Danube, perhaps it has a particular and unexpected meaning for him, but the writing is so disengaged, and yet so devoid of the grace of irony, that it feels like a schoolboy's assignment. There is too much information, and the information is not even interesting. There are no filters; what you get is a kind of data noise, like when looking up a complicated query on google. At the same time, there is no redeeming bibliography, there are no useful references, no illuminations of a bibliography.Nor is there a sense of the Danube's majesty as a river, as an experience of travel. It is wondrous, how Margis manages to convey no evidence whatsoever that he has indeed ever seen what he is writing about with his own eyes. Margis here is a mediocre recycler of other people's writing--and to make it worse, the book is fatally weakened by his empty efforts to suggest that he is doing something more."},{"Title":"Danube A sentimental journey from the source to the Black Sea","review":"The greatest book I ever read in my lif"},{"Title":"Erasmus of the Low Countries","review":"A book written by a man who has become very well aquainted with the subject matter.

All within the context of the times."},{"Title":"Erasmus of the Low Countries","review":"This book is excellent for gaining a cursory understanding of Erasmus, some of his works ,and various elements that helped him develop his ideas. Tracy has done a good job of trying to walk the middle ground and has done an admirable job of laying the details down without trying to interpret them too much. An excellent starting point for those who wish to study Erasmus."},{"Title":"Erasmus of the Low Countries","review":"I am writing this review principally to negate the previous reviewer who said that this book's merit consists in giving a \\"cursory\\" understanding of Erasmus. Pity the scholar who receives praise like that. It is especially unfair and, let me say stupid, in this book's case. First, it is very difficult to summarize any complicated historical subject well and accurately. Second, in this specific case the issues that concerned Erasmus his whole life are so easily confused with the great events of history -- The Reformation -- that his peculiar qualities are scarcely understood most of the time. I have read quite a few books on Erasmus, but not until I read this one did I feel I had a grasp on his unique position in the process of Western intellectual history. So, while I can imagine this book being a good introduction, it is clearly simply wrong to imply that is all it is. It is a masterful piece of precise scholarly focus on an individual and ideas that are are still very misunderstood in our culture. This misunderstanding is a great to the detriment of our culture. Therefore, in my view, this is a culturally crucial book."},{"Title":"Erasmus of the Low Countries","review":"Tracy states clearly that his aim in this work is to show Erasmus's efforts to reform the Church through a reformation of the *doctrina* of the day. Thus this book is less of a personal biography, offering instead a well-developed picture of Erasmus as a thinker within the various currents in the 16th century Church. Tracy also provides an interested analysis of the classical and Patristic sources that formed the Rotterdam humanist's own doctrina--so there are some nice passages exploring the influence of Augustine, Origen, and, of course, Jerome.This book is well written, and--with the exception of the unavoidable profusion of difficult Eastern-European names and the occasional meticulously detailed account of some minor court or other's political maneuvering--it offers a very nice introduction to the mind of Erasmus alongside the mind of the age... and that without neglecting to give the reader a sense of familiarity with the man himself."},{"Title":"The Cult of the Budgerigar","review":"&quot;Cult of the Budgerigar&quot;, by W.

Her intent, which has a much larger scope than a memoir with the structure of a simple diary, seemes to be to humanize and personalize the wartime chaos and utter dehumanization of 1940s France under Nazi domination. She sets a record about the Holocaust. She makes a monument rather than writes a diary. This is why her memoir rises above those that Lichtenberg criticizes, those that &quot;seem a pornography of emotions, offering up whatever excess of misery will provoke a fleeting response&quot;; what he calls, &quot;a talk-show between book covers.&quot; The War is crafted not written. You won't find mind-numbing cliches but only imaginative language. And the language will move you."},{"Title":"The War: A Memoir.","review":"This memoir is a very heartfelt testiment to love, longing, hunger, suspicion, pain and regret. It is always a treat when a writer of Duras' caliber is witness to extraordinary events and the reader is pulled along as she desperately tries to find out information about her imprisoned husband. The fact that the episodes are presented out of order is slightly disconcerting I felt in the sense that the book becomes a collection of several periods rather than a linear narrative."},{"Title":"The War: A Memoir.","review":"Duras' writing can be painfully self-involved,examining emotions and intellectual reactions to emotional states until the reader feels suffocated. The War: A Memoir is no less personally intense, but the subject is the author's experiences during the Nazis occupation of Paris. Her brutal examination of her trials and the suffering of her fellow Parisians is riveting. Her painful honesty helps the reader to answer the question, \\"What would I have done?\\""},{"Title":"WWF Attitude","review":"I remember when I bought the video game &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; in 1999, my local video game store had a special where you could buy this unauthorized strategy guide for only $5, instead of the retail price of $12. I thought this was a good idea, so I ended up buying it. Little did I know that this guide wasn't even worth one penny, much less five dollars. Let me just state everything that's wrong with this guide:First and foremost, the ONLY reason why people get strategy guides on wrestling games is so that they know how to do each move. I couldn't really believe it at first, but this book is completely wrong on everything in this game. I can't really even see how something like this could get published.The controls for doing each move is wrong. I've tried many, many times to do some of the moves in this game by using the controls listed in this guide, but none of them worked.Lots of information is completely wrong. This guide lists that wrestlers such as The Godfather are secret characters thatneed to be unlocked, while other wrestlers like Kurrgan and TAKA Michinoku aren't secret. In reality, both Kurrgan and TAKA Michinoku are secret characters, while The Godfather isn't.One more thing, I've noticed that some wrestler's names are misspelled. I remember they list Road Dogg as being named &quot;Road Hog&quot;.Even if you ignore all of those previous faults, there's still one huge flaw to this guide: It's completely useless. In the official game itself, when you press start and go down to &quot;Move List&quot;, it tells you what moves your wrestler can do and what controls work to perform them, so there really isn't any need to get this guide."},{"Title":"Five Steps to Forgiveness: The Art and Science of Forgiving","review":"Dr. Worthington's latest book is certain to lead the reader forward on the path to forgiving another.

The author tells a great story about how he forgave his mother's murderer, something I don't think I could ever do. I had hated my ex-husband for years, and I had tried hard to forgive. I read a lot of books on forgiveness-both religious and self-help. This is the best I've read. I liked his five steps. They were easy to do and easy to remember, but the best thing was his sections on forgiving ourselves and on talking about old wounds with others (in the last half of the book). His whole approach was really practical. The book was written well, with lots of stories and several laugh-out-loud stories. I have tried to do what the book recommended and I seem to have been able to forgive myself more than ever and to forgive my ex. I don't think I'll ever get completely over our fighting, but at least I could let go of some of my hate and feel some empathy for him. I think this has been pretty much a life changer for me.

He does an excellent job of outlining each of the vital steps to both forgiving and reconciling old wounds. His inclusion of real life examples, both from his own life and the lives of others, on how (and when) to implement these steps, gives this piece a personal touch that allows the reader and the author to relate to one another.

Very appropriately, he segments his descriptive chapters into Gameswhich reflect the different singlestick traditions of singlestick in 19th-century Britain. Game I being the contained system described in Hughes Tom Browns School Days, updated to avoid the aggravating bleeding head wounds that terminated early Victorian bouts. A second large practical chapter is based on R.G. Allanson-Winn and C. Phillipps Wolleys Broadsword and Singlestick (1920), reflecting the continental and military traditions of the singlestick as the training weapon for broadsword and saber. To squeeze the book into the more marketable category of self defense, a quickie chapter is devoted to the use of the stick against thugs. The publisher supplied the appropriate yet oddly out-of-placedrawings of grim, muscular bogey men in need of a shave and a haircut, and how you can stop them from evildoing by a quick thrust into their aviator glasses. Other chapters deal with how you can make cheap, durable weapons yourselfjust in case your local wickerwork store does not supply singlestick hilts.

This monograph, \\"The Colonial Background of the American Revolution,\\" seeks to reverse the general habit of trying to justify rather than explain, and the tendency by early nineteenth century historians to concentrate exclusively on the years of the conflict, without exploring in any detail the nearly two centuries of colonial experience that preceded it.England may have stumbled blindly into empire and the American colonists may have moved in a slow, clumsy manner toward self government, but these inexorable movements in opposite directions were destined to strain colonial relations, Andrews argues. Just as England was coming to the realization that it needed greater control and authority over its vast colonial holdings, the American colonies were realizing that they were developing an independent self-identity. Thus, the hundred years before the Stamp Act mark a \\"silent revolution\\" that was gradual, yet profound; balancing the needs of establishing an imperial domain while placating a radical colonial population were irreconcilable.Despite the effects of this silent revolution, Andrews maintains that cooperation and conciliation could have prevented the American War for Independence. Thus, the American Revolution was more the product of obstinacy and radicalism by British and Colonial elite, respectively, than it was of any true principle of liberty. Ultimately, however, the two competing parties simply failed to understand one another, according to Andrews. Although they came from the same racial stock and institutional tradition, two hundred years of life apart had left an indelible impression. Americans were imbued with the \\"spirit of the frontier\\" and a fierce drive for independence and self government, all feelings that the common Englishman of the eighteenth century were incapable of understanding. But even if they could appreciate the motivations behind the revolts and were willing to explore conciliation, the British government simply could not accept the colonial argument of the solubility of Parliamentary laws without directly threatening the entire foundation on which the British empire rested.From the perspective of official London, there was only one proper response to the behavior and increasingly strident demands of the colonial radicals: physical coercion. Brute force, not conciliation, was the answer. Colonial grievances, Andrews says, were in no way interpreted as legitimate claims or as an expression of a newly developed concept of naturals rights or liberty. Rather, they were viewed as craven examples of colonial ingratitude and treasonous disrespect. The author claims that this disdain for popular dissent among the governing elite was not dissimilar from the \\"gag rule\\" over slavery instituted by American Congressional lawmakers in the early nineteenth century.Andrews maintains that the Revolution was a direct result of two native, ruling elites with a total inability to empathize with the other and an irrational unwillingness to even try. In addition, he cites a host of minor causes. Among them are: 1) Royal Governors, who either failed to appreciate the inadequacies of Royal colonial government or understand the fundamental changes that had taken place in colonial society (often both); 2) Privy Council, which even more than the Royal governors failed to grasp the need for change in colonial administration; and 3) Crown Legal Advisors, who almost to a man maintained a strict interpretation of existing legislation, which condemned colonial actions out of hand for legal reasons and gave the ruling authorities the motivation to maintain a very hard line in dealing with the radicals.Interestingly, it is only after 1774 that Andrews believes that King George III deserves any culpability in the events leading to the Revolution, and that overall the King has been made a scapegoat. He was surrounded, the author argues, by officials who refused to depart in any way from a strict interpretation of the law. Although, over time, George became a true believer in the value of coercion as the only way to settle the situation, Andrews continues. In a way, the American Revolution was like Vietnam for the George III administration. All close advisors urged a hardline policy and threatened that failure to respond with resolute action tempted a domino scenario throughout the empire, as one profitable colony after another fell to self-determination. Once engaged in a costly war, many former advocates became critics and the timeless argument of sunk costs reared its baleful head. George III ultimately had to find an exit for a war his advisors had created.\\"The Colonial Background of the American Revolution\\" might be a rather arcane, academic history of early American history, but it's one that reads well and retains its relevance nearly a century after its initial publication. The fact that it is still in print is testimony to its enduring value."},{"Title":"Getting Along Almost with Your Adult Kids: A Decade-By-Decade Guide","review":"I purchased this book to seek some guidance on how to build a balanced, mutually respectful, adult relationship with my 20-something daughter. This book did not deliver. I read it twice, thinking I missed either the humor/sarcasm or the main point the first time around. The message I got from my reading was that to have a good relationship with your adult child, you must expect almost nothing - not consideration, not good manners, not time, not communication. In return, you should be willing to be there at all times to offer endless emotional support, time, and money. Thus, if you expect nothing from your children, you will not be disappointed by whatever attention they give you. I expected something far more balanced and constructive than the one-sided view that was offered.The authors do a dis-service to all adult children by taking the viewpoint that they are no more than large-sized toddlers who should be indulged and humored. Negligence and bad manners are just dismissed as their \\"being too busy\\" or \\"too absorbed with their own lives.\\" Parents will be checked-in with from time to time just to make sure they are still there. Otherwise, the kids really don't care. These are not healthy ways for any adults to interact.A recurring theme in this book is, as parents, to do anything to preserve the relationship. After a while, I began wondering \\"what relationship?\\"If you are considering this book, I would suggest that you read it in conjunction with others on this topic.

One night, his wish comes true in a way he never imagined when his island is invaded by fiends, the Heartless, and he is swept away to a strange new place. In this new city, Traverse Town, he meets Donald and Goofy, who are searching for the missing King Mickey, as well as some of the characters from the Final Fantasy series. In hopes of finding his own missing friends, Sora joins Donald and Goofy as they prepare to travel to other worlds in search of clues. Part one concludes with the end of their adventure in the first world they visit, Wonderland.I really loved the Kingdom Hearts game so I was looking forward to reading the manga when I learned about it. The art is very cute and it's a fun way to go through the story again without replaying a 30 hour game, especially with the Kingdom Hearts II game coming out soon. I'd recommend the manga to all Kingdom Hearts fans and I look forward to reading the other three volumes."},{"Title":"Kingdom Hearts: Volume 1","review":"It is great. All the adventure of kingdom hearts in this series. I enjoyed the first volume. The characters are beautifully drawn, it has good dialogue, and it matches nicely with the game. The only two bad things1. I read graphic novels which are usually around 200 pages, this is only 135 pages. But it is a book and not a graphic novel so i guess it works out.2. Only one volume every 3 months. Thats 3 months you can finish one in 2 hours. Number 2 isnt coming out until january and number three in april.I reccomend this book to anybody who loves kingdom hearts or doesnt want to play the game. And it is a lot cheaper only 5.99 that is cheap compared to 7.99-9.99 for viz. I love viz and that is a great price too but for 5.99 i can afford it without a second thought!!! Buy it if you are looking for a good story or if you like the game."},{"Title":"Kingdom Hearts: Volume 1","review":"I have seen some of my friends play this game and I ended up buying it for myself. I played a bit of the game and stopped because I didn't have the time to go through another long RPG. I figured that if I read the manga, I would get the basic story of the game without having to play through 60+ hours. After reading the first two volumes I realized that it is a very basic rehashing of the story with little detail. It just goes over pieces of main plot elements thus making it rather choppy/jumpy.I would have liked to see a little bit more action, suspense, scenery, and character development. Instead I'm shown with the picture of a bad guy on one page, Sora and friends exclaim that they are going to kill it, and he is dead on the next page. Kinda boring if you ask me. I would also like to point out the fact that each chapter (called episodes in the book) is very short. In fact, each volume (there are 4 total) is only about 130 pages compared to most mangas which are about 200. I think they could have fleshed out the chapters a little more and made it a more interesting read. I don't understand how they thought they could cram a long RPG into only 4 volumes.In conclusion, I would much rather spend the 60+ hours playing the actual game and experiencing the storytelling via the wonderful in game scenery, music, and cgi. At least I would be getting the whole story they way it was meant to be told. However, I am sure this would be a great gift for people who have already played the game and like to collect anything related to it."},{"Title":"Kingdom Hearts: Volume 1","review":"I had heard of this video game from my cousin.

When we awaken in the morning, it is our body that awakens for Consciousness, what wereally are, never sleeps. We can learn to live from the heart.Being aware of what I see, what I smell, what I taste, what Ihear, what I am touching, what I am thinking, takes me to a place of Silent Observation. This is what Jean Klein and other Self Realized Masters teach. We are the Self that shines on the world. I am not in the world, the world is in me.Don't just read this book, digest it.Namaste,Michael"},{"Title":"The Ease of Being","review":"Jean Klein has the ability to create the stillness necessary to see the silent knowingness which Advaita Vedanta or other non-duality traditions point to.Jean invites us to watch the mind, notice that we desire and fear, witness the arising of jealousy and greed. And in this simple looking without the desire for an outcome, we may find ourselves resting in being - the natural state.Jean shows us that when we simply notice what's happening in the mind, a space is created, we are immediately outside the suffering - watching as an observer. And in this - we may see that it's all happening in our consciousness/awareness.This book isn't the easiest to read - it's not a new-age spirituality book, filled with feel-good methods and processes which are intended to make the \\"person\\" better. If this, or anything else written by Jean Klein, is read with no attachment to attaining something or getting somewhere, this simple silent presence of being may be noticed as your natural and already-present state."},{"Title":"The Ease of Being","review":"I suppose I have to admit to a certain amount of bias for the Advaita teachings, but this bias has come at the expence of much effort to translate what many teachers have to to say given their cultural background. This book presents Advaita in wonderfully warm and simple language. Jean Klein provides one of the most aticulate presentations of these teachings available and yet almost completely free from the use of Hindu and Sanskrit terms or popular \\"insider\\" language. My feeling is that this reflects his own realization."},{"Title":"The Ease of Being","review":"\\"There's no person to answer personal questions. I listen to your question and I listen to the answer. The answer comes out of silence.\\"The essence of non-duality is Jean Klein. The same Absolute that speaks through Nisargadatta and Ramana speaks beautifully through Jean Klein. His writings are perhaps more suited for the Western tuned mind. His words cut sharply and deeply and actually push one toward the non-dual. Others can talk the talk but there is no mistaking the words of a truly realized master.This is one of four JK books I've read to date and while they are all different they are all basically about the same thing. I noticed with some authors that the later in life they wrote the book the more enlightened it seemed to me. I felt his book \\"I Am\\" more deeply than the other three so far.It's a shame that he, like the fabulous Paul Brunton, is not more widely known."},{"Title":"The Ease of Being","review":"The really wonderful thing about this book is that it is seemingly \\"new\\" each time you pick it up. A line or paragraph that touched you in one manner at one time will inspire a completely new experience on a second or third read at a later date.

Every paragraph, every line, exudes truth. Lately I have begun to think of those monks in the middle ages that had to copy, by hand, word by word, certain religious texts, perhaps the Bible even. With Jean Klein The Ease of Being, this is what naturally happens, what you have to be 'careful' about actually not to do - to simultaneously read and write down the entire book.Here is no esoteric language, no way not to be penetrated and slowly saturated by the wisdom, freedom and love of these teacher's words. And you can hardly read more than 10 pages at a stretch, because each paragraph has the potential, has to power, to bring, indeed, the ease of being, relaxation, inner silence, admiration/wonder.These is one of the few books of which I know: this is all you need. If you align yourself with the message of this book, listen, learn, be open and receptive to it's depth and immediate transformational impact, if you follow through with sincerity and consistency - there is no other book, no other teacher to search for, in principle. The clarity and utter simplicity with which our true nature as formless consciousness is expounded in this book, has occasionally stirred up some feelings of 'shame and guilt' for not being enlightened yet, though that is of course an illusory thought. And this is only half a joke.Almost every time I open this book, and read just a few lines, a wide, joyful, liberating, grateful smile appears spontaneously on my face. And my relationship with a friend I recommended this book to, and with whom I am living in the same house, is greatly enriched by our mutual recognition and appreciation. When we look at each other, we often have to smile, because both of us are thinking about some line, some gem, from the Ease of Being.Namaste."},{"Title":"Kids' Incredible Fishing Stories","review":"This book is really awesome!

Imagine trying to choose three -- rarely as much as five -- answers to represent everything these 5,000-plus men had to say in response to each of the 313 questions. Do you choose the most representative answer? The wittiest? The funniest? Most thoughtful? Most shocking?In many cases, it is obvious the authors have chosen one or two of the latter ... but how is a reader to know which answers best represent the majority of the male sex? As a man, I found some of the vitriol and caricaturing of the male sex indulged in by some of the interviewees to be as bad (and inaccurate) as anything I've ever heard a woman say about men. What does this do for us?The information in this book has all the titillation -- and corresponding weightlessness -- of secrets shared by an utter stranger at a cocktail party. There's no context for the content; it's of no earthly use to the reader beyond a fleeting instant of entertainment. The book is rather like a greatly extended version of a typical women's magazine article for which the reporter has chatted with three to five friends and thereupon uses the conversations either to construct a portrait of the sexes whole cloth, or merely to confirm her own preexisting conception of how the sexes relate and play."},{"Title":"Life Is Worth Living: First and Second Series","review":"Archbishop Fulton J.

The marketing \\"zing\\" that the product proclaims - \\"every Catholic household should own a copy\\" - is very accurate. Fulton Sheen was born in 1895 and went to God Our Father in 1979. Substitute the cold war examples of his day with current day visual images of oppression/violence that we still suffer here in the 21st century and the presentations still awe you today as they most probably did on radio, and television when the program was in its peak.\\"Awe, you say?\\" Yes AWE. At this fact and this fact alone. Bishop Sheen orated the 24 disks from memory?!?!?! without reference to any notes!! When you hear him say that (disk 1) and listen attentively to what is said per disk/per topic of faith, one can only be left in awe in what was clearly a man blessed with the gifts of Wisdom, Knowledge, Understanding and Piety. The ways in which the articles of faith, and the teachings of the Church are presented are timeless and in total accord with the Will of God, the Tradition of the Church and the teachings of the Church Fathers.The original media format change to compact disk is clear on 23 of 24 cd's. The final disk, the clarity is not as sound and crisp - most probably due to the fact that the talk seems to have been re-recorded from a different source - ie., from a live talk on a certain location as opposed to a studio. In any event....To ANY Catholic_____ who desires to obtain a more full and deeper understanding of the Faith - to know what you believe and why you believe it________ (or protestant brother/sister in Christ who is near conversion or in the process thereof) I STRONGLY recommend this product.

If you click on the product image you can peruse the contents of the paperback version of Ignatius Press' \\"Life Is Worth Living\\", which consists of transcripts of the TV show from the early 50's. However, the contents of the CDs are not from the \\"Life is Worth Living\\" show, rather I think they are catechetic instructions that Bishop Sheen recorded (without an audience) in the early 1960's. The narrative is by Sheen, not by Alexander Scourby, as described. Listening to Bishop Sheen rather that Alexander Scourby certainly isn't a disappointment, and the contents of the talks are exemplary, but the talks themselves are not from \\"Life Is Worth Living\\". In fact the talks on the CDs are available from other websites in mp3 format for free.In the late 1970's/early 1980's Ministr-O-Media issued multiple volumes of the \\"Life Is Worth Living\\" soundtracks on cassette.

I watched and listened to Bishop Sheen's &#34;Life is Worth Living&#34; on many of those afternoons. His thoughts and presentations were riveting to me. When I got my Kindle and discovered his book was available as an ebook, I ordered and read it.

I'm too young to remember Fr. Sheen's TV show (from which these are transcripts) but now certainly would love to see some reruns. Despite the age of these transcripts they are not at all dated. Also, for those who may be turned off because of Sheen's religion (He's a Catholic) please do not be. His shows were very popular to people of all faiths and after reading this I can see why. His topics aren't at all dogmatic and are very well reasoned and even entertaining. Also, given the state of things today and knowing that these were written many decades ago some of it is quite prophetic."},{"Title":"Life Is Worth Living: First and Second Series","review":"I wish I had more to say about this book, but it covers a completely different set of themes in each chapter, so there's just not much I can do to summarize it. Still, here goes.This is a book by Bishop Sheen, written by imperfectly transcribing a few dozen episodes of his classic show; Life is Worth Living. I say \\"imperfectly,\\" only because the transcriptions aren't strictly word-for-word. It's really very well-done.Now, that having been said, if you know anything about Bishop Sheen, you know what a clever wit and a powerful speaker he was, to say nothing of being one of the most honest and faithful Catholics in America. Even his worst work is exceptionally-good, and this is some of his best; the strong, solid messages that kept millions and millions of Americans watching him week after week, even in a prime-time slot that competed with Frank Sinatra and Milton Berle.The chapters of this book are well-divided into such topics as mothers, war, character-building, education, suffering, teenagers, prayer and tolerance (the last being one of my favorites, for debunking several myths about tolerance that we as a culture have been terminally suffering from since his death.)I don't say this kind of thing often, but I really think that anyone who has any desire to see a truly balanced world view described (Catholic or otherwise) would benefit from reading this book. It's Bishop Sheen at his finest and most faithful, and when you get down to it, you can't give a book a much bigger compliment than that."},{"Title":"Life Is Worth Living: First and Second Series","review":"I never received this product.

I am not sure what happened."},{"Title":"Coming Down the Seine","review":"Coming Down The Seine, Robert Gibbings; Readers Union, J. M. Dent & Sons (London; 1955)\\"Shortly before dawn a band of lemon light appeared on the eastern horizon, & then a blood-red sheen. The light increased, not steadily, but as if thin veils were lifted, one by one. Five herons passed overhead on heavy wings & then a skein of ducks in urgent flight. The flame in the sky gave way to mottled grey & blue. A lavender mist hung over the water as I dipped my oars.\\"\\"Coming Down The Seine\\" has been fashioned & then polished by a jeweler working in ink.Gibbings, dauntless at the age of sixty, rented a small craft & propelled himself, solo, down the Seine - incidentally, in the aftermath of a terrible storm.From this came the story of his 400-mile voyage from the river's source to the English Channel. And it is almost flawless, complete with Gibbings' own lovely illustrations of the people & their buildings in the villages & cities flanking the river, liberally bestowed throughout a slender but substantial volume.\\"My boat... in rough water...needed no small ingenuity...to circumvent her eccentricities. If left to herself...she would perform all of the gyrations...of a floating leaf...& where the [swollen] current sluiced through a labyrinth of fallen tress, the uglier the stub that reared its head above the surface, the greater for her its attraction.\\"OK, so it was occasionally dangerous. But it wasn't Chatterton & Kohler repeatedly risking death in their attempt to identify a sunken U-boat on the underwater shelf of the Atlantic Ocean.And he did bag it, temporarily, after the flooded river proved to be impossible to navigate, after completing about a quarter of the journey (he beached the craft & hopped on a train to Paris; about a week later, with the flood waters having somewhat receded, he returned & resumed his river voyage).But who cares? You get a carefully crafted & charming account of not only his trip, but also of Napoleon's being forced to bribe his Marshals Oudinot & Soult (the latter, otherwise, would have sat out the battle of Waterloo), & many other interesting historical tales of artists & kings, set in France & beyond.You're always brought back to the present - swiftly, when he describes his sober encounters with the war wreckage in various towns, still piled up in the streets & inside uninhabitable, abandoned buildings - ten years after the end of WWII.Also an outstanding wood engraver, Gibbings passed away three years after the publication of this book. This may well have been his final written work. And his life itself had been run in a series of rapids more demanding than anything this temporarily treacherous Seine could have thrown at him (having been most seriously wounded in Gallipoli during World War I).By 1955, he was an astute observer as well as an experienced adventurer, reconciled by experience to reverses & tragedies. The sincere, disarming final words of a sensible mystic:\\"There is great peace in old age; responsibilities have been passed to others, anxiety about our choice of road in life no longer exists. We see, too, the inevitability in the sequence of many events. What at one time seemed a climax to all adventure, was but a prelude to fresh enterprise. Unknowingly, we had gone stale, had lost interest in the old activities; without realizing it, a new focus for our energy had appeared.\\"Who also had a wry sense of humor...\\"The village of Marcilly bordering the far side of another river, the Aube, the greatest of the many affluents of the Seine...it is the stronger of the two rivers when they meet; yet, comparable to the Missouri at its junction at the Mississippi, it yields up its name & sinks its personality [into] that of the weaker partner - a phenomenon not unknown in human matrimony...\\""},{"Title":"Coming Down the Seine","review":"Firstly - not the author or even his amazing woodcuts, nor the glory of the, river but the edition. Lost and Found Series - part of the Interlink publishing house - are nicely produced books of Classic Travel Writing, \\"old and new\\" they state but it seems the older classic offer the best potential. Next - the book. Well bound and printed with decent font size so easy to read ... but then the illustrations! Gorgeous woodcut blocks that totally support the text and seamlessly blend with the masterly style of this writer, an artist indeed.Gibbings studied at the Slade and went on to become a Master Printer, engraver, publisher and artist and only came to authorship relatively late in his career. Eventually he produced a series of river-trip works, all illustrated with his own art, in wood-block format. So, having enjoyed this wonderful tale of a trip on the river Seine, this reader is already anticipating a further four of five more similar travels. And they can not arrive soon enough!I hated to finish this book, the author has a \\"voice\\" that beguiles, charms, is full of the Celtic lilt of the Irish, and - very much - amuses. One chapter (18) is of those wonderful yarns of the Come here \`till I tell ye type. But most are lyric descriptions of landscape or history, nature or just \\"Toad'-like messing about in boats.A charming book that will entrap any reader who loves France, travel, boats, river, history or just charming, engaging and well-crafted tales."},{"Title":"The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights","review":"Raoul Berger had already exploded the \\"incorporation doctrine\\" in hisGOVERNMENT BY JUDICIARY. But critics tried to answer his arguments and scholarly conclusions throughout the 1980s.Here, Berger addresses his critics' arguments and, again, demonstrates that the intended meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment was not to \\"incorporate\\" provisions of the the Bill of Rights and thereby make them applicable as limitations against the states. Instead, the amendment had a much more limited scope and meaning.The theory of \\"selective incorporation\\" via the due process clause is quickly exploded by Berger. Shooting fish in a barrel came to mind, as the historical evidence is clear that \\"due process of law\\" is a procedural protection intended to protect defendants accused of a crime from arbitrary punishment. \\"Substantive due process\\" is a legal fantasy, Berger demonstrates. Indeed, few historians and academics will, with a straight face, defend substantive due process based on original intent.Justice Black's theory of \\"total incorporation\\" via the \\"privileges or immunities\\" clause, however, is the main meat of Berger's book. The Bingham and Howard statements in the 39th Congress are given great attention by Berger. He explodes them both; Bingham was a confused, contradictory thinker on this subject, and Howard's brief statement played no influence. Berger lays out all the evidence from the framing and ratification debates demonstrating that \\"privileges or immunities\\" are terms of art borrowed from Article IV, and that their meaning is clearly tied to the specified rights in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Incorporation was simply never imagined by the framers and ratifiers.For \\"incorporation doctrine\\" scholars, and for those interested in the Fourteenth Amendment, this Berger classic is a must-read. Thoroughly researched, heavily cited, and well written, this book is a great supplemental to Berger's Government by Judiciary."},{"Title":"The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights","review":"Berger was politically a liberal, meaning that he favored centralized government control of the lives of the citizenry. He was an honest liberal, however, and, based on his sound scholarship, rejected the self-defeating notion of a constitution which is &quot;living,&quot; i.e. a written law which is not law, but whim. Predictably, Berger was reviled by his fellow liberals. This is despite the fact that he was praised highly for books on impeachment and executive privilege which, by mere coincidence, were published when Nixon was being run out of Washington. Born in Russia, brought to the U.S. as a boy, Berger did not publish a book until age 68. His work on the 14th Amendment is a masterpiece of American legal scholarship."},{"Title":"The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights","review":"As the title indicates, this book is yet another examination of the meaning of the 14th Amendment, with a specific focus on the so-called &quot;incorporation&quot; theory which holds that the Amendment makes the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. Berger is a well-known proponent of &quot;original understanding&quot; in constitutional interpretation, and his view is that the 14th Amendment was meant to have a very narrow meaning, that modern judicial exegesis of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses is without historical foundation, and that the Amendment was not meant to apply the Bill of Rigths to the states. His most developed arguments on the historical evidence are given in a previous work, &quot;Government by Judiciary,&quot; which is quite possibly the most excoriated book in the history of constitutional law. The present book is partly a response to some of Berger's critics and then a rehashing of some of the historical evidence. Though one is forced to feel some sympathy for Berger, who has always come across as somewhat of a maverick scholar, his works usually end up being somewhat historically myopic, failing to look at events in their proper overall context. This book is no exception. A better place to look for an examination of the 14th Amendment and incorporation is Akhil Amar's &quot;The Bill of Rights,&quot; a more subtle and challenging treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"Champions Worldwide","review":"The Upside:Champions World Wide covers both superheroes and supervillains who operate in places outside the United States, which has been the main focus of the Champions Universe so far.The introduction of the book presents the information contained in it as a report from UNTIL (the Champions Universe UN superhuman organization) regarding superhuman activity around the world. It makes for some good flavor text and helps set the tone of the book.Each of the sections covers how the various regions react to Superhumans, any laws they have regarding them (specifically outlining Superhuman Registration laws throughout the world). A section covering prominent Superteams and heroes in the regions. As well as information on the activities of evil organizations like DEMON and VIPER plus local threats to the area like gangs, crime lords and other organizations that don't operate globally. Finally, each section provides \\"Five Places For A Fight Scene\\" which briefly outlines five locations famous to the area to have a good solid superfight around.Chapter One - Europe. Not including the United Kingdom (which Hero has stated will be covered under a future release by itself), this section covers Western Europe up to Russia and the former USSR satellite states. There are six superheroes presented here, two from France (one a street level hero, another a standard superhero), A trick-archer German hero, a mystical Portuguese brick, a young heroine in Hungary, and a Polish heroine with a love of death metal. A good presentation of various power levels and types of powers are presented.Chapter Two - Russia. Only four heroes are given for Russia and the surrounding countries. A powerful mystic, a powered armor hero working with the new Russian government, a tragic hero operating along the waters and coasts of Russia, and a young heroine representing the new generation of heroes in Russia since the fall of Communism.Chapter Three - The Middle East. A moderately detailed account of the Iraq War is given here, containing itself to what part Superheroes took part in during the initial invasion and subsequent rebuilding. Three heroes are presented as well. A street level hero in Saudi Arabia. An Iranian patriot, and an Israeli patriot. The Iranian patriot is a good example of a Hero who may end up opposing western heroes based on ideology instead of criminal intent, which can lead to interesting role-playing situations.Chapter Four - Africa. Only three heroes are presented for such a large continent. A physical manifestation of the Egyptian Goddess Ma'at. A speedster operating in South Africa. And a semi-retired hero who can manipulate metal in Nigeria. The chapter does state that in the Champions Universe almost all of Africa's superhuman activity is confined to either Egypt or South Africa.Chapter Five - India. Only three heroes are presented here. One of the most powerful mystics in the world. An overly enthusiastic Indian patriot, and a big fan of Western heroes. And a no-nonsense duplicator working for the Indian government as a super soldier.Chapter Six - East Asia. The largest collection of superheroes is in this chapter. One of the notable factors is the widely varied treatment of Superhumans in this part of the world. Japan has no registration act, while China has strictly enforced and harsh laws regarding superhumans which has created the worlds largest officially endorsed government Superteam. From China there is a street-level martial artist, and a pro-democracy teleporter, both operating outside China's laws. From Japan we have three heroes, a boy genius gadgeteer, one of the world's most powerful powered-armor heroes and a teen-celebrity flying brick heroine. From South Korea we have a telekinetic heroine who has taken up the name of her fallen mentor. And from Singapore an energy projector who works closely both the government and UNTIL.Chapter Seven - Australia And Oceania. All three of the heroes in this chapter are from Australia. A celebrity brick hero. A low-powered heroine working for the secret service. And a mystic hero that walks the entire continent helping people.Chapter Eight - Central And South America. This section comes with the story of a Superhero Team turned bad. Not all the members, but many within the Mexican government sponsored team fell to corruption. Some of the former members of the now defunct team are still heroes. Two of them are presented in this chapter, a strait forward brick and an ancient Aztec warrior who is out of his time. There are two other superheroes presented. A street level hero from Brazil, and an empathic manipulator fighting crime in Barbados.Chapter Nine - The GMs Vault. This chapter contains GM information on the previous eight chapters, which rumors are false or true, and other behind the scenes information. It also provides villains for each of the areas of the world from the first half of the book. Within each section are three plot seeds for the heroes presented earlier, and \\"Five Crimes To Commit\\" for each part of the world, providing ideas for GMs to involve the locals if not the villains and heroes contained in the book.To quickly go over the villains, the GMs Vault provides forty-three new villains from around the world. Seven from Europe, five Russian, seven from the Middle East, four from Africa, Five Indian, eight from East Asia, three from Australia, and four from South America. The power and personality levels are nice and varied. There are low powered villains, third tier master villains, villains that are pure evil, redeemable villains, and a few extremely powerful ones.Aside from providing a number of new characters, both good and bad, the books high points are the \\"Five Places For A Superfight\\" and \\"Five Crimes To Commit\\" sections for each region. The inclusion of those elements goes a long way to helping a GM bring the world to life and get a few sessions outside of the PCs hometown. If your game is already a globetrotting game this is an excellent addition to get some local villains and heroes involved in events.The Downside:There's no Summary Table of the heroes or the villains, which is an always useful item to help GMs find just right the right Superhuman quickly and easily.Also, maps are provided for some of the areas of the world in the book, two regions to a page. But only four of the eight regions provide maps showing all the countries involved. Of those missing Central and South America, including the many islands off the coats, and Oceania would have been very useful. Why only four of the eight regions had country maps provided I don't know. But it gave the impression the job was only half-heartedly done.The Otherside:Between the varied character personalities and the \\"Five Locations\\" sections this book has a good amount of stuff to offer up to non-Hero gamers. And those into converting have seventy-seven new characters to convert to their system of choice.Overall, this is a pretty good book and a helpful addition to anyone's collection who wants to take their game to a global scale while keeping various locations full of cultural differences. Forty-three new villains, thirty-four potential allies and a host of information to get the PCs in trouble around the world."},{"Title":"Champions Worldwide","review":"Champions Worldwide is a good sourcebook for players wanting allies and or enemies outside of the United States.

I had no idea how much I would enjoy this one. I have actually read it cover-to-cover, and though I've had to use the dictionary feature for several phrases in the book (for example, \\"Indian meal\\" seems to have been the term for \\"corn meal\\" during Miss Parloa's era), I have highlighted more than a few recipes to try from this book.Something to note is that the measurements are not quite as precise as you'd find nowadays (i.e., she calls for \\"butter the size of an egg\\" in several recipes), and there is never a temperature given for baking in the oven - rather, she uses terminology such as \\"cook in a moderate oven\\" (which I take to mean as somewhere around 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit) - so making some of these recipes will probably prove to be a bit of a challenge for even an experienced cook. But if you're looking for real, from-scratch recipes the way your great-great-grandmother would have done it, this is a really great place to start."},{"Title":"Miss Parloa's new cook book","review":"This was far more interesting than I expected it to be. I love that it seems to be one of the very first cookbooks where they found it necessary to actually tell you how much of what to use and gave standardized measurements, of sorts.Excellent information about beef and fish and other ingredients and a wonderful bit of insight into history. Some of the recipes would be fun to try even now, which I didn't expect. The section on how to equip a kitchen was fun to read as well.If you're into old cookbooks or just like reading about food and they type of things they used in their kitchens back then, well worth the free download!"},{"Title":"Miss Parloa's new cook book","review":"This is a really fun old book that is full of interesting info.

I really enjoyed it and you can't beat the price. Get it and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Miss Parloa's new cook book","review":"I love reading old cookbooks. It also makes me appreciate how much easier and less time intensive cooking is today. This was entertaining to peruse and was free, who could ask for more?"},{"Title":"Miss Parloa's new cook book","review":"A good insight of cooking at the turn of the century.The recipes cover a great variety of vaious ingredients, some based in the new england area.The book refers to plates (pictures) but there are none in the kindle edition."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"If a reader has read and enjoyed any of Janet Evanovich's previous novels, they will not be disappointed with the modern romantic's newest addition, Full House. With a story plot classic to the style of Evonocich, this novel provides the vice from normal life which Evonivich always delivers.What makes Janet Evanovich such a successful author and also Full House such an enjoyable read, is what some may call the golden story plot. It is not hard to notice that the two novel's stories follow almost the same plot which goes as follows: An average woman meets and accidentally falls in love with the perfect man. This man is always suave, handsome, confident, and exactly what the woman needs in her life. The couple somehow becomes entangled in a dangerous mystery which unravels itself by the end of the novel, and is solved in an action-packed, suspenseful manner. Evanovich knows exactly what the female reader is looking for in a story, and she knows how to deliver it. Evanovich's plots are simple and cheesy, so much so that they are addicting, and her books cannot be put down until they are finished.Overall, if a reader is looking for an easy read that can be read in over a short period of time, Full House is a good choice"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book has wonderful twists and turns in it. It is like any other book by Janet Evanovich, it is laugh out loud funny and you will not be able to put the book down!!!If you are like me, you will fall inlove with the charaters and feel like you are with them when there lives turn upside down!!!!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Seems like an odd pairing, but Evanovich and Hughes make it work. And if you think the idea of Nick and Billie is odd, wait until you meet the secondary cast. A ditzy fashion diva with a heart of gold, her eccentric brother who likes to blow things up, throw in some wrestlers and a small mystery and you have a page-turning read that is sure to delight!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This was my first Evanovich novel, and I am wondering why so many people rave on and on. Based on other reviews, I can see that I need to try again, possibly with a Stephanie Plum book. Full House is shallow, mindless, and only occasionally fun. Most of the novel's plot seemed paper thin and too ridiculous to be enjoyable.I read most of this by the pool, and my suggestion is that's where it's best enjoyed. Otherwise, just don't even bother. If you want a quick romance, try the Red Dress Ink series."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"After reading the Stephanie Plum series, I was really dissapointed in the supposedly re-vamped and re-issue of Full House. At first it seemed pretty interesting, but suddenly turned sour. Boring, no real thrill. Plot is the same ole thing. Boy meets girl, girl not interested then boy sweeps her off her feet. I was in the middle of the book and skipped to the last chapter and that seemed to be a little more exciting. Maybe that was the re-write portion."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Major disappointment. This book is neither a good romance nor a good anything else. I'm a big fan of the Stephanie Plum books but cannot recommend this book. Wait for the next &quot;plum&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"It was alright. Not great. It was a cute story, not in any way believable though. And whoever else said the editing was bad was dead on. The names kept changing on you. And just at a &quot;critical&quot; moment is when they changed Nick's name to Neil. VERY distracting! I'm wondering when in the world she hopped into bed with Neil, since Nick was just there a moment ago. And the whole Joel/Joey thing was bad. They also changed her minivan to a station wagon at one point. I've never read any of the Stephanie Plum series because mysteries aren't really my thing, but if this was any indication of her work I think I'd pass.I'm now reading &quot;Full Tilt&quot;, the sequel to this story, and the editing is almost as bad in it.I'm not giving a recap of the plot since I'm sure you've already determined what it's about, but I'll tell you to save your money on this one. If you INSIST on reading it though, pick it up at the library!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is really sad...I adore the Plum series, but this book is trite and juvenile. If you don't believe me, read it. I think you'll find it a real disappointment."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Was a little disappointed being that the Stephanie Plum series is such a great read. This book was pretty predictable, and often somewhat hokey. I can't believe they're going to make this into a series...a series of what?? Please please, I hope that by the next book in this series they will have come up with a more 'adult', convincing plot. Maybe Janet E. shouldn't have teamed up with someone?"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I couldn't wait to read a romance written by Evanovich. Better yet, getting to read her earlier work written as Stephanie Hall. I honestly don't know what I expected, but this book highly disappointed me. One thing for certain, after reading Full House,there could be no doubt about how far Janet has evolved from writing romance to mystery. For sure, she needs to stick to mystery because she obviously isn't a romance writer. She's still one of my favorites because of her humor, but this book shows undeveloped talent prior to the Stephanie Plum series. I can't/don't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I have always loved Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series so much and was so disappointed with this book. I found the candy coated characters and plot so amateurish that I just skimmed through the last 100 pages to find out the ending -- which I never do but frankly just didn't want to waste my time. The plot was predictable and boring. The love interests were so unrealistic and they didn't seem to stay consistent. I even noticed on one page there was a typo -- the wrong name for the leading male character. Now how can you miss that. If you are compelled to read it, take it out of the library."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I picked up this book at the airport, trusting it would be similar to her mysteries, although I understood it to be part of her earlier romance attempts. I was very surprised at the amateur level of the writing. The plots were very thin, and the characters had little of the endearing qualitites I love in her mysteries. Stick with the mysteries!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Like many other readers, I bought this because I enjoy the Plum series. If I had the talent of Janet Evanovich, I would have kept this one buried. It is not funny, but it is trite. Save your money."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Like many others, I purchased this book based on the fact that I enjoy the Stephanie Plum books . . . let's face it, they are not literature, they are a fun read and allow me to escape for a few hours on a weekend. Full House on the other hand was a waste of time . . .Did others wonder, as I did, what could have persuaded Evanovich to agree to the rewrite and the republishing of this book? I finally skipped to the last two pages and then put the book in the bag for the charity book sale at work (for 25cents --- it's not a bad buy at that price!)Hopefully Evanovich visits this page and reads these reviews . . ."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Ms. Evanovich seems to have lost her grip. The intricate plots, loveable cast of characters, and genuinely humorous dialogue present in the Stephanie Plum series are not to be found in Full House. The book is said to have been written before the Plum series and to have be rewritten for this publication. While Echos, or perhaps precursors, of Plum's character can be found in F. H., this effort is best described as &quot;A predictable plot, forgettable characters, hackneyed dialogue.&quot; Don't bother!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"That's definitely not what I expected when I picked up this reworked and rereleased novel from Janet Evanovich, but I still enjoyed it. I'd give it 2.5 stars, if that were an option, just because the plot is one giant cliche. Fortunately, the cliched plot is somewhat saved by Janet's humorous writing.This story is nearly every girl's secret fantasy - rich, handsome, funny, suave womanizer falls madly in love with Everyday Woman Like Us. Ugh, predictable! I should hate this! Sadly, my inner teenage girl ate it right up, rather voraciously - she loves that whole gratification of desires thing. [sigh] OH, the humanity...I much prefer Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but this wasn't bad, especially considering it's an early work for her. Hopefully this won't get me hooked on romance novels in general - I'm not quite sure I could cope with that. ;-)"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"His current class consists of seven students, but one of them stands out for polo instructor Nicholas Kaharchek. It is not that Billie Pearce is extraordinary in any sense except that she does not belong near a horse let alone a polo field. His thoughts prove prophetic when her horse steps on her foot. Nick takes the injured pupil to the hospital.To his chagrin, Nick is attracted to Billie, a divorc&eacute; with two children currently on vacation with their father. She likes him too and offers the use of her presently empty nest home for his lunatic cousin Deedee to stay. He jumps at the offer, but wonders where the attached strings are even as he falls in love with the one student who flunked polo 101.Though readers will not pull out a plum, fans of amusing romantic suspense will enjoy the remake of FULL HOUSE by Janet Evanovich with the help of Charlotte Hughes. The story line never takes itself seriously as the antics of Billie and the support cast leaves a bemused and bewildered Nicholas wondering who is in the asylum if the folks he cherishes roam the streets?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I love Janet's books and characters, and while this book has some interesting characters; the dialogue, plot, and character development leave a lot to be desired. I read it in a day, so at least I didn't throw it in the trash! The romance in the Plum series is better than this earlier \\"romance\\" novel. It's not a believable piece of work. I did laugh out loud once, so there is a hint of the Janet that evolved into the writer we know and love. We all have to start somewhere."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I'm a long time fan of Evanovich and I've read one of her romance novels before. It wasn't bad, so I grabbed Full House as soon as I saw it.It was pretty dire.I don't know what happened but it was like a reflection in a fun house mirror; all the elements of the Plum series were there but distorted.It probably didn't help that the heroine was 38 with two kids. So am I and reality kept creeping in. Where's the millionaire who's mad for me because I can bake cookies?The secondary characters were oddball, yes, but not in the least bit interesting. The spark between the two main characters wasn't there. Ranger had me drooling, this hero couldn't do that if I were biting into a lemon as I read.And the villain? Can we spell 'obvious'?I really felt cheated of my money. I should have got it from the library."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Full house is the story of Billie Pearce and her romance with handsome playboy Nick Kaharachek. Billie, a single-mom, school-teacher of the bumbling 'Stephanie Plum' vein meets Nick, during a polo lesson. Nick is smitten by Billie, despite her incompetence at Polo. In an effort to 'woo' her, Nick talks Billie into taking on a boarder - his irritatingly rich cousin Dee Dee- in exchange for free riding lessons. Despite the hassle of having Dee Dee third-wheeling their romance, Billie and Nick hit it off and become engaged almost immediately. (Groan) Together they have a series of madcap adventures.I was really looking forward to reading Full House, but for me Full House felt so contrived it was unenjoyable. Billie and Nick had nothing in common, and the presence of Dee Dee didn't help matters. We saw absolutely nothing of Billie's career as a school teacher, the villian seemed pathetic and sad, and 'tacked on' at the end to add a little last minute suspense. But worse, the novel was just boring and predictable. It lacked the spark of other Evanovich work.If you are looking for a light 'fluffy' read, pick up Full House, otherwise, save your money and go for another Plum book."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Bought the book for a relative for Christmas present.

Her characters can be related to and they become your friends. Get all her books you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is a great story about how a woman happens into love. She is independant, but darn, he always seems to be needed by her, it's been awhile since I've read this book but it did make me an Evaonovich fan, I loved the lovable and colorful characters, the misguided son, and the misguided father who really needed the heroines help in order to set him straight. No spoiler alert, just a happy, heart-warming fun read, fast too."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a huge Janet E. fan so my judgment may be a bit clouded when it comes to her books. I expect nothing but a great storyline from her and I've rarely been let down. Full House is another adorable story of love against odds following Nick & Billie through their whirlwind romance and introduces readers to the main character of the Full series Max Holt. At first I did not like how this book is based 20 years prior to the rest of the series but it provides key character information on Max for the remainding five books of the series. If you like Janet E.'s books then these are a definite option to try reading. A fast read, but cute story and fun characters."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Full House is about Billie a single mother of two and Nick a wealthy playboy who is using her.

If you don't enjoy ikky romance novels, don't buy it!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the Fans who did not like this. They seem to have two major complaints. One is the editing, and the other the fact that it's got a romance and the...tension that we love in Stephanie Plum isn't there. If these readers had bought this book cold they would have loved it, and enjoyed the humor and quirky characters. Charlotte Hughes can write d[ar]n good mysteries, and everyone knows Janet can as well, but this book is meant to be a fun adventure. Taken as that its a great read. The editing is a real problem but that's St Martins Press fault, isnt it?. If it were a hardcover I would let the editing get to me, but I am more forgiving when it comes to paperbacks."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"everything bad said is the absolute truth i'm afraid. i love the plum series, but picked this up because i really enjoyed evanovich's writing style. I don't think it was all Evanovich's fault, i think her editing was poorly done as well. something i found funny, that no one else seemed to mention was that the main family's names are: billie, christy and joel. now, i like billy joel as well as the next person, but, i mean, why?. my advice is skip this one. this is a waste of time and a waste of money."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book is a romance and a mystery. While the mystery is not all that intriguing, the humor and sweetness make it a great read. I loved the side characters most. Dee Dee is a spoiled but sweet ex-beauty queen, and she is marrying (how many times has she been married?) a wrestler Frankie the Assassin. Her brother Max, a do-gooding supergenious is also cute. The two leads, Billy and Nick, are prototypes. Billy is a single mom who wins Nick with her cookies, and Nick is the rich, sensitive playboy who finally settles down. The sweetness isn't as apealing to hard edge Plum fans, but to those of us who love romance and humor, this was a real find."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am still amazed I finished this book - just a sickness I guess - I never allow myself to NOT finish a book. What is even more amazing is that this piece of garbage ever got published. It is absolutely HORRIBLE - stupid drivel. STAY AWAY."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I read ALOT of books, different types of writing, and I guess forsome people this wasnt the best thing Evanovich has done but I read the reviews before I read the book and I think people were a little harsh in their reviews. It was like Plum with the crazy characters, and I LOVE Stephanie, but sometimes I think the Plum series is a little too &quot;clipped&quot;- this had more detail, so it was just different but not necessarily bad. I enjoyed the quirky characters and it made me laugh. Sometimes thats all I need from a book. I noticed mistakes in the book too, and I agree the editingcould be done a little better, but that is nothing new, ive come across that with other books too. Anyway, I had to say, give the book a try, you might find that you enjoy it. Ill definitely read the next book, while waiting anxiously for the new Plum book!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"For those of you who may not know it, Steffie Hall is Janet Evanovich's pseudonym. This book is currently out of print but it's scheduled to be reissued in an expanded form in September 2002 after being rewritten by Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes. It's a funny and engaging book in its original form, and I'm looking forward to the expanded rewrite.Billie Pierce is the epitomy of a suburban mom. She lives in a well-to-do suburban development, has two kids, is a 6th grade teacher, and is happy being a homemaker. The only glitch in the picture is that Mr. Pierce hit his mid-life crisis at an early age, so for the past four years Billie has been a divorced mom, too. She decides that she needs more exercise in her life, so she signs up for polo lessons, given by Nick Kaharchek, a local polo-playing, horse-farm-owning, millionaire/publisher. When signing up she neglected to mention that while she's been around horses all her life, she's never actually been on one. Needless to say, Nick usually doesn't pursue women of Billie's type, but the air of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies that surrounds her is almost more than he can resist. She, on the other hand, can recognize danger when it's staring into her eyes and resolves to keep her distance. Uh huh, yeah, sure.Of course, since this is an Evanovich book, the secondary characters are not bland two-dimensional characters. There's Deedee, Nick's many-times married cousin, who's now engaged to be married to a professional wrestler, and who Nick cons Billie into housing; Frankie The Assassin, a professional wrestler who's Deedee's fiance; Eugene, Nick's precocious cousin who blows things up in order to get his point across; and an assortment of pro wrestlers that Deedee tries to fix Billie up with.This was a fun book with a lot of witty dialogue, well-written scenes and characters, and sexy and humorous romance. Even with the upcoming rewrite, it's a book that's definitely worth finding in its original version."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"\`Full House' is a sweet romance. I think that you will enjoy this book if you like light-hearted romantic stories. The only comparison to the Stephanie Plum series is a group of quirky minor characters. The mystery involved is light compared to the Plum series, so understand that from the beginning. Something seems off about the story and it's probably due to the re-writing. The story was revamped (which I wasn't aware of until after I read the book) and flow was two-stepping between flowing really well and being jerky.The story begins with Billie Pearce, a single mom who is enjoying time without her kids. She is a schoolteacher and plans on enjoying her summer. She embarks on a summer of personal improvement by taking Polo lessons. Billie is a strong and caring woman. However, she is not good at Polo. Her ineptitude endears her to Nick Kaharchek. Nick is a good-hearted guy; a newspaper owner, the stable owner, and a true family man. Nick takes care of his nephew, Maximillian \`Max' Holt. Max likes to live outside on his uncle's property. He also likes to make homemade bombs and cause havoc. (He's a genius who is bored). As Nick and Billie become closer, she finds herself getting an unexpected roommate. Nick's cousin, Deedee (Max's sister), is a self-absorbed celebrity. She needs down time and is in a relationship with a professional wrestler, Frankie Fontana. Deedee and Billie form an interesting relationship. Deedee even tries to set Billie up with a friend of Frankie's, who is a professional wrestler. Needless to say, Nick is having none of that!This book was entertaining for what it was...a campy, romantic, and mildly mysterious romp. I look forward to the next in the series, if only to see if the characters develop in their full potential."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am the typical Evanovich fan. I will read practically anything with her name on it and so I wanted to try some of her older stuff. This definitely was not a &quot;Plum&quot; novel, but it was a lighthearted, easy read. I didn't find myself laughing out loud very much as I sometimes laugh to tears at Stephanie's escapades, but it did leave you with a good feeling in the end."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Billie Pearce, a divorced house wife, meets Nick Kaharchek, a... millionaire, and of course the two quickly fall in love. Not everything goes smoothly when Nick's kooky family members get involved in Billie's life. This is a cute book even though it's a bit too much of a romance novel for my tastes. I decided to pick it up because Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series amuses me greatly. Fans of that series will surely enjoy this book. There isn't as much action as the Stephanie Plum series but the same wacky humor is still there. Besides, Nick's mad genius cousin, Max, is so very adorable."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I think this book is sweet and funny. I wont tell the plot because it would be no fun, but there its a zoo full of crazy characters and while I agree its all very improbable I haven't ever read Janet Evanovich for anything but escape. As Entertainemnt this it tops! I want to see the next one."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I really enjoy reading Janet Evanovich's books. Though this wasn't as good as her Plum series (HUGE fan of that series), it was an easy read. The characters were likeable and the story was cute. Definitely enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I find Billie Pearce to be annoying beyond belief. Endless thoughts that go over the same ground, over and over and over... when at one point she said something like &quot;I'm such a moron,&quot; I thought wow, at last some real self-awareness. She decides she loves Nick based on very little - particularly after she realizes that, while pain medication was affecting her resistance, he took advantage of her to foist off his annoying airhead cousin DeeDee on her, when he could just as easily have parked DeeDee in a hotel - and probably one that has French Provincial furniture, to boot - Loudon County is actually relatively close to DC, and it's not like DeeDee was doing anything in particular in Loudon County while she waited for her wedding day to roll around. There were logic leaps and holes, unbelieveable characters, idiot behavior (Billie deciding to jump out of a cake at a bachelor party because all men are pigs, and if her fiance is going to root with the pigs, then she's going to make sure that she's the truffle), quirky characters who are more like fingernails on a blackboard than endearingly cute... et cetera et cetera... Billie is priggish, selfish, self-absorbed, and completely spineless. She lets herself get backed into marrying Nick because she's trying to keep DeeDee from fixing her up - she's only known DeeDee a day or two, but she apparently can't tell her no. When DeeDee tells Raoul rather pointedly that he's not invited to the double wedding (it's family and politicians only, DeeDee says), even though Billie counts Raoul as a friend she just shrugs and says, basically, sorry you can't come. She says she trusts Nick, but then her actions and endless ruminations show that she doesn't trust him at all. Why they love each other is beyond me - Billie's rather like one of my sisters - the one my other sisters and I enjoy talking about when we get together because of all the annoying and stupid things she does. I don't remember Full Tilt being nearly this irritating, and I enjoy most of the Stephanie Plum novels (there was some serious sagging in the middle of the series), but this book just goes to show how a writer can learn and improve. This novel should give hope to anyone that, with a little bit of luck, they, too, could be published."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"...I read Evanovich when I want to be entertained. And I was...no this was not a Plum novel - and I do not believe anyone said it would be...BUT it is a fun and easy read. I lov to laugh when I read a book - and it does not happen often - only when I read Evanovich.THANKS Janet, for the fun!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I really wanted to like this, because I liked her other books- alot. This was far fetched and at best just fluff and filler until the plot takes off.

For those seeking a fix before the next full length Stephanie Plum novel, this might not be the best choice. The tale is certainly light enough with divorced mother of two Annie finding love and excitement with handsome Nick. The story moves quickly with usual red herrings. But certain characters seemed more paper-doll cutouts. Overall, a definite library checkout or purchase for a hefty discount only read."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"It's a light romance with some suspense and mystery thrown in and a bunch of hilarious characters.

I love Janet Evanovich's characterizations; she's in high form here; parts of this book were so funny."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I wonder what this book was like before it was re-written? Its a bit too long, a bit too angsty and lot too unbelieveable (and I love the Plum series!)All about 38 year old single mother, Billie, who goes along to take Polo lessons from and falls for the teacher - well eventually. Who has all the advantages of being young, (well 36) handsome, millionaire, hard-working newspaper owner who teaches polo in his spare time. HmmmmHe lands his ditsy cousin Deedee on her so that she won't bein his house driving him mad and decorating it in French Provincial style, while she is waiting to marry Frankie who is a professional Wrestler. That way he can also conduct a discreet seduction of her and then walk away easily. Billie's kids are off with their father for a month. However all is not well. Max, Deedee's much younger cousin is blowing things up on his property, his glamorous ex-girlfriend is hanging around making trouble. And in Billie's life, there are burglarys in her neighbourhood, and an infestation of spiders in her house.It seems awfully long and yet I felt many of the characters and situations were introduced simply to get things to happen. Billie sits on a horse to learn to play polo - gets stepped on and her foot seems to miraculously heal. She gets given a horse by him and then only once more has a ride. Her children come hurtling back into the story becuase there father has an accident - yet they seem to come in and out of the story to suit circumstances. Billie seems to end up in bed and engaged to the hero with almost alarming ease - and the marriage just doesn't make sense. It is supposed to be a double wedding which Deedee has been planning for months - so why is she doing nothing about it? and why does it end up being in the backyard of Billie's house planned only a week before.Isuppose you have to suspend your disbelief - but I couldn'twith the ending sequence. You see part of the book is a mystery - who is trying to blow up the hero - is it Max gone to far, is it the slightly deranged ex-lover - and who is breaking in to Billie's neighbourhood all the time? I found the final sequence annoying to say the least - and it just seem to go on and on and on and on and on - page after page after page after page.There were lots of lovely characters - Deedee was a real joy to read - but it just wasnt' a book I would ever read again."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I'm a big Evanovich fan. However., I consider her latest book incredibly insulting to her millions of fans. From the beginning I kept reading and stopped at page 132 because I couldn't take it anymore. The plot was weak, and the characters garnered no sympathy from me. I've read Janet's early romance and for the most part liked them. This one however left me frustrated. I still have hopes for her upcoming books."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I know that many romance readers today cannot wait for the next Janet Evanovich book featuring Stephanie Plum and other characters to be published. But what some of these readers may not realize is that Janet Evanovich began her writing career as an author of romance novels. Now almost 13 years late, Ms. Evanovich, along with another author has reworked one of her earlier books, which she originally wrote under the name Steffi Hall. And after reading this book, I'm left with the burning question why did she bother doing this. From a financial point of view, I guess there were reasons for her doing this. But in my opinion she might have been better off writing another Stephanie Plum novel.As a reader, who at one time couldn't gulp down enough romance titles, I thought Full House was less than an engaging read let alone as a romance novel. I do understand that some romances are light hearted and funny but instead this book at times was downright silly. Of course there was the requisite romance theme of boy meets girl and the happily ever after ending but there seemed little if any reason for these two to fall in love. Then there were also a couple of very quirky characters who included a wrestler, ditsy blond and even Billie's ex- husband which should have spiced up this book but didn't. And finally there was a bit about owning a horse farm and a small mystery. But in the end the book never really seemed more than just words on paper and it just didn't matter. I think what was really lacking for any novel was any real interest in the characters their circumstances or their outcome. I even found that I forced myself to finish this title. From the forward of this book readers learn that Evanovich plans on doing this again in the future. In my opinion, she should consider writing new books and leaving her past books where they most likely belong, in the past."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"My husband and I have read every Stephanie Plum book and loved them. I was intrigued by this new series &quot;in the Plum tradition.&quot; Instead of laughing out loud, as I often do with Stephanie Plum, I grimaced repeatedly. All Evanovich characters are caricatures but these are amazingly one-dimensional. I have never read in the Romance genre and if this is an example, I never will again."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Don't the stars for the review come in negative? I vote -1 star. I'm with the person who said this book cheated them out of money. I LOVED all of the other books written by Janet Evanovich--did I say loved, I meant devoured. I went to the bookstore the day they came out. But this??? Anyone who gives this book anything more than a star is wacked! I didn't laugh once and felt annoyed that I spent the time to get to the end."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I could not even get through the first chapter without having to restrain the urge to yack. Couldn't even force myself to read it. And I say that as a huge Stephanie Plum series fan."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I couldn't get the next Stephanie Plum book so I tried this one. I threw it out after 10 pages. Maybe I didn't give it much of a try but anything that starts off as that bad of a romance novel (the equivalent of \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" would have been 100 times better) had no potential for me. Romance fans, have fun. Plum fans, give it a second thought."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Compared to the plum books, this novel is a bore, and overly silly, i am sorry i read past page three, hoping it would improve. save your money for the next plum."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"The previous reviewer said she liked the first four chapters. I couldn't even finish the first one. I love the Stephanie Plum novels, but this was awful from the first page. There were so many absurdities, unlikelihoods, and &quot;get reals&quot; in the first 3 pages that I gave up. I wish I'd sat down with it in the bookstore for 5 minutes and I wouldn't have wasted my money."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I love Stephanie Plum -- only book I buy pre-publication at full price. I was thrilled to think we'd be getting more Janet Evanovich. Forgetaboutit! I read the first chapter, and even that was a waste of time...not to mention money. Janet, you're doing yourself a disservice to let this book out."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"The original 1989 Full House (by Steffie Hall) was a ho-hum romance, 179 pages, in which boy met girl, boy lost -- no, he didn't. It was just boy met girl, boy got girl. There was no conflict but there were some interesting characters: Eugene (in this new book renamed Max), Deedee, and Billie herself, as well as some good comic turns.This new book adds an ex-fiancee, increases a one-mention character to secondary status, and throws in a darker plot complication VERY late in the book. Yet still the book lacks any kind of real conflict to hold it together and set it above the mainstream. Pages have been expanded, the late complication has been added, and the occasional insubstantial scene that makes you go, \\"huh?\\" pops up (the dress shop owner??) (these seem to be there just to increase page count). A co-author has also been added -- but her name doesn't appear anywhere on the cover. I feel sorry for her and a little irritated at Janet for taking the credit (though this could well be an editorial decision).Like the last Stephanie Plum book, this one falls completely apart at the 3/4 mark. The world suddenly shifts into a dimension where rational people act in utterly irrational ways. (Take the bachelor party scene, which in the first version had Billie jumping out of the cake fully clothed and merrily waving a rolling pin at Nick, whom she knew wasn't interested in the party. Compare it to this unfunny and out-of-character version.) (Or take the busload of people and carload of wrestlers and see where they go at the end of this book -- it made absolutely no sense.)Marion Zimmer Bradley is one of my favorite fantasy authors, but when her name became big enough the quality of her books plummeted. Perhaps (as another reviewer has suggested) editors just don't bother once they've got The Big Name on the cover.If this book could get a rewrite, it deserved a true rewrite, a tearing apart and restructuring. The save-the-wilderness plot could have served as a basis of conflict, complicated by the existing darker subplot. Billie and Nick could have had a real conflict between themselves instead of smooth sailing. Janet enjoys wrestling (or at least wrestlers); couldn't we have gotten into them some more for a lot of fun?If this is a rewrite, shouldn't it be better than the first version? If it's not, why not just re-release the original?"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Billie Pearce is a girl next door- divorced, mother of two kids, bakes chocolate chip cookies, and the biggest problem she faces is an overbearing mom. Until she meets wealthy playboy, newspaper moghul and her polo instructer Nick Kaharcheck. Nick brings temptation and a family of zany characters that puts Billie on a roller coaster ride of feelings.One of these characters, DeeDee, moves in with her. DeeDee never rises before noon, has been married a zillion times, and is engaged to Frankie Fontana- a wrestling star. DeeDee is a vintage Janet Evanovich character and fans of Janet will love her and her cousin Max Holt. Max is a do-gooder and a genious, and he blows up things around Nick's House, mostly because he is a passionate environmentalist and wants to get Nick to support his causes. Both of these characters are so enjoyable they overshaddow at times Billie and Nick who seem mundane by comparison.While the original book by Ms. Evanovich is a simple romance, the new book adds depth and motivation to the romance, and a mystery. While, like many of Janet Evanovich's books, who dunnit is somewhat beside the point, it is never the less a gripping yet funny race to the end of the book.Both of these accomplished collaborators bring assets to the book. Miss Hughes, who helped with the rewrite has penned a number of sweet romances in Loveswept, some Maggie winning mysteries with Avon, and most recently two really excellent romantic comedies for MIRA. Her touch is in the depth and the fast pace at the end (see the pace in HOT SHOT for a similar feel). Janet Evanovich is a truly brilliant writer when it comes to developing memorable secondary characters, and she does so again here. The book's romance is still closer to the kind we would expect in Janet and Charlotte's Loveswept days, so don't expect the compelling sexual tension in the Plum series, but if a lovely, warm and fun romantic comedy is your desire, with a dash of suspense, then Full House is the book for your nightstand."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I cannot even exactly remember what bundle of Romance Novels from about 10 years that held the first Janet Evanovich novel I read, but I took to her style immediately. It was only afterwards that I then discovered her beloved Stephanie Plum series, so while I am a huge fan of the Plum Series, I was already used to and happily predisposed to Ms. Evanovich writing about other characters and stretching in other directions than some fan might be most happy with. (Once you are a fan of one thing, well, you want more of what you want.)Full House is definitely a fantasy romance. Some Cinderella esque elements in the classic romance plot device which has been redone into Pride & Prejudice, Beatrice and Benedict, and even Pretty Woman. Some contemporary romance readers desire a more \\"realistic\\" plot device, and sometimes we still want just complete froth and fantasy for the sake of romance and fun, and THAT is what Janet Evanovich delivers in \\"Full House.\\"This is part of the \\"FULL SERIES\\" and you will meet a number of the characters here in \\"Full House.\\" Some of the characters are utterly ridiculous, and that is part of it's charm, if that is to your liking. If it is not, then you won't enjoy \\"Full House.\\" Some of us are looking for diversion and want to find a break from a boring week or a life that is sometimes too predictable.

It was a quick read for me (because I do work during the day), I love the characters. It was so easy to just picture this book like a movie going on in your head! Since this book is the first one in the series, there is a lot of background information coming to light so that you can know the characters a little better. I myself loved DeeDee. As with every review I give I won't let out to much of the book, because I want you to read it. It was fast-paced, I actually caught myself reading snipits to my husband occassionally, and laughing out loud (and people thought I was crazy, I suppose). If your looking for a fun read, pick up Full House, I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"If you're expecting something along the lines of the Stephanie Plum mysteries, this book is not for you. Full House must be viewed on its own. It's not as action-packed as Evanovich's more recent best sellers, although there's some action and a car does in fact get blown to bits.

Although it's a simply story without much depth, it's Janet Evanovich's characters that keep you interested. The characters are extremely vivid, likeable and very memorable. For example, Nick's cousin Deedee, a rich, spoiled, ex-beauty queen, sweet but dim-witted. Nick cons Billie into letting Deedee stay with her for a couple weeks until her wedding to professional wrestler Frankie The Assassin. Also beware of Deedee's 16-year-old brother, Max, a young genius, animal rights activist, who likes to blow things up to get attention. There's also Nick's ex-fiance Sheridan to contend with. And Raoul, the bug-guy who tries to please everyone in the neighborhood, but isn't too good at his job.

It starts out as a VERY cheesy romance (hey, I'm an avid reader and have been known to read a few romance novels) novel and it's just awful. The second half of the book picks up a bit of speed and becomes slightly more interesting, but then at the ending the speed is so fast you can barely keep up. It was as if the authors decided they'd better make this all a little more &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; to keep the readers interested in the &quot;Full -&quot; series, and... it just made no sense.Of course I bought Full Tilt (the 2nd in this series) at the same time, so I had to read that one. That one was a touch better, but I'll review it seperately (;In conclusion, if you loooove Stephanie Plum, um... don't read these just because you feel loyal to Janet, like I did."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Janet Evanovich is very honest about this book: 'I wrote and published the original in 1989....Charlotte Hughes and I now have made it bigger and better.'Charlotte Hughes may have made it bigger, but she did not make it better. Friends who have read the original smaller version liked it; no one I've talked to has liked this version.The characters are typical Evanovich and delightful; the plot seems to be going along nicely, and then the padding begins. Plot is going in all directions and the charm of the Evanovich books is no where in sight.I bought this book after reading the first four or so chapters; they were a delight. Then the book got boring; I started skipping paragraphs, then pages, then raced on to the improbable ending.My advice: save your money for the new Plum. Don't go here."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"\\"Full House,\\" took me about three hours to read, cover to cover, and thankfully I was only in public for about forty minutes of that, on a bus. I laughed out loud at least once a chapter at Evanovich's typical slapstick style of storytelling - enough to earn strange looks from the other passengers on the bus.This is no Stephanie Plum mystery - and I didn't go into it expecting one, which I think many others might have and would explain the overall low rating this book received. I enjoyed it as what it was: crazy fun romantic hijinks with impossibly neurotic characters aplenty. When you put in a blonde bombshell airhaid into the home of a strict but fair schoolteacher, add in a young genius who blows things up, a wrestler and his wrestling buddies, a polo-teaching rich man and his crazy ex-fiance, and, of course, an ineffective bug killer, you can't help but set the stage for typical Evanovich fallout. When the schoolteacher falls for the playboy, despite the airhead's attempts to set her up with \\"Big John\\" the anatomically exaggerated wrestler, things are sure to fire up as zany as ever.My one real frustration with the book was how terribly it was edited. Nick, the love interest of our heroine, is referred to as Neil a few times (why would you have to change the name of the character when this book was re-written?), and there are a large enough number of other small mistakes that derailed my train of thought just often enough to make me drop this review from four stars to three.This book was candy, not a three-course meal, and as a candy-book, it was wonderful. You read it quickly, enjoy it, and then move on to another book. Go in expecting a light and quick read, and you'll be happy.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book was worth the read. It was not Stephanie Plum, but if it were that would of added to her series. I don't understand all the bad ratings either. I thought it was a very cute story.Not the adventure but I didn't find this story as predictable as the rest of the reviewers. I found the humor and character style like with the Plum series.This was the first in the series and rewritten. I can only lay odds that the next one will be even that much better. This book was worth the read and I am sorry for all the bad reviews, I truly do not understand them."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book took a lot of patience to complete, and I still can't believe I read the whole thing.Stuck in midstream without a paddle, it floats between romance, mystery, mayhem and madness. Evanovich's usually quirky characters fly off the believability radar like stealth bombers, unfortunately undetected by my bad book warning system.What starts out as a rich man, divorced woman love story in a horsey setting, becomes a comedy circus of professional wrestlers, crazy people, insects and endless (and I mean ENDLESS) repetition.Evanovich and Hughes seem to have forgotten the KISS principle for effective writing, and I would recommend you forget this one.Amanda Richards, February 26, 2005(KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid)"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This was one of the most awful books I've ever read, and I can't believe it came from the same author who brings us the Stephanie Plum series.Even after finishing the book, I have absolutely no idea why a charming playboy millionaire fell in love with a divorced schoolteacher with two small children. One day Billie shows up to take polo lessons, then suddenly Nick's got his cousin moving in with her, he's in love with her, and they're talking marriage. There was no development of the relationship at all. And since the two characters hopped into bed together so early in the book, there was no buildup -- the rest of the book seemed like filler until the \\"big climax,\\" which was about as predictable as I've ever come across, since it was obvious who the bad guy was the minute I first saw their name appear in the book.The book was also poorly edited -- Nick was referred to as Neil during one paragraph, Billie's son Joel went for two or three pages being called Joey, and the lady who sold Billie her wedding dress was introduced as Emma, then became Ida in the next paragraph.Romance is obviously not this writer's forte, nor is proofing and editing. She really should spend her time fine-tuning her Stephanie Plum series, which is starting to become repetitious and stagnant, rather than cashing in on her name putting out garbage like this to pad her bank account."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Since I'm a huge fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, I eagerly picked up this book, expecting the snappy, witty voice I've come to expect. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. In fact, the style is so different, if I hadn't seen Evanovich on the cover I would never have identified it as one of hers. Although I understand this is a revised version of an earlier book, FULL HOUSE wasn't THAT much earlier (four or five years at the most) than the first Plum book, so I wouldn't have expected such vast differences between the two. While there are flashes of cleverness in some of the dialogue, the prose is often sluggish and predictable, the chemistry between the protagonists is flat, and the frequent, and unclear, point of view changes are exhausting. Compared with the Plum books, this one seems extremely amateurish in comparison.I'm not sure I understand how the collaboration between Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes was supposed to &quot;improve&quot; this early work. For someone with such a wonderful, and well deserved, reputation to team up with another writer -- when this is the result -- makes little sense to me. I will anxiously await the next Evanovich book, whether a new Stephanie Plum or not, but will be steering clear of any future books written by this team."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a BIG fan of the Stephanie Plum novels. They are such fun to read, so I decided to try other books by Ms. Evanovich, starting with Full House.The first half of the book was rather vanilla, but not intolerably so. There was little plot, the characters were uninteresting, and the viewpoint was a hodge-podge of omniscient and third person subjective which was so confusing at times, I had a hard time separating truth/fact from character opinion. For someone as well-published as Evanovich, this book was very poorly written. It reads like someone's first novel. When I learned it was one of her earlier works, I thought I could cut her some slack, but to find out this is a re-written version of it -- BLECH. She should have known enough about how to tell a story by now. This book should have been allowed to go quietly out of print.I lost interest half-way through the book, and while I am struggling to force myself through it, I don't think I'm going to make it. The dialog is boring, the characters cardboardy, and the plot has simply died. There's nowhere for them to go. The conflict has just petered out, so it's more like looking in the window of an ordinary person, watching their ordinary daily lives. Yawn. Don't waste your money. Get a Stephanie Plum novel if you want a fun read."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I felt cheated after buying this book and starting to read it. It was horrible. And yes, I knew this was an early work, but I can't believe Janet Evanovich wasn't just putting this one out for the money. IT STANK. The characters were flatter than cartoons. It was ripe with cliche's. I agree, you definitely could see how far Janet has come with the Stephanie Plum books, but I thought her re-writing this would be better than it was. I could have written a better book than this. I had the urge to rewrite it every time I picked it up. I finally stopped picking it up and never finished it. I can't believe she did this to her fans."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"After reading through all eight stephanie plum novels in the course of a week and a half this summer, I eagerly snatched up Full House at the book store, grateful for a &quot;fix&quot; before the next plum novel. I'm so sorry to say that it certainly did not meet my expectations. The relationship between the two main characters was boring and implausible. I didn't grow to like either one of them. I liked some of the secondary characters but they were not a big enough part of the book to carry it off. I am hoping that this book is not a hint of what is to come with future stephanie plum novels. I will be very sad."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Do not go into reading this novel expecting a characteristic Plum adventure! Take it for what it was intended to be...a lighthearted, wispy romance. Since it's from the beginnings of Evanovich's career as a writer, the story does not have the same depth and character development as seen in the Plum series. The attempts at wittiness are hindered, I believe, by the collaboration with fellow writer Charlotte Hughes. The secondary characters, in their outlandishness, are comparable to those in the Plum series. However, the main characters, Nick and Billie, don't hold their own among the minor characters. I can't say I was disappointed with this novel because I read it without expecting much from it. I think this was an attempt to tide over fans that eagerly await the next installment of the Stephanie Plum series. While this was a pleasant enough read, it just didn't accomplish that for me. I'll pass the time some other way as we all wait for the return of our favorite zany Jersey girl."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Wait for the next Stephanie Plum book. Do not waste your money on this unless you're looking for insight into Evanovich's evolution as a writer. This is not the worst book I've ever read, but if you're expecting the brilliance she's evolved to and we've come to expect from her you'll be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book would have been pretty ok if an unnecessary and ridiculous action sequence wouldn't have been forced in at the end. I didn't find very much humor in this book which was fine because I really enjoyed the characters, felt like they were given much more depth than the characters in the Stephanie Plum novels, and actually missed them when I was finished with the book. I don't really read romances, because I get so tired of innocent conversations between the characters resulting in internal suspicion, doubt, and questions, but if the book would have stuck with romance I probably would have gone with a 7/10 rating.Maybe if the bad guy would have been developed better he would have worked. He was just too inconsistent. There was new material and new characters added to the original 1980's version of this book? I never read the original, but I believe I know what character and scene was added and unfortunately it didn't get worked into the story well and didn't belong. However, Janet Evanovich remains a gifted writer. 4/10"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought Full House and Full Tilt based on how much I liked the Stephanie Plum novels. I thought anything by the same author had to be good.

THIS book certainly confirms that.Shame on you!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I think Janet Evanovich didn't write this book. I think Charlotte Hughes wrote it and Janet Evanovich is trying to get her friend established (published!). This was one of the worst books I've ever read and I'm a devoted Stephanie Plum fan. I think Janet Evanovich should think twice about putting her name on these books by Charlotte Hughes. I note there's a new one out right now.

As one reader commented, it's similar to a &quot;beach read&quot; requiring nothing more of you than your sense of humor. Yes, it's predictible, but are the Plum series worthy of any literary prize? No, we read them not for the plot development but for the characters we've grown to love. A Full House was one of life's guilty pleasures.

I allowed myself to go with the flow and enjoyed what I could.I found myself feeling embarrassed for the author. It is ashamed that this book was not edited properly. Besides the Nick/Neil mistakes there was Detective Ferrell/Farrell misspelling and a few other obvious mistakes. I have to admit that the carelessness taken to produce this book made me feel a little taken.On a positive note ... the book was a cute fantasy story. Being a single mom at one time it was fun to fantasize that there would be someone like Nick, a knight in shining armor, that would fall in love with the \\"whole package.\\" And, at least there was enough humor in the book to leave a smile on my face.I can't say that I will recommend this book like I have most of her others.

The characters in this series are just as crazy as the characters in the Stephanie Plum series. Deidra and Max were my favorite characters in this series. I can't wait to read the rest of this series; hopefully Max has a story in one of them.

When he sets eyes on her in motion, he can't help the laughter because she doesn't belong in his class. She is a klutz, and has obviously never been on a polo horse in her entire life. When she has an accident, Nick takes her to the hospital, and then home. Nick can't figure out exactly why, but he is incredibly attracted to Billie. She is not at all the type of women he normally goes out with, but he is very reluctant to leave her home once he is there.Billie can't believe her luck.

An entertaining read."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"As mentioned in the main review, this is an expanded version of a book with the same title written by Ms. Evanovich under the pseudonym Steffie Hall. I've read both books, and while my preference is the earlier version, readers who haven't read that one will surely enjoy this version. The earlier version seemed tighter plot-wise, but the additions made in the new version fall in nicely with the tone of the book.If you like Ms. Evanovich's writing, you will like this book. The dialogue is interesting and witty. The romance/sexual tension is nicely done. I really liked the character of Billie, a divorced mom with two kids who's also an excellent sixth grade teacher. She was a nice change of pace. Nick is one of Ms. Evanovich's classic sexy male lead characters - always a treat. The secondary characters are nicely quirkly (a former beauty queen, professional wrestlers, a pest control professional, a boy genius, etc.), and of course there is an exploding car.Since we have to wait at least a year for a new Stephanie Plum novel, this book will serve nicely to fill the publishing gap."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I read a couple of Stephanie Plum novels. Unlike many of the reviews, I actually find this new series quite good. Of course you know need to treat this as a classic literature, if all you need is a light and funny book, say for a long plane trip, this is the book.I thought this will be just a romance story. Not only it has the same comical characters (like in the Plum novels), it has more romance but also with some elements of suspense. These will keep you finish the whole book quickly.Give it a try."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This disappointing, earlier effort by Ms Evanovich is a mismatch of romance, humor, mystery and shallow characters. In her later &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; stories, she found a balance of these elements that is quite enjoyable. This time out, only her most dedicated fans will be pleased.At its heart, &quot;Full House&quot; is a romance novel: A Cinderella story of love at first sight. But the simple charm of two people falling in love is overwhelmed by seemingly endless passages directly relating their thoughts, doubts and misunderstandings.The oddball characters that are so much fun with Stephanie Plum are jarring and distracting here. Their primary literary purpose is -- apparently -- to create gaps between the aforementioned passages about the inner thoughts and feelings of the protaganists.There is a mystery of sorts, but it's entirely incidental, simplistic and disengaging. And the resolution is not much more than &quot;then they were all run over by a bus&quot;.All the characters are shallow, cardboard cutouts. At no time did their actions reveal a deeper, believable person. This is ironic considering the amount of ink devoted to inner thoughts. In the Plum novels, the shallow characters make the fun, fun. (If we empathized with Lulu or Stephanie, we'd cry when their cars blew up.)&quot;Full House&quot; was an experiment in mixing romance, screwball characters and a bit of mystery together. It failed. Thankfully, Ms Evanovich learned from her experience and got it right the next time."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It was written just like every day life with its problems in families. Theirs was a little more chaotic than most. Very humorous."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I loved this book, I think it's one of her best. It didn't keep you hanging on at the end like Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I will admit that it was not as good as Stephanie and her grandma, but it was cute and worth the read. As long as you are expecting a fun, quick romance, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Janet Evanovich you are a legend.We will be ardent fans of yours forever.Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book is written by Janet Evanovich, the author who brings you Stephanie Plum.This is a love story about a devious man, an uncooperative woman, and a misguided genius. It is laced with fast-paced action, dysFUNctional loveable characters, suspense, and lots of laughs."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I bought this with reservations, loving Plum as I do, and had to struggle to finish it. The difference in writing style is marked. It's a sweet story, but nothing special, or maybe I've just been ruined by Stephanie Plum. Please, Ms Evanovich, go back to Jersy!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I was so disappointed by this book! I know it was originallywritten in 1989, but I really expected something much better since it was supposed to have been re-written to be bigger andbetter. I skimmed through alot of it. The characters and storyline were totally unbelievable and the romance and proposal happened way too fast. First Billie is supposed to be this strong, smart single mom, next thing you know she is marrying someone she met 2 weeks ago...Unfortunately this book is another case of a newly popular author putting out a not very good book to cash in on recent popularity. I'm surprised Janet Evanovich would get on the &quot;Put Out Anything to Make Money&quot; bandwagon, butthe proof she did is Full House. Stick with the Plum books, which are truly awesome, this one is so disappointing to Stephanie/Janet fans it's heartbreaking!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Well, well, well...with everyone being so harsh on Ms. Evanovich, figured I'd be nice. I liked this book. It's not one I'd put on the shelf next to classic Faulkner, Hemingway, or Thoreau, but it was definitely a nice &quot;light&quot; read. I call her books &quot;airplane books&quot; because they're typically witty, fun, and can easily be read on a 3-hour flight.This book was simply put, a romantic mystery. Sure, it was predictable, but Evanovich did throw in some curves to add doubts to your predictions. Billie (the divorced mom of two) and her crazy romance with Nick (the rich man) was highly unrealistic, but hey, the story made me laugh out loud, cry at times, get my anxiety all worked up, feel all icky (spiders...eww), even make me hot and bothered.Sure, it had some typos and some major editing mistakes (particularly with character names), but hey, I'm sure Evanovich will hire a new editing team for the next book. I'd DEFINITELY RECOMMEND Full House for a fun, &quot;light,&quot; afternoon read!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a big fan of Evanovich books; I love the Stephanie Plum novels. However, this novel was very sophomoric and quite predictable. I felt very let down by this effort with Charlotte Hughes. I would have rated this 0 stars if given that option!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"\\"Full House\\" by Janet Evanovich is a re-printed and re-written version of an early romance novel by the author of the hugely popular Stephanie Plum mystery series. And in my opinion, it's because of the fact that the majority of the people buying this book are mystery fans, not romance fans, that \\"Full House\\" has gotten such a bad reputation. It is mismarketing by the publisher and bookstores to house this book in the mystery section, which was where I found it, but as light and fluffy romances go, \\"Full House\\" is not half bad. And this book is undeniably a romance novel. As far as a rating goes, I'm wavering between three and four stars. I honestly did enjoy the story and found myself completely entertained by this light and amusing tale. But there were a few things that took away from my enjoyment, most notably, the atrocious editing job. There were glaring errors scattered liberally throughout the book, including the changing of some main characters names! I'd like to give \\"Full House\\" four stars, because I really did like it, but because of the markedly poor editing I'm dropping it down to three (if I could I'd compromise with ***1/2).\\"Full House\\" tells the story of Billie Pearce, a divorced mother of two who finds herself lonely and bored when her children go away on vacation with their father. Deciding to try something new, Billie signs up for polo lessons. The actual polo is a disaster, but her polo instructor, wealthy playboy Nick Kaharchek, is another story. After having her foot stomped on by a horse, Billie is taken to the hospital by Nick, and their fascination with one another begins.Used to sophisticated and snobby women, Nick is drawn to the lovely, warm, and real Billie. And Billie finds Nick irresistible, though she's sure a handsome, rich, and exciting man like him would never be interested in her. But there is an intense chemistry that sparks between them, that neither Nick nor Billie can deny, and they begin a fun, romantic, and somewhat unusual courtship.Things start to get crazy when Nick convinces Billie to let his cousin Deedee stay with her until her upcoming wedding, and Billie inherits a redheaded whirlwind! Billie finds Deedee utterly exhausting, and quite annoying, not to mention the presence of her enormous fianc&eacute;, wrestler Frankie the assassin. Billie's not quite sure how things got so out of control, but she knows that Nick Kaharchek is to blame. Not that she's able to stay mad at him.And Nick has lots of problems worse than Deedee, including her cousin Max, a young genius in hiding on Nick's vast property, on a mission that involves blowing things up and generally running amok. Billie finds this a little frightening, but she has other things to worry about too, like Nick's jealous and nasty ex-fianc&eacute;e. Add in Billie's bug-killing neighbour and a touch of mystery near the end, and you have yourself an offbeat, light, and pleasant romance.There isn't a whole lot of conflict between the main characters, nor in the story as a whole, really. It's just a quick and fun read that can be read, enjoyed and then most likely forgotten. \\"Full House\\" isn't a fabulous, standout novel, but it's not awful either. My advice is that even if you're a big Evanovich fan; if you don't like romances, don't read this book. But if you enjoy romances and non-demanding, feel-good tales then \\"Full House\\" is worth the read."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is an old book that was &quot;reworked&quot; and, IMHO, Ms. E should have let sleeping dogs lie. The author appears to have done this reworking to give we Plum fans &quot;more of the same.&quot; Sorry, but this is so NOT that. I suppose if I was a fan of romance novels, this may have been a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm not. For a while, I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to finish it. Granted, the last half isn't as bad as the first, but if this is what the author thinks readers of the Plum series want, I will be very wary of buying any more non-Plum Evanovich novels after having read this one."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Having just recently found the Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series, I was excited about something &quot;new&quot; from the same author. As it turns out, I'm glad I read the Plum series first. If Full House had been my first Evanovich novel, I might not have returned as a Plum reader. This book was disappointing, to say the least. I read 76 pages and couldn't bring myself to continue, even though I rarely leave a book unfinished--this was the exception! It was dull and plodding, the characters were not believable, interesting, or entertaining, and there was absolutely nothing in the first 76 pages that made me want to know more about any of them. I'll continue to read the Plum series, but I'll leave Evanovich's attempts at light romance alone."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I have always looked forward to the next Stephanie Plum book byJanet Evanovich, so I was very happy when I saw this book andbought it. When I realized it wasn't a Stephanie Plum mystery,I thought it still would probably be good since it's written byEvanovich. Wrong! I found it dull, with little humor, andquite boring. The characters were flat and the dialog wasterrible. I devoutly hope that Ms. Evanovich will treat us toanother Stephanie book soon. I don't plan to buy any other bookwritten by her unless it's a &quot;Plum,&quot; always outrageous andhilarious."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is not a new Stephanie Plum book,but an old Evanovich novel (first published in 1989,I think) that has been re-printed.It has many of the trademarks of a typical Evanovich novel:the humour,the rich cast of supporting characters etc.Like in her Plum books,you grow to like and care about the characters.Howeverthis is more of a straight forward romance novel;there is a mystery,but it takes the backseat in this story.Nick and Billie are wonderful characters,and &quot;Full House&quot; makes an engaging and sweet romance.If you need a book to relax and enjoy for a few hours,This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I was sooooo excited when I saw this book in the store, as I love Janet Evanovich. What a disappointment! It is nothing but a junkie romance. To be honest, I only read 50 pages and had to put it down. It was so awful I couldn't see wasting another minute on it. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"A Full House is what Janet Evanovich claims to have in this alleged improvement on an early novel -- but she's bluffing, big-time. Stilted writing, a banal plot, and characters shallower than most politicians. I'd feel guilty re-selling it for 50 cents at a garage sale. Shame on the publisher and Ms. Evanovich for conning those of us who enjoyed her later writing."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully. Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development. Yuck.She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing. Uh, not in this one. The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Apparently Janet Evanovich wrote romances in an earlier incarnation and this is one of them. Macho men aren't supposed to read romances but there's only one new Stephanie Plum a year and my addiction is such that I had to scrape the barrel.As regrards plot it has the one size fits all plot derived from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Elizabeth Bennett is played by Billy Pearce, a divorced 38 year old mother of two. Darcy is played by Nicholas Kaharchek,a millionaire newspaper owner and polo horse trainer There are some misunderstandings between them but then in the end you'll never guess what happens.Are there any traces of the brilliance of the One, Two, Three ...Nine series? Occasionally - there's a good scene of buying a wedding dress with a salesperson whose previous job was IRS auditor. The writing is full of cliches. On one page we have&quot;expert hands&quot; &quot;Thoughts into a tailspin&quot;&quot;utterly confused&quot;&quot;fresh-scrubbed look&quot;&quot;simple nature&quot;&quot;put on airs&quot; and a man wonders &quot;What was the power she had over him that made him desire her.&quot; I've read that romance writers deliberately stick to stereotyped plots and use cliches so maybe it's not all JE's fault. A lot of people like romances and many art forms use conventional formulas. (And Pride and Prejudice is a great novel.}It's interesting from the point of view of Evanovichian scholarship and I'd love to know what the input of Charlotte Hughes was and to lay my hands on an unaltered early work."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I happen to really like Evanovich's &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; series, so I decided to pick up this book. After reading it, and it was a struggle to read, I can only say I am glad I didn't pay hardcover prices to read one of my favorite authors. Ms. Evanovich has let me down.The book obviously didn't make the bestsellers list years ago - but now - the author is marketing it again....why, probably because she has a following who buys her books.Well, if the next book isn't any better than this.............I'll probably decide to read a few chapters in the bookstore before investing the money (hardcover OR paperback)."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is a light and endearing early work by the author of the outrageously funny Stephanie Plum series. It's a bit unfair to compare this book with the Plums. (It's unfair to compare most anything with the Plums.) \\"Full House\\" is romantic, sweet natured, and doesn't have what so many romance writers feel is the necessary plot device of having the main characters hate or mistrust each other halfway through the book. No angst.How can you dislike a book that is well written and has a housewife as the romantic lead character? Go Billie! Snag that gorgeous guy with homemade chocolate chip cookie fumes. Who says that being a normal, well-adjusted family isn't a guy magnet?Evanovich teases the reader with the kind of off-the-wall characters she'll use so well in the Plum series. Nick's nephew Max, the teenage bomb-mixing genius, and his gorgeous older sister DeeDee, engaged to a wrester, are just the sorts of characters you expect to explore in an Evanovich book. She does the characters better now, but these are a great offbeat touch to balance Billie's middle-class life. The way Billie and Nick adjust to each other's families is what makes the book fun to read. So read it!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"as the old TV show by the same name. You know, the one that featured John Stamos' hair, and introduced the Olsen twins? Well, this book is just as probable as the show.Evanovich starts with an interesting heroine and premise, and things go well up until the wrestler, Frankie is introduced. From that point on, the woman who's slapstick humor fuels her Stephanie Plum series gets carried away into the improbable zone.I finished the book and didn't hate it. Hope Evanovich continues to publish now that she's increased her skill and doesn't succumb to going back to her old work, which wasn't published widely, for a reason."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I really look forward to Janet Evanovich's \\"Stephanie Plum\\" series, so tried \\"Full House\\". While the beginning held some interest for me, in getting to know these new characters, the second half of the book just seemed to go down hill pretty fast. Dialog dragged and the characters just weren't fleshed out very well. By the end of the book I found I just didn't care any more and finished it just out of curiosity. There just wasn't any feeling of excitement, and no real sparks between the characters. I was glad it finally ended. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"A single mother of two becomes engaged to her polo instructor after knowing him only a few days. This is a story Ms. Evanovich had written earlier and resurrected it now that she's famous, adding some things to it for this publication. It promises to be like the Stephanie Plum novels, and it does not deliver. Characters are wooden. Dialogue is corny. There's no excitement. The only suspense is at the end, which perks up the story but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the book. Very disappointing, when this writer is capable of so much more."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book is a collaboration with one of Janet's friends, and I have a hard time believing that Janet actually had much to do with the writing of this book! It starts out as a VERY cheesy romance (hey, I'm an avid reader and have been known to read a few romance novels) novel and it's just awful. The second half of the book picks up a bit of speed and becomes slightly more interesting, but then at the ending the speed is so fast you can barely keep up. It was as if the authors decided they'd better make this all a little more &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; to keep the readers interested in the &quot;Full -&quot; series, and... it just made no sense.Of course I bought Full Tilt (the 2nd in this series) at the same time, so I had to read that one. That one was a touch better, but I'll review it seperately (;In conclusion, if you loooove Stephanie Plum, um... don't read these just because you feel loyal to Janet, like I did."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I couldn't wait for another book by this author but reading this book was a huge dissapointment. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. If I wanted to read a romance novel I would have bought one (which I never will). Her other books are funny and entertaining. Ms. Evanovich needs to skip the sex and go back to detective stories."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Sorry, but this book is for women who continue to kiss frogs hoping one will turn into a prince! Virtuous Billie, a school teacher mom (of course, her X was the bum, she's the victim), meets a rich and powerful newspaper magnate when she decides to take up polo lessons (she's been on a horse once in childhood). Within two weeks this handsome womanizer becomes an average middle class fella who loves her and her children (oh yeah, and her kids like him because he has horses, not because he's rich). Her family values are tossed aside as she climbs into bed with him but of course she's redeemed when she teaches him how to relate to his needy teenage cousin. Are you still not convinced this is drivel? Here's how far the fanatsy is out of reach: 1) She's so nice she's talked into taking a stranger into her home! And 2) when his luxury model car breaks down, he doesn't rent a car but drives the stable's pick up truck loaded with manure. Ah, he must be a regular Joe. Get real. Miss Evanovich has shamelessly used her fans with this one. Wake up women!!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I was very disappointed to say the least. The Stephanie Plum series are awesome and I do have to admit that I had the expectancy that this novel would rank among her others. I think that Janet Evanovich should stick to what works, not venture into something that is clearly not her expertise. I won't be buying her next novel in this new series, &quot;Full Tilt&quot;. It will probably be &quot;Full Wilt&quot;."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Definitely not up to the standard of the Stephanie Plum novels.

I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan and thought it would be very interesting to see how Janet tackled a non-Plum story. I'm sorry to say it,but it was just awful! I have this bad habit of finishing every book I start so I painstakingly plodded through this one for about 3 weeks. I kept hoping it would improve, but to no avail. All of the things I love about Stephanie's character, and Ms. Evanovich's wonderful, hilarious writing style are missing here. Instead of Stephanie's plucky, funny, tenacious character, the central character in Full House is way too perfect (a beautiful school teacher)and BORING!! Instead of Stephanie's wonderful cadre of outrageous friends and family (Grandma Mazur, Lula, Ranger), in Full House there's a lame ex-girlfriend, a \\"crazy\\" nephew, and an eccentric niece. All of the characters are underdeveloped, which is probably OK since I didn't care for any of them anyway. And since Nick and Billie meet and fall in love in the first section of the book, there is absolutely no tension or mystery to pull us along. This one is a big fat yawn! It was a weird mix of totally bland story, forgettable characters, with some x-rated sex scenes thrown in. What's up with that?"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series and had read the original &quot;Full House&quot;. I really enjoyed this new updated version. I don't understand all the bad ratings. No, it is not as good as the Plum series but it is a cute little romance book. The mystery plot is predictable but I enjoyed seeing how it played out. It was also a hoot. The wrestling game scene and the bachelor party were especially funny parts. After reading &quot;Full House&quot; I am really looking forward to the next release &quot;Full Tilt&quot; and have discovered a new author...Charlotte Hughes."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Not recommended. I think that Evanovich was cashing in on her name and the success of S. Plum by digging up this old novel of hers and rehashing it. It took TWO people to write something this bad? Not worth it. Characters are uninteresting and un-sexy. Stick with reading about Stepanie Plum, one of my favorite series."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Having been a long-time fan of the author's Stephanie Plum series, I started this book with the expectation of a good read. Wrong! It was so bad that I didn't bother finishing it, but merely skimmed the last 50+ pages. Here are just a few of its faults: It had none of the charm and witty repartee of Stephanie Plum and company; the author tried hard to make the characters looney-but-lovable, but they ended up just being unlikeable; and the identity of the \\"bad guy\\" was telegraphed early on. The book reads more like a bad romance novel than a mystery. Luckily, I wasn't out any money, since the book was loaned to me. The author should be ashamed of herself for letting her publisher talk her into reprinting it. Her fans deserve better than being [taken] like this. Though I've already pre-ordered the next Stephanie Plum book, I doubt that I'll ever buy any of the author's previously published books . . . not unless they've received glowing praise by all who've reviewed them."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is the most trite and unconvincing writing I have read since -- well, now that I think of it, maybe ever.It is extremely disappointing that Janet Evanovich was willing to have this published after her very engaging, funny and convincing Stephanie Plum books -- as wild as they are, they have a ring of truth.There is no such ring in Full House -- it is straight out of Ladies Home Journal -- handsome, rich, sensitive guy who happens to be still single at 35 falls for cute divorced housewife who smells like chocolate chip cookies and has a good attitude. There is an undeveloped villian who pops up at the end; some almost funny side-characters -- but everything is too sterotypied to even be worth reading.This book makes me worried about the next Stephanie -- is Janet grasping at straws?"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I couldn't wait for Full House to arrive at the bookstore. I thought it would be a fast read, and a fun new series to fill in the gaps between reading the Stephanie Plum books by Evanovich that are so enjoyed by her fans (myslef included). I bought the book and took it on vacation, only to realize that after forcing myself to read half of the book, I could not continue. The characters are not fun or entertaining, especially in comparison with the Plum characters. I hope that Janet Evanovich will shelve this book and any to follow in a series, and if not, develop the characters to be if not believable, at least fun."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Like must readers, I am a big fan of Ms. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Series but, I did not set my hopes on this book being like or written in the Stephanie Plum style.I think must of Ms. Evanovich's readers were looking for or expecting this book to contain funny and outlandish characters like the Stephanie Plum Novels. But this is a romance book and not really a mystery.Like most romance novels, the setting is the same; a man and woman meet, they feel this special chemistry and they feel this physical attraction but they try to fight off. The woman is portrayed as an old-fashioned gal, the one who will never trust another man because she was hurt in a pass relationship, don't kiss on the first date and just a miss goodie, goodie. The man is this big strong playboy, who is drop dead gorgeous, can have any woman he wants, who has many of girlfriends, but does not want to settle down, so he breaks up the relationship, when they fall in love with him. Basically, the book starts off slow and boring and at one point, I was ready to put the book down. But when I continue to read, I noticed that strange and bizaar incidents were happening to the characters and I found myself wanted to know who, what, and why. So the novel did contain mystery and I could detect some of the author's writing style that she uses in the Stephanie Plum's series.My suggestion when reading this book, don't look for the Stephanie Plum environment or characters but tell yourself, this is the author's earlier work and this is romance."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan and was delighted she has something on the market outside of the Plum series, however, this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a huge Stephanie Plum fan, and I was really looking forward to reading something new and different by Evanovich. However, I have to say I am very disappointed by this book: Full House. Some of the flaws can be laid to poor proofing and editing. But the deeper flaw is that the wacky cast of characters simply isn't funny.Proofing errors include: 1] Nick's name changing to \\"Neil\\" once in a following sentence; 2] Billie's father becoming Frankie's father in the following sentence; 3] Billie's one brother becoming \\"one of her brothers\\" in discussing spiders late in the book; 4] Sheridan's age which fluctuates wildly: at one point, DeeDee discusses Sheridan in such a way that it sounds like they were in school together; at the end of the book, Nick talks about playing with Sheridan as a kid and growing up with her, which would indicate that she is 10 years older than implied by DeeDee. As for editing, the book does not flow smoothly. The additional material seems to have been forced into the existing story rather than the story being entirely re-written. Catherine Coulter has frequently redone books from earlier in her career. If she hadn't said she'd rewritten them, one would never know, they flow so smoothly.The most amusing thing about Full House is the name sets: Billie, Joel, and Christie; Buffy and Spike. There may be other fun name sets, but those were the two I picked up on.The excerpt from Visions of Sugar Plums at the end of the book is funnier than the entire Full House, which even as a romance is only so-so. I cannot recommend Full House to any Plum readers."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This book was sophomoric, dull and an insult to all the loyal readership of Janet Evanovich. I am very disapponted. A waste of money."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a Janet Evanovich fan, having read all of her Plum novels. It was exciting to find that she was reintroducing a new series, as I am also a fan of series books and have enjoyed Evanovich's style of humor and mystery. Of course, knowing the new series was a romantically based plot, I didn't expect mystery, but I did expect realism, interesting characters and unpredictable story lines. Disappointingly, what I got was just the opposite.If this has been the first Evanovich book I ever read, I never would have picked up &quot;One for the Money&quot; and the others. The plot is not only predictable and unrealistic, it is flat out unbelievable and immature. It could have been written by a starry-eyed teenager, dreaming of her knight-prince to come in on his horse and sweep her off her feet away from all the problems of the world. Come on, this is the real world here.The female lead, a divorced mother who conveniently has time to spare given that her children are away for the summer, falls into a rapid romance with a rich, good looking, seemingly perfect man (all the stuff we dream of, girls) who pursues her and asks her to marry him after only knowing her for a few days! The children, upon their return, welcome him with open arms, and all ends happily, despite minor tribulations from absurd characters, a seemingly early, albeit poor, attempt at the Plum style of colorful, goofy characters.(While I know the Plum novels were not entirely realistic either, most of the plot lines were believable and the characters had some depth. None of that here.) Again, I did not expect this to be a Plum novel, and didn't want it to be, but I expected it to be well thought out and believable.The bottom line: I abandoned this book on the lounge chair in Mexico, only half-read. Maybe someone else picked it up and enjoyed it, but in reality, I hope it was thrown out by the attendant."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"As much as I enjoyed reading Stephanie Plum series, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I can't beleive it was written by the same person! The book is flat, predictable and full of cheap romance novel clich&eacute;s. I don't know what was this book doing in a mystery section at the bookstore; there is no mystery in it, and it's missing the down-to-earth humor of Stephanie Plum series. I couldn't bring myself to finishing this book, it was so bad. Janet Evanovich, I want my $8 back!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I want my money back!This isn't a new Evanovich novel, it's recycled garbage! This book wasn't even good enough to be a Harlequin the first time it came out - it was a Silouette - and now that Evanovich is fanous for her Stephanie Plum novels, they've recycled this piece of dreck to capitalize off of her reputation.I have never felt so cheated by a publisher as I did when I tried to read this book."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Having just finished all 8 in the Stephanie Plum series, I grabbed this Evanovich novel, hungry for more of the good stuff that makes those books such page-turners. Was I disappointed! Cardboard characters, cliche-riddled dialogue, far-fetched yet predictable plot. I am not sure if this book preceded the Plum novels - if so, the author has definitely improved over time. I'm sticking with the Plum novels from now on, and so should Janet Evanovich."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"It is amazing that this book is by the same author of the Stephanie Plum series! This book was corny, predictable, and so unrealistic that the characters were not endearing at all to the reader. It was extremely hard for me to finish it at all. I kept thinking it would get better and I was wrong. The poor editing was my biggest complaint considering the main male characer is referred to as Neil instead of Nick right in the midst of a love scene! It doesn't get any worse than that. If you enjoy the Plum series, you will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"You know, warning bells were going off in my head when I bought this book and I should have listened. This is a revamped, recycled early effort of this popular author, done in conjunction with another writer. In other words, she's a money maker, the publisher wanted to milk her for all she's worth, but she's too busy/not interested in bringing the old stuff up to date. About all I can say that's good about this book is that the characters are promising and in the hands of another author (think Jennifer Crusie) they could have really come to life. As it is, this book is a complete waste of time and I have only myself to blame (always listen to those inner voices). The irony is that I have not read any other of Ms Evanovich's wildly popular books - and I'm so disgruntled over this rip off, I probably won't."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This was horrible. It's hard to believe that it was rewritten and was still this bad. Now, if I had never read an Evanovich book my reaction might be less harsh, but I've read all her Stephanie Plum's and loved them. This just doesn't measure up. It seemed too worked and too trite."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I am a huge fan of Janet Evanovich. I own a copy of every book she ever wrote, including Full House in its original version. I am convinced that the reason over 70 disappointed reviewers (to date) can't recognize Evanovich's wonderful comic voice in this rewrite is because the rewrite gave the book Charlotte Hughes's voice, which is (sorry, Ms. Hughes) plodding and flat (I really disliked Hot Shot, which I only read because I heard Evanovich liked her so much she had her do the Full House rewrite). In addition, the plotting flaws that everyone complains about, the one-dimensional, boring characters, the lack of humor and sexual tension, a sense that many events are just thrown in with no rhyme or reason--all this, I'm afraid, can also be laid to the door of Ms. Hughes's unfortunate rewrite.What is most sad of all, though, among all the problems this book has, is the horrible editing. What a commentary on the state of today's publishing world that even a superstar like Ms. Evanovich doesn't rate any editing by her publisher!Like most other readers commenting here, I had to *force* myself to read this book to the end, and after the first half I was skimming. Reading it was not fun, it was an experience in horror--not from the psycho-stalker villain, who was totally out of place in a light comedy--but rather the horror of feeling compelled to rubberneck at a train wreck--the wreck (please heaven I hope not!) of a wonderful writing career.Please, Ms. Evanovich, don't collaborate with Charlotte Hughes again!"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I love The Stephanie Plum series and keep on the look out for more by this author. This first book in The Full Series is a rewrite from an older version. It is a typical romantic novel that is enjoyable once in awhile, but the mystery is predictable. The read is quick and light reading. HOWEVER the important thing about this book is the introduction Of Max since he is one of the lead characters in the upcoming series. The other books are better mysteries with a light, fun atmosphere you find in The Plum books, including the sexual tension between the main characters. I have read Full Tilt and Full Scoop and have now just started Full Blast. They are not as meaty as The Stephanie Plum series, but I still enjoy them."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"To be fair, I can't give this book a thorough review, because I was unable to make it past the first few chapters. I'm not the type of person who usually puts down books once I've started them, but the characters, dialog and plot I encountered was hopelessly cliched and boring. I found myself skipping pages and chapters, and not really caring what happened.I might have been willing to give this book more of a shot, if I hadn't just muddled through another novel in the \\"Full\\" series and been so severely disappointed.Janet Evanovich is a very talented writer in her Stephanie Plum series, but I've found that her other books really miss the mark."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked this book up - I quite enjoy the Stephanie Plum books and so I was prepared to immerse myself in frothy, predictable fun. Nobody reads these because they are high literary \\"art.\\" They're like a meringue dessert - light on the tongue and pleasant, with no real effort at digestion.The Full Series was written with a co-author and prior to the Plum series, and you can see that Evanovich hasn't quite found her voice yet, though there are flashes of wit that hint at things to come. In one sequence, which made me giggle out loud, the lead character comments that she has pepper spray that she's keen to use before its expiration date.I have to admit that I did not see who the suspect was going to be until the finale of the book, which is unusual in these sorts of stories. I was pleasantly surprised that Evanovich had managed to fool me for almost 300 pages.All in all a pleasant diversion, though not in a league with her best work. The paperback copy that I read was supplemented with a short story featuring Stephanie Plum, and that was an added treat."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I picked this book up because I needed something light and funny. I usually don't read this type of book, but soon found myself smiling and even laughing out loud at times. Like I said, it was what I needed. Is it believable? Of course not. It is what it is supposed to be, light reading, funny, romantic, predictable ending and some suspense. If you are a fan of Stephanie Plum, this one doesn't compare to the Plum series. It is a rewrite of one of the author's previous books and shows how she evolved into Plum. For the genre that it is, it is a good read."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I was very disappointed with this book after reading One for the Money. I found this to be VERY ordinary and uneventful. I really wish I would have read the second installment of the Stephanie Plum series instead of this."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Single mother of two and six-grade teacher Billie Pearce has decided to take polo lessons, with hopes to impress her kids once they return from Disney World with her ex-husband. The problem is that she has no experience whatsoever, but her clumsiness with horses charms intructor and rich businessman Nick Kaharchek. Before she knows it, the horse has smashed her foot, and Nick is responsible for taking her to the ER and take her home safely.With hopes of avoiding a lawsuit, Nick offers Billie free polo lessons. But while Billie is on very strong pain medication, Nick convinces her to rent out an empty room to his outrageous cousin Deedee. Deedee tends to go through marriages quickly, but now she intends on marrying a wrestler named Frankie soon. Deedee tries to convince Billie that she deserves to remarry, but Billie ends up lusting after Nick. Fortunately, he's crazy about her too.In the neighborhood, there has been a string of robberies and break-ins. Nick is convinced that his younger cousin, 16-year-old Max, is involved, especially after he seemed to have managed to blow up Nick's Mercedes. Max has been missing for a while, but Billie manages to find him, and return him home, convinced he had nothing to do with any of the such.Now Billie is engaged to Nick, and they are both scheduled to get married at Deedee and Frankie's wedding --- yes, you guessed it! A double wedding. But the wedding goes terribly wrong.---I must've read this book four years ago when it was re-released. I'd never read the Stephanie Plum series, so I didn't know what to expect. The first time, I liked it. This time, not so much. Now that I've read the entire Stephanie Plum series, I guess my expectations were too high for the Full Series. Who knows, maybe it will grow on me, because I do plan the give the rest of the books in the Full Series a try.I guess I was hoping this book to have more comedy in it as the Stephanie Plum series, as well as a little more adventure. This book has little comedy that I noticed, but it was replaced with heavy romance and... SEX. And the adventure part of it didn't really pick up until the last 30 pages or so. I didn't enjoy it as much, but I know there will be lots of people who will love it. I'm just not one of them.One thing that had me a little confused were the names. Throughout the book, it seemed like they changed names like Nick to Neil, and Joel to Joey. It did crack me up a little :)"},{"Title":"Full House","review":"After devouring all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books, I was left wanting more from this fun author. I found a new series that Evanovich wrote with her friend and co-author Charlotte Hughes. FULL HOUSE is the first book in that series and although not as great as Stephanie Plum's books, it is a very fun book.FULL HOUSE is the story of Billie Pearce, a single mother of two. She's trying to figure out what to do with herself since her children are with their father on a vacation to Disney World for a month. She's lost and wanting an adventure. She decides to take polo lessons even though she has no prior experience with horses and she happens to be accident prone. Yep, definitely not something most people with those attributes would consider, but Billie is one of a kind.Her instructor is Nick Kaharcheck, a wealthy businessman who focuses on running the local newspaper and playing with his horses. Giving polo lessons is a fun thing for Nick until Billie shows up. She tries his patience and he soon learns that Billie on a polo pony may be more than his insurance can handle. Nick decides to offer her riding lessons to see if he can stop a disaster.The first riding lesson goes well until the horse steps on Billie's foot and ends up with Nick taking her to ER. He takes her home and while she's on pain pills and not thinking clearly, Nick talks her into letting his cousin, DeeDee, stay with her until DeeDee's upcoming wedding. See DeeDee is driving Nick crazy and if he can offload her onto Billie, then he will be thrilled. In Billie's hazed state, she agrees. This is where the book becomes fun.Seems DeeDee is a character. She's been married numerous times and is definitely a high maintenance woman. She sleeps until noon, and won't eat much or she'll lose her figure. Her entire outlook on life is the direct opposite of Billie or most people for that matter. Billie soon realizes that Nick was not completely truthful with her about DeeDee and wants to renege on the deal. But Nick has more than he can handle trying to find DeeDee's sixteen year old brother, Max, who is staying with Nick and has a penchant for blowing things up to make a point. His intelligence is off the charts and his common sense is lacking.Next thrown into the mix is DeeDee's fianc&eacute; - a pro wrestler who has an entourage of characters. Those guys are a scream, especially with DeeDee constantly trying to fix Billie up with one of them.The plot line gets a bit convoluted and the main idea is overshadowed by the antics of the cast. With the strong characters and the wit, I'm not sure that was a bad thing. It added levity to the plot and made the book difficult to put down. In fact, I remember some of the subplots easier than the main plot because they were so much fun.The main plot was a series of break-ins in Billie's neighborhood and her possibly being in danger. Yep, the fun of a wrestling match or trying to catch Max before he blows up something was definitely a lot more interesting.Character development was at Evanovich's best. DeeDee was a riot as were the wrestlers. Thinking of Billie hooking up with The Snakeman was absolutely hilarious. Max was interesting and we learned about him through his antics and were not introduced to him until near the end of the book. Billie and Nick were the stars and it was obvious that their romantic involvement was the strong point of the book. A few other sub-characters were also well done and kept things lively.I'm not sure why this is touted as a mystery instead of a romantic comedy. The mystery was lacking and almost non-existent. However the humor definitely made up for it and the added romance was enjoyable.Overall, this was a pleasant way to spend a few hours and definitely made me want to continue with the series. If you're looking for a lighthearted book that will give you a few laughs, then FULL HOUSE is one to get."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Bille is a sixth grade teacher, home for the summer and missing her two children who are off at Disney World with their father. While taking polo lessons she meets this rich, know to be a womanizing man. Thinking she was going to have a summer to herself, he ends up smack in the middle of her life with his relatives to boot.This book has romance, mystery, some bombs and spiders and a few laughs. The characters are lovable and its a nice story. There were some funny parts, but I never laughed out loud. I liked the book enough to continue with the series and read the next, but I had expected more.Its hard not to compare any of Janet Evanovich's books to her Stephanie Plum series. Most people who read this have probably read the Plum series as well. If you are expecting the same from this book, you will be disappointed. If you go into it not expecting it to be Plum, you may like it."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"This is nothing like the Stephanie Plum books. The writing is very different and it's written to a low reading level. If you like Janet Evanovich's other series, you probably won't like this one."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"We all had to agree, it was funny, twisted, and romantic, but most of all it was just a great and easy read. It was refreshing to read something that you just knew had to end as bizzarre as it started. It was hilarous..... we may read it again next year. I believe we will &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; at this one for a long time."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"In this \\"bigger and better\\" work from the team of Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hugges, Nick Kaharchek and Billie Pierce find their mutual attraction compelling, despite their obvious differences. He is a wealthy playboy polo teacher and she can't ride and bakes cookies and tends her two children.The \\"full house\\" results when Nick gets Billie to rent a room to his zany cousin Deedee (who is engaged to a wrestler). Along with DeeDee and another realtive, a genious teen named Max -- who is prone to making bombs -- and a pest man who can't stop the bugs in the neighborhood, and soon you feel right at home in the world of Evanovich. The \\"tension\\" comes at first from a pretense that Nick and Billie are also going to marry (supposedly to stop DeeDee from matchmaking) and later from a \\"mystery\\" about who is trying to sabotage things. A love triangle with Dheridan Flock seems tangential at best and was probably an addition to the new book that could have been left out.Full House was originally a sweet and simple romance by Janet Evanovich writing under the pen name Steffie Hall. The old version would most likely have disappointed most of her fans- at least those who have followed her recent stellar career. Smart woman that Ms. Evanovich is, she turned to her friend and fellow Loveswept Author Charlotte Hughes, and together they spiffed and polished and added depth. Ms. Hughes, Like Ms. Evanovich, has a wild sense of the absurd, and Hughes does ensemble comedy as well as Evanovich and Seinfeld (cf. HOT SHOT and A NEW ATTITUDE). The resulting book has the best of both authors: the depth, dialogue, and character of Hughes, and the warped slapstick that is the trademark Ms. Evanovich. While the romantic tension is not as well developed as in later Evanovich novels, the plot line is actually more like a mystery (albeit a straightforward one) than is typically the case in her Plum series, and the zany characters are quite memorable, and cry out for a sequel. I was on the edge of my seat for the last 1/3 of the book- and that part is all new material not in the original book. A fun and compelling book, with memorable and loveable misfits and a plot that is much improved from the original --already enjoyable -- romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"I love Janet Evanovich and was very excited when I heard she was coming out with a new book so I wouldn't have to wait until next June to get a fix (even if it wasn't a Stephanie Plum book). Well, this book didn't help.It is so obvious that it is from her Harlequin days it isn't even funny. I'm halfway through and I'm not sure how I got there. I dread picking it up, I can't wait to put it back down. I was going to force myself to finish, just in case it got better, but I don't think I want to waste my time anymore than I already have.If you are desparate to get a Janet fix, get one of the old Plum books, but if you absolutely must read this book, then get it from the library and don't waste your money. It's not worth it."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"Well, I've read many of the other reviews, and you can see by my rating that I have a different take. If you read this book expecting a mystery, you will be disappointed. However, I definitely think this book is in the Plum tradition like the author claims. After all, the mysteries in the Plum novels often seem to take a backseat to the crazy characters as far as I can tell. True, this book is predictable. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But predictable doesn't mean boring. The secondary characters were very, very funny. If you're like me and enjoy a wide variety of stories, then you should check this book out. It will make you laugh. If the mere mention of the word romance makes you break out in a cold sweat, then you might want to steer clear."},{"Title":"Full House","review":"A great escape from the realities of the world. some call this &quot;beach&quot; reading.

Folksinger Bill Staines was blessed to have been a part of that scene, first as an enthusiastic Boston area teenager, spending his evenings in the audience at the legendary Club 47 in Cambridge and later honing his own unique songwriting and performing skills. It is with this in mind I purchased \\"The Tour\\". Bill's many first-hand recollections of these magical times alone are a good reason to read this book.Years ago I stumbled across the novel \\"Blue Highways: A Journey Into America\\" by William Least Heat-Moon. What a marvelous read. One simple man's take on a myriad of plain folk who he meets on a journey across America leads him to not only discover some truths about what makes people tick, but gives him insight into his own heart. Only when I read \\"The Tour:...\\" did I get that same sense of a man finding his own way in life through his observance and interaction with others.Certainly the most comprehensive and entertaining novel I've found on the subject of the 1960's folk scene is \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\" by Eric Von Schmidt and Jim Rooney. My not so tongue-in-cheek title for this review may now make a bit more sense!The tour of which Bill Staines writes juxtaposes a thirty year practically continual tour against his approximately thirty day fall tour of I think 2003. I laughed at stories of home-made hot tubs in remote Alaska and cried as Bill related his belief in the rainbows that seem to appear at just the right times in his life."},{"Title":"The Tour: A Life Between the Lines","review":"I've followed Bill's career over 20 years, and apppreciate what it took to take a life of music and the road, and put it together in this book by the very talented Bill Staines. The book reads like a song, and is a beautiful memoir of the rough life of a solo songster. Hear his music once, and you'll have his songs in your heart forever."},{"Title":"The Tour: A Life Between the Lines","review":"Here's the info from Bill Staines' website about the book:For more than 35 years, Bill Staines has traveled the highways and byways of North America, playing his music in colleges, coffeehouses, concert halls and folk song societies. He is one of America's quintessential troubadours, logging almost 70,000 miles a year on the open road. The Tour is not only a collection of characters, consequences and experiences, it is - perhaps more importantly - an offering up of some of the wisdom gained from \\"a life between the lines.\\"The Tour is a book that will take you on two journeys, one past and one present. Each fall, Bill Staines leaves his home in New England and sets out on a five week tour of North America, playing his music for fans and friends, and covering almost 15,000 miles of open highway. On the twentieth anniversary of the tour, he began writing this narrative.Read these pages and you will journey with Bill and get to know some of the people and places that make his story worth telling.The Tour is also a chronicle of a life, from the time that Bill spent growing up in the Boston-Cambridge folk music scene in the early 1960's to the present, when he has come to be considered one of the most respected singer-songwriters on the folk music scene today. It is all here, and it is all written from the heart."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I enjoyed the first edition of \\"My War\\" and this, the second edition, seems to contain a bit more fact and opinion, all seen from the point of view of \\"Andrew Rooney\\", a war correspondent in the U. S. Army who spent most of his time with the Eight Air Force in England and the rest of the time with ground forces fighting their way through France and Germany. Oh, he's an old curmudgeon. Many of the things you and I would take for granted or disregard, he's annoyed by. It's not \\"the holocaust.\\" It's \\"genocide.\\" People are proud of being color blind, like Walter Cronkite. The only reason Tom Brokaw's \\"greatest generation\\" was \\"the greatest generation\\" was that they had a war to fight. He likes reporters generally but some of them have quirks he finds annoying. But he doesn't heap on anybody or anything the ire he expends on, say, those damned green peppers that come bundled three to a package in the supermarket when he only needs two.He doesn't really explore his own emotions but he does admit, in an abstract way, as if talking about someone else, to being horrified by some incidents he witnessed. When a Sherman tank is grinding along a narrow path in the hedgerow country and, if it stops, becomes a target, it keeps moving ahead, even if there are dead bodies on the road before it.The amusing incidents are just as impressive and which he describes with the same detachment as the unpleasant ones. I'll give two examples.In England, he worked under a reporter and novelist named Oram Clark Hutton, known to everyone as \\"Bud\\" Hutton. Hutton wrote a story for \\"Stars and Stripes\\" about the newly arrived P-47. High up the food chain someone read into it a revelation that the P-47 was now flying out of England, which would have been interesting to the Germans if Hutton had actually written such a datum. I will quote in extenso.\\"On the second day a half-inch-thick manila evelope marked THE EDITOR was hand-delivered by Fighter Command Headquarters to the offices of \\"The Stars and Stripes.\\" It was routinely handled and Joe McBride put it in Hutton's IN basket on the news desk. Hutton routinely tore open his mail, including the manila envelope. Inside was a sheaf of papers constituting a formally drawn-up request for a court-martial of M/Sgt. Oram Clark Hutton. Hutton looked through the legal document, put it down on his desk, and thought a minute. At that point he picked up a pen, and scribbled on top of the document DISAPPROVED! Under the word he wrote his initials, \\"BH\\". Bud put the official-looking document into his out basket with RETURN TO SENDER noted on the outside of the fat brown envelope. No further word was ever heard about General Hunter's demand that Sergeant Hutton be tried for treason.\\"Equally funny is the story of Rooney's being issued a jeep in Normandy in 1944 and then, on being transferred to China, casually handing it over to another reporter. A year or so later, Rooney received an official document from the U. S. Army demanding to know the whereabouts of the jeep, serial number such and such. (He ignored it.)The book is full of casual but thought-provoking observations. \\"I was always impressed with the idea that each .50-caliber bullet cost about $1 then and when all ten guns were firing over a target with German fighter planes diving in on the formation, the air gunners could fire away about $10,000 worth of ammunition in a few minutes. The tail gunner's machine gun had to be fed by a track of ammunition from a storage magazine amidships. The ammunition on his track alone would have probably sent him to college. The ball turret rotated and revolved on a complicated set of geared wheels inside a piece of equipment worth five times as much as any car the gunner ever owned.\\" Eisenhower was given to making similar comparisons independently.It's an easy book to read, relaxing despite its sometimes horrible contents, and informative as well. We're unlikely to get many more such first-person accounts like it."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Interesting and entertaining book. I would recommend this book to any and all Andy Rooney fans or to any WWII history buffs."},{"Title":"My War","review":"During his 60 Minutes days, Andy Rooney became somewhat of a parody of Andy Rooney. This book goes a long way in re-establishing his serious credentials as a journalist. It is simply one of the finest memoirs I have read of World War II, or of any war for that matter (tops is still Henry Kydd Douglas's \\"I Rode with Stonewall\\").My father was with Patton's Third Army; Rooney gives that Army short shrift here, concentrating mostly on the First Army. It doesn't matter, though, I could still hear the \\"unspoken\\" war experiences of my father through Rooney's words. I think his style is very good here; often funny and ironic, Rooney does not underestimate the tragic cost of the war in personal terms. There is an existential \\"bite\\" to the memoir, that I thought was a perfect tone.I read this book in two sittings; I recommend it to anyone who wants to see the Second World War as it was lived and experienced."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy Rooney on the front lines--a straight edge with wit. The perfect gift for any vet whose memories hang with WWII."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Andy Rooney's story makes you feel as if you are standing next to him while he observes, takes notes, and writes about the World War II battles in Europe. For someone who loves World War II History, this is a must read."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy Rooney's \\"My War\\" grabbed this 89-year-old WW-11 naval officer's attention and held it to the last page. Although I served in both the Atlantic and Pacific, I had never read an up-close account about D-Day and events leading to the German surrender. Like a few civilians of the period, I questioned the Patton \\"Legend\\" portrayed by newspapers and media, but I had no facts to counter the hero-worship of a grandstander whose \\"end run\\" siouth of the real action earned him banner headlines while other courageious field commanders were fighting their way through German ambushes in hedgerow country. I was surprised and somewhat amused by some of Rooney's personal predjudices which, in my case, tended to bolster his credibility. I give him a U.S. Navy \\"Well Done\\" for his service to our country and for his insightful book.Al Kayworth, WW-II Navy Lt.Published author:Abenaki WarriorLegends of the PondThe Scalp HuntersIceman to the Internet"},{"Title":"My War","review":"Had I not been importuned to read My War by a client, it would never have crossed my desk. But since it was fairly thrust upon me and I had given him my word to read something he considered so compelling, I finally got around to reading it nearly a year later. And do you know what? Not only was it a pretty good read, it changed my opinion of the author somewhat for the better.I have read a great many books on World War Two, but have rarely read one that approaches it the way Andy Rooney does here. After reading this, you will think more about what should be the self-evident fact that what you think you know about the war depends on which sources you've read and whose stories you've heard. Most popular histories concentrate on the big picture. Rooney concentrates on small pieces of the puzzle that comprise that big picture.In My War, you are getting Andy Rooney's impressions of the war based on what he felt about what he saw and heard. He relates those impressions with great insight and often with his quirky sense of humor. And being an army reporter rather than a combat soldier, he saw the war from a different perspective and is quite reflective about that perspective. I learned much that I was unaware of and relearned some of what I had forgotten. The biggest lesson I relearned is that war makes savages out of the most educated and idealistic of people. There are few real heroes and few real villains, rather just a bunch of guys fighting to stay alive and make it home in one piece. We did many of the same things in combat that we accused our foes of, such as murdering surrendering enemy troops in cold blood and slaughtering civilians on a scale that exceeds the toll of the Holocaust. The only thing besides our ultimate victory that absolves us is that we \\"knew\\" that we were fighting for a higher moral purpose.Whatever you might think about Andy Rooney and his politics, he does a good job in My War of making the reader think about all he/she assumes they know about World War Two in a different way. Give this book a chance and you, too, may come away with a slightly altered point of view."},{"Title":"My War","review":"This memoir by Andy Rooney of CBS of his army days during World War II mixes humor, cynicism, and tragedy. Rooney recounts how he was drafted into the artillery in 1941, and then transferred to the army newspaper STARS AND STRIPES. The author recounts his army experiences with a mixture of nostalgia, humor and sadness. The author admits his distaste for the military, and considers him self lucky to have drawn duty as a correspondent. Yet his service record was hardly risk-free. Rooney accompanied B-17 crews on raids over Nazi Germany, then infantrymen as they battled their way after D-Day. Rooney recounts much of the war's horrors and describes several friends and acquaintances that died in combat. The author's irreverent and at times cynical tone (particularly regarding General Patton) reflects both himself and many of the GI's that served in that deadly conflict. The book is generally very readable, although it does slow in a couple spots. Still, this moving 1995 memoir written half a century after Rooney's discharge is worth reading."},{"Title":"My War","review":"This is a really good book, and I'm not sure that these reviews so far have done this justice....First, to make the point, I was raised in a house in which my mother had bought, I believe, every one of the books that he had written to date. I am accustomed to his voice and like the fact that he pretty much sums up the world as he sees it (he scathes-- at least scratches at-- Tom Brokaw's 'The Greatest Generation' in the second version of this book: Brokaw who WROTE THE PREFACE....) His voice is ironic, thoughtful, and that of an old crumrudgeon-- what you'd expect after having listened to him since time immorial on 60 Minutes...He details his triumphs, travails, and low moments in the course of being a sergeant for 'Stars and Stripes' during World War II. He doesn't glorify war, praise anyone out of want to preserve history, and has a neat way of telling a story. He saw a lot in the time he served. Thus, this is a war memoir of the first degree....Another book that fans of this book might like is called 'Infantry Soldier' which is a memoir of an American soldier who fought in the Battle of the Bulge.... I'm not sure who the author is.... but this also, is a worthwhile read....Buy this!"},{"Title":"My War","review":"My grandfather was in the Army Air Corp during WWII and would tell wonderful stories about his time in the war (the good and the bad). I think he would have liked Andy Rooney.I found the book very interesting particularly his insights on Patton. I have an great uncle who served under Patton. His mind never was the same."},{"Title":"My War","review":"As Mr. Rooney states early in the work, writing it is was a cathartic exercise to lay some of his old ghosts to rest. This he certainly does, confessing to past sins, relating old jokes, and paying honor to some of World War II's unknown heroes. Being the grandson of two WWII veterans, I read with awe and began to understand the incredible and heroic actions that were standard behavior for the soldiers of this war. I also understand why they are reluctant to reopen those memories and discuss them. While reading this, I begin to realize the amount of history that is contained in, and dying with, the collective memories of these veterans."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I think the vast majority of the people interested in this book and author are because of his fame from the TV and not as an author. I know this is how I approached this book, I was hopping for the biting humor from his appearances on 60 Minutes but concerned that it would not come through in the written word. What I found when reading the book is that he was representing a different person then the one on TV. He was providing the reader with his experiences during World War 2 in Europe and I found that the writing seemed to come from a much younger and more innocent mind then the current TV personality.Due to this writing style I found that the book was more enjoyable then I expected. The author gives us some very good stories written in a comfortable way that seems more like holding a conversation with a close friend. This book is not for he person looking for page after page of combat action, just the interesting person story of a war reporter that sees a little bit of everything in the European theater."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Short, punchy style typical of the way Rooney talks on 60 minutes. Very good view back of WWII as he saw it. Very entertaining and informative view of some historical figures-esp. Gen. Patton. Lots of wry humor/sarcastic wit."},{"Title":"My War","review":"&quot;My War&quot;Andy RooneyISBN 1-58648-010-3As well as being a humorist, Andy Rooney is an iconoclast, and independent thinkers are rarely plentiful. When Tom Brokaw characterized Rooney's WWII age group as &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, Rooney wrote that it was probably no more special than the current generation, which had not found the occasion for identifying the same qualities in itself. Mr. Brokaw, however, has written the foreword of &quot;My War&quot; and speaks there of Andy Rooney's book as a gift to those who did not come home.This book is the best work I have read by Andy Rooney. I admire Mr. Rooney's self-effacing approach to writing. For example, he characterizes his assignment as a reporter for the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as a &quot;bungled assignment&quot; by the army that put him in the midst of reporters who had written for papers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; while his own experience was as sub-editor of &quot;The Thirteenth Field Artillery Brigade Bulletin&quot;.One of the WWII-era personalities Rooney criticizes in this book is General George Patton, whom he views as overrated. Rooney slyly claims people who admire Patton are confusing him with George C. Scott. To Rooney's credit, he quotes a letter received, after unfavorable Patton comments on television, from the general's daughter in which she wrote that the general would not have liked him either. Ernest Hemingway and Charles De Gaulle are also singled out as pompous egomaniacs. General Eisenhower, on the other hand, Rooney praises for allowing &quot;The Stars and Stripes&quot; to have the editorial freedom of regular American newspapers.Those who know Andy Rooney mainly from his &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; segments, once caricatured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, may be surprised at the extent to which he saw action as a reporter in WWII. For example, he flew on a B17 raid over enemy territory and won the bronze star for battlefield reporting in Germany. At one point, he even managed to capture a German prisoner.Much of what Rooney writes in this book is not pretty, such as seeing dead soldiers whose bodies had been crushed by tanks, watching the revenge that some of the citizens of Paris took on the German prisoners when the city was liberated, and coming upon the charred bodies of the Thekla concentration camp inmates that the SS had massacred as the Americans approached.There are some light touches in this book apropos to human goodness as well. In France, Rooney writes &quot;every wandering dog was adopted and fed by some GI&quot;.Rooney's books always mix humor and candid observation. The same is true here. However, Rooney has a more serious purpose in mind this time. The young men that he knew, killed in the war, he writes, did not give their lives, but rather those lives were taken. It would seem that this book is a way of reconciling the deaths of so many friends and fellow soldiers with Rooney's own relatively long and comfortable life. The book is dedicated to some of those close friends."},{"Title":"My War","review":"As someone who loves to read about history, this book encompassed all that I appreciate so much in an historical account: straight, to the point, no nonsense telling of the facts and emotions rellenvant to a time in history as seen through the eyes of an ordinary person. Rooney does an excellent job showing to the reader that there was nothing special about him or how the events unfolded for him. He was just any young man dragged into war and left to experience the events as they happened. That he was able to begin a long and enjoyable career in journalism thanks to the war is quite typical of how life seems to unfold (how many of us look at where we are in life and realize that just a slight curve in the road got us here?). Beyond that, it was a pleasure to read an account of WWII by a person who's honesty and intelligent wit are so looked foward to on sunday nights."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Didya ever wonder how the US Army -- that bureaucratic bungle of millions that made recruits do things they wouldn't do in peacetime, retained some officers who were jerks, took four days of paperwork to release men from the service at the end of the war and stupidly assigned a private whose only prior journalistic experience was a few weeks work on his high school yearbook to the post of reporter at \\"Stars and Stripes\\" -- didyaever wonder how these guys won the war?They were fighting other country's armies, that's how.Ok, enough of my attempt to parody Andy Rooney's style above. The guy who lampoons makers of personal care products for a few minutes ever Sunday night does sometimes lend his \\"what kind of idiot would do this\\" attitude toward the US Army, WWII version. In those moments, this book sometimes grates -- the same voice that illuminates follies with instant cereal advertising and electric tooth brushes sounds somewhat tinny applied against what was a great undertaking.Fortunately for this book, those moments are few enough that an interesting picture of the war as seen through Rooney's eyes is not subsumed with his sarcasm and general crankiness. In fact, he keeps those traits generally in check in what reads like an honest look at his service as a front line reporter during the war in Europe.Rooney's book \\"My War\\" is a collection of anecdotes. Fortunately, his travels over German skies in American B-17's, with advancing armor and infantry in France and Germany and to newly (as in a few hours ago) liberated nazi work and concentration camps makes for fascinating anecdotes.A sergeant in rank, Rooney was afforded the opportunity to meet with personalities and troops of all ranks as he covered the war for what I am sure was the largest circulation American daily newspaper during the early 1940's. His travel made great anecdotes and good stories.Rooney is poignant in this book. He has a great reverence for lives lost and is very honest about himself and his changing appreciation for war as a sometimes necessary thing (he entered the war with the words \\"any peace is better than any war\\" from a college professor ringing in his ears and came to learn after reflecting upon Nazi warfare that \\"any peace is not better than any war\\"). This book is somewhat a chronicle of Rooney's maturation as well as his war stories.The stories are for the most part entertaining and worth reading. His assignment as a reporter gave him a somewhat Zelig-like ability to be near many major events in the war. The reader benefits from these interesting first person accounts."},{"Title":"My War","review":"This is an interesting book to read, for the tangential impressions of life in London, and with the Allied invasion of Europe, and even brief stays in India and China, during World War II by former Stars and Stripes reporter Andy Rooney.The title, \\"My War,\\" does not indicate possession as another reviewer thought, but indicates that this is a memoir. The book is full of anecdotal, and broader, observations of the war effort and those involved in it.However, Rooney's opinion seems a bit too self-important at times, considering his own personal judgment of a situation or person as the final and authoritative word on the subject. He tends to paint those he meets and hears about as totally \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\"It could be that, in print, Rooney can't convey the wry \\"just kidding\\" tone he verbally communicates in his TV commentaries. Rooney's inability to convey tone leaves the reader puzzled after reading such truly bizarre Rooney statements as \\"Let me assure you the state of the helicopter art, even the best there is, to this day is primitive. The big Sikorsky, for instance, had that small propeller mounted on the tail.... This small mechanical necessity alone leaves helicopters in the class of Mickey Mouse inventions.\\"You'll find this an interesting, and somewhat quick, read, but not on your \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I am not a fan of 60 minutes but after reading this I will never see Andy Rooney in quite the same way. This is a very honest and humble account of one man's experience in WWII. An ordinary guy placed in extraordinary circumstances with the ability to record what he witnesses in straightfoward and honest language. Rooney's voice and style from his 60 minutes editorials is evident throughout and in this context the result is a combination of respect for the men Rooney encountered in combat situations and an ability to find humor and irony in those situations as well. Overall this is an excellent account of the European war from a journalists perspective. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy Rooney has never been more to me than the nagging, faintly humorous, mildly eccentric curmudgeon that caps each 60 Minutes program. I've seen his newspaper column, but never read it. Indeed, had I not seen this book at a closeout bookseller, I wouldn't own it. But, the bargain price and my interest in WWII convinced me to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.An enlisted reporter for The Stars and Stripes during the war, Rooney flew missions over Germany, accompanied the allies shortly after D-Day, and continued reporting until victory. In the contemporary catalog of WWII books, his vantage point as a reporter is unique, insightful, and conducive to extended durations of page turning pleasure.As the title announces, this isn't a book about \\"the\\" war. It's about \\"his\\" war, his experiences, his opinion. And, in a departure from his 60 Minutes routine, he manages to avoid complaints about matters of trifling importance. Perhaps, this is because there is little of trifling importance associated with WWII. Nevertheless, Rooney faithfully relates the awe of having witnessed, first-hand, an epic period in human history.In the end, I put down the book and realized, after all these years, that I can enjoy Andy Rooney. I commend this book's honesty and pragmatism, (even though I doubt this is the effect he was aiming for). I am also thankful that, like author's before him, Rooney introduced the general reader to many Americans who didn't come home.His was a generation of sacrifice unlike anything those who came after are likely to see. Rooney believes them not special people, but people involved in special circumstances. This provides hope that every generation will rise with comparable bravery and commitment whenever liberty is seriously threatened. 4 stars."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy's &quot;War&quot; was a new and unique view of a subject we've all heard so much about over the past half century. His tour of duty as a war correspondent for the Stars and Stripes gave him unique first-hand experiences, and his maturity as a commentator gives him a special ability to relate those experiences to us in a way that is both informative and entertaining. I had no prior knowledge of Andy's WWII experience, so this book was quite a surprise. I've enjoyed Andy for many years on the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; show, and now this book gave me a new way to enjoy his astute observations. His ego-deflating stories about General Patton were particularly revealing about a WWII icon. The book was very enjoyable, and a good read for anyone with a historical interest in the way Americans performed during this horrific war. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy above and beyond potrayed his position in WW2 if anything played down. Yes he was a private that lucked out as many do in the service,but it seems he is able to tell the truth about it and feels no lesser for the facts. He tells of several heroes and some not so good officers. We have all known those. All in all I found the book very enjoyable and would highly reccomend it to all."},{"Title":"My War","review":"If you remember and like Andy Rooney, you will enjoy this book. As you read it you can hear him talking."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy was dragged into this war after finishing college, the good news is he wasn&#8217;t in the &#8216;Army&#8217; for very long and was transferred to the Stars and Strips a newspaper for the ETO soldiers. Andy spent a lot of his starting days in the war with the 305th Airborne and has a ton of great stories that you really have to read twice before you get the gravity of how any of this could be real. Andy then travels through Normandy to Paris and is there for the liberation of Paris and talks about how that was the greatest celebration he ever saw in his life. He said the celebration here in the States when the war was over was close but because we were never occupied at home by foreign soldiers the joy just wasn&#8217;t to the same level.I hung on every word of this book and was constantly amazed at it. I agree with him I have read a lot of books that glorify war and make it easier to read and understand but his style of writing here is great. It basically would be how I would write a book because it sort of jumps all over the place in the same &#8216;chapters&#8217;. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a no non-sense, real account, no BS look at the front line (or near it). I really wish I paid more attention in my history classes but I have to say it might make reading books like this that much more interesting for me!"},{"Title":"My War","review":"Purchased for my father's library for Christmas.

This is true primarily because Mr. Rooney focuses on individuals, not Armies, and writes beautifully about hundreds of the tiny events and lives that comprised that big picture.Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\" ultimately disappointed me with its cookie-cutter presentation pattern (Man A grew up during the Depression, then was swept into WWII, but he worked hard, didn't complain, got the job done, and then became a successful XYZ afterward, etc.). It was based on interviews and depended on the memories of the interviewees. In contrast, Rooney's \\"My War\\" flows smoothly from topic to fascinating topic based on his perspective as a reporter for the Army's Stars & Stripes newspaper throughout the war. On one level, it brought him face-to-face with iconic generals and legendary war heroes; on another, he went into the midst and minds of bomber crew members and infantrymen whose chances of living out a particular year (or next few missions, for that matter) were relatively small. The stories of so many young lives cut short, or changed forever by horrific physical and psychological wounds, are truly emotional\\"My War\\" is a colorful, compelling book I thoroughly enjoyed, and one I still think about and recommend.P.S. - I'm not \\"Married to a Mess.\\" This is Amazon's snafu with my screen name and I don't quite know how to correct it."},{"Title":"My War","review":"A good book, but the Kindle version should have been proof-read before being released.

His contempt for George Patton is well founded. The attention he brings to historical figures who were so important to the war, yet seldom mentioned, such as Maj. General Maurice Rose, makes this a very poignant and pertinant historical account of what happened during WWII. If it is possible to convey to a reader the horrors of war, and give an accurate description of how soldiers felt on all fronts, then this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"My War","review":"After reading this book I have to ask myself how much of what I have read is true. This book seems to be the work of a highly opinionated mean old man, who in the 1940's was a highly opinionated mean young man. The book is not bad, but I don't know how much to believe. There is no way that Rooney would ever praise someone who he did not like. In other words, I do not think he is any great respecter of truth when personal spite is involved. Andy Rooney is not mad at the world, just anyone who has crossed him in the last eighty odd years."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Combat is only part of war.

Arrogant, vindictive, disdainfull of authority. He was drafted, did not volunteer. He found his way into cushy jobs behind the lines; Always in a relatively safe place and whenever authority infringed on his comfort he was quick to criticise. It is not the story of the GI who sacrificed his freedom for the better good of society instead it is 'my war', Andy Rooney's War, and not that of the typical U.S. service man. Carry on Andy Rooney! You make a career of being that kind of person."},{"Title":"My War","review":"The year was 1943 and I had been in a foxhole for three months. Was I in France? Belgum? Poland? No, I was in New Jersey - and it as all Andy Rooney's fault. Ya see, back in the summer of '42, Andy (or &quot;The Dodger&quot; as we &quot;boys&quot; &quot;called&quot; &quot;him&quot;) had convinced me that the &quot;Krauts&quot; (or the &quot;lungers&quot;) were planning to launch an invasion (or &quot;yoodle party&quot;) of Jersey (or &quot;iutyggfs&quot;).

Just like I showed the Japanese at Dunkirk!"},{"Title":"My War","review":"his book. I have been watching him on \\"60 minutes\\" for so many years. This is my favorite subject, World War II, & this first person account is better than most. It should be, Rooney's a pro. He was mentored by the best writers of his time working as a reporter for \\"Stars & Stripe\\". Talk about on the job training.He saw the the war on the western front up close & then was able to walk away from it & write about it. He wasn't in real danger on the front. The real challenge was when he rode along on a B-17 bombing mission & they came under attack. Quite a life changing experience, I'd imagine. Also the best chapter in the book.He recalls some of the people he had to deal with. He saves special scorn for General Patton. He mostly has high praise for the men he met, worked with & those who never got old . He was an enlisted man who had the best job in the war. He appreciated that, not being a particularly military type.The best part about this book is that he writes it now while he still has all his marbles & is a much better writer than he was then. The drawback is he is writing this book with 60 years hindsight. Things might not have been as he now remembers them. Still the book is as truthful, I believe as Andy Rooney could make it.For us boomers who will never exprience such a time or place it is a fine read."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I'm not a big fan of Andy's 60 Minute spots although I do enjoy them. I was drawn to this book because so many other soldiers and writers mentioned that Andy was in the B-17s and on the front lines of Europe all through the war. I thought his impressions would be unique and I was not disappointed. Interstingly, he is quick to point out that he was not at the front lines (even when he was). He makes sure we understand that it was the soldiers doing the fighting and dying. Like most people I imagine, we are so consumed with all of the major battles of WWII that we overlook the newspaper carrying news to the troops. His accounting of how the paper was to be run via Ike's directive, the day to day operations, striving not to be biased or give away too much information, and the unknown leaders who won the war as well as the pompous leaders (look out Patton lovers), all make this a fascinating read. I was particularly interested in the stories they didn't tell - no soldier wants to read about other soldiers dying, etc. This book is all the more interesting because Andy was nearly a conscientious objector - a significant fact when he arrives at the concentration camps. Good stuff told with great wit."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Depending upon your point of view, Andy Rooney is either a lovable curmudgeon or an overopinionated old goat. You have to give Rooney credit, he is absolutely honest. He freely admits he was once an overopinionated young smart aleck who just grew into an overopinionated old goat. The book is interesting and typically Rooney, quick and wity, and written like a series of newpaper reports rather than a developing story. He typically manages to get very cranky with the people, usually his superiors, whom he didn't like. Take General Patton. Rooney loathed Patton and went out of his way to make sure his readers are not left with any doubt. The problem is, his hate for Patton left him with a total lack of any sort of objectivity and his accounts are very different than most pieces written about the famous general. It sort of reminds me of James Carville writing about Conservatives--forget the objectivity, full agenda ahead. But as previously stated, Rooney is dead honest. That's what he thought of Patton and he starts the book by telling readers that his recollections don't always jive with history--but that's fine with him. My War is an easy read and worth the time. If you like Rooney, you'll love it. If you don't like Rooney, you'll get annoyed, but probably read it anyway."},{"Title":"My War","review":"If you enjoy Andy Rooney, you'll enjoy My War. Even if you don't care for grumpy Andy on Sixty Minutes, you still should read this account for its honesty and tribute to those who fought and died in WWII. In his preface, Andy notes that when he started checking his memory with the historical record, he was surprised at how often they didn't jibe. And that when in doubt, he relied on memory! A person who takes his World War II history seriously will find an error here and there, a misinterpretation now and then. But this is not footnoted history; this is Andy's story--and, as always, he tells it well with admirable brevity of words, dabs of humor, and occasional sentamentality.Andy has his likes and dislikes--General Patton being one of those he disliked, no despised, the most--and he also snipes a bit at a few of his fellow war correspondents and some of the officers who made life difficult for the enlisted man. But three parts of his book stand out. For nearly two years Andy covered the Eight Air Force and their bombing campaign against Germany and German-occupied France. He is sympathethic to the airmen and the horrendous losses they suffered in those early years. To his credit, Andy volunteered for a mission that turned out to be a difficult target--Wilhelmshaven--in which his plane was damaged and of his own role in reviving a crewman who had had his oxygen supply cut off. As a former WWII AAF navigator [20th AF], his feelings and reactions to air combat ring true. A second section is his account of the liberation of Paris in which Andy chose to enter the city with the French Army. Much of this is mildy amusing, but also poignant, as the liberators argued over who &quot;first&quot; came into the city, of the political aspects of this in dealing with the French and General Charles de Gaulle, and the vast excitement as this momentous event unfolded. No matter who came first, the Parisiens were overjoyed at being at last freed from their oppressors. Finally, Andy's account of Buchenwald and of his own mixed feelings--he had originally thought the stories of extermination camps somewhat suspect--are a tribute to his own candor. He also reminds us with his honest account of own biases of the mindsets of many Americans when WWII descended.Anyone interested in World War II and the men who fought in it will be enlightened by Andy's account."},{"Title":"My War","review":"As a soldier, I'm always interested in well-written war books (call it professional development). Andy Rooney's book was well written, which is to be expected from someone who has been writing for the last 60 years. Basically, The book is an Autobiography lightly covering his early years up until he got drafted for WWII. Then the book shifts into very descriptive, and it tells how he lucked into Stars and Stripes, and the reporting that he did during WWII. He tells his story honestly without blowing his role out of perportion or representing himself as more than he was. A great book and an entertaining read."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I really don't know if Andy Rooney is a great journalist. All I know of Andy is from his short 60 MINUTE pieces; and I was interested in reading him for the first time. I found his book pedestrian. He is no David Halberstam -- he's not even a David Brinkley. Pop memoirs, by a pop commentator, for a pop culture. I found this rather surprising, considering he chides Walter Cronkite for not being a good writer. Andy writes on a par with Cronkite. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. There are times we don't want to fully engage the brain. We only have a need to relax with a good story; and Andy writes a very good story of his adventures as a 'Stars and Stripes' reporter. For all I know, he is reflecting the style of reporting of the 30's and 40's. Report all you see and hear, and spell the names correctly. Andy is simply a good reporter. My only disappointment is, I have read better memoirs by combat veterans who are not professional writers.It is an interesting, enjoyable, and entertaining book to read. No serious issues, or new revelations presented; just Andy relating his war experiences. A page-turner that can be quickly read."},{"Title":"My War","review":"A highly personal work by Mr Rooney, as he delves into his past to exercise old ghosts, bearing his sins and his heart. He also spends a good amount of time on WWII heroes, which while it seems a trendy thing to do thes days, is understandable for Rooney given that he is descended of WWII vets. Once you read this you'll understand why we owe those soldiers so much thanks and why they'd rather not hear about those times. And what is amazing is that Roney delivers this historical feast in his usual direct and caustic style we've gotten used to on TV. You'll laugh and cry throughout."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Gripping, heart-rendering, Tragic stories of real people in a war which caused overwhelming human suffering... Presented in an 'almost conversational' format and which was easy to comprehend and learn of the many horrible aspects of this tragic period in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Young Andy Rooney was not always the acerbic commentator that television viewers know best from SIXTY MINUTES. After reading this memoir, MY WAR, written by him, it is easy to see that he grew up in the best traditions of 19th and 20th Century America. As a result of this upbringing, the young Rooney viewed life through a prism of morality and right and wrong.After he was inducted as a soldier in World War II, he was lucky enough to be assigned, for reasons that make little sense, to the famous Armed Forces newspaper, the STARS & STRIPES. Without a doubt, had he not ended up on the staff of this newspaper, he would not have had his subsequent civilian career as a reporter.A consequence of this Army assignment, in his role of reporter, Rooney was a witness to some of the most significant actions of this war, including the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps.Very aptly titled, this memoir is the story of World War II as observed from Rooney's unexpected bird's eye view. It is a personal history, written in his own inimitable and riveting style. The report he gives readers of \\"his\\" war is fascinating and touching.This book should not be missed by anyone with a serious interest in this most pivotal event of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"My War","review":"This is how W.W.II was for Mr. Andy Rooney. This is HIS personal experiences and HIS thoughts on same.Stars and Stripes reporters by the very nature of their jobs probably saw more of the war than anyone else. So not only are we treated to a view of the the war from a different perspective other than the soldier's but a view broader in scope and content. He was there when many historical events were unfolding. He met and interviewed many many people, big and small. He went into the concentration camps hours after they were liberated. Buchenwald and Thekla.\\"Buchenwald represented the worst of everything in all the Nazi extermination camps. The dead and dying were still everywhere. The camp was unchanged, still the way it had been for allthose terrible months except that there were cameramen there now, documenting the horror of it for all time.\\"\\"The burned and blackened bodies of about sixty men were hanging in contorted positions from needle-point barbs of the wire. ...When the SS troops realized U.S. soldiers were going toarrive in Thekla within hours, they herded 300 prisoners into one of the barracks. They threw pails of gasoline over the barracks and onto some of the prisoners and then tossedincendiary grenades into the building.\\"\\" Walking the same road a day or so after a tank had passed through, I would often come upon the gruesome sight of the whole halves of four or five men, and four or five halves of whathad been men, mashed into the dirt and mud by the grinding tracks of a ten-ton tank.\\" He's talking about our tanks here rolling over our dead.Mr. Rooney puts W.W.II into more of a human ground level perspective. He shows you details, such as the many animal who suffered. Cows wandering the fields with painful uttersswollen with milk and no one there to milk them..... Horses and mules mowed down in battle. Abandoned pets.I learned a few things here. I'm happy I read the book. Mr. R is up-front and honest and that's all that counts. He's not afraid to speak his mind like most people, thank god! I love him(his opinions 99% of the time are mine).This would make a great movie. I envy his life. Hell, as he scrambled behind a French farmers stone wall to avoid heavy German artillery fire he found himself in the company of ErnestHemingway! Just him and Ernie out there. Ernie telling Rooney where the other danger points were ahead of them."},{"Title":"My War","review":"I have long been an Andy Rooney fan and this was an interesting look at his war time experience. As others have said, Andy had a unique perspective in the Army by being assigned to the Stars and Stripes. His primary assignments were England covering the 8th Air force then Western Europe after the invasion. I find it strange that people would disparage him because he was \\"only\\" a reporter. The fact of the matter is that the majority of veterans, past and present, were/are rarely in harms way. Andy in no way embellishes his experience and pays due respect to those who fought and died in the war. His observations of the sometimes pettiness of military life ring true even to this 80s peace time vet.Note this book does read more like a column or a series of essays and Andy is not afraid of blatantly revealing his own opinion. Keep it up Andy!"},{"Title":"My War","review":"Reading this book is like having the last 5 minute segment of 60 minutes go on for hours. You can hear Andy Rooney with every page you read. The phrasing, the sarcasm. The wry sardonic observations, which after you read them seem obvious. I found this book an enjoyable read of a first hand account of the air war in London, the land war, taking of Paris and Germany and final observations from India and China. The book is more Andy's narrative of what he saw over there, versus a history. He does little to fill in the story around his experience. I suspect that I enjoyed it more having read several other history books on the subject.As always Andy is opinionated, however to his credit he largely acknowledges when they border on prejudice. This is balanced by a lot more opportunity than 5 of the 60 minutes to round out his overall view. On 60 minutes all you get is his sarcasm in this book you have much well rounded view...."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Andy Rooney occasionally scores hits on 60 Minutes, but this book hits less frequently. Readers will hear about his dislike for things Army, especially his training days, and his frequent lucky run-ins with notable media reporters of the day that helped him fine-tune his career as a journalist. It's not bad; but the stories that show his comapssion such as those where he has been flying with bomber groups only to lose friends, or those where he is at the front and writing about people to send back home to their hometown papers are too rare.Rooney is honest in his writing, and that is welcome, but we see more of his opinions than we do the better-known war story compendiums now available. My War is defintiely about his."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Didya ever wonder how the US Army -- that bureaucratic bungle of millions that made recruits do things they wouldn't do in peacetime, retained some officers who were jerks, took four days of paperwork to release men from the service at the end of the war and stupidly assigned a private whose only prior journalistic experience was a few weeks work on his high school yearbook to the post of reporter at \\"Stars and Stripes\\" -- didyaever wonder how these guys won the war?They were fighting other country's armies, that's how.Ok, enough of my attempt to parody Andy Rooney's style above. The guy who lampoons makers of personal care products for a few minutes ever Sunday night does sometimes lend his \\"what kind of idiot would do this\\" attitude toward the US Army, WWII version. In those moments, this book sometimes grates -- the same voice that illuminates follies with instant cereal advertising and electric tooth brushes sounds somewhat tinny applied against what was a great undertaking.Fortunately for this book, those moments are few enough that an interesting picture of the war as seen through Rooney's eyes is not subsumed with his sarcasm and general crankiness. In fact, he keeps those traits generally in check in what reads like an honest look at his service as a front line reporter during the war in Europe.Rooney's book \\"My War\\" is a collection of anecdotes. Fortunately, his travels over German skies in American B-17's, with advancing armor and infantry in France and Germany and to newly (as in a few hours ago) liberated nazi work and concentration camps makes for fascinating anecdotes.A sergeant in rank, Rooney was afforded the opportunity to meet with personalities and troops of all ranks as he covered the war for what I am sure was the largest circulation American daily newspaper during the early 1940's. His travel made great anecdotes and good stories.Rooney is poignant in this book. He has a great reverence for lives lost and is very honest about himself and his changing appreciation for war as a sometimes necessary thing (he entered the war with the words \\"any peace is better than any war\\" from a college professor ringing in his ears and came to learn after reflecting upon Nazi warfare that \\"any peace is not better than any war\\"). This book is somewhat a chronicle of Rooney's maturation as well as his war stories.The stories are for the most part entertaining and worth reading. His assignment as a reporter gave him a somewhat Zelig-like ability to be near many major events in the war. The reader benefits from these interesting first person accounts."},{"Title":"My War","review":"A interesting account by this extraordinary man who comes across a little grumpy and little disillusioned about life these days...But,&quot;My War&quot; as a young man tells the truth and is honest about his feelings(not saying that he is not today)...funny thought.. when you read his book you can actuallyhear Mr Rooney's voice!..."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Of all the history books I have read, this book opened my eyes more than most because the author backs his recollections with such detail and description. His contempt for George Patton is well founded. The attention he brings to historical figures who were so important to the war, yet seldom mentioned, such as Maj. General Maurice Rose, makes this a very poignant and pertinant historical account of what happened during WWII. If it is possible to convey to a reader the horrors of war, and give an accurate description of how soldiers felt on all fronts, then this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"My War","review":"Anyone who mourned the passing of Andy Rooney and miss his grounding views on the world at large on CBS's \\"Sixty Minutes\\" should read this book. It is the story of how Andrew Rooney, soldier, found his calling as Andy Rooney, writer and chronicler of world events. This young man, well-educated and full of acerbic wit and curiosity, joined the Army to \\"do his bit\\" for our nation in World War II. Chance landed him a gig writing for \\"Stars and Stripes\\", reporting the news for the fighting men.Stationed in England, and then in the European Theatre of War, Rooney was in a position to see what was happening in the higher echelons of the command structure and with the ordinary soldier trying to do his duty and survive. Flying over fortress Europe with bomber squadrons, crossing from England into Normandy just after D-Day, entering Paris with the liberating French forces, viewing the horror of the Nazi concentration camps, and spending time in a newly liberated China, Rooney saw it all. He was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery that he accepted sheepishly, but one cannot doubt it was deserved. Not only do we here the facts from a great reporter, but we also share in his moral dilemmas as he lived through these troubled times.This is classic Andy Rooney and a wonderful coming of age tale that any American would enjoy. I have had the book for many years, and, when rereading it, ordered this 20th century classic as a Kindle book to enjoy it with 21st century convenience.My War"},{"Title":"My War","review":"Lately I've been reading stories about war, an unfortunate constant of human history, I'm afraid. Tales about WWII, or \\"The Last Good War\\" (a book I read many years ago), as Studs Terkel called it, abound, but I especailly recommend this one. My War, by Andy Rooney (yep, the same bushy-eyebrowed old grump you see on 60 Minutes every week), is a true gem, full of his homespun self-deprecating bits of humor and wisdom, along with the expected grim and grisly stories about the carnage that is war. As to the importance of his wartime experience, Rooney says right up front, \\"My life was never the same again.\\" As a young reporter (his army ID photo looks startlingly like Audie Murphy, who of course penned his own memoir, To Hell and Back) for The Stars and Stripes, Rooney got up close and personal with both the air and ground wars in Europe, and also traveled to India and China, rubbing shoulders with Ernie Pyle, Bill Mauldin and Walter Cronkite. One particular line from the book has stayed with me: \\"I laugh, bitterly, when I hear the phrase, 'He gave his life for his country.' No one gives his life. His life is taken.\\" Rooney is a newspaperman and a reporter, but more than anything else he is a damn fine writer who simply tells it like he sees it. - Tim Bazzett, author of Soldier Boy and Love, War & Polio ([...])"},{"Title":"My War","review":"This is a great book. Andy Rooney, who I hate, is likable here in his stories about the GReat War. He tells stories, and jokes, and rubs elbows with all sorts of famous people, and, yet, doesn't seem to be bragging as much as telling.

In other words, drugs are either good or bad, legal or illegal, healthy or unhealthy, &c.; Concerning illicit drugs, the customary portrayal is that it has a diabolical dimension, as if the drug itself was actually sentient and its intentions were nothing but malicious. Contrarily, that same drug which at one point was contextually portrayed as evil can as easily be portrayed as a redeemer, a healer - again, almost as if it were a sentient thing - this time possessing good intentions. Is it, however, reasonable to bestow on drugs human attributes? Of course, no one would really ever admit that it, in fact, is reasonable (unless you're in Harry Potter-land), yet - Heroin has that exact kind of human status - in this case, it is wholly evil. And, by association, those who use Heroin are by default branded evil; these distinctions can lead to interesting conclusions, such as: Heroin is evil; you use Heroin; therefore you are evil. In this case, the attributes of the user are based on his or her use of the drug, and not the natural disposition of the user. Of course, logically considered, this assertion goes against all sense, yet this is how the propaganda against Heroin and its users or \\"fiends\\" have been articulated in the political arena as well as in the media. The author, Th. Metzger, considers this odd twist of unjust identification by analyzing the origins of opiate use in America and how it went from having an exalted status to that of the demonic, something bereft of any medical utility. Heroin, is, in and of itself, not only useless - but and especially morbid. A perfect and modern example of this, not mentioned in the book, can be easily seen in the hysteria over the BRAND of opiate, Oxycotin. Other than who manufactures the pill and how it is designed to work as well as its potency - there is simply no difference between it and other opiates, hydrocodones included.Like Richard Lawrence Miller's excellent thesis of what societal role drug users play in American life in his book, \\"Drug Warriors and Their Prey,\\" Metzger's book is an excellent survey of the more irrational side of the virulent American obsession with drugs, which has manifested itself in what is commonly referred to as the \\"drug war.\\" In his book, Metzger mainly sticks to the topic of Heroin and the Heroin user and therefore other drugs are rarely mentioned.This book is an excellent source for those not only interested in the role of drugs and drug users in society but why it is an issue in the first place - in fact, this book can provide many interesting directions for further study.Metzger is an academic, but his writing is devoid of all the usual abstruse language and verboseness that attends typical scholarly writing. This work is well documented - however, I do wish that there were an index included in this work! Otherwise, Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Birth of Heroin and the Demonization of the Dope Fiend","review":"Great book. I learned a tremendous amount from Metzger's details. I was shocked to find out the truth behind what company was the first to deal heroin (so to speak) and the real people and dates of addiction, eugenics, and the demographics of the heroin addict at different times.

Metzger focuses largely on the link between the eugenics 'cult of purity' of the early 20th century and the emergent anti-drug attitudes of 'mainstream' culture. At times Metzger may veer towards the hysterical himself, but his analysis of the beginnings of the criminalisation of heroin goes some way towards understanding the cultural formation of illict drugs and is a must for anyone wishing to explore the construction of the heroin addict. The book redresses the imbalance of 'legitimate' narratives, which simply take a moral stance on drug issues without a historical perspective. It's also an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ludwig van Beethoven Complete String Quartets","review":"Great manuscript to have.

But this edition of Beethoven's complete string quartets is of excellent quality, and for the price it may well be the best bargain in music ever. The music is incredibly important--superb pieces by one of the most gifted people to ever live. That all the quartets are included allows the student of these works to trace Beethoven's stylistic development in a single volume from the early quartets rooted in the Classical tradition through those absolutely innovative late quartets, which combined Baroque contrapuntal and formal elements with Romantic harmonies and Beethoven's own unique sense of rhythm and drama. (In addition to the originally published version of the final quartet with the new final movement suggested by his publisher, the Grosse Fuge is included also.) I recommend to all my music students and especially my composition students that they get these pieces and study them throughout their lives. I can honestly say that I have learned more from these quartets than from any other, similar body of music literature by a single composer; and even as a composer of twenty-first century music I am continuously educated and inspired by them."},{"Title":"Ludwig van Beethoven Complete String Quartets","review":"This edition of the Beethoven String Quartets is by far the best value.

Jeffrey Noel Lastrapes, The Lindsayan String Quartet"},{"Title":"Ludwig van Beethoven Complete String Quartets","review":"Beethoven's string quartets are basic for any music lover's library. Beethoven wrote string quartets throughout his composing life, and they reflect his evolving art. Never resting on his laurels, Beethoven continually grew artistically until the end.It is difficult to label Beethoven as primarily a symphonist, chamber music composer, or piano composer. Practically every ensemble and form he used he produced masterpieces that reflect not only the music he wrote, but the music he wrote within the ensemble he chose. His music does not transcribe well at all.A music lover needs to be acquainted with pieces from each of the ensembles to have any kind of grasp on the monumental influence that Beethoven has had on western music. Perhaps a good beginning would be the piano sonatas, but the string quartets have to have a place also.From the early quartets to the last quartets, the amount and variety of music in the quartet opus alone is astounding. Like the other genres he composed in, some of his best music is in the string quartets.One of the best ways to get the most out of this music is to follow along in the score. It is a good way to learn to follow more than one staff of music at a time, and is a good primer that can lead to full orchestral score reading.

It can be studied in its entirety within two days, but cementing all the information in long-term memory will require returning to it frequently during the course of study.Stringer's casual student-oriented style helps put the nervous reader at ease and builds confidence while studying, a rarity in review books which are more likely on one of the two polar extremes of intimidating or condescending. The sheer mass of detail can be overwhelming in pharmacology as well, and Stringer is also very helpfully pragmatic in emphasizing which details are important for the student to learn the first time around, and which can be saved for a second pass through the material.Pharmacology books become obsolete quickly, and, like most others, this one needs an update. For example, it covers only sulfonyl ureas, not even mentioning the three newer classes of diabetes drugs.Stringer reminds the reader constantly that her book is not complete, and that it should be supplemented by other material, and she's right. At times its coverage is a bit skimpy, especially on side effects, and it has little discussion about recent trends in treatment options (e.g., that barbiturates are being phased out in favor of the less toxic benzodiazapines). Still it's an excellent starting point and emphasizes well what's most important versus what's less so.One minor quibble is that the editing on this book needs to be tighter - there are quite a few grammatical errors, such as confusing the contraction &quot;it's&quot; with the possessive &quot;its&quot;.

Actually, sex is everywhere. Most people simple don't notice it because they are blind -- or something like it. After reading this strange --albeit good -- novel, it is impossible not to star wondering about what people do in order to have carnal pleasure. And this is not a bad thing -- most of the time.By telling the intertwined story of two brothers in France through some decades, the French writer went deep into the compartment of the human soul that keeps the sexual desire. Michel and Bruno share the same mother and the feeling that their lives are a bore. The first one is a famous biological researcher that has quitted his job and wants to do something with his life -- whatever it means. His brother is a professor in his early 40's and with a felling that his life is approaching to death, therefore he wants to live intensely.\\"The Elementary Particles\\" follows the adventures -- many of the sexual -- beginning in their childhoods until this period of their lives when they are living through the motions. In both lives a woman will emerge as an important character -- after their mother. She is Annabelle. Michel met her when they were still kids, and since them they have approached and fallen apart form each other. Bruno, on the other hand, is not interested in love, until the day he meets a strange woman in a swimming pool.Houellebcq is one of the most famous names of French contemporary literature. That doesn't mean he is good -- but, actually, he is good indeed. His prose is light and, at the same time, deep. His explicit narrative, detailing sexual rendezvous, is not gratuitous. It seems that in this world, sex tries to replace love -- and it works sometimes, until the moment that his characters notice that they need more than an orgasm.In \\"The Elementary Particles\\", the writer exploits what has became of the generation that preached free love in the late 60s. Now, the flower power has been replaced new age mumbo-jumbo, including workshops, music and all sort of mystical crap. However the last chapters of the book take a strange detour, exploiting the power of science. In this fashion, Houellebecq goes very close to Adouls Huxley -- one of the writers he admits influenced his work. The epilogue seems to belong to another book. But, as soon as one finishes reading this novel, and starts thinking about it, any reader can realize that the ending makes total sense. Beautifully deceitful."},{"Title":"Errors, Medicine and the Law","review":"When someone is hurt during medical treatment it is an understandable reaction to blame the doctor for the harm. However, the great majority of errors which occur in medicine are a simple consequence of conscientious doctors being fallible human beings just like the rest of us. Hospital systems are generally full of design faults which pre-dispose doctors to make mistakes. Blaming doctors for simply being human directs attention away from these design faults, reduces the chance that system improvements will be made, and makes it likely that the same error will repeat itself in the future - thus perpetuating patient harm. Human error cannot be avoided, but patient harm can, through better systems and procedures. Genuinely negligent acts do occur in medicine, but it is important that these are distinguished from the inevitable human errors of clinicians doing their best. This is a distinction which is also required in law to ensure fairness in both the prosecution of negligent doctors and the compensation of harmed patients. This book goes several steps beyond the Institute of Medicine Report (&quot;To Err is Human&quot;) in identifying the mechanisms and nature of error within health care and in its detailed discussion of the intricacies of culpability, blame, violation, error, legal fairness, and patient safety."},{"Title":"The Contemporary Printmaker: Intaglio-Type & Acrylic Resist Etching","review":"This book has tons of great ideas and techniques, but is terribly written, organized and edited.

Look for the first version or another book..."},{"Title":"The Contemporary Printmaker: Intaglio-Type & Acrylic Resist Etching","review":"Howard's book contains much information on this subject which you will not find (at least readily) anywhere else. The methods are presented very clearly, \\"almost as if he expected you to be able to do them, also\\" -- cynicism intended -- as it is indeed clear that he is trying to teach and have you learn.There is no substitute for this book currently available.Howard is personally responsible for much of the advance of the state-of-the-art in non-toxic printmaking, for which we should be grateful. However, that leads to one of the flaws of the book: Things are presented in rather absolute terms, implying that \\"this way, my way, is the only way\\". I realize that Howard invented a number of these methods, but, as an inventor myself, I have long since become accustomed to the fact that just because I invented something new, which no one else was able to get to work previously, I have definitely not proven that the thing I invented was either the \\"only\\", let alone the \\"best\\" method. Far from it! Being the first to get something \\"to work\\" means that you are about to see a flood of improvements and variations, of which you would never have thought.Another flaw is this: It is clear that companies like Olec helped Howard out quite a bit in his experimentation over the years. And the book, for example, in places, almost reads like an ad brochure for Olec equipment. That doesn't mean that the Olec equipment is not fine equipment; rather, the opposite: it is indeed fine equipment. But it is not the *only* suitable equipment available; Howard almost makes it sound as if the equipment he recommends is the only equipment which will work.Another flaw: the editing is absolutely substandard. I don't understand how anyone successfully got the MS out of microsoft word. There are *very* many mis-spellings, etc., which should have been caught.Another flaw: The writing throughout is very much in the first person. I do understand how that is unavoidable in some places. But I do not understand why that \\"style\\" -- in my opinion, inappropriate for a monograph -- was allowed to continue through the entire volume. I would guess that this is not the author's fault, but is a case of poor editing."},{"Title":"The Contemporary Printmaker: Intaglio-Type & Acrylic Resist Etching","review":"I recently started learning ImagOn to make etchings based on my photos. Keith is probably the most knowledgeable person regarding this medium, and I'm signed up to take a workshop with him in May. I got this book in anticipation of the workshop.The book has very useful information, especially about making plates, doing test exposures and development, and how to work with Akua Inks. I immediately learned a great deal that I think will improve my printmaking (such as not soaking paper for long when using Akua and also how to properly ink and wipe down a plate).The place where I found the book less useful and less clear is in making photo transparencies using photoshop and an inkjet printer--which is the technique I'm most interested in. There are methods shown using two different printers, but since I don't have either of these, I'm at a bit of a loss as how to proceed.What would be helpful would be an explanation of what you're trying to achieve (for example, is it a certain grain pattern or density, or level of opacity in my transparencies?) so that it could be more universally applied regardless of which printer you're using. But the book jumps right in to the technique without any explanation. There are other sections about making plates for 4-color prints which offers some info, but overall I didn't find this topic clearly presented.I, like others, also found numerous typos and errors, and the layout inconsistent. For example, at one point, I found an 'o' spelled with a zero, which is pretty tacky. There are also some typos where I find myself guessing at what the real meaning is, and though I'm probably right, its still leaves you feeling a bit confused.In summary, some very good material here, and I hope that any future versions will fix the obvious flaws. I'm still looking forward to learning much more from Keith in a workshop, but I really had hoped the book would have gotten me further along before that.David."},{"Title":"The Contemporary Printmaker: Intaglio-Type & Acrylic Resist Etching","review":"I respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who commented \\"There is no substitute for this book currently available\\".

This DVD leaves no stone unturned as I assume does this book. \\"ImageOn\\" is a photopolymer film that a printmaker such as Howard must apply to a copper intaglio plate before exposure to the light and image transparency.

This second volume of Detectives, Inc. features two struggling private investigators named Ted Denning and Bob Ranier, longtime friends whose consciences sometimes lead them to take cases that aren't exactly profitable. Both men have deep scars: Ranier from a painful divorce that has damaged his willingness to seek intimacy, and Denning from a time when he was forced to shoot someone.Entering their lives is a tough social worker named Dierdre Sevens, who is drawn into trying to help an acquaintance who calls on her desperately when her husband has beaten her one too many times. Unsurprisingly, this friend backtracks on her story when Dierdre shows up and curses her when her husband arrives home. After a physical confrontation with him, Dierdre decides to hire Denning &amp; Rainier to investigate the husband. What follows is a series of twists and turns involving emotional scars, hypocrisy, the bonds of friendship and the possibility of new hope, not to mention murder.McGregor is a master wordsmith, delving deep into his characters' psyches, both hero and villain. While emotions run high, he's also able to inject a great deal of humor into the story with the easy rapport between the two detectives. Colan has long been respected as one of the greatest artists in the history of comics, and this black &amp; white masterpiece is one of his finest works ever. His specialty is depicting mood &amp; motion as well as being able to portray the subtleties of emotion on the human face.This is a mature, introspective work that confronts and examines a number of issues without preaching or pretending to come up with all the answers. If you want to see a more human take on the detective genre, an interesting character study, or an example of what comics are capable of, check this graphic novel out."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"IDW is really winning my heart with its reprints of great comics from the 1980's and 1990's. This B&W; collection of writer Don McGregor's Detectives, Inc. comic stories comes with several prose pieces on the genesis of the comic, along with a piece on the filming of the Detectives, Inc. movie. My only caveat about the volume is that it's unfortunate that it couldn't be reprinted in a larger format -- the hyper-detailed art of Marshall Rogers on \\"A Remembrance of Threatening Green\\" originally appeared in a larger album size, and things do get a little squinty at times.Quibbles aside, this is a tremendous achievement both in writing and art. The world of McGregor's private detectives, Rainier and Dennings, gets the hypercrisp, hyper-detailed treatment from Marshall Rogers (best known for his Batman work in the 1970's), and the moodier, more humanistic approach from Gene Colan (best known for Tomb of Dracula and about a dozen other books). Both art styles work, and both look great in black and white. Indeed, this may be the late Rogers' greatest work. The attention to detail is stunning, and Rogers experiments with some really fascinating one and two-page designs.Private detectives aren't all that common in comic books unless they wear costumes or have occult powers. Rainier and Dennings remind me a lot of revisionist 70's PIs from the movies -- not so much Jake Gittes in Chinatown, as Rainier and Dennings are less cynical than Robert Towne's PI, but more the characters we see in films like Night Moves (with Gene Hackman on the case) and Cutter's Way (in which non-PI's John Heard and Jeff Bridges try to solve a case). They're battered and bruised sometimes, emotionally as well as physically, but they stay on the case.McGregor invests his characters with a lot of heart -- he's one of the great comic book writers in terms of creating sympathy and empathy, at creating plausibly flawed and self-doubting protagonists, and at incorporating both sex and romance into a comic book without being prurient or exploitative. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"Detectives Inc. from creator/writer Don McGregor and artist Marshall Rogers is an important work in the evolution of the comic book medium. Best known for his work on Marvel's Black Panther and Killraven, this was a story that had been stewing in the back of McGregor's mind for over a decade. As an author, he had high aspirations for the types of stories he would tell and believed the possibilities for the comic medium had barely been scratched. With Detectives Inc., McGregor did his best to look ahead at what those possibilities could be and eschewed all \\"conventional wisdom\\" with regard to how a comic should look and what stories could be told. Knowingly taking a big risk, McGregor dove head first off the deep end and made it work. And it can be argued that with this book he helped to redefine the way comics were viewed.This was the first book I had read by Don McGregor and I opened the first page with trepidation, worried it would suffer from the stilting dialogue and poor use of exposition prevalent in a lot of work from the early 80s. I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case. Certainly, there are spots where the dialogue sometimes gets preachy, but in most of these instances it falls in step with the characterization. The story was very compelling and refused to fall into melodrama. With this book, McGregor brought a gritty realism that I can only assume was sorely lacking within the comics medium at the time this first saw print in 1980.In my opinion, this is an incredibly important comic. It came at a time, shortly after publication of Will Eisner's A Contract with God, when creators closer to the mainstream began pushing at its boundaries. In Detectives Inc., McGregor ran headlong through any taboo you can name, dealing with lesbianism, divorce, racism, abortion, sex, nudity, and murder in a taut, literate, and intelligent manner. This would have been nearly impossible to pull off if his protagonists, Ted Denning and Bob Rainier, had not been such well realized characters. These two men are familiar because they deal with all the fears and insecurities everyone faces on a daily basis. The use of violence is not something they revel in, and in fact only leads to trouble down the line when Denning is again put in a situation where he must use his gun. Unable to discard the phantom of the boy he needed to kill, Denning hesitates for just a second. That is all the murderer needs as he runs Denning down with his car, leaving him on the edge of consciousness. Meanwhile, Rainier is still dealing with his recent divorce throughout the entire series, often unable to focus as his mind wanders to thoughts of sexual fantasy with any woman that may be near, including his stated feelings on this subject to his ex-wife. And if the expectation is that things will be tied up as neatly as on Law & Order or NYPD Blue then readers are in for a surprise.Those who were not turned away by the subject matter - No capes? No cyclotrons? No anti-matter devices? - were not only in for a treat regarding the story, but also found McGregor and Rogers playing with the way a comic could look as well. McGregor set the story up as a graphic novel, with the emphasis on novel, and broke the story into chapters along with a prologue and epilogue. Each chapter was titled and opened with a few paragraphs of prose before starting into the traditional comic panels, which are beautifully drawn by Marshall Rogers. With this being a dense work, there are a lot of panels. And yet, Rogers manages to convey what is happening within those panels masterfully. Nothing seems cluttered, nothing is missing, and his storytelling is as clear as any artist. And despite utilizing many different panel arrangements - including one early two-page spread that includes 21 panels - one never has trouble following the story. It is obvious that Rogers felt as passionately about this story as McGregor did, and it shows through in the final product.This was a big risk for both writer and artist. The direct market was in its infancy, as was Eclipse Enterprises, and then, as now, superheroes were king. The thought of trying to do anything outside of the strict boundaries of the spandex set was not at all a healthy gamble to take. For that aspect alone, as well as for the fact that McGregor and Rogers wished to attack the taboos that had plagued mainstream comics for decades, this is an extremely important book and one worth seeking out. McGregor realized the untapped potential of comics and challenged himself to live up to that potential. In doing this, he also challenged readers to expect more from their comics."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"\\"There came a day when it wasn't kid stuff anymore.\\"Those were words that I felt with both gratitude and intensity when I learned that Don McGregor's Detectives Inc. stories would be collected into a hardcover book.I remember sitting on the floor of a tiny apartment on a day in 1987, reading a three-issue story by Don McGregor and Gene Colan. It was really a single graphic novel, called Detectives Inc.: A Terror of Dying Dreams. Comic books had always been a haven of sorts for me. A place where I could retreat into a world of glorious color and equally glorious heroism; a place where things were resolved with the simplicity of a child's belief in right and wrong. On that day comic books became much more. In the pages of that story, I saw the dedication of the character Dierdre Sevens, who put her money, her time and caring into hiring the two detectives in the case of a battered wife in terrible denial. Later in the story, Dierdre and Bob Rainier were passing slow hours on a boardwalk, talking about abuse in their own lives. Their emotions were intense, angry, confused. They were seeking for ways to be heard, seeking to hear one another. Their exchange was painfully real; touching through a clear yearning in both of them to speak and have it be okay to have spoken...to know that one could break silence and not have to retreat in shame and fear afterward. That there was strength in being there to listen to one another.When had the medium of comic books come to this place? Where a story like this could exist, could reach out with assurance that there would eventually come a time when the far side of pain could be reached; that hope and dignity could be waiting there?As I wrote in the Afterward of this new edition of Detectives, Inc., I was powerfully inspired by these stories. Many years and countless re-readings later, they directly moved me to begin a project called Poets Against Abuse, which was all about using words as Don had used them: to tell gripping stories on one level, and on another to reach out with the kind of caring that brings an articulate voice to experiences that so often are left unspoken.The stories of Detectives Inc. are at once raw and subtle, moving, heartbreaking, uplifting. The characters whose stories unfold in them are nothing short of alive and real; you can hear their voices, connect with their humanity.Don McGregor's Detectives Inc. was in the forefront when stories of emotional truth were few and far between in any medium. Few creations have ever, to my mind, left such a legacy of life, of hard-edged awareness, of hope."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"During his famous run penciling Batman stories in DETECTIVE COMICS, with Steve Engelhart writing the story and Terry Austin providing the inks, Marshall Rogers showed that nobody (with the possible exception of Frank Miller in his DAREDEVIL stories) could convey New York City's grimy and cluttered Seventies urban landscape in graphic narrative form quite as evocatively. Soon afterwards, with DETECTIVES, INC., he got the chance to draw New York as it is rather than in thinly fictionalized form as \\"Gotham City\\"; this remarkable early graphic novel is worth owning if only just for his haunting and brilliantly detailed cityscapes. The graphic novel (the first naturalistically drawn one after Will Eisner's A CONTRACT WITH GOD) is essentially a gritty detective novel following a two-man operation, Ted Denning and Bob Rainier, who are hired by a midwife to find the murderer of her female lover; this was the first mass-market American comics story to explicitly portray lesbian lovers. Don McGregor's mystery is a good one, and he makes his heroes (particularly Rainier) sensitive and fleshed-out characters. Marshall Rogers's graphic experimentation (particularly in terms of layout) can take some getting used to, especially since he packs so much onto each page. But like his work for DETECTIVE at DC Comics and DOCTOR STRANGE at Marvel, there's something practically breathtaking about seeing how fertile and inventive his imagination is; he keeps trying different approaches--some which work, others which don't--to see what he can do that's new. I can't think of any other text (standard or in sequential art form) that can give the reader a better sense of what Manhattan was like in the very late 1970s: crowded, dirty, massive, and intensely alive."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"For those who aren't familiar with his work, Don McGregor has always been a trendsetter in comics. He made his name avoiding standard super-hero fare, instead doing the political high adventure Black Panther (in Jungle Action), the philosophical science-fiction feature Killraven, and a number of horror scripts for Warren Comics. But Don also was one of the first who broke away from the big companies to create and own his own characters.Among his first creator-owned works was the first Detectives, Inc. graphic novel, A Remembrance of Threatening Green. It introduces his memorable Ted Denning and Bob Rainier, two struggling detectives who are long-time friends. This story is so absorbing because like in so many McGregor works, the plot serves the characters rather than the other way around.Denning and Rainier both have their crosses to bear, as we soon learn. Denning is haunted by killing a man in self-defense. Rainier is still shattered by his divorce, unable to let go of his wound. Rainier's ex-wife asks him to take on a murder case involving a friend of hers. It turns out that a mid-wife's girlfriend has been killed in a hit-and-run accident, but she suspects foul play.Don takes a potentially sensationalistic topic, homosexuality, and treats it like exactly what it is: simply another aspect of being human. The way Rainier drifts off into fantasizing about their client, a lesbian, imagining her in very typical male fantasies is replaced by understanding that the two of them had very similar senses of loss. They both had deep scars and were able to share their pain, not as male and female or gay and straight but two human beings who were not only alone, but whose link to intimacy had been taken away in a cruel manner.Denning and Rainier work through a number of different suspects as a number of twists and turns reveal some interesting things about all of the characters, and the final confrontation delivers the action genre goods. But the focus of the book is the friendship between Bob &amp; Ted. The two men share a bond deeper than words can express, and their easy, humorous rapport helps both cope with the issues they're dealing with.The art is exquisite, with the fabulous Marshall Rogers giving us a detailed tour-de-force filled with grit and whimsy. The panel design is imaginative, with a certain cinematic influence. This is McGregor at the top of his game, and any fans of comics, the detective genre will like it and anyone interested in a complex exploration of relationships will love it."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"The two \\"Detectives Inc.\\" graphic novels, with art by the late Marshall Rogers and by Gene Colan, respectively, are, aside from being beautifully written, humanistic detective novels, landmark graphic novels.

And aside from Will Eisner's hardcover & trade-aoer \\"A Contract with God\\" (a series of short stories rather than a single story)and Jules Feiffer's hardcover-only \\"Tantrum\\" (a single-panel-per-page story), these are the first graphic novels about ordinary people, and not heroic-adventure fantasy. (And even the Feiffer book had a plot-crucial fantasy element.)The \\"Detectives Inc.\\" novels paved the way for future graphic novels about ordinary people; they helped prove that such stories could work, and work well, in paneled-narrative book form. While daily comic strips had mined that form, and while there were collections of detective or medical or other strips that formed de facto book narratives, such collections contained the artificial daily climax that serial strips require -- giving them a style and rhythm much different from those of a single long narrative. \\"Detectives Inc.\\" proved that these kinds of stories could work in this form, and for anyone who wants to truly understand the graphic novel and how it evolved to what it is today, these works are cornerstones that no serious comics fan or detective-novel fan should be without."},{"Title":"Detectives inc. in A remembrance of threatening green","review":"In amongst the capes and tights and adolescent power fantasies that pass themselves off as the American comic books, there are a handful of dedicated creators out there who are attempting to push the medium to be more than it is. DON McGREGOR has been pushing for a long time. Back in the '70s, when he was writing Black Panther (in the pages of JUNGLE ACTION) for Marvel, he was told his work was &quot;too close to the black experience.&quot; The person saying it meant it as a negative, but since Don is in fact a white guy, I can't think of too much higher praise a white writer working on a title with a black central character and a mostly black supporting cast could ask for. Flash forward a few years, Don is again pushing the envelope. This time for creator rights. Among the creator-owned characters he brings to life are private detectives Denning and Ranier, the stars of this (and so far one other) DETECTIVES, INC. book. The Culp and Cosby of the comic book set. These guys are low on cash, strong on ethics, and positively white hot on intrigue, action and great, great dialogue. He could have sold them to one of the big publishers and produced some watered-down version, but he didn't. He stuck to his guns and with artist Marshal Rogers executed one of the most original graphic novels to ever come off the presses. Real characters. Real problems. Real suspense. This recently published 20th anniversary edition is a superb introduction to these characters, and a great private detective story on its own.

I thought I was well prepared for the task of breastfeeding. Boy was I wrong. I knew the technical aspects of how to breastfeed but was completely lost on how to actually do it. Breastfeeding is such a touch sensitive thing that if you don't understand how something feels, you could get the latch wrong.The book does describe potential problems, such as mastitis. However, the descriptions are also very technical and left me without knowing whether or not I had mastitis.I wish I skipped this book and went right to Nursing Mother's Companion. I have breastfed my daughters for a total of 2.5 years and have never referenced this book beyond the initial reading."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"This book's information is generally accurate, and it's easy to read. However, readers should know that the American Academy of Pediatrics sold this book a formula company. Now, the company gives hundreds of thousands of copies of it emblazoned with their logo to pediatricians offices to give away for free. If the American Academy of Pediatrics really cares about breastfeeding and the well-being of breastfeeding mothers and babies, why would they sell their book to a formula company? Perhaps the answer is because the American Academy of Pediatrics depends nearly 100% on the pharmaceutical and formula industries for its financial support. There are many excellent books on breastfeeding: Newman and Pittman's The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers; Mohrbacher's Breastfeeding Made Simple; Sears and Sears' The Breastfeeding Book, to name but a few. Buying one of them will not support the American Academy of Pediatrics, and in turn, the formula industry."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"This is THE breastfeeding book to buy. As a NICU nurse, I am familiar with breastfeeding, but as a new mom, I needed some help. This book addresses the real issues that come up with breastfeeding without passing judgement or inducing guilt if your experience isn't \\"perfect\\".

ALOHA!!"},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"This book should be titled \\"Rah Rah Breastfeeding!\\". There was too much effort spent convincing you to breastfeed, rather than presenting useful information for nursing mothers. It's also filled with annoyingly sappy stories about mothers who choose to nurse.Just in case you think I'm anti-breastfeeding, not so! I'm still nursing my little one at 15 months, but I can't say this book was any help at all. The La Leche League website was far more informative and FREE. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"I read this book when I was about 7 mos pregnant w/ my son, and then looked it over as my due date approached. Because of this I was very well prepared. You will definitely want to keep it to review as you run into nursing issues though. Aside from a supportive family and patience this is the best resource you can have for successful breast feeding experience."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"As a new mom-to-be, I stumbled across this book at a secondhand store and, from briefly flipping through it, thought it might be helpful, so I grabbed it up. Indeed, it features drawings of latch techniques and positions that I found useful, along with summarized descriptions of many basic breastfeeding topics. However, this book falls seriously short in so many ways, and I realize that more than ever now that I'm actually breastfeeding (my baby is now 3 months old).First of all, this book is absolutely littered with these ridiculous fictional accounts of women with geriatric-sounding names that address this, that, or the other. It's cumbersome and completely unnecessary to have to skim through fictional \\"conversations between friends\\" just to try to weed out factual information on breastfeeding. The readers of this book are adults, not grade-schoolers, and it's hard to take this book seriously as a rational resource due to this unfortunate offense.Second, I agree that this book harps on and on and on a little too hard about the benefits of breastfeeding (and there are many) while totally glossing over the fact that, to some extent or another, problems arise very frequently and are oftentimes perceived as severe or stressful in new mothers. They touch very lightly on the basics like mastitis and engorgement, but for this to be a truly comprehensive resource, there needs to be MUCH more information on breastfeeding roadblocks. If women read this book and go into it thinking it's going to be a piece of cake, most of them will be in for an unexpected surprise, which might put them at risk for early weaning. My daughter is 3 months and I had mastitis four times which led to a very severe abscess that had to be surgically drained. (I still breastfeed on one side only.) My experience, while not overwhelmingly common, is certainly not unheard of in breastfeeding women, yet the word \\"abscess\\" is not even mentioned in the entire book. I feel that they are not taking a realistic approach with their readers by the neglectful omission of many painful issues women may experience while breastfeeding.Overall, unless you're like me and find it for dirt cheap someplace, I cannot recommend this book. I found La Leche League's website, the Kellymom website, and in-person lactation consultations to be more beneficial in getting the hang of it all. I recommend that pregnant women try to get as much information as they possibly can before the birth of their child to be prepared, but perhaps not from this particular resource. But whatever you do, hang in there and seek out help from a pediatrician or lactation consultant if you need it!"},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"Having already decided to breastfeed, I read this book (on loan from a friend) hoping for some practical information to help me feel prepared.This book has very little useful information, and far too many feel-good, corny stories about imaginary mothers who've decided to breastfeed.If you've already decided to breastfeed, you won't learn anything from this \\"guide\\" beyond what you've already learned in your pregnancy books. I'm now borrowing \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" from another friend in hopes of getting less propaganda and more practical advice!"},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"Written simply, it's easy to get through the book in a day or two. There are little stories here and there that can be skipped over as they do not add any real information or entertainment. The information is good,they do give good resources for where to go or who to contact if you are struggling to feed or just need support, as well as all the specs on how and why to breastfeed. I also like the charts in the back that tell you what to normally expect from growth to bowel movements daily. Be aware that it can get preachy (possibly rightfully so) that breastfeeding is ALWAYS better than formula, the longer you breastfeed the better (has facts to back it up) and pushes feeding on demand (AKA milk factory open 24/7) It scolds society for shunning women who breastfeed into the toddler years or in public, reminding us that the baby's health is more important than public approval."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"I got this book free with that bag of formula the hospital gives away (YIKES!), but I found the book's information to be helpful to me.

So if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement, this book won't help you.My baby was always hungry, she wanted to eat every hour and I was going crazy. Plus my hormones were crazy and breastfeeding hurt. It was a nightmare. I checked the book to find something about the pain and my cracked nipples. I found the story of a woman who had the same problem. It said: \\"Sam's pediatrician was able to show me some new nursing positions when I brought him in for a checkup a couple of days later. She helped Sam latch on better, and this made breastfeeding much more comfortable form me.\\" And that's it. They never explain what these positions were. So I ended up going to the breastfeeding center. They said I was doing everything correctly. And they told me that the first couple of weeks it hurst and then it doesn't. They were right. A week and half later, I didn't have any pain while nursing. They also told me the reason my baby was always hungry was because I didn't have enough to give her so I had to supplement with formula.So since I went to the breastfeeding center, this book's been collecting dust in the bookshelf."},{"Title":"New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding (American Academy of Pediatrics)","review":"I bought this book before my first daughter was born. My milk supply was low with her and I went through hell trying to get my milk supply up (pumping, SNS, meds, lactation consultants...everything) but had to supplement her through the entire 9 months of breastfeeding when she weaned herself. I felt so inadequate and like a total failure as a mother. Since then I've met SO many women with a similar problems. Anyway, I pulled this book out again last night since I am starting to have similar supply problems with my 2nd, 3 month old daughter. What an awful book. The book does not address supply problems at all except for a couple of cursory comments and offers no real advice on the subject. It appears that the whole point of the book is to push breastfeeding propaganda through fear while purposely ignoring real problems to make breastfeeding seem easy. If you're a new mom, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK. If you do have problems, this book will only make you feel like you are going to make your children unhealthy and stupid if you can't breastfeed through puberty.

I'm not sure what the problem is with it being distributed free by pharmaceutical companies either; actually, I think it's great that people are getting this resource free. Far from discouraging breastfeeding, the pharmaceutical insdustry is helping doctors PROMOTE it. By offering the book free, pharmaceutical companies are hardly helping their own bottom line (they could simply give out free formula and not provide anything supportive of breastfeeding); quite the opposite, they are doing something that works against their bottom line. Pharmaceutical companies who sell formular even use the phrase \\"breast is best.\\" The fact of the matter is, there is a place for formula since breastfeeding is not an option for everyone, and a place for companies that continually try to improve options available for such people.

After reading it, I fully realize why she didn't bother to keep it as reference! It cover the basics of breastfeeding, but left me feeling uninspired and frustrated. The writing style, with sappy made-up stories in each chapter, felt juvenile. The benefits of breastfeeding were pushed hard, and the particular stance about continuing to breast-feed for a long time feels like an unreachable goal. I'm not against breast-feeding -- in fact, I plan to do it -- but this book left me feeling more overwhelmed than prepared.The biggest frustration I had was in the chapter titled \\"A Father's Role.\\" That chapter would have insulted my husband if I'd let him read it!

The big stuff is covered (like mastitis), and resources for support are awesome.But the second time around it had been almost 4 years since I breastfeed and was in need of a bit of a refresher. Esspecially when I had a harder time adjusting to feeding than last time. I was having alot of pain, and it didn't have the detailed info I needed. Like the exact symptoms of mastitis, and that it is only treatable by antibiotics. A little more detailed information would have been more helpful (medical wise), and less time spent writing the included stories.

It mostly seems geared toward making a case for breastfeeding, which I already was planning to do, so I found it a little overly enthusiastic. It is a very good intro to breastfeeding and the benefits but what I found, as soon as I had my baby, was that it really was no help for breastfeeding problems outside of the very most common issues. If someone was looking to this book and breastfeeding was offering challenges this book would make a new mom feel like a failure and that she must not be someone who could do it. I needed more help and ended up getting that from the La Leche League website and from a lactation consultant. I give it four stars because I think it unwittingly could discourage a new mom who is trying but lacks the support of a good social network that she can do it even if getting started is challenging.

His answer embarrassed me, because I was very familiar with both of the books he cited, one of which was this title, by Jeffrey and Todd Brabec. The Brabec twins' track record goes back thirty years or so. About 1970, when I was first setting up my music companies, both brothers worked for ASCAP, and helped me with some business details. Later on, as the dust-jacket bio explains, Jeff went on into private practice, and is now associated with the Chrysalis Group. Todd has stayed with ASCAP, and is currently Director of Membership, a position that gives him high visibility in the L.A. music community. In other words, these guys know their territory: when they talk about &quot;the inner workings of a music publisher,&quot; they lead you into a world seldom seen by the uninitiated outsider. When they talk about &quot;sources of income,&quot; their list is exhaustive, not ending until they've included all possible licensing revenues, even &quot;greeting cards&quot; and &quot;dolls and toys.&quot; When they tackle co-publishing agreements with this same attention to detail, they are recommending strategies many enterprising and entrepreneurial songwriters will want to try, sooner or later. And we're just beginning: yet to come are the fields of records, television, movies, live performance income, and, finallymusical theater, where my colleague had discovered more complex principles and formulas for computing royalties than I had seen before. Thanks, Jeff and Todd, for taking time to create this book. Okay, sure, you'll make some money with it-costs thirty bucks, for heaven's sake. But still, getting these concepts out of your heads and onto our desks is a major service. While the value of this material is obvious to anyone involved with licensing or contracts, it can be equally helpful as a university text. Consider it for honors work in music business, or for independent readings projects. Now that the book has been around a few years, it has found its way into the libraries of many star-level artists and songwriters, who regularly sing its praises to anyone who will listen.

With this fabulous autobiography I get the best of both worlds as the legendary Roz tells her story. This book remains one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, one to which I return time and time again.Why do I enjoy reading a true life story? I think it's because it's fascinating to learn how a person came from obscurity and became someone influential and beloved by millions of people the world over, to learn about the good times, the struggles and the triumphs.Why do I love Rosalind Russell? Well, that's harder to put into words. But I'll try. I think it's because she was such a versatile actress who was adept at comedy (\\"The Women\\", \\"His Girl Friday\\", \\"This Thing Called Love\\", \\"My Sister Eileen\\", \\"A Woman Of Distinction\\" and \\"Auntie Mame\\"), powerful in drama (\\"Sister Kenny\\", \\"Mourning Becomes Electra\\" and \\"A Majority Of One\\") and expert in musicals (\\"The Girl Rush\\" and \\"Gypsy\\"). How many actresses could do all that? Whatever she did on screen she did as a true professional. But, in real life she was also a tireless worker for charity and a devoted wife and mother. Rosalind Russell was a greatly respected woman among her peers.In telling her story, Miss Russell brings her delightful sense of fun to the fore. From the opening anecdote about winning a prize in a horse riding contest, to the way she got out of her first movie contract when a better offer came her way, to her ploy to get over the title billing in \\"The Women\\", Miss Russell spices her life story with wonderful humour that makes this book irresistible. She also includes some of the more tragic events of her life without remorse or self pity but with the strength of character that saw her battle breast cancer and crippling arthritis. It's all presented here in an endearing portrait of a true Hollywood survivor.What is also fascinating is the foreword by her husband Frederick Brisson. What Miss Russell does not include in the book is presented by her husband, rounding out this multifaceted portrait of a great lady. For example, her breast cancer and mastectomy are not discussed by Miss Russell but by her husband. Miss Russell lived in an era where revealing such a health crisis would have effectively killed her career. But, she lived through this traumatic time and continued to give the powerhouse performances she was famous for. Also recounted are her nervous breakdown, the heartbreak at only having one child and the deaths of those close to her.This is a wonderful book, one that I can not recommend highly enough. Although currently out of print, hopefully it will be back in print where it belongs in the not too distant future. My advice: do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of this fabulous book, even in a used copy. It will certainly provide you with a banquet of wonderful stories from a wonderful actress and woman, Rosalind Russell."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"From the forward written by her husband, Frederick Brisson, the reader is drawn into the dynamic life of Rosalind Russell. This book is full of delightful escapades of her childhood and shows an honest glimpse of a movie star (the best man at her wedding was Cary Grant) and the consummate professional she was. Gifted as an actress, no doubt, but Russell, shows the reader that it's the age old Thomas Edison adage - Genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. Talk about a persistent, creative marketeer of promoting herself, this book is a must-read for anyone needing to be shown a road of how it's done. She once told her only son, Lance, \\"Flops are part of life's menu and I'm never a girl to miss out on any of the courses.\\" And several times flop she does, always pulling herself up from the boot strings and trying again. Also, the glimpse into Hollywood legends lives - Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, even Coco Chanel, are a satisfying bonus to reading this book.Funny, poignant (her sister, whom Roz calls \\"The Duchess\\" and whom she based the character of Auntie Mame, dies early in the book) and thought-provoking, Russell indeed proves that life is a banquet to be feasted on and enjoyed each and every day. A delectable read, you'll come away from this book with a brighter take on life."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This book is about Rosalind Russell's career. She is funny, and as I stated above, honest. She speaks of rheumatoid arthritis, with which she was afflicted, and her childhood. The book also features a foreword by Frederick Brisson, who was her husband until her death, and he speaks of her truthfully. This is a wonderful book!!!"},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"As a longtime &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; fan, I was anxious to read &quot;Life is A Banquet&quot;. I'm thrilled to say that Ms. Russell didn't disappoint. She is a gem ~ authentic and honest and a wicked sense of humor. She maintained her ability, despite her success and life in Hollywood, to laugh at herself and those around her. If you can find a copy of this book, grab it and enjoy the ride. She absolutely lived her life as a banquet. May we be so lucky."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This is funny, poignant, interesting, and delightfully written. Russell begins with her childhood adventures riding horses with her brothers and sisters and also talks about her loveable, eccentric father and too-funny eldest sister, who was nicknamed \\"the Duchess\\" before moving on to her stage and then movie career. You feel as if you have come to tea with Miss Russell and she is telling you stories."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"I read this biography years ago, but after reading a recent article about Rosalind Russell, decided I just had to have it. She was the real deal - actress, star, no-nonsense dame. I love her."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This book is almost just as funny as one of Rosalind Russell's movies. I learned much I hadn't known before about her early life, as well as her co-stars. The book gives hilarious insights into such projects as His Girl Friday (1940), and The Women (1939), her first comedy.Roz, the fast-talking dame, will never disappoint in this three-laughs-a-page book. It's also got some great photographs, of her childhood, early acting career, and behind-the-scenes shots of her films. If you are a fan of Rosalind Russell, missing out on this book is your loss!"},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"AS stated multiple times, this was an order for a Christmas present; therefore, I will not be reading it. My daughter will be."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This paperback was in much better condition than advertised. I will definitely be buying from Mrs. Wiggins at every opportunity!"},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"Rosalind Russell's autobiography is full of stories about her movies and Broadway career and her friendships with Hollywood stars like Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra. She discusses in detail her breakthrough movie,The Womenand all of her early MGM films. My favorite Russell movies came later in her career and sadly, she devotes only a few quick sentences toPicnic(never mentioning Kim Novak),Auntie Mame(nothing about her costars), andGypsy(not a word about Natalie Wood).Much of the book is a testament to her long marriage to producer Freddie Brisson, who writes a very loving and revealing preface. She was strong and dynamic, a talented and dedicated actress, but her family always came first in her heart. Although she was quite ill at the end, she barely mentions her problems and indeed, spends no time in self-pity. (She was still editing the book at the time of her death.)It was disappointing that she glossed over her later movies, but her strength of character and humor shine through on every page and the book is quite inspiring. Many personal and professional photos are included."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"I could (and have) read this book over and over. Rosalind Russell takes you through her life as a child in Conneticut, her career with MGM, and her marriage to Freddie Brisson. I found each story engrossing, none of it was disinteresting. She tells the story of her life as if she was speaking to you personally. This book is a must read for any Rosalind Russell fan."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"Reviewers don't mention the ghostwriter of this autobiography which is told in the first person, the hilarious and wonderful Chris Chase who also wrote Betty Ford's biography.Anyone familiar with Chase's articles in the NY Times and her book would recognize her voice here.The book is wonderful but while it's honest about Russell's deep religious feelings and patriotism, it skates over her right-wing sympathies (to which she was entitled) and her friendships with Nazi sympathizers.Russell was indeed a multi-talented and fascinating woman who had an amazing life. I liked and admired her--- I enjoyed this book immensely, but I wish she had been challenged more."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This is not the behind-the-scenes tell-all one would expect from a Hollywood star. Instead it's a tame memoir that covers most of Russell's famous movies in just a couple sentences each. It certainly is told in her blunt \\"voice,\\" but she reveals little about who she is, the people she worked with or the roles she made famous.Diehard fans will love it simply because she wrote it. Published after she died, the book comes across as too reverential. She doesn't talk about any wild love affairs or even many on-set adventures. It's just kind of a boring life story. (Her husband's preface is actually more informative than the entire rest of the book!)There are a few things she likes to talk about, in particular her friendship with Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant. The only chapter written with much enthusiasm is about her 25th wedding anniversary party given by Sinatra in Vegas. But she then talks about how much she and her husband are apart--and how they allow a man who has been in love with her for decades to move into their house while the husband is gone. Few other personal details other than saying she and her husband fought a lot.She also takes a lot of credit for Auntie Mame. It's hard to say if she's being honest about how much input she had into all aspects of the original stage production, but she acts as if she almost single-handedly made a variety of decisions that turned it into a hit.Her lack of movie-making stories is truly disappointing. She should have some really interesting stories of working with famous directors and stars--but she barely even mentions some of her works. My favorite is The Trouble With Angels, which she dismisses as \\"the nun movie\\" and only devotes a couple sentences to it even though she devoted two years of her life to the film and its sequel! The same with Gypsy, His Girl Friday and others--she gives glib, terse observations and then moves on. She either doesn't recall stories or is hiding something. Either way, this book falls far short of her definitive life story."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"There is no doubt that she was talented and beautiful and suffered a lot in her life ( who doesn't). However, the book is very dull and boring. David Niven did a memorable job in his book about the same era, with scandalous snippets and interesting tit-bits. Rosalind places herself above such \\"sins\\", which is how she was. She continually upsets the chronology of the events in her life thereby creating confusion, this could be because she was so unwell since 1960 - and that really upsets the apple cart.Few years back, I watched Picnic on TV ( though not aware who she was), I seem to remember her acting; which was totally uninhibited.However, this book is a loser and doesn't entertain at all. Her cheerfulness and supposed candor becomes forced and contrived.Avoid..."},{"Title":"Life is a banquet","review":"This is one of my favorite books folks. Yes, she dishes up a bit of dirt and gossip about the stars she worked with but, she does it with such class and a healthy dose of sensitive editing. The respect she felt for her co-stars is evident and her life story a pleasure to read. Ms. Russell takes you right along with her through the joy, sorrow, and crazy fun that made up her life. I found this book to be both uplifting and motivating. What a smart,witty,enthusiastic lady! If you don't love her yet, you will after you read this."},{"Title":"Sustainable Urban Landscapes: The Surrey Design Charrette","review":"&quot;Sustainable Urban Landscapes: The 1995 Surrey Charrette&quot; is a new publication that deals with the issue of sustainability and sustainable communities. It may be of some use to educators and/ or those interested in the topic. Orders may be made to UBC PRESS 6344 Memorial Road Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.Telephone inquiries can be made to 604 822 5959.SUSTAINABLE URBAN LANDSCAPES: 1995 SURREY CHARRETTEDespite an emerging regional, state/provincial, and federal consensus on the paramount importance of sustainable community design, and reams of resultant policy goals to support this consensus, our new communities seem to be as unsustainable as ever. Perhaps one reason for our reluctance to change is that, while the policies exist, there are very few pictures of what a viable sustainable community might look like.Sustainable Urban Landscapes: The Surrey Charrette helps to move urban landscape sustainability from the realm of abstract policy goal to concrete practical reality by showing exactly what a more sustainable community might look like. The book contains the complete catalogue of design ideas, literally hundreds of colour design illustrations, generated at an international design charrette hosted by the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Landscape Architecture Program. Top landscape architects and architects from all over North America teamed up with UBC architecture and landscape architecture students, to design a sustainable community for 10,000 persons on a 400 acre site in Surrey, British Columbia. The result is North America's most comprehensive vision to date of what a sustainable urban landscape might someday look like.The five day brainstorming design charrette produced four complete design proposals, each supported by dozens of explanatory plans, perspectives and analytic diagrams. These proposals differ markedly from the conventional subdivisions of cul-de-sacs currently sprawling across the North American urban landscape, obliterating whatever natural environment lay in their paths. Instead, in these four proposals, the natural environment retains its ecological and functional integrity, most streets include a wide array of housing options, ecological systems extend virtually to the door of every home, streets are narrowed, the pedestrian and bicycle are accommodated, and commercial and transit services are located within walking distance to all dwellings.The book is laid out so that the reader gets a sense of the evolution each design. Each design team gets its own chapter, within which numerous analytical diagrams chart the steps in their design process. In this way the book helps explain the method by which North America's most accomplished designers approached the problem, and provides four model design processes that may be useful others.The forward is by Doug Kelbaugh, FAIA, one of the team leaders of the charrette, co- editor of The Pedestrian Pocket Handbook, and organizer of over a dozen major charrettes sponsored by the University of Washington.The introduction is by Patrick Condon, the Charrette organizer and the holder of the UBC Chair in Landscape and Livable Environments.The book also includes Beautiful Infrastructure, an essay by William R. Morrish, another of the team leaders of the charrette, and Director of the Design Center for the American Urban Landscape in Minneapolis Minnesota.The other team leaders for the charrette were: Joost Bakker, Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Cheryl Barton, Landscape Architect, San Francisco, California; Catherine Brown, Landscape Architect, Minneapolis Minnesota; Patrick Condon, Landscape Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Roger Hughes, Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Ken Greenberg, Architect, Toronto, Ontario; Jennifer Marshall, Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Stacy Moriarty, Landscape Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Moura Quayle, Landscape Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Murray Silverstein, Architect, Berkeley, California; Ron Walkey, Architect, Vancouver, British Columbia; Bill Wenk, Landscape Architect, Denver, Colorado; Carolyn Woodland, Landscape Architect, Toronto, Ontario; Don Wuori, Landscape Architect, Vancouver, British ColumbiaLargely descriptive rather than prescriptive, the Sustainable Urban Landscape Design Charrette is the first comprehensive work of its kind. The book provides readers with innovative and eminently practical ways of integrating nature with the city and, further, a compelling vision of what a more sustainable urban landscape would look like.

JB: The Last Great Secret of the Second World War","review":"If you actually read West's \\"Counterfeit Spies\\" you'll notice he complains about the FICTIONAL elements of the FICTIONAL novel The Paladin while documenting FACTS like that Creighton is indeed who he says he is (spy and Commando)--to include a statement by BSC Director Sir William Stephenson (The Man Called Intrepid)."},{"Title":"Op. JB: The Last Great Secret of the Second World War","review":"OPJB refers to \\"Operation James Bond\\", the subject of this 1996 story which I can't decide whether to call a novel or an historical account. I just don't know if this is a true story or not. The writer's first sentence in the preface to the book states 'I am well aware that many readers will find this story incredible.\\" He was certainly right about that. Creighton writes in the first person and claims to have been an under-cover operator in the secret \\"M\\" section of British Military Intelligence during the waning days of World war II. Since the activities of M section and British Military Intelligence are so secret, there is no evidence available even today, to confirm or deny his story, or even to determine whether Creighton himself was indeed a secret agent. But then the number one objective of secret egents is to hide their own identity, so its left to you and I, the readers, to decide whether or not we buy this story. World War II and the activities described here, ended with the surrender of Nazi Germany in May of 1945. Creighton claims that he had been given permission by Winston Churchill to publish his story, and in fact a copy of the letter purported to be from Churchill to Creighton dated October 1954, which stated that permission, is reproduced in the book. However in that letter, Churchill admonishes him to wait until after he, Churchill, is dead. Indeed Creighton waited 40 years and until all of his superiors in the British Intelligence community of WWII, including Churchill, Mountbatten, Ian Fleming and Morton had all passed away. The story concerns the decision of the British government in 1944 to regain possession of the treasures including Art, sculpture, currency and gold, which had been stolen by the Nazi leaders during the war and hidden in secret places all over Europe. That the Nazis had stolen and transported works of art is well established. In fact at the Nuremburg trials, evidence was presented about the two trains loaded with artwork stolen mostly from the Rothschild collections, which Hermann Goering had arranged for transportation to Munich to be stored in the \\"Fuhrerhaus\\" of Adolf Hitler. So it was that in January 1945, Christopher Creighton, a young Naval Officer already working under Lord Louis Mountbatten in the Intelligence community, was selected to assemble and direct the operation which the Intelligence Officer Ian Fleming had named \\"Operation James Bond\\", an operation to locate and take control of Art and other treasurers which had been stolen by the Nazis. This book then is the telling of that operation. It is a story of daring actions undertaken by Creighton and his small band of men and women, several of whom lost their lives, in the very nerve center of the Nazi organization, at the very moment of its ultimate destruction, but if true, it is also a story of the complicity of the highest level of western military and political leaders in decisions which they knew would cost thousands of lives and in a decision which potentially jeopardized millions. True ? or false ? . . . you will probably end the book, as I did, with a point of view, but regardless of where you come down, it's an interesting read for a winter weekend."},{"Title":"Op.

There are so many ridiculous \\"facts\\" that no one should ever even remotely believe any part of it. Being taken to Ireland by a naval gun boat, armed to the teeth, when there was a perfectly good ferry to Belfast (I used it)and road to Dublin is one glaring idiot story. The huge number of support staff smuggled into Berlin is another. But the winner is the taking out Ian Fleming by Lysander but leaving Martin Borman.All you can give the author is he managed to con some money out of the public and publisher with mediocre writing."},{"Title":"Op. JB: The Last Great Secret of the Second World War","review":"This should have been a war fiction book in the manner of Biggles, although even Biggles wasn't this heroic and his adventures were at least logical. Creighton had a big war - after magically becoming one of the youngest torpedo boat squadron leaders ever he: 1. he poisoned the crew of Dutch sub that reported the Japanese fleet heading to Pearl Harbour. 2. he looked down over the aftermath of the unsuccessful raid on Dieppe with none other than Adolf himself. 3. Having gained such a great reputation with the Nazi's, he is then sent over to Europe with information that the invasion will be Normandy (we gave this information to our spies heading to the continent all the time). He is captured and tortured into giving up this information. But wait it was a double double cross (his masters actually had it put out that he was planning to give this information up as a cover story so naturally they would then think the invasion was Calais after all). 4 he spirited Martin Borman out of Berlin during its fall. This last exploit was named Op Jb (James Bond) because Ian Fleming was involved.This book contains obviously bogus letters from Winston Churchill and Ian Fleming in a transparent attempt to back up his fantasy e.g. they go something like this: \\"I fondly remember [insert summary of plot here]. Here is some money and feel free to use this letter [to support your ludicrous story] once I am dead.\\"There are many other internal inconsistencies. I would love to detail them, but I tossed the book out in disgust.Please do not waste your money on this. It is not even good fiction.Creighton is one of the \\"Counterfeit Spies\\" exposed by Nigel West in his book of the same name."},{"Title":"Op.

I have read, studied, &amp; treasured countless books about the Divine Feminine, but none compare to this woman's spiritual courage and sensitivity. It made me enraged &amp; it broke me down to tears- Never have I been more proud to be a woman on this journey. A reviewer below criticized the author for finding enlightenment in forgiveness and resolution in righteous action. We are NOT here on this earth to deliver retribution, but to evolve and come into full SPIRITUAL POWER. Anyone can pursue revenge and remain in a self-righteous, angry abyss, but it takes a very refined soul, courageous heart, and deep spiritual intelligence to accomplish what this author has. I feel pity for those who missed the revolutionary purpose of this book.

The author does a great job clarifying her goals along the way."},{"Title":"Bond Between Women: A Journey to Fierce Compassion","review":"This is likely the best book i've read in the last several years. One of those books where you are outraged, depressed, crying, screaming and laughing at the same time, one of those books you wait for all day until you can sit down with it again. At least the first half of the book... the second half wasn't quite as powerful for me, but still wonderful. I understand how someone might think this view of compassion &quot;wimpy&quot; and &quot;same old same old&quot; But it really is a way beyond despair and rage, a way of protesting evil without letting it consume you. It's not about forgiveness, It's about power and action."},{"Title":"Bond Between Women: A Journey to Fierce Compassion","review":"Highly recommended; it reads like a mystery. China's descriptions of her travels are rich, colorful, poetic. Her personal journey and feelings speak to my own feelings about the horrendous crimes against humanity and each of us as individuals. How does one move from being a victim to going beyond the crime to &quot;fierce compassion&quot;? It's a puzzle that confronts us all and China has given us a great global view of how others have followed their heart with action and forgiveness; and the femimine dieties that have inspired us all for centuries. I was inspired and grateful for this timely piece of art."},{"Title":"Bond Between Women: A Journey to Fierce Compassion","review":"No woman should not read the bond between women, China Galland has given her readers a journey to enlightment on the page.

Whether she is learning about child prostitution in Nepal, serving salad on the streets of San Francisco, or discussing the Vietnam War with Sister Chan Khong, Galland illustrates both the horrendous difficulties, pain and trauma these women face; and their remarkable courage in rising above them. Especially moving was the chapter on the Disappeared in Argentina.This book highlights little-known or discussed issues facing women worldwide, and would be valued enough for that alone. It also realistically grapples with the complicated structures of forgiveness, setting boundaries, and healing. A superb spiritual work that crosses denominational lines."},{"Title":"Bond Between Women: A Journey to Fierce Compassion","review":"The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her. She remains the &quot;good girl&quot; and subsumes her anger into a semantic term &quot;fierce&quot; compassion. The title of the book is rather &quot;nice girl forgives once again&quot;. Except now she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no longer need to be silent provided we forgive. And since we are not compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than laugh at our own anger. What's so fierce or compassionate about that!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"This review is directed towards Catholics, not curiosity seekers.\\"The Pilgrim's guide to Italy\\" was written by a couple of practitioners of an Indian religion. Their selection of saints is strange and often ludicrously deficient. One example is their omission Saint Benedict and Scholastica. Many great saints are simply omitted due to the absurd whims of the authors and their biographies have been butchered in an attempt to make them politically correct. If one is an uncritical new age \\"touchy-feely\\" type who samples religions like snobs sample expensive wine, one might appreciate this book. However, for an orthodox Catholic it is obnoxious and glaringly deficient. There are better books out there anyway. Lucinda Vardey's book \\"Traveling With The Saints In Italy: Contemporary Pilgrimages On Ancient Paths\\" is markedly superior in tone, volume of information, and quality of content."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"It really never occurred to me that I might use The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints as an actual guide book to understand the religious culture of Italy. Then, my husband and I found ourselves charmed and immersed in the religious culture of the exquisite Italian countryside (and cities) where we found our unlikely travel companion in this book to be invaluable. For example, as foot tourists in Northern Italy, we were rescued by The Pilgrim's Guide from our destination dilemma when we found ourselves at the train station in Menestra instead of Venice! Thankfully, The Pilgrim's Guide was very helpful. The book says, when you are in Mesestra, you still must take another train to get into Venice. Why can't other travel books be so simple and specific? One might also read The Pilgrim's Italy for its delightful short biographies of Italy's most popular (and plentiful!) saints, but it's an inspirational read as well as a marvelous travel book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"We found The Pilgrim's Italy a wonderful travel companion. It's engagingly written with lots of useful information; a book which is both useful for travel and fun to read. The authors provide all the details for getting around, and, on a deeper level, convey the spirit of visiting these holy places. Pilgrim's Italy is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"The Pilgrim's Italy is a wonderful travel book, packed with information on pilgrimmage sites, places to stay, and all the details you need to make your trip fabulous experience.

Enhanced with a wealth of information, maps, descriptions, and accessibility of holy sites, The Pilgrim's Italy is a first-rate guide to spiritually enriching travel and an invaluable aid in finding lodging in monasteries along the way."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"I highly recommend The Pilgrim's Italy for those to whom travel is an inner as well as an outer adventure, and sustenance for the soul as well as the palate. It complements other guidebooks by providing informative tips for pilgrims that are not readily available in one place - shrine hours, for instance, places to meditate, useful Italian phrases and nearby places of interest. It also pulls one in with fascinating glimpses into the lives of some of the rare individuals who have achieved sainthood, and opens one up to the possibility of the miraculous."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"I found this book to be very informative and inspiring.

Even non-Benedictines know of the rule of St. Benedict, which is a guidelines for monastic communities. Neither Subiaco in Umbria, with both St. Benedict and St. Scholastica monasteries, nor Cassino, with the great Monte Cassino monastery which Benedict founded later, are included. I bought the book largely because I am planning a trip to Subiaco; this book is no help. If you want to learn about St. Benedict and St. Scholastica, Subiaco or Monte Cassino, you will have to go to The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy or to somewhere else. The Pilgrim's Italy is also larger and heavier than The Christian Travelers Guide, though the later still has a lot of information."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"I found The Pilgrim's Italy to be a very enlightening, informative, easy to read and follow guide to the saints.

Their writing has been most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"As someone who enjoys visiting saints' shrines in any country I happen to be visiting, I deeply appreciate this spiritual travel guide to bella Italia. The Heaters have packed The Pilgrim's Italy with all the pertinent information a spiritual seeker would need. I can say from experience that their description and advice on many of the sites they recommend-especially in and near Assisi, Italy-are right on the money. And they even include in their book brief instructions on how to achieve a state of inner communion. If you are going to Italy and are the type of person who likes to delve within and feel the peace and joy that permeates a church or home made sacred by historic connections with a great soul, you should get this book.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"&quot;The Pilgrim's Guide to Italy is essential reading for anyone planning a trip to Italy who wishes to include a visit to its spiritual treasures.

The book, The Pilgrim's Italy:A Travel Guide to the Saints was invaluable. It quided us to places where we could meditate and pray and go very deep into the vibrations of the saints. It also educated us on the lives of the saints in that area. We felt it gave us an experience that most people are unaware of when traveling to such holy places. Because we read the book prior to the trip and took it with us, we had expections that we could actually experience the presence of the saints and we did. Our expcetations were fulfilled more than we could have imagined.

This takes a lot of the work out of finding out where to go and what to see. The authors have fully done their work well. This book makes a great guidebook for any trip into Italy - be it a divine quest of some kind or just a holiday adventure. Their maps, information and recommendation are valued pieces of travel luggage on any trip.This is one of a series of book that the authors have written on making trips to locate and visit holy and sacred places. To me this is still their best but maybe it is because of all the saints that have walked on that blessed soil of Italy.I highly recommend this book for all travelers to Italy even if you do not think you are interested in finding the sacred places - it will help you find places of interest."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"I liked this book because it contained better biographical information than I'd been able to find elsewhere on a few saints.

Everyone knows where to find the museums, restaurants and tourist traps... we're looking for something genuine and new; and The Pilgrim's ITALY has it.

The information on how to find the pilgrimage sites, hours, lodging, etc, are thorough and helpful. But more than that, I really enjoy the information on the lives of the saints.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"In 2004 I took a trip to Italy. My intent was to seek out places of high spiritual vibration (due to the historical presence of saints) and to meditate in those places. The Pilgrim's Italy was invaluable in carrying out this vision. Many of the places I visited were off the beaten track and accessible and authentic beyond my imaginings (especially the hermitages associated with St. Francis, about an hour outside Rome). My spiritual life was transformed by my meditations in Italy, and I am forever grateful to the authors for their informative guidance."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"We traveled for a month in Italy and it was wonderful to have this book at our side. Suddenly we would find ourselves in a new area and look up the region in the book, only to find yet another saint we might visit! It is said that you can't hardly throw a rock and not hit a saint in Italy, so one could not possibly expect the book to contain them all. But it is wonderfully researched and leads you to even some back and sleepy places in search of inspiration. I remember taking a side journey on the Amalfi coast in search of one of the saints, which resulted in a most spectacular diversion to our otherwise calculated plans, a wonderful surprise worth finding. I recommend the book if you are interested in finding even some of the magnificent inspiration available in Italy."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Italy: A Travel Guide to the Saints","review":"Made a recent pilgrimage to Italy and because of this book visited churches I did not know about.

This is much better thanthe other books that have similar theme."},{"Title":"A Late Phoenix: A C.D. Sloan Mystery","review":"I recommend Robin Bailey's unabridged narration. As always, he's the perfect reader for an English cozy mystery, and a fine actor. He can slip into and out of the voices of young constable Crosby, an old man whose lungs were damaged by poison gas in WWI, an overweight woman with a bad leg in a doctor's office, and many more, all without missing a beat.The Battle of Britain, of course, didn't just involve the bombing of London; even thirty years later, Lamb Lane in Berebury is still a bomb site. (The council and the owners have been fighting for years about the building plans.) Now that everyone has their act together, the bomb rubble is being cleared - and the excavator hits just the wrong (or right) place: the skeleton of a pregnant woman was buried on the site, dating back to the war. Even before the autopsy, Dr. Dabbe doesn't buy the theory that a bomb would have laid her out so neatly with no visible crush injuries, so Sloan is stuck with an investigation that the superintendent would be just as happy to write off as 'historical' rather than 'possible murder', but there are suggestive points: the absence of any identification - or wedding ring - on the body, for one. Other missing pieces include a hue-and-cry for a missing person (there wasn't any) and the required notification of the local archeologists about the construction (the notice never arrived - if it was ever sent). And when the archaeologists had arrived in spite of everything, someone had moved their pegs out of the danger zone.Inspector Sloan, beginning his digging while the contractors are banned from continuing theirs, turns up various interesting tidbits: the memories of the older members of the Berebury force and the firefighting and rescue teams of the time, as well as the receptionist of the doctor's office across from the site (the old doctor himself died a few months ago). The Waite brothers, sons of the old couple who used to live in the bombed house, both left after the war, but only Harold inherited it, and promptly sold the site; Leslie, a black sheep, was disinherited. Why? And why did the self-made buyer want it but let it get bogged down in planning fights for so many years - or did someone else engineer the delay? And how and why did the clearance plans finally get approved?Apart from interesting sidelights on living through bombing, not once but over and over again, we have Miss Tyrell, breaking in the new Dr. Latimer as the late Dr. Tarde's successor, and William Latimer's own attempts to find his feet in Calleshire's medical community as a first-generation doctor."},{"Title":"A Late Phoenix: A C.D. Sloan Mystery","review":"While I'm emphatically the right sort of audience for what we might call (for want of a better term) the genteel British mystery tradition, I found myself feeling entirely undernourished by the end of this book. Ms. Aird seems to have none of the requisite skills (beyond the rudimentary ability to tell her story in a coherent way) that keep readers returning to writers like Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh or even Patricia Wentworth (who, formulaic and inconsequential as she can be, at least usually writes about likable people with distinct personalities).The details of the mystery at the heart of this book are solid enough, but she manages an unusual feat in the genre: an Inspector we feel we barely know and with whom we cannot really connect. And that's the most detailed of her characterizations! As the book begins, we are introduced to a Dr. Latimer and his receptionist, and they remain the most vividly drawn characters in the whole novel, but they are not really main characters at all. Everyone else in the town (developers, dotty old former Home Guard members, archeologists) have literally no apparent personalities at all -- Ms. Aird paints them so superficially and in so noncommital a nature that they never have any life on the page.She does attempt to give some eccentricities or idiosyncrasies to some of the members of the Police force, but even these remedially filled-out characters are one-dimensional at best, from Inspector Sloan's meandering superior, obsessed with the hippies at \\"Dick's Dive\\" to the police doctor, who hints at a bit of the curmudgeonly, but only appears in about 8 pages total.Weirdest of all, no-one feels real at all, a sense heightened by the oddity of WAY too many characters all randomly quoting obscure literary phrases at each other. I mean, we could believe that ONE character might do this, but Ms. Aird would have us believe that this whole town does this, including our ostensible hero Inspector Sloan \\"muttering\\" little quotes from plays or poetry while interviewing a witness or making official enquiries.None of it rings true, it doesn't add up to anything, and unless you're just trying to get to sleep, I don't recommend this book to anyone. It's just a pale and insubstantial imitation of a kind of mystery writing that has been done better countless times.There's nothing embarassing or unprofessional about the writing. There's just nothing of distinction or endearing quality about it either."},{"Title":"A Late Phoenix: A C.D. Sloan Mystery","review":"There's a strange familiarity I found with the characters of 'A Late Phoenix' which is only apparent in the greatest of writers (Crane, Zelazny, Fitzgerald, Tyler, and for the more 'mysterious' variety - Sayers, Stout, Tey, Christie, and Mortimer). Crosby is always great as the comic relief (always reminding me of friends I've had in school or more often than I'd care to think about, myself :P). Also of listening to the audio book, Bailey's performance is masterful and has a minimalist professonalism - he's no David Suchet...to his credit.Aird is, in my opinion and rather arguably, one of the greatest mystery writers of all-time (Sayers, Stout, and Christie being the others).I've read quite a few mysteries and this has to be one of my favorites because it doesn't just stick to the immediate mystery, there are countless other 'mini-mysteries' within it (like all good mysteries have). Also because the 'main mystery' behind this story is something to be solved on an incredibly difficult scale, because the protagonist must solve something that happened way way in the past (as it was Tey's 'A Daughter in Time')."},{"Title":"A Late Phoenix: A C.D. Sloan Mystery","review":"An interesting read the way only the British can write. Set in current time, a flash back to the 1940's war time is necessary to figure out this one.

In this book Cheif Inspector Sloane is taxed with finding the identity of a skeleton that had been shot 25 to 30 years ago. Murder was definitely the cause of death in this case, so Sloan is on the hunt again for a murderer. I think the best part of a Catherine Aird book is the wry humour, and of course, the inimitable Leeyes (Sloane's superior officer).

Mrs. Armitage has one of her Spasms (\\"her ultimate weapon\\") and has to be brought round by burning a quantity of feathers under her nose. Annabelle, the nearest in age to Minerva, is clearly jealous, the boys are all surly, and the other girls just start off crying. But the other five daughters will all get their chance, because \\"Minerva\\" is but the first volume in The Six Sisters series by Marion Chesney.Minerva, the eldest, is beautiful but a prude. While her mother reclines on a chaise longue coming up with new malaises and her father is off hunting instead of worrying about the dowries the girls need to be married off. But then Papa decides the boys should be sent to Eton, which requires money, and his solution is to marry Minerva off to some man with a fortune. So she is dispatched to town, where a man is walking around wearing nothing but green (Minerva is shocked), for her first season and her first target, Lady Wentwater's nephew. It goes without saying that this match is not going to work out and that reducing marriage to an economic transaction is never going to pan out in a romance novel.The comic irony here is that the man who is perfect for Minerva is one who has a ringside seat to her failed machinations. A common theme of Chesney's book is that poor Minerva is scandalized by life in the big city. She is being tutored on how to act in society by an elderly relative, Lady Godolphin, but nothing will stop Minerva from making her moral superiority known to one and all. Consequently, she becomes the subject of a rather inappropriate wager among the supposed gentlemen of Regency London. Time after time, Minerva finds herself in extremely compromising situations with a certain gentleman, who has wagered 50,000 pounds of the matter, but who insists he is not the marrying kind.Poor Minerva. A prude being seduced is going to be a tale ripe for humor and Chesney indulges in some ribaldry (I was shocked, shocked I tell you, that the word virgin escapes Minerva's lips). The emphasis is clearly on the comedy more than the romance, and my favorite point is when Lady Godolphin demands to know a gentleman's intentions towards Miss Armitage only to be told \\"You ask me my intentions, ma'am. Well, they're the worst, damme! The very worse!\\" Then the guy strides away. Now, I realize that could read like something serious, but it really is pretty funny. In comparison to the obvious reference point of Jane Austen, Chesney's offering displays a broader sense of humor, which should be enough to tell you whether or not you would find this book and this series appealing. After all, the vicar still has Annabelle, Deirdre, and three more daughters to marry off as successfully as he manages with this first one (ahem)."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"Minerva is the first in the Six Sisters series, a set of Regency-era romances by Marion Chesney (who also publishes other romances and mysteries under several pseudonyms). Chesney produced a number of Regency series (Rake's Progress, House for the Season, Mannerling Series, et.al.) but the Six Sisters is her finest romance work by far. Each of the six Armitage sisters has her own complete story;Minerva sets the tone for the whole set-- each girl is beautiful but distinct and flawed, not a perfect doll-like character with no depth. As the eldest of the girls, Minerva must make her way through the perils of London, while falling in love! The supporting cast of hunt-obsessed father, hypochondriac mother and grand dame chaperone who refuses to age gracefully add a backdrop of hilarity and consistency to the stories. Chesney's writing is a standout in this genre because the situations and characters and funny and quirky but not awkward or tedious.Chesney also adds lots of intersting cultural and historical information, blended so well into the narrative that it serves to make the characters more fascinating. Once you read Chesney's work, you won't be able to read the standard dull, pretentious Regency romance-type again. One of my favorite relaxing-reading sets of stories. I only wish the stories were longer--each only runs about 150 pages."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"In my opinion, Marion Chesney is the best of all regency authors.Her books aren't more sugary than treacle syrup, nor are theyever so proper like some regencies are. And best of all shedoesn't pull out every darn regency slang word that ever existedand put it all in one novel like some do. She educates about theRegency Era and at the same time amuses with her quirky humorand good romance between the hero and heroine.The Six Sisters is my favorite of her six book series and Minervais my favorite of all her 80 to 90 novels. (99% of which I haveread."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"I loved Minerva. But more than that, I love that Marion Chesney released her previously out of print Six Sisters Series to Kindle. What a treat! Every single character is fully developed. Yes, I took the bait and ordered one right after the other. Yes, all six. And believe me, when I finished the last one I was very sad that I would never again enjoy the exploits of Lady Goldolphin, The Vicar, and the entire catastrophic troupe of young ladies and their hysterical coming out parties in London. I'd never read much about the Regency period and generally hate romance novels. Oh, but these are so much more than that... So now, like a dutiful, serenely addicted nutcase, I'm off again with another Chesney series called Emily Goes to Exeter. What a great escape.

Minerva is the first of its series, and Chesney does a sparkling job of introducing prosing Minerva, her fox-hunting vicar father, the scandalous old malaprop Lady Godolphin and the rest of Minerva's sisters, each of whom have their own stories. Minerva, beautiful and a bit too full of holier-than-thou zeal, is taken down a peg or two by her beloved Lord Sylvester in delightful ways. Excellent villains plot her downfall and all ends happily when Sylvester saves the day."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"Cute, just as I remembered from reading it as a teen. Quick and easy read, good for vacation or after a more serious read."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"I have read several of the Agatha Raisin mysteries by M.C. Beaton and enjoyed them quite a bit. I stumbled across this series of books recently and realized they are written by the author, writing as Marion Chesney. Since I also discovered I enjoyed Georgette Heyer books, and they sounded similar I decided to give it a go.The book is relatively short, under 200 pages, and is the first in a series of six each highlighting the sisters of the Armitage family. The patriarch of this clan is the Reverend Charles Armitage who is a vicar that would prefer to spend his time hunting and breeding hounds rather than overseeing his flock. His wife is rendered helpless by her \\"spasms\\" so between these two, not much gets accomplished. Their oldest daughter, Minerva, steps up to handle most of the household duties as well as many of the duties that should be taken care of by the vicar. In addition to largely ignoring his duties to home and church, Reverend Armitage doesn't spend much time paying attention to his finances and finds himself unable to provide for the family in the way he would like. Rather than selling some of his hounds to pay expenses, he decides to send Minerva to London for the season in hopes she will snare a wealthy husband who will support her family.Once in London, things don't go as planned and Minerva finds herself the butt of a very mean wager and on the outs with society. Our hero bails her out of the social disaster she has created and rescues her from the seven men who have placed bets around winning her affections. Lady Godolphin is the relative that has agreed to present Minerva to society for the season and she turns out to be something other than what the family expected. Thrice-married, she is on the lookout for the next husband as well and is quite the character.A very enjoyable book, filled with humor and family struggles, it is definitely worth a read. If you have never read a Regency romance this would be a good place to start. A fish-out-of-water story that will keep you smiling as you turn the pages."},{"Title":"Minerva","review":"I have read many Regency novels, and I believe Minerva is my very favorite. I love the way Minerva comes to terms with the world around her while not embracing the way everyone else acts. I also enjoyed the interactions between Minerva and Comfrey, the hero of the tale.

I picked a campground based on this guide, and once again I was not disappointed! The site was the best one I've camped at yet--very private, beautiful, peaceful, quiet--just as described in the book. The guide rates the campgrounds based on beauty, security, spaciousness, and quiet--four very important factors to me. It also describes campground costs, facilities, area attractions, and gives directions. I like knowing what the site will be like--fire ring or fire grate, picnic table, graded tent pad, etc. All of this information contributes to a great camping experience without unpleasant surprises.This is the second great camping trip I've had thanks to Johnny Molloy. I also bought his guide to camping in the Smoky Mountains and was rewarded with another memorable vacation there.

After this I headed really high and went to Spruce Knob Lake, at 4,000 feet the highest campground in the entire guidebook. Oh, the weather was spectacular!

I remember the shady trees and cool springs that were a second home to me, my two sisters and young brother.Now that I have my own family complete with three young children ages 9,7 and 4 it is most important to me that they come to appreciate and respect the outdoors- especially W.V., where I spent so much time as a youth.Of course, I remember the old campsites that I long ago visited; but my wife and I decided to explore more of the camping scene in W.V. While in a local bookstore, I came upon this camping guide of West Virginia by Johnny Molloy. This little treasure has been a great guide in our quest to search out new sites to visit.This book is directly responsible for trips to Tomlinson Run (in the panhandle), Kanawah State Forest (near Charleston) and Bishop Knob (in the beautiful Monongahela National Forest). My wife and I hope to eventually visit all the camp sites in Mr. Molloy's book.When I mention to the kids that we are going on a camping trip, I can't quite help but notice the thoughts of coming adventures and fun in their eyes and smiles.

I own a food store and loved the easy to use and practical recipes. Great book!"},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I have tried for years to replicate the Artisan breads of Baltimore and Washington bakeries in my kitchen oven. Although the breads were fine tasting, they never had the tough, chewy, delicious crust of those breads I favored and bought as often as I could. Daniel Leader, author of Bread Alone, presents the &quot;secret&quot; of Artisan bread making. The first recipe I tried resulted in the crust and crumb I have tried for years to produce! Not only does Mr. Leader show the home baker, through step by step process of making Artisan bread, he laces his recipes with personal stories of his trips to France, learning from the French Boulangers and their sometimes personal stories. Not only is the book well worth it's recipes, it makes for enjoyable reading. This book goes beyond the recipes found in Baking with Julia, a very good book. Bread Alone shows step by step how to build the chef, the poolish and the slow fermentation of the dough to produce that wonderful tastey crust, so elusive in other books."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"The book has many good features, and I've made some great breads with it. But it is very annoying to run accross silly errors that a half way decent editor should have caught. The worst mistakes are in proportions, which are obviously very frustrating (particularly if you've spent money on the expensive flours Leader incorrectly suggests are crucial). Other reviewers are correct that the number of pages could have been drastically reduced. Frustrating is the fact that while there is an enormous amount of repetition, some important aspects are given only cursory treatment: e.g., how to form the loaves, how to make breads from straight dough. Also annoying is his suggestion that you reuse plastic wrap. The fixation on temperature is too much as well. When my house is warm, it's warm, and when it's cool it's cool, and the bread does fine in both, although it moves faster the warmer it is. My book fell apart very quickly, too."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Okay, I agree with some of the negatives pointed out by the other reviewers. The excruciating detail can become repetitive, we do not all have access to the exact ingredients, nor the patience to deal with the precise temperature requirements. That said, this book allowed me, an amateur, to make some amazing bread. I follow the instructions fairly closely, but use common sense where appropriate. I have not yet used a thermometer, and yet have produced some great regular and sourdough loaves, bagels, pitas, etc. What this book does is tell you the steps you need to follow, techniques to use (particularly kneading), how the dough should look and feel at different stages. This book provides everything you need to learn the basics of bread-making (except patience, of course)."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Absolutely sure fire book for baking artisan bread. Each section of the book has a core of recipes that followed will result in wonderful bread. The only thing you need to watch is the amount of flour that a recipe calls out. Depending on density it varies wildly, but to give him credit he does say to weigh it, but you need to experiment with the correct texture and feel. I have probably 10 books on breads, but this is the one I use and the one I can't live without.Also it has an absolutely surefire Pain de levain recipe with about 6 variations of the same recipe, and two of the best baguette recipes I have tried. No other recipe has given the results that this book does. The sourdough starter is sure fire also.If you want to learn how to bake good bread using only flour, water, salt, and starter/yeast this is it."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I discovered &quot;Bread Alone&quot; about five years ago and have been baking from it almost weekly over the period. I have greatly enjoyed creating breads using this book. My life has been made greater for the experience. However.....I agree with all the negatives so well discribed in other reviews. The 300 plus pages could be reduced to 50 with no loss of information. Many of the instructions are ambiguous,repetitious and confusing. There are mistakes. One specific example, pg 290 &quot;Rose Levy Jewish Rye&quot;. Omitted the addition of fluid for the &quot;Final Dough&quot;. The book should be edited."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"If you're interested in making serious artisan bread, this book gives you the basic essentials in terms of ingerdients, method and recipes. Other reviewers gripe about his level of detail but let's be honest. Anyone can make bread with yeast, all purpose flour and a couple of hours to spare. But this is not that kind of bread. Leader goes through the steps of what it takes to make great bread, and temperature (yes, 78 degrees) as well as proportion and timing are crucial in artisan sourdough breads. So if you want easy, this is not for you. Buy a bread machine. If you want a thorough run-down on what it takes to make great artisan breads, I can think of no better place to start. And the product is great. From here, however, I would proceed to Nancy Silverton's &quot;Breads from the La Brea Bakery.&quot; She makes Leader look like a simpleton in comparison."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I purchased this book because I had tried to bake bread in the past and the results were disapointing. I found this book extemely helpful and it has become my baking \\"Bible\\". I know it can sometimes be tedious, but if you try to follow the instructions as close as possible, the results are absolutely delicious! I have even started ordering organic stone ground flour and the flavor and texture of my bread has improved as the author said they would. Buy this book if you are serious about baking delicious bread."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Having worked with several other books on baking bread, I have to say that this book is among the most disappointing. I bought the hardcover edition, and within a few months it was falling apart, even though it was not heavily used. But there are other, more serious problems. In a section entitled &quot;Traditional&quot; breads, Mr. Leader includes recipes for breads he fully acknowledges are creations of his own whim. Throughout the section on &quot;levain&quot; (sourdough), he confuses in several recipes &quot;chef&quot; when he means &quot;starter&quot; and vice versa. And the instructions themselves for making the starter would have you mix the starter with a wooden spoon until it is the consistency of a &quot;stiff dough.&quot; A STIFF dough?! Any dough would be difficult to mix with a spoon, let alone a stiff one. Perhaps he means &quot;stiff batter?&quot; For the novice baker, this would be terribly frustrating. There are no illustrations, and the copious color photographs are not instructive, but rather pictures of his breads, and those of his French mentors' breads, in various poses. One photograph purports to show you what your batter should look like as your sponge develops; even here, it's not clear what you should learn from this. Better if there were illustrations or photos showing you how to knead, for example. Finally, I wonder what the motivation was to set out writing a book with a &quot;Master Recipe&quot; -- a great idea, in my opinion (think of Julia Child's books) -- and then repeat every last painful detail in every single recipes. And some of the recipes differ only in the size of the loaf!! I think the useful information in this book could have been reduced to a book about one-fourth its size, and it would be more useful, and cheaper, too."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Before buying this book, I'd not done much bread baking before. On the few occasions I had tried, invariably the results were lifeless white breads that seemed to have more in common with the flavor and texture of paste than bread. With Daniel Leader's book I learned the value of bread starters and slower fermentation. This lead to a marked improvement in the flavor and texture of my bread. (it also makes baking a lot more fun).My favorite discussion in the book is the description of the Levain and other wild yeast breads. The procedure for creating a starter in the book worked surprisingly well for me and the resulting bread is fantastic. I'm now an \\"avid\\" baker and my family and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment from the start I found in this book."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"An excellent book which will help everyone from the novice bread maker to the accomplished baker arrive at an excellent loaf. IMHO, some of the griping in other reviews on this site are unwarrented: my copy has held together just fine, thank you (1st ed, 3rd printing); I really appreciate the fact that the recipes are repetitive...I don't like to have to flip all through the book searching for each step's recipe...I enjoy the efficiency of having all the information in one place for each bread, even though it is repeated elsewhere; I find the book to be very clear on the difference between the various steps and &quot;starters&quot;.Bake and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I have read with dismay some of the negative reviews of this book. Why? I bought it years ago after having fallen in love with Bread Alone's breads. Could I make t hem myself? Book purchased in high hopes, but daunted by the several-page long recipes, I let the book sit on my shelf for several years, unused. I thought that recipes of several pages must be too complicated for a beginner, and that my life was too busy to stop, think, savor, take in what was being offered.It wasn't until I received a bread machine as a gift, tried a couple of loaves, and found that I wanted to try more challenging bread recipes in exchange for a better result, that I once again reached for Daniel Lederer's book and dusted it off.What then dawned on me about the book as I began to work with it is that the number of pages in the recipes made them not difficult, but rather thorough. As well as can be expressed from the page to the kitchen counter, Lederer tried to make it everything clear, so that it would be impossible for the baker to fail. I used the temperatures he provided for dough rising, and I used his instructions as to how to recognize when the dough was ready to punch down, and how to know I was done with kneading. Through carefully reading and following his instructions, I was able to improve dramatically the quality of the bread I was baking.After years of thinking it was \\"too hard,\\" now I am grateful for his attention to detail and care in translating what he does into something I could make.This book was written before the days of youtube and cooking videos. It is now possible to distill pages of recipes into well chosen video sequences and convey more quickly what took great attention to produce on the page. At the time the book was put together, there were far more limited means of conveying how bread making looks and feels.I have not made the recipes with the inaccuracies described; I wish the publisher would include a list of errata. The book is valuable enough to make it worthwhile for the publisher to have made corrections in future editions. The book well deserves to be enjoyed without distraction. Any issues reported to exist are finite and pale beside the contribution that this book represents.I do not wish for an editor to streamline the pages -- part of what makes the book unusual is the effort at precision and dedication to creating understanding.For people who just want a once-over-lightly bread book, this book is not for you. For people who like to make dishes over again and try to perfect them by honing a few details, or who are thrilled at the prospect of going down the path of mastering some of the points of artisanal bread making, I believe you have met a kindred spirit in the author of this book. Enjoy the journey. I believe my journey would have been far longer if I had persisted in pursuing books with telegraphic instructions, so-so recipes, and incompletely explained techniques.Some reviewers compare the book to other bread books that I have not read or worked from, so what I can say is that in comparison to the books I have borrowed or owned on bread baking, this book stands out."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Peter Rheinhart's books are also good, but if I had to have just one and only one book on artisan bread baking Bread Alone would be the one.

This is more than a book of recipes - recipes are really not that difficult to find - it is also about the passion of life, which has, without ourselves noticing, quickly but quietly turned into an obsession for quick tempo,profiteering, without a genuine understanding and appreciation of inner qualities. His attention paid to finding the best oven, organic wheats and slow fermention methods all related to bringing back the kind of breads which does not just look good, but which are genuinely good for health. And, for him, as a baker and owner of the shops, this is not just about a way to profiteer, but more to using human techniques and knowledge to turn the simplest and cheapest produce on earth into the best everyday food for the most people, even the not-so-wealthy ones. This is not just about the breads, but about the passion for life, substantial, earthly and without unnecessary sophistication. (the recipes are not that simple though.) This book is thus a sharing of the baker with the readers about his ways of looking at life as a baker, and letting us know also the passions of other bakers, and the persistent efforts putting into the soil by the organic farmers. In short, a book not just to function in the kitchen, but also one whose inspirations and thoughts you can share with the rest of the family."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Besides the proportion errors, some of the recipes are downright absurd.\\"Truly Tuscany Bread\\" on page 282 features a technique in which \\"italian bakers ferment this dough over a two day period\\" which will certainly affect the taste of the result. Unless you follow Leader's recipe.The recipe tells you to build a poolish with water, flour, and a pinch of dry yeast. Mix, cover, then refrigerate for 10-24 hours. Care to guess what happens in 24 hours? Nothing. Why? There's not enough yeast, there's no way to capture the airborne stuff in your fridge because it's covered, and it's too cold.The second poolish wastes more flour and time. Same thing, another pinch of yeast. Eight hours. Same result too.The second time, I humored this silly recipe and fermented the second poolish for SEVEN DAYS in my fridge in the hopes that maybe something was there. The bread sprung nicely, but the crumb was boringly uniform, dull-tasting, and lacking any sort of pleasure that makes bread worth eating.Making the bread? Don't bother autolyzing it- apparently, it's not important enough to put that into the recipe. Neither is it emphasized that the salt needs to go in first.In the end, you will get a dull-tasting, underfermented loaf of uniformly crumbed, unspectacular bread that manages to spread wasted time over 2 and a half days. And because of the attention that is devoted to temperature, you'll try the same recipes over and over again, thinking the temperature is some sort of magic fix for your dull bread.It'll help but it's not a miracle. You can't make good bread with a bad recipe. If you'd like more of the same, this is the book for you.Shaping loaves is badly covered here- there are no illustrations, not enough time is spent on it, and, worse, there are no instructions on how to shape some of the loaves pictured in that section.This book doesn't need an editor. It needs some gasoline and a few matches.Save your money and buy Raymond Calvel's book instead. Given the price, you'll need it :)"},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I have been baking bread for over 30 years, but have never found a helpful guide to approaching the fine , chewy, flavourful artisan loaf of the Europeans. I have devoured this book from cover to cover, and learned that bread baking is not just an art, but a science. I am now experimenting with time, temperature, weighing everything, and learning the patience of slower-paced bread making and its rich reward. I highly recommend this book to anyone on the quest for the perfect loaf."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"Learned how to make a good sour-dough bread and a marvelous hearth bread, but the level of detail is extreme and very boring. As a previous reviewer suggests, the detail could be cut at least by half or more and there are several mild contradictions and/or errors that would have been removed by an editor familiar with bread-making. After all, how many times must you be warned about spraying a hot oven light and the tiresome emphasis on adjusting temperatures to exactly 78 degrees? Also, the mechanical book construction is poor at best and careless by any standard. The book fell apart just from a few days of use."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"It's so sad to see such potential squandered for the sake of word count. If the authors had spent as much time on the accuracy of their writing as they do on the accuracy of the temperature and weight of their ingredients, this would have been perhaps one of the greatest bread books ever written. However, the combination of gross omissions, editorial blunders, and what I believe to be bad recipes is truly disappointing.Just a short taste of the mistakes I encountered:- time tables were inconsistent. One place in the recipe instructs allowing 2 hours for mixing the poolish, while another says it will take 24 hours.- a chapter on straight dough breads gives an alternative time table for mixing, kneading, and baking. It says that all the recipes in this chapter can be used with this method. However, there are no recipes at all in the chapter it mentions.- too much salt. I followed the instructions precisely, and didn't think a thing of adding a full tablespoon to the mix as suggested. The bread came out flat and so salty that it was inedible. I reduced the amount of salt by 1/2 and my loaves were much better.Please, don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I wrote one review after I read the whole book. But now, after owning other very famous books of bread and after gaining much experience now as a homebaker who bakes bread every other day, I must say this book is a must for the serious ones. Comparing the explanations of the ingredients and techniques, as well as that of the recipes of how to make complicated starters and sourdough with other books, this one is indeed the most detailed and easiest to follow. And, like other reviewers said, they make really high-quality breads which far excel those available in the market. Of course, like any skills which aim at excellence, the Bread Alone methods take a bit of time and patience to master."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I don't have quite the problem others do with the organization of the book -- while the recipe organization (repeating the full process over the course of 3-5 pages) definitely makes the book look excessively padded, consider that if you want to share a recipe, a looseleaf-like organization (similar, in fact, to my own binder of downloaded recipes) is far more convenient than many others. (Oops, did I just say that out loud?)What I don't like about this book is its irksome resemblance to Marlena Di Blasi's overly flowery Italian cookbooks and a level of dogmatism that makes me wonder if Leader has a political axe to grind in this whole thing akin to that of vegans and locavores. He is utterly obsessed with organic flours (a casual casting aside of a product like King Arthur Flour, a cult product almost legendary for its quality, could be taken by many bakers as a personal slight), without even the attempted justification ofThe Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book, and disturbingly his knowledge base of bread chemistry seems pretty much stuck at the Breadmaking 101 level, without the exhaustive data inquiry ofWing and ScottorBaking Illustrated, the fine emphasis on technique ofPeterReinhart, or the easygoing mastery ofTassajaraorThe King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion; in fact, Bread Alone in places comes off as little more than a lobotomized version ofNancy Silverton's Breads from the La Brea Bakeryat times. In fact, for reasons I'm completely unclear on, Leader almost completely avoids wheat sourdough breads other than the French pain au levain, which he shunts off to a completely different chapter.For all the romance he writes of, Leader comes off as rather incurious; while revelations such as a sourdough starter trapped in an ancient wooden bowl are certainly interesting, Leader doesn't come off as the sort of baker who does a great deal of digging, but someone who, once he understands the basics of something, stops and moves on. I've heard other reviews point out his ignorance on various basic subjects (at least one of which, to be fair, I haven't been able to track down in the book). Admittedly it's been 15 years since this came out and Leader's likely changed his attitude since, but until he rewrites Bread Alone from the ground up, it's not going to be worth buying new. Buy it as a remainder, or a used book, or go to the library, and then only if you see a recipe you need. But if you want to learn the mechanics of bread baking, try another book."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I loved the look and feel of this book. I read it and reread it before attempting the beginner recipe. Went and bought all equipment necessary mentioned in the book, bought the precise ingredients and then followed the recipe religiously. I just spent the last two days (for the second time) making this bread and to say the bread is disappointing is an understatement."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I love bread books and bake artisan breads several times a week. In my quest for \\"new\\" recipes, I am always on the lookout for another tome. I purchased this and was eager to try some of the recipes. I found that the dough produced by the recipes were a bit dry, resulting in lower volume loaves. This was easily remedied by adding more water than the recipe called for, but would have been somewhat difficult for a novice baker to gauge accurately. Further, Leader gives measurements only in cups/teaspoons, etc. or pounds and ounces. I've found that metric measurements are more accurate and result in better loaves; hopefully, any other printing of this book will include metric measurements. Maggie Glezer still has the best books out there for artisan baking."},{"Title":"Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands","review":"I have owned and used Daniel's &quot;Bread Alone&quot; for several years now and have been impressed with the positive change in my bread baking results.

The superb photographs complement quotes from some of the owners regarding what they think about their cottages: &quot;Living in a cottage is somewhat like living on a ship.

Also, the book's title suggests that this will be about cottages, in general, but it's about San Francisco area cottages.If you want cottage-style decorating, this is not the book for you.

It's about time someone has come up with a method that makes sense.Shuman and Twombly have developed and innovative method for measuring and managing the value in your business relationships. It sounds obvious at first however; their methodology shows you how to systematically work towards making each interaction a win-win situation.This method is of significant value for entrepreneurs. In today's economy start-ups are having a hard time obtaining funding. Everyone Is A Customer show how entrepreneurs can start-up a business with less money than one would expect.Business professionals will also receive value from this as the traditional way of doing business has died. More companies need to be customer focused and this can only be achieve by win-win relationships between your company's community and their customers.I highly recommend reading this book, as it will open your eyes to a different yet common sense way of doing business."},{"Title":"Everyone Is a Customer: A Proven Method for Measuring the Value of Every Relationship in the Era of Collaborative Business","review":"Two of the most celebrated teams were comprised of the animators at the Disney Studies who produced the first feature-length animated film (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and the team of physicists at Los Alamos who designed the first atomic bomb (dropped above Hiroshima and then Nagasaki). Most other teams receive no publicity although what they contribute is of great importance to their respective organizations. With the assistance of David Rottenberg, Jeffrey Shuman wrote The Rhythm of Business in which he asserts that each organization evolves in often unpredictable ways and to an extent takes on a life of its own. The challenge for decision-makers is to recognize that \\"rhythm\\" and then ensure that everyone involved is in \\"harmony\\" with it. Later, again assisted by Rottenberg, Shuman co-authored Collaborative Communities with Janice Twombley. In it, they correctly explain why and how communication, cooperation, and collaboration are essential to the effectiveness of teamwork. No news there. What differentiates their book from so many others is that they define \\"community\\" so as to include literally anyone who is directly and even indirectly associated with a given organization.In this volume, Shuman and Twombley develop in much greater depth several of the ideas which were introduced in the previous book. For example, they explain how and why an organization's effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration can nourish and indeed strengthen its relations with customers. In fact, according to them, literally anyone associated directly or even indirectly with that organization must be viewed -- and treated -- as a customer. Moreover, they introduce and then explain a proven method for measuring the value of every relationship, both within and beyond the organization.Shuman and Twombley carefully organize their material within three Parts: The Era of Collaborative Business, Purposeful Collaboration, and Choreographing Your Success. They agree with Drucker's admonition that \\"you increasingly have to think through what relationships make the most sense -- the customer is the most important relationship.\\" The challenge is to identify all customers, classify them according to the nature of their relationship with the given organization, and then determine with meticulous care their relative importance to the organization's own objectives. This is an on-going process, requiring both rigorous vigilance and absolute precision, because the relative value of customers can increase or diminish and do so suddenly and unexpectedly. Shuman and Twombley explain HOW to design, implement, and then monitor this process by guiding their reader through it (literally) step-by-step. Throughout the book, they also provide dozens of \\"Figures\\" which graphically support key points. For example, Figure 8.2 illustrates the \\"Relationship Scenario Matrix\\" whereas Figure 10.1 illustrates the \\"Purposeful Collaboration Process.\\" Shuman and Twombley are well aware of all the risks involved. They identify them and then suggest how to avoid them or at least minimize their impact on the value measurement process.Obviously I think highly of this book. I also have a healthy respect for the difficulty of applying Shuman and Twombley's ideas. My own rather experience suggests that most people do not fear change; rather, they fear the unknown. Hence the importance of effective communications and the even greater importance of getting everyone actively involved in the process, but only after they fully understand what the objectives are as well as why those objectives are important, not only to the organization but also to every individual within that organization. I also agree with Drucker about customer relationships while presuming to suggest that the value of those relationships is almost entirely dependent on those employees (or if you prefer, associates) within the organization who interact with customers.Near the end of the film Spartacus, the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier) and his slave master Lentulus Batiatus (played by Peter Ustinov) walk among the survivors of the defeated gladiator army looking for Spartacus. They are told that unless they identify him or his body, they will be crucified. One by one, they stand up proclaiming \\"I am Spartacus!\\" I recalled that scene as I finished reading this book. It is not enough merely to measure the value of customers. That value must also be sustained, preferably increased. When a corporation (let's call it OmniGlobal InternationaI) achieves both, every one of its people can proudly proclaim \\"I am OGI!\\"In fact, from a customer's perspective, anyone with whom she or he interacts in an organization IS that organization, for better or worse."},{"Title":"Everyone Is a Customer: A Proven Method for Measuring the Value of Every Relationship in the Era of Collaborative Business","review":"&quot;Everyone Is A Customer&quot;(2002) is a companion book to last year's &quot;Collaborative Communities&quot;(2001), which taken together, present a realistic roadmap for companies interested in changing with the times. They build on Peter Drucker's insight that when a business thinks through the relationships that make the most sense, it is the customer they should focus on to increase sales and profits. According to authors Jeffrey Shuman and Janice Twombly with David Rottenberg, This well written and insightful book, takes the reader step-by-step through an understanding of what it takes for a business owner to survive, innovate and prosper in the new era of collaborative business that relies so heavily on the networking of relationships to succeed.The authors urge business owners to recognize the natural process of change that takes place once a business is started, resulting in the unforseen development of new products,new service, and new customers. They call this process the &quot;rhythm of business.&quot; For companies and business owners interested in better understanding the expectations of their customres and what it takes to succeed in today's economy, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Network Administration Training Kit","review":"Certainly not as well composed as the Windows 95 Training Kit.

There are many characters in the movies with very little in the form of background and that has spawned a large number of books that serve to give them a history. Some of the books describe future events in their lives. The character of bounty hunter Boba Fett was introduced in episode 5 and died in episode 6 and the young Boba appeared with his father Jango Fett in episode 2.This comic is a description of two of the jobs that Jango takes. In both of them his path crosses that of Zam Wesell, a female bounty hunter that is his equal in capability. The primary story has Jango being hired by a mysterious employer that keeps his identity secret. An ancient religious artifact has supposedly been stolen from the employer's art collection and Jango is hired to retrieve it.The quest takes him to a planet that once had a thriving technology but now is being overgrown by the jungle. Jango has a battle with the thief, has a face-off with Zam and then decides to help her when a powerful creature captures her. They have a brief semi-romantic moment and the story ends with Jango once again holding his beloved son in his arms.One of the best aspects of the Jango Fett character is the combination of the brutal, killing mercenary with the loving and loyal father. Those traits are both exhibited in this story, making it very clear that no one is all bad, not even the most ruthless bounty hunters. There is also the potential for future romance between Jango and Zam, a storyline that I would like to see further developed."},{"Title":"Star Wars: Jango Fett","review":"Jango Fett. Mandalorian Warrior. Bounty Hunter. Flirt. Father.This relatively brief comic gives us a glimpse of the Jango Fett that flitted across the screen in \\"Attack of the Clones\\". We see his tenderness for his son, Boba Fett, his regret at having to leave for assignments, and his desire to stay with his son, but also the struggle to provide for his son.We see how he takes assignments, how intimidating he is to those around him, how he is willing to take any job for just the right credits.We see how he knows Zam Wesell, how he flirts with her, and the tip of the iceberg of their convoluted relationship.This story does have a few swear words, some sexual attire and innuendos (particuarly between Zam and Jango), and quite a bit of violence (as one could expect from two bounty hunters). On the whole, I would rate it rather tame in all three departments.Overall, the comic is pretty interesting. The story is a little bland--Jango must retrieve an artifact--and the drawings are a little strange, but there was something about them that was quite interesting. 4.5 stars, unfortunately rounded down to 4.Brought to you by*C.S.

It's also cheaper ($5.95), encouraging you to buy both.This is a prety good story so I'm going to have to buy the other one now. The artwork is like story boards for the movie production department.

This book, simply titled \\"Jango Fett,\\" attempts to fill in some blanks.But for those of us who saw the movies, \\"Jango\\" doesn't tell us much we didn't already know. The bounty hunter is ruthless and efficient on the job; he's a caring father when he's home and in the company of young Boba.In this story, an assassination goes awry when Jango runs afoul of competing bounty hunter Zam Wesell, whose own appearance in the movies was shortlived. Needing funds, Jango accepts another job to retrieve an object, and he shows no mercy in its capture. Of course, Zam has a tendency to show up at the most crucial moments in Jango's life.The flirtation between the two hunters is awkward at best, although the few father-son moments between Jango and Boba are nicely handled. The story is fairly dull, however, and does little to endear me to the characters.

Open Seasons provides a pretty effective origin story for Jango. It's essentially a revenge tale. Jango hunts down Death Watch leader Vizsla, the man who killed his family and mentor. Moreover, the story provides more depth to Count Dooku's character as we see his disillusionment with the Jedi during a mission against the Mandalorians. In the end, of course, Dooku hires Jango to become the clone trooper template.The art in the comic is on the border between cartoonish and realistic. It works pretty well at conveying the gruffness of the Mandalorians. Hayden Blackman writes the dialogue crisply and created a compelling plot that interweaves several periods in Jango's life. The only part that bothered me is Vizsla's uncanny ability to escape death. He always seems to escape. It made me wonder why Dooku hadn't recruited him instead.Overall, this is essentially reading for fans of Mandalorians and Jango Fett."},{"Title":"Star Wars: Jango Fett","review":"Order this along with the Zam Wessel book for my 10 year old.

I could not put these novels down and am searching for the subsequent installments as they have not been released in the US. Ravin eviscerates his characters' vain pretensions while making readers fall in love with their flaws. As the novels progress humanity bumps its head on the creaky half-timbered buildings of the British(Christian) Empire and lots of people get bruised. Wonderful, gossipy, erotic as well as thought-provoking page-turners. I can't really give enough praise. The only other recent fiction that I liked this much was Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy."},{"Title":"Friends in low places","review":"At the time of this book's appearance in the 60's I heard Simon Raven described as wicked or naughty or that kind of thing, and indeed even 10 years or so ago I read a notice in a publication that I think highly of that still talked of enjoying some louche and overripe ambience in his writing. Am I just unshockable (I very much doubt that), or has the literary bar for naughtiness and wickedness been raised a long way in the last 40-odd years? I am in little doubt which it is.In my own opinion, Friends in Low Places is a very enjoyable and very readable novel. The author seems to me perfectly clear in his mind what sort of story he wants to write, and perfectly consistent in the way he goes about it. It is a fictionalised study of a certain English social class at a particular period of recent history. The class is Macmillan's Tory party, and the time is immediately following the Suez debacle, this latter chosen not so much for its political significance as because it fits the overall narrative very conveniently. What we are invited to behold is the English ruling elite behaving with casual and insouciant ruthlessness, still oblivious to any likely threat to their hold on power. They make a good story, and I absolve Raven totally of anything so tawdry and unsophisticated as attempting to \`lift the lid' on the world that his actors inhabit. He depicts it all as a blas&eacute; insider would, and he never seems shocked for the very good and simple reason that nothing that happens is really all that shocking. Are you shaken to the core of your being when a Tory selection committee is controlled in practice by two or three grandees who choose the more unpleasant and less honest of the candidates? You would more likely be startled if they were represented as doing the opposite. Likewise the sexual aspects of the narrative are not so much tame as nearly non-existent, passing references to background issues rather than integral to the plot. Will you be horrified to read about a hard-up and exploitative gigolo? Hardly, and in fact even this theme is much more financial than erotic in its emphasis. As for the apparent dynamite contained in a letter revealing dark secrets in the conduct of senior cabinet ministers in relation to Suez, we are not given details but if we had been they would probably be small beer in comparison with the organised deception and chicanery we have got used to nowadays.In general, expect another tale of the lifestyle of the wealthy, a kind of British equivalent of Dallas in a sense, although told with elegance, skill and not a little dry humour. Insofar as the story has dated, that is because the mise-en-scene has dated. By the time Friends in Low Places was even published the government was already Labour. The Tory party returned to power first under Heath and later under Thatcher, but in a very downmarket reincarnation. How much period charm other readers may find in this book I am simply in no position to say. What I will say is that, within its own terms of reference, this tale is engaging and inventive. I can't imagine this society returning in the form we find it here.

The characters in this smaller novel of Mulish show traces of the themes Mulish uses throughout his organic oeuvre. The plot is mesmerizing as it unwinds and gives us insight into the lives of ordinary people that struggle with coming to terms with what counts in their lives; namely love and their loved ones. It also serves as an example of how same-sex love is nothing out of the ordinary, and even though this might now seem somewhat outdated (the book was published early 1970s) for the Netherlands at least, this only proves that through such book as Mulishes we have established something of a more normal outlook on love in all its forms."},{"Title":"Two Women","review":"As an expatriate living in The Netherlands, I've read a number of Mulisch's books. It's part of the naturalization process. Until now I've been either unimpressed or disliked them all. Anti-climatic and forced come to mind. \\"Two Women\\", however, redeemed Mulisch for me. I stayed up the entire night reading it. I was breathless.It is my intention to read it again today. It is a book I feel compelled to study.I read the book in Dutch and thus I can't vouch for the English translation. In Dutch it is stunning. Poignant. It speaks of the landscape and the culture and the language in a way that few other Dutch classics do."},{"Title":"Two Women","review":"Unbelievable that this book was written 30 years ago and that it was written by a man...A beautiful, unadorned love story of the relationship between 2 women, Laura and Sylvia. The narrator, Laura, is on her way to Nice (France), where her mother has died. Meanwhile she recounts the events of the past half year. Out of the blue she fell in love with the much younger Sylvia. For both of them this is their first experience with lesbian love, but everything seems to go pretty normal. Except that it becomes more and more apparent that Sylvia has huge problems communicating and in the end this leads to her fall.A book that is absolutely worthwhile to read, a classic of Dutch literature."},{"Title":"Two Women","review":"this book is as if someone has punched you in the gut. i think the end wasn't revealed until it was the end, which is always good. i read this book in german, which may have caused me to miss a couple things, but it was very good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Two Women","review":"I think the author of this book is over-valued.

But it's to repetive and to much of a soap story, unreal. Maybe Mulisch wants it that way, binding the links to Orpheus and Oidipus. It's not a gay memmoar that it's \\"though being a lesbian\\" but instead (the story) lends to the extreme, in the relations, in the happenings aso. - it is just to perfect - one doesn't get the real bad smell of the ordinary day love, it just crash boom bang, wow, can you do that again! She shaves of all her hair, the car that drives by her crashes...after a while nothing surprises you anymore and one just waits for the final bang.Worth reading but my heart is not bleeding!"},{"Title":"West of the Pecos","review":"This book is definately worth buying. It is my favorite book because when you read a romance you usually expect as follows: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl falls in love with boy, they live happily ever after or die. Zane Grey throws an unusual twist into the usual romance storyline. The &quot;boy&quot;, Pecos Smith, thinks the &quot;girl&quot;, Terril Lambeth, is a boy. Pecos thinks of Terril as a little brother, where as; Terril thinks of Pecos as handsome man. Zane Grey captures a strange yet amazingly tender romance that could only happen West of the Pecos."},{"Title":"West of the Pecos","review":"Zane Grey was a \\"formula\\" writer, and he was the one who created the \\"formula\\", the modern western novel. And he used the same plot devices in many of his books. This one uses the girl pretending to be a boy scheme to protect the innocent young girl from being treated harshly by the other drovers. Terrill Lambeth is now an orphan, her father having died, and her adventures are the basis of this story. The fact she can ride and shoot doesn't hurt, but before long, Pecos Smith, the hard riding, fast shooting \\"man\\" of the bunch discovers he is a she. And you can probably already imagine the scenarios that follow. This is a \\"traditional\\" western, the kind one associates with Zane Grey; it has the broad use of language and the vivid descriptions of the locale he is known for. It is a book well worth reading, and more than once."},{"Title":"GARTERS (HARDCOVER)","review":"I can always count on Pamela Morsi to write a good-hearted story about everyday people who make me laugh and GARTERS is no exceptionEsme (short for Esmerelda!) Crabb is the practical one in her family. Her beautiful twin sisters are a little light in the brains department and her dad is kind-hearted but the laziest man in the county, so the burden of providing for her family is entirely hers. Determined to make a better life for her and her useless loved-ones she concocts a plan to make the richest man in town marry her.Esme's not a beauty, nor is she refined, being brought up in the &quot;hills&quot; so she has to use her brains to snare Cleavis Rye's attention. He's the town store-keeper and is one of the best educated men in the land and she figures when he realizes how practical marrying up with her is he'd have to be crazy not to just jump at the chance. So she follows him around a like a puppy and insinuates her way into his life and before he knows what is happening she's working in his store, flashing her legs at him, driving him insane and ruining his reputation!This book was fun, fun, fun! I so enjoyed watching the practical Esme lose all common sense when trying to catch herself a man. She's blunt, honest and funny and I was rooting for her all the way. It was also amusing to see the prissy talking and sometimes snobby Cleavis lighten up, get all hot and bothered and lose his heart to the most unlikely woman possible. His nickname for the heroine &quot;Hillbaby&quot; drove me nuts but you can't have everything, can you? There are no bad guys in GARTERS because Morsi has a gift that manages to turn even the most unlikable character into a real person (Cleavis's Mom comes to mind, as do the twins shifty suitor). Her books always remain centered on her characters growing love, never getting lost or bogged down with intrigue and action. And did I forget to mention the incredible sensual tension?! Whew, this one had plenty of it. It's the perfect book to brighten up a dank, rainy day or any day for that matter."},{"Title":"GARTERS (HARDCOVER)","review":"This is my first Pamela Morsi book and I bought it because of the reviews of other readers. Let me just say that they did a great job reviewing this book; so basically, I'm not going to say too much more.Esme (short for Esmerelda) Crabb is the practical one in her family. Her beautiful twin sisters are man-crazy flirts and her dad is kind-hearted but the laziest man in the county. Unfortunately, everyone in town knows this and they also know that Esme is the only hard worker of the bunch, so she gets a double-heap of pity (one for being a Crabb, the other for having supporting her Pa and sisters alone). Thing is, Esme is tired of nearly starving in their mountain cave during the winter and realizes that, unless she wants to work herself into an early grave as her mother did, she has to marry and marry well. She sets her sights on Cleavis Rhy, the town storekeeper, because he has a big, fine white house that only he and his mother live in. She decides that is perfect for her family and she will marry him.Esme's not a beauty, nor is she educated or \\"genteel\\", being brought up in the \\"hills,\\" so she has to use her brains to snare Cleavis's attention. Since he was educated in the city and is a real \\"gentleman\\" she assumes that she will have to be practical and highlight her best attributes (hard-working, willing to sacrifice, willing to be a helpmeet, etc) in order to catch him. So she simply walks up to him and says, \\"You wanna marry me?\\" This is the beginning of the most hilarious love story I've read in a long time. Esme follows him, worms her way into his life and starts driving him insane and ruining his reputation by working in his store and flashing her legs at him! Did I mention and Cleavis was supposed to be courting the minister's daughter???This book was fun and funny! I really enjoyed watching practical Esme lose all common sense when trying to catch a man. I also thought it was realistic when she started feeling as if she wasn't good enough for Cleavis and wondering how to be the lady that she thought he needed. But Esme is blunt, honest and funny and I loved her. It was interesting to watch Cleavis open up to her and start talking about memories that transformed him from a smalltown hillboy to the prissy talking, snob that he was a the beginning of the novel.There are no bad guys in GARTERS because Morsi has a gift of portraying real people, all their foibles and prejudices intact. Other reviewers weren't that pleased with Cleavis's Mom and Armon Hightower (the guy dating Esme's twin sisters), but I could see them as real people. Overall, I give this book five stars because it deserves five stars. It was written in 1992, so unlike most of the novels that have come out recently, the book isn't merely sex scenes for the second half. There is steam and heat, but also true plot and resolution. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"GARTERS (HARDCOVER)","review":"Esme Crabb is dirt poor and lives in the mountains with her lazy father and two beautiful (but dumb) twin sisters.

Esme is not *really* manipulative, just desperate. She is warm, fun, earthy, and just what Cleav needs!Cleavis is the storekeeper and the richest man in town. On the surface, he is the perfect gentleman: polite, smartly dressed, upright, and uptight. Esme's first words to him, &quot;You wanna marry me?&quot;, startle him. She distracts him with her forwardness and tempts him by constantly flipping up her skirts to adjust her sagging stockings.

Her father does not work... he doesnt do anyhting for that matter, except being the laziest man on earth. And her 2 older twin sisters do not help her at all and the only thing that fills their brains besides attractive men is air!Esme is in charge of her whole family, from feeding and clothing to keeping that little cave (yes indees cave) that they live in as clean as humanly possible.She's tired of the life she's leading and decides that the best way to get out of a dead end life she and her family have is by marrying someone with money... and who would be a better candidate than Cleav? He's still young, hardworking, handsome and owns a house that is could fit an small army but is only lived by him and his mother.So she ventures down the mountain to gain the affection of Cleav. Little did she know that the minute she would be eye to eye with those beautiful pale blue eyes (that she now sees in a whole new light) she would actually notice that he is a beautiful man.Soon she stciks to him like glue and follows him everywhere, just so he doesnt get a chance to forget she exists, but what started as something practical, has now turned into something more powerful for both of them, but particularly for Esme. Now she really wants to be his wife and would do anything in her power to get him for herself.Cleav and Esme make a great couple. He's at first so reluctant to marry her, but he cant stop thinking about those legs of hers wrapped around his waist (talk about steamy!) and Esme wants nothing but to be the perfect wife for him.Their romance is so beautiful and so real. Before she realizes that her feelings for him are love she is really selfish and protective of him, but once those feelings beging to evolve and she finally realizes that she feels a tremendous amount of love for him she leaves her selfishness and even humbles herself in order to make the perfect wife for him, to make him love her, to not humiliate him.The story is really really sweet and the characters are a blast.

The authors cover most aspects of plant care, from basic watering and lighting to reproduction and pest control to extensive entries on houseplant varieties. Every plant entry seems unique, breaking from the dull template of information that the more encyclopedia-like plant books have. This engaging style is a strength of the book, but it is also a weakness because the style lends itself to inconsistency. For example, the entry on Saintpaulias (African Violets) specifies the height at which artificial lights should be placed above the plants, but many of the other entries do not give such information. Another complaint is that the secondary plant list in the back does not feature a photograph of every plant. For the price I paid, I would have willingly give up a few of the extra photos in the front if it would result in a more comprehensive photo collection in the back. Identifying p! lants without pictures is very difficult. Nonetheless, no plant book is perfect, and this one comes very close.

That book gives info on each plant from the direct knowledge of the authors and as a result has proved to be the best tropical houseplant book bar none, thus far. They give personal observations, recommendations, etc. Whereas 19 out of 20 such books have the usual set of short paragraphs with pedestrian info (i.e. dimensions, temperatures, light requirements, etc.). The Elberts also cover a goodly number of varieties and cultivars one is likely to encounter.This present volume, dated 1997, is far better than the Readers' Digest edition of 2006, in that the photos are illustrative of the plant, and not illustrative of the artistic prowess of the photographer. It is also better in the text with at least some inkling that real people are writing about the species from their own experience.There is alot of extra stuff on indoor plants that I didn't need, but that occurs in all of these kinds of books. The question is how sophisticated it is. Here it is not sophisticated. I do like the use of double-page treatments of some of the more popular types; tons of info and good illustrations of everything: flowers, leaves, unhealthy leaves, varieties, and so forth.I have given this book 4 stars for these reasons. In fact I might even buy a copy given how cheap they are.

This book contained a brief biography of St. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), comments about Loyola's succesors, the curricula of the Jesuit colleges, a brief history this religious order,and the organization of The Society of Jesus or the Jesuits.Father Hughes began this book with a summary of Loyola's life. Loyola began his career as \\"an officer and a gentleman\\" until he was serious wounded. He had a fractured leg which required physicians to rebreak and reset his leg which obviously ended his military career. If such a concept exists as one who is divinely inspired, Loyola fit this description very well. During his recovery period, he made a decision to enter religious life and perhaps start a religious order. As an adult, he sat with elementary students to learn Latin and the Classics whereby his teachers showed leniency and let him graduate. Loyola then went to Paris, France only to discovery that his learning was inadequet, and again attended lower education classes. However, this time Loyola \\"learned his lessons\\" well and became a scholar. According to Father Hughes, Loyola attracted a following of other students who swore themselves to form a new Catholic Religious Order in 1534. After facing and successfully defending themselves against charges of heresy, Loyola and his followers were formally recognized by Pope Paul III (1534-1549)who recognized religous devotion and dedication.According to Father Hughes, Loyola and his Jesuits did not originally plan to participate in the Catholic Counter Reformation. Loyola & co. wanted to convert the Moslems, especially the Turks, to the Catholic Faith. However, diplomacy and war prevented this endeavor. As a result, Loyola & co. decided to work in Europe, the Americas and Asia where they were unbelieveably successful in recovery of Protestant areas of Europe and establish missions and schools in European and non-European areas.Loyola prescirbed a very rigorous formation for novices. This included demonstrations of virtue, dedication to learning, and a serious commitment to teaching and learning. The Jesuits did not cater to the European nobility and wealthy. Nor did they refuse admission to those who came from poor families. The Jesuits required dedication and a serious approach to teaching and learning and dismissed those novices who refused to demonstrate such characteristics. The Jesuits had two basic catagories of leaning achievement. One was called mediocrity whereby the student learned what was taught. The other catagory was Master which meant that the student not only learned what was taught but enchanced his studies and defended them effectively in debate and disputation.The ranking of students and masters was carefully arranged. Students began their studies by studying the Belles Lettres or learning of the Great Books, good literature, clear/concise writing style, etc. Once these studies were completed, students then studied philosophy which included not only philosophy but mathematics and physics. Father Hughes wrote that the Jesuits stipulated that before one could teach, he had to master the academic discipline he was to teach. The Jesuits actually took bona fide teaching serious. Students had to have a thorough knowledge of what they they taught. Unlike modern \\"teaching,\\" Jesuit teachers had to very learned in what they taught. The Jesuits had no place for \\"teaching\\" gimmicks, cheap literature, childish entertainment, etc.After Loyola died in 1556, his Order and detailed academic curricula sucessfully continued. For example, Father Aquaviva, S.J. (1543-1615)continued the Jesuit tradidtion as envisioned by Loyola. By the end of the 17th. century (the 1600s), Jesuit houses and colleges could be found in almost every area in Europe, parts of the Americans, and Asia. Jesuit teachers were highly respected by both Catholics and Protestants. Father Hughes stated that Dutch Protestants would do all they could to get their sons into Jesuit colleges and pay exhorident legal fines for having their sons in Jesuit schools. These Dutch Protestants often fabricated thier sons' names to get them into Jesuit colleges.Father Hughes also wrote briefly about the suppression of the Jesuits which lasted from about 1750 to 1773. Yet, Catherine II (1762-1796), also known as Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick II (1740-1780)of German Prussia refused to comply with what is know among Jesuit circles as The Suppresion. Even though Catherine and Frederick were not Catholic, they knew very well just how good Jesuit teachers were. The Suppression started to abate in 1773 and was not completed until 1814. The Jesuits resumed their rightful place in European learning with as much success as prior to the Suppression.Father Hughes gave a brief description of the results of the Suppression. Costs for colleges rose dramtically. The results of teaching and learning declined drastically, and Euopean intellectual life suffered because of the Suppression. Yet, the Jesuits continued to thrive where they were not suppressed and persecuted.Had this book been written later, Father Hughes could have included the fact that 35 moon craters are named after Jesuit mathematicians. Father Hughes could have included Father Lemaitre, S.J. (1894-1966)who developed complex mathematics about an acceleating expanding universe. When Albert Einstein(1879-1955) first studied Father Lemaitre's work, Einstein stated that the work showed brilliant mathematics but bad science. However, when Hubble (1889-1953)proved the concept of an accelerating universe (The Big Bang Theory), Einstein had the grace to agree with Father Lemaitre's work.St. Ignatius Loyola made the quote \\"Virtue unlearned is virtue unarmed.\\" His emphasis on bona fide teaching and learning was inspired by the meaning of this quote. Gilbert Higet who was not a Jesuit nor a Catholic made the comment in his book titled THE ART OF TEACHING that whatever criticisms were made against the Jesuits, bad teaching was not one of them."},{"Title":"The Cure","review":"Restore Tabs are taking the nation by storm.

Shobin is a master at getting the most out of his characters. For anyone who likes medical thrillers, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Cure","review":"See story summary above.I thought this was a very enjoyable medical thriller. It reads similar to a Robin Cook novel. The backbone of the novel is about herbal supplements. Good or Bad? You decide. Though an average medical thriller, it will educate you at the same time it entertains you. Both emotional and suspenseful, it will definitely keep you intrigued.Recommended for the lover of medical thrillers."},{"Title":"The Cure","review":"Seems no one cared to review for a couple years. This author is new to me and my opinion of this book does not match the other reviews. I found it hard to buy the events in this story. The gulliblity of Steve was just too much. I could hardly finish the story. Why did it take him so long and need for eavesdropping equipment to realize his lover's involvement. I'm sorry but I'll take Robin Cook's thrillers any day."},{"Title":"The Cure","review":"I only finished this book to see if the Indonesian cop accomplished his goals. His story was interesting and enjoyable. As for the rest of this book, not so much.Our main character is a pathetic man named Steve. He's got daddy problems, a drinking problem, problems with patients, issues with commitment to his family life that lead to a divorce, a fat unlikable daughter, an office staff that does all of his hard work for him, poor taste in women, is gullible to an extreme, and is just unlikable overall.The protagonists are from central casting. The Muscle, at the beginning of the book was an ex-Marine, who by the second half, was ex-Army. The Femme Fatal was a rotten actress, and the evil scientist was a non-entity.By the time I got to the end and the Good Doctor snows someone, I was ready to throw up. What a loser. But, he's had very questionable ethics since the start, as he hocks nutritional supplements to his own patients, because he's needs the extra money.Oh, and \\"The Cure\\"? It's only taken by the dumbest, most entitled, bull headed American women on earth, who can't read package inserts or directions on medicine bottles. Their selfishness gets them into trouble. Also, it's an excuse for the author to talk constantly about heavy vaginal bleeding. Lovely.Go Indonesian cop! The whole book should have been about him."},{"Title":"The Palace of the White Skunks: A Novel","review":"In this, the second book of five about revolutionary Cuba, Arenas brings us into the city to continue on the life of Fortunato, the boy narrator introduced in Singing from the Well. Fortunato is older now, and the narrative reflects this maturity by following a more chronological format. But his torment, misery and anger is no less. Always in the background is the gunfire of the reveloution which captivates Fortunato and eventually ensnares him.While less difficult than Singing from the Well, The Palace of the White Skunks is still no easy read. Yet both books are extraordinary. Anyone interested in reading Latin American authors must include Arenas."},{"Title":"The Palace of the White Skunks: A Novel","review":"I haven't read all five of Reinaldo Arenas' Pentagonia, of which this is the second book, so I have to treat this as a standalone novel. What a novel it is, though! The story concerns itself mainly with the teenage protagonist (Fortunato) who is slowly but inexorably driven to utter desperation by the totally banal evil of everyday life: poverty, hopelessness, the frankly loathsome behavior of a family member. When the other characters in this tale receive treatment, they turn out to be as desperate, unsatisfied, or as crazy as humanly possible. The overwhelming atmosphere in the book can be easily described: no way out. No hope. No future. Eventually the food runs out for the poor family, and Fortunato decides to take his chance with the rebels that have recently popped up in Batista's Cuba. Like everything else in the hero's life, it doesn't work out...Brief passages interspersed in the narrative take us back to examine the life of Fortunato's grandfather, who's in large part responsible for the misery of the family (or at least as I see it). Driven by unbelievable desperation, capable of murder, Fortunato's grandfather is also easily duped, taken advantage of by smooth talkers, and takes out every frustration on his wife and his progeny (all disappointingly daughters). The fearsome back story provides us with all we need to know about the family's situation...Arenas liberally uses magic realism to communicate the fraying sanities, the absolute wit's end, of the characters. The ghosts of Fortunato's dead cousins appear, speak amongst themselves, and drop hints about his fate. I felt this only contributed to the atmosphere of insanity, of the final destruction of the human being. In short, this is a masterpiece, but don't expect to be uplifted."},{"Title":"Beneath the surface: A journal of life & love during the great copper strike of 1913","review":"I grew up in this area so I found the history along with the love story in this book very interesting. Even if you didn't grow up in the area I think this is a fun quick read."},{"Title":"The Mystified Magistrate: And Other Tales","review":"This was an excellent collection of some of De Sade's shorter works. The stories are quite funny and nice for a lite reading of Sade. I highly recommend this to those who dare not venture into some of his other more explicit works, but also to those who are looking to round out their Sade readings.If you like this, or if you found it too mild, i highly recommend the 120 Days of Sodom and Justine, both fantastic books."},{"Title":"Expository Sermons on Revelation (five volumes in one)","review":"I read the Bible through and then start again. This time I began with the &quot;Expository Sermons on Revelation&quot;. one chapter at a time, one day at a time. Even though I do agree with his stand on these chapters, I have had the most wonderful spiritual blessings reading along day by day what the Christian can expect to transpire. It has really made a difference in my life, actually, and am visiting my son and his family in May and will give them this book to read with my blessings. Dr. Criswell,in my opinion, is a mighty man of God."},{"Title":"Expository Sermons on Revelation (five volumes in one)","review":"Most sermon books cannot be read smoothly from one chapter to the next. In these messages, the reader can smoothly transition from chapter to chapter. Because this is a sermon book, some points are repeated because there are different messages covering the same Scriptures. However, in true Criswell style you will not grow weary reading two messages about the same exact Scriptures. This is a great book for the reader who wants to read it straight through and it is also a great book for the person who wants to study it as a resource book."},{"Title":"Expository Sermons on Revelation (five volumes in one)","review":"The text consists of material from sermons and,therefore, has quite a bit of repetitive material.It is very complete, though, and serves as anexcellent exposition for anyone needing commentaryon the Book of Revelation. In almost all cases,the author takes the fundamentalist view. He isalso of the futurist school. These two positionsagree with my leanings, so they were not a problemfor me. Others, though, may want to take his stand into consideration before purchasing the book. I would recommend it as a reference, but perhaps would not as general reading since itis quite large and (as I have mentioned) somewhatrepetitive."},{"Title":"Doing Democracy: The MAP Model for Organizing Social Movements","review":"This book is both a strategic orientation to, and a tactical primer on, how to develop and manage non-violent social movements at the grassroots or &quot;people power&quot; level.The reason this book is important is because it solves the most important problem or gap facing all social movements: the lack of strategic models and methods that help activists understand, plan, conduct, and evaluate their social movements. I have read this book from cover to cover and it fulfills the objective. Had Howard Dean and Joe Trippi read this book six months ago, they would not have blown the lead and come in a sorry fourth (less than half of what Kerry had, less than a quarter Kerry and Edwards combined), to guys that did *not* figure out MoveOn.org and the Internet as a collective consciousness tool.This is among the most heavily marked up books I have read in the past four years, and instead of summarizing it in detail, which may cause some of you to avoid buying it, I will simply endorse the primary author's view that social movements are needed now more than ever, for the simple reason that the powerholders are making life on the planet unsustainable--everything they do (think Dick Cheney here) to increase profits, control, and power, is also &quot;increasing unemployment, the gap between rich and poor, violence, ecological collapse, and unsustainability&quot;.There are four aspects of the book that are especially valuable as we all find ourselves in a &quot;world war&quot; between fundamentalist groups (both Islamic and extremist Americans of the religious right falling prey to neo-conservative doctrine) and progressive individuals seeking the common good:1) the author's focus on sub-movements, on creating a strategic campaign that specifically embraces each sub-movement as a distinct but coordinated element, is the &quot;aha&quot; factor in leaping forward.2) the author's specific discussion of negative rebels and how much harm they can do to the larger movement is compelling, to the point of actually suggesting that we need to create a counterintelligence service within social movements to address this. The few violent protesters in Seattle got all the media coverage, and the non-violent mass lost a great deal of credit.3) the eight-stages of social movements are extremely detailed and the case studies help to explain why the &quot;slump&quot; must be overcome in the fifth stage, when success has been achieved but there is a perception of failure.4) the importance of having an economic strategy for where the social movement's vision needs to go, is not understood by most presidential candidates. This book is valuable to anyone who would be president, or senator, for it explains not only how to organize and lead a social movement, but how to govern resources to its desired ends after the fact of victory. Real world budgeting is a neglected aspect of leadership during the electoral process.I would say that this book (together with Tom Atlee's &quot;The Tao of Democracy: Using CO-INTELLIGENCE to create a world that works for all&quot;), is core reading for anyone interested in saving his or her neighborhood, his or her country, or the world at large. The primary and secondary authors are also to be commended for making the point that it is possible to be effective *regardless of who is President or what party is in charge in the capitol*--they emphasize local grass-roots effectiveness that is non-partisan.Juliette Beck and Nancy Gregory make contributions that should have been acknowledged on the cover. Juliette Beck especially, with her focus on globalization and the sub-movements and stages of the aggregate movement, provides a most satisfactory case study that concludes the book."},{"Title":"Doing Democracy: The MAP Model for Organizing Social Movements","review":"If you want to make the world a better place, buy this book.Based on his years of experience, Bill Moyer knows how to design effective nonviolent social change movements that can challenge entrenched power, overcome resistance, and implement positive alternatives. Moyer explains how grassroots democracy really works and shows how to build powerful change movements that uphold widely held values like honesty, democracy, fairness, compassion, and protection of the envionment. He also shows how conventional politics meshes with grassroots organizing.The section on how Moyer's ideas fit in with the sociology and polictical science literature is easy to read and interesting. The current scholarly literature on social change movements is quite meager and Moyer's model makes a big contribution to change theory.Finally, the examples at the end of the book are enlightening and heartening.Read this book and then go out and make the world better!"},{"Title":"Doing Democracy: The MAP Model for Organizing Social Movements","review":"As a long time activist in drug policy reform and criminal justice reform, I have been aware that many of the movement leaders and the grass roots activists really don't know what they are doing. They know the facts of the issue, and they know that they need to get Congress and the state legislatures to change the laws, but they have an undeveloped and uninformed view of how to achieve the changes they are working for. Many of them don't realize that building a grass roots movement is essential. And many of those who know they are trying to mobilize a majority, aren't aware that their messages or tactics can often be counter-productive. This book brings a great deal of wisdom and clarity.This easy-to-read book can help break down the confusion within the movement about the necessary, different roles people need to fill. Read this book and learn that different approaches are necessary to complement each other. This, hopefully, will minimize the uninformed arguments about strategy that we have engaged in. The lessons of this book lay the groundwork for fruitful discussions of what we can and should be doing.This book provides a very valuable analysis of the stages that movements go through, on the way to success. The case histories teach, among other things, that the stages can overlap.This book is grounded in the tradition of nonviolent social action. It is remains idealistic in the best sense, and is not cynical.Eric E.
