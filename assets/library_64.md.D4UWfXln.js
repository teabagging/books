The book did not address this specific configuration, its 3-star alignment programming, or the alignment bug that currently plagues the ASGT system. Also, I had already spent so much time trying to solve the go-to alignment bug that a forced learning curve made the book of marginal value. Therefore, I ended up returning it. I will say that it is otherwise a good book, but it really does not address all NexStar applications. Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend the Guide to ASGT owners until the book as been updated to include the Celestron ASGT Advanced Series mount and the alingment problems."},{"Title":"The NexStar User's Guide (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"The content of the book may be relevant and useful if you own or are interested in any of the older model Celestron telescopes discussed. Unfortunately the material is dated and I couldn't immediately find any coverage of telescopes in Celestron's current productline (May 2010). I wanted to use the book to help me learn about Celestron's current offerings and also to help me decide on what to buy but it ended up being a chore trying to match the new and current products to those covered in the book either by name, features and capabilities. So I gave up and returned the book.If you are interested in older Celestron telescope models, the book may be of value to you. If you have some familiarity with Celestron's goto telescopes, you could probably figure out and benefit from the book by applying the content to current models.

If you are not in this class of people, then there are other books that you might rather consider.I was, frankly, a little disappointed with this book. I was looking for something that was chock full of \\"secret tips\\" on how to use my NexStar telescope, but found that there were few tips available. Much of the information was general information about astronomical topics that an experienced amateur astronomer might already know. It did, however, contain some information specific to the NexStar scopes. And, I did learn some general things that I had not known before. So, if you are a NexStar owner, you spent a good deal of money on your telescope and this is an excellent first accessory, especially if you are a beginner in stargazing.So, why do I give such a lukewarm review to a book that I awarded five stars?? Well, if you are a NexStar owner, you should know about the web site that author Swanson runs, The NexStar Resource Site, [...]. If you are a NexStar owner and this is the first that you have heard of this site, then you owe it to yourself to check it out!! It has a wealth of current information that you will want to refer to from time to time. So, buy Mr. Swanson's book, if for no other reason than to support his site.

He gives his beloved relatives nine sealed individualized notes using the letters in the word Christmas to symbolize the recipient. The loving notes explain how each brought joy and happiness into his well filled contented life as well providing them with a life parable.Christmas is coming soon, but Grandpa proved accurate as he died in the summer. Yet everyone gathers at Grandpa's house because they all believe he is there for them through his letters and in spirit to celebrate Christmas with his loved ones.This novella is a terrific tale as each of the family members receive a precious memento from a person held in high regard and cherished by all. Readers will appreciate the gift from Grandpa as Bret Nicholaus provides touching short vignettes of what Grandpa as says in his letters to each person.

While taking out Christmas decorations, the narrator reflects on the previous Christmas: the last he spent with his grandfather. Grandpa gave each member of his family a small piece of red felt cut out in the shape of a letter. Each letter signifies something special about that person that was important to Grandpa. Putting all the letters together spelled CHRISTMAS, and without any one of them, the holiday wouldn't feel complete. Grandpa also takes the time to remind his family the real meaning of Christmas and how much he loves them. The book has beautiful illustrations and is a really quick read. It's perfect as a gift book or to put out on the coffee table for guests to read. It will stir your emotions and remind you of what Christmas really means.

I hope so!"},{"Title":"The Christmas Letters: A Timeless Story for Every Generation","review":"Reviewed by Susan Pettrone for Reader Views (11/06)\\"The Christmas Letters,\\" written by Bret Nicholaus, is a heart-warming tale of a Grandfather's love for his family and the legacy he left them, that only he could provide. The reader is instantly drawn into the setting for this book, a family gathering in which everyone surprised when typically quiet \`Grandpa' asks for everyone's attention and proceeds to hand out envelopes to each member of the family. As the family sets spellbound, Grandpa explains that he would like each member to open their envelopes. As the family follows Grandpa's wishes, confused glances are exchanged when hand cut red velvet alphabet letters tumble onto the table in front of each member of the family.As the family sits silently, Grandpa explains that each letter symbolizes an important part of the holiday for him. Continuing on, Grandpa tells each recipient what their letter means to him and why each letter stands for a special part of Christmas. Combining the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S, he explains, adds up to what makes Christmas complete for him. The family members realize that he is in fact telling them that they are each an important part of Christmas for him and without one of them; his Christmas would not be complete. As they sit silently thinking about their individual letters, Grandpa reaches for another envelope, tears it open, and withdraws the letter \\"J.\\" Confusion is once again seen in the faces around the table until Grandpa speaks. He tells them that the \\"J\\" stands for \`Jesus' and says...\\"without this piece of Christmas, there can be no peace of Christmas.\\" As the meaning dawns on the family, Grandpa cuts the \\"J\\" into small pieces and hands one to each person present. With this simple gesture and the deep faith behind it, the family is reminded of what Christmas really means in their lives and how Jesus is the \\"piece\\" that defines Christmas for what it truly is.This book touched a part of my heart that I didn't expect it to, upon first opening the cover. I found myself transformed to a Christmas Eve celebration, with my own family in attendance and saw through its pages, how everyone adds their own special \\"piece\\" of Christmas to the family. I was touched by Grandpa's love for his family and his need to tell them so. I too have an older father and I know my Christmas' with him will someday be no more. Somehow, through reading this book, although it brought tears to my eyes, it also brought a peace to my soul as well. It is a book that I intend to purchase for many friends this holiday season, as it is one of timeless love and deep faith as well. It is not just a story of Christmas but a story of deep love for not only family but for Jesus as well.I would highly recommend \\"The Christmas Letters\\" as a gift for anyone on your list. It is a book that is rare indeed, as it can touch the youngest and the oldest heart alike with its message. It would be a welcome addition to any family bookshelf and reading it aloud could easily become a family tradition during many Christmas seasons to come. This book is one that will stay with you long after you close its cover and will touch you every time you read it. It is a jewel of a book for the Christmas season ahead and one that should be on everyone's \\"must read\\" list.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Forever a Chief: Derrick Thomas, Always Giving Back","review":"\\"Forever a Chief\\" is the only book dedicated to the life and career of Kansas City Chief Linebacker Derrick Thomas that I am aware of.This book consists of quotes from Mr. Thomas and NFL players and coaches, some full page action photos,(there are a few photos of D.T. in uniform for his last game) and career achievements from both on and off the field.\\"On the field accolades are great, but in order to reach your full potential, you have to overstep the boundaries of football and go out into the community and be an All-Pro there too.\\" -Derrick Thomas.A large part of his legacy is his involvement in the community and especially with the youth.In an NFL career that was too short, the late Derrick Thomas achieved the single-game sack record, impacted the outcome of games with his K.C.

Not highbrow in any sense, just thorough and smart, and good reading to boot! It's also great to have a list of the opening and ending sequences in this shot by shot format, since there's never been a montage anything like Roeg's jewel created since 1973."},{"Title":"Don't Look Now (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"This is a great book for anyone who loves the film, &quot;Don't Look Now,&quot; by Nicolas Roeg. The film itself is an extraordinary and powerful thriller and love story--anyone who has seen it can never forget its beginning and ending scenes, or its beautiful sex scene between Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland. The movie is filled with hidden secrets and little details which this book does a good job of pointing out. It also goes through, shot-by-shot, the opening and climactic scenes. A very interesting book. It also helps that the author writes on a personal, intimate level without being stuffy or confusing."},{"Title":"Don't Look Now (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"Nicolas Roeg's filmDon't Look Now [HD] is a superb and chilling tale of suspense and tragedy, with great performances by Julie Christie, Donald Sutherland and others.

Beth Ann Fennelly seems to have made up her mind to change that. The poems in this chapbook are absolutely lovely and lyrical, smart and funny, surprising and rich. In a broad range of forms (dramatic monologues, sonnets, sestinas, etc), Ms. Fennelly explores a wide scope of subject matter, from love (a great poem about a boyfriend/husband/lover who catches snakes &quot;like you'd pinch lightning in mid-air&quot; and lets them go; the poem's narrator feels the same gentleness from the lover, saying that she, the narrator, is free to go, too) to history (read the absolutely stunning &quot;Madame L. Describes the Seige of Paris&quot; where, when Paris was surrounded by Prussians, the starving Parisians storm the zoo and eat the animals: it's an amazing--and long!--poem, narrative in structure and full of strange detail) to art (several great examples here). I can't say enough about this book or this poet. I've seen other poems of hers in lit journals and I anticipate her first full-length book. Beth Ann Fennelly may have just re-converted me to poetry. And I thank her."},{"Title":"Shadow Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"I love African-American romance books. It feels good to read books that reflect the love lives of African-Americans, but this one misses the mark. The plot is too convoluted and unbelievable. I mean I know books are supposed to take you away on a journey, but this one is a little too much. The characters fall in love too quickly. The writing is too stilted and disjointed. Something was just missing all together from this one. It took all I had just to finish the book. I would recommend that you borrow a copy of this from your local library or a friend, but please don't buy it. However, I still love Arabesque and will continue to support them. I'll just stick to the authors I know."},{"Title":"Shadow Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"I have read this authors book Real Love which I believe is much better in the development of the characters.

I found Sheler's journalist perspective and persona a help and not a hindrance. He seemed at all times to honestly give multiple sides their due, then provide a reasonable analysis from there. Throughout, cruxes of the matter(s) were explained articulately for the reader to reflect upon. The two sections on archaeology and the Dead Sea scrolls were very informative since I had never delved into either area before. He managed to inform without getting too specialized or getting too dummied-down/generalized. I've already read a few historical Jesus/Jesus Seminar books before, and feel that section was also fairly and thoroughly done without seeming as heavy-handed as that material usually does. The coverage of the various &quot;quests&quot; gave he helpful terminology and the brief overviews of the Jesus Seminar scholars gave me some background information for the names I have frequently seen in bibliographies. I had only recently heard of the &quot;Bible Code&quot; and after reading his section on that feel confident enough to not sweat further inquiry in that area. If you're interested at all in understanding any of these Biblical studies areas in layman's terms, I think this book would be very interesting and helpful."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"Being a skeptic, I am always intrigued by writings from both sides of the debate regarding the historical accuracy and validity of the so called holy scriptures. I have come across so many writings from believers and non believers alike. I have read material from detractors who are obviously filled with hate and a naturalisic bias, as well as writings from ignorant and intellectually lazy Christians who refuse to investigate and deal with the genuine and honest questions that are raised when their beliefs are challenged. I was very curious as to the position that this particular writer would take. I found the writer to quite refreshing in his honesty and scholastic approach. His writings came across as neither reflecting any of the two aforementioned positions. He presented the material, both in the affirmitive and negation, in a non-ranting,unprejudicial manner, while giving the reader room to draw their own conclusions. Though proponents of both sides may not like this approach along with their subsequential conclusions, readers who are seeking truth (as they understand it to be)on these matters will be happy to see that honesty and integrity can still be found while dealing with such controversial topics. A must for any honest seeker who has no \\"particular axe to grind\\" in such matters."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"A better title for this book might have been, \\"Is the History in the Bible True?\\" For it is on history (rather than theology) that Shelter devotes nearly all his time. Recent discoveries in archeology, the finding of other ancient manuscripts, carbon dating, etc. have, according to Shelter, shown many of the historical accounts in the Bible to be, apparently, true. Those readers who expect, from the book's title, to find some \\"proof\\" of the Creation, the Flood, the Parting of the Red Sea, various miracles, etc. will be in for a disappointment. The same goes for Christians looking for the \\"truth\\" of the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation, the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, the exact sayings of Jesus, etc. Only near the end of the book does Shelton tell the reader that these are indeed matters of faith, only to be discovered, well ... if and whenever.

That's what this book does. It's a good read if you're seeking to reinforce the comfort found in your beliefs. The author states that the virgin birth story is too weird to have been made up, yet virgin birth stories already existed at the time the biblical one was written (the stories of Apollonius of Tyana, Krishna and Mithras to name a few). Evidence clearly suggests that Christianity &quot;borrowed&quot; these concepts from much older religions. This type of information was omitted from this work, making it, in my view a very narrow study."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"Jeffery Sheler asks a question in his title that virtually no scholar in the world asks of the Bible. Not that scholars aren't interested in truth. They simply understand the Bible to represent very complex stories and a compilation and editing process than that lasted several hundred years. The Bible can be seen as a mini-encyclopedia of ideas, poetry, claims, stories, songs and battles. It asserts political, religious and historical matters and comparisons without being purely political, religious or historical.Geographically the Bible is, of course, not encyclopedic even though it draws from people and ideas in a rather wide area of the ancient Near East. Thus, I qualify the analogy. However, no one ever asks...is an encyclopedia true! Popular journalism thus, can do things that scholars simply do not do. But the same standards of research and fact finding should apply.Sheler approaches his mission, which this reviewer senses is very personal, with a sort of \\"on the one hand, but on the other hand, thus it is probably the case\\" presentation. I started to say \\"logic\\" rather than presentation except logically you could conclude just as often \\"it is probably not the case\\" or there is no real evidence here. Many will sense that surmise and estimation are used to establish fact...a kind of on-balance-sort-of-reasoning, \\"therefore we conclude\\"...to accomplish the author's task.For example, if one reads the initial paragraphs of chapter 4, the author rhapsodizes, through the supposed comments of others, that the Bible is \\"....a timeless book...one that speaks eternal truths to every age...\\". He then offers a series of comments suggesting the Bible be recognized as very distant in time, language and culture. So far so good. Let us read it \\"in the light of the time period from which it comes.\\"But what if it can not be read in such a manner. What if all the past readings, well intentioned or not, have largely failed to understand the language(s), culture and period, as a whole, from which it comes? What if current scholarship is demonstrating beyond a shadow of a doubt just that...that past readings guided by the more recently created theological super structure of the Church have misread the Bible. But let us continue with chapter 4 to see where the author takes us.We encounter the following: \\"But as scholars who view the Bible as basically reliable...\\" without being told what does \\"basically reliable\\" mean. Sarna is quoted as saying the Bible writers' \\"...concern was with the didactic use of selected historical traditions.\\" Dever is next giving testimony to the effect that the writers had a larger question, \\"What does it mean?\\" How very funny then, the question\\"what does it mean\\" appears no where in the Bible! A chapter heading or two so titled actually in the Bible would be reassuring especially for those of us who consult it almost daily.This book gives one the feeling of a very specious construction, that is, seeming to be good, sound, correct without really being so. Such is okay if it reflects a personal pilgrimage and is so described. However, if judged against objective or scholarly standards it falls short. Lest this comment be seen as nitpicking let us look at how the concluding paragraphs of chapter 4 are structured.William Dever is quoted as saying \\"...it really does matter what happened in the past...\\". Truly historical or \\"...possessing an essential historicality...\\" the author intones prior to the further asserting, \\"And when biblical writings that are unambiguously historical in their intent are critically examined, they consistently show themselves to be remarkably dependable. \\"(emphasis added). The author goes on to quote Seigfried H. Horn with a rather dated Albrightian-like statement.The statement begins, \\"The factual information contained in the historical books of the Bible has generally proved to be trustworthy and accurate...\\". Thus, the reader may tend to miss the author's concluding qualifier that some discoveries \\"...have not always been supportive of traditional views,...\\". Further, if one is not careful it might seem that Dever is also endorsing the Horn position on a point as the chapter concludes. Sheler uses Dever's careful thoughts as a prelude to Horn's stronger and much more traditional position. This sort of positioning of expert quotes is not limited to this chapter. The reader may be confused as to where the \\"chips\\" are falling. One might even think of this as a \\"balanced\\" treatment of difficult materials. I would ask but one more question.Is anyone surprised that so many reviewers suggest this book to be so very \\"even handed\\"? Has no one read the book jacket comments to ascertain reviewer biasso institutionally obvious even while these theologians judge it is \\"trustworthy\\" and \\"balanced\\"?The problem, of course, is what the Bible is versus what generations of \\"tradents\\" acting sincerely but with enormous self interest have said it is! A Tradent is a person primarily interested in preserving and transmitting the (particular religious) tradition. The question arises: Is Sheler a tradent or an \\"objective\\" journalist. On the one hand he may be a tradent. On the other he may not. I think the preponderance of evidence reveals that...well, you... dear reader will have to decide! One last thought...I do hope the Encyclopedia is true!8-14-2002 psb"},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"A great subject. Lot's of good information. Dry as dust. Skip the first 70 pages... they amount to an excuse for writing the book. I don't understand how such an exciting subject could be presented with so little spark. Some pictures would not have hurt, either. The U.S. News article by the same author was better."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"The parts on the bible codes and Dead Sea Scrolls were good. Otherwise author favored conservative views excessively. It seems there wasn't a conservative position he didn't agree with. He wasn't critical enough. As an example consider his treatment of the book of Joshua. He said the archeological evidence seems not to agree with the book of Joshua about the destruction of Jericho. Then he said that the evidence seems to support the conquest happening about 1250BC. Evidence of destruction of Hazor fits with that time. Then he says new evidence seems to support the destruction of Jericho in 1450BC. He doesn't see or at least doesn't emphasize that this conflicts with the other 1250BC evidence. The author doesn't mention lack of evidence like no record of eqyptian artifacts carried in by the arriving Isrealites."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was prepared for it to be full of sloppy thinking and predjudiced conclusions. I commend the author for his evenhanded evaluation of the Bible. I was especially encouraged by the section on archeology. This book should cause anyone to want to read the Bible directly regardless of thier religious views."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"This book takes the approach that the Bible can (and perhaps should) be considered in the same manner as any other ancient text. The author points out that this often is not what happens; rather that (often in the service of their own prejudices) scholars hold a double standard which demands more of Biblical text than other contemporaneous writings. The whole presentation of this book was refreshing in the respect that it paid to the three major monotheistic religions of the Middle East, and especially so the Christian tradition. Whereas many current writers seem intent on &quot;debunking&quot; religious belief, this book can, and does, strengthen one's faith. The archeological and historical support for Biblical scriptures is presented in a manner that can be understood easily, historiographical issues are raised and discussed, and when the evidence simply is not there (in either direction) the author says so. As a Christian, I appreciated Mr. Sheler's respect. As an educated man (doctorate and practicing psychologist) I appreciate the intelligence Mr. Sheler brought to the table. This was a very difficult task that was done well!"},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"Sheler's book is generally good and helpful. He discusses many ways in which archaeology support the Bible record--both by direct evidence, and by proving that the Bible accurately reflects the time in which it was written. The book will definitely give you a new appreciation for the accuracy of the Bible!Sheler also does us a favor when he shows how misguided the hardened critics are (on one hand), and mystical kooks (on the other). For example, hardened critics believed there was no David, no Sargon, and no Nebuchadnezzar--until archaeologists found evidence of all three. On the other hand, mystical kooks continually dish up silliness like the Dead Sea Scrolls conspiracy theories: suggesting that the scrolls are being held secret because they would completely disprove the New Testament, etc.. Other kooky ideas include \`\`Bible Code'' theories and the modern gnostic ideas, which suggest that the \`\`real message'' of the Bible is in the form of a secret message.Sheler's book has its weaknesses, though. He tries to be a little too glib. He dismisses the Bible a little lightly at times, suggesting that \`\`only serious fundamentalists'' take this or that portion of the Bible seriously. It makes him shoot low: he is content to prove that the Bible is \`\`generally accurate'' while at the same time leaving the impression that the Bible has often botched the details.Overall, the book is good and helpful. It leaves an off taste, and some loose ends, for the reason I mention above. But if you can take it with a pinch of salt, you'll be glad you gave it a read."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"When dealing with questions about the Bible and about faith, we are often only able to find extremists--whether from the right or the left. Balance is a rare commodity. I think Jeffery Sheler brings us that balance in &quot;Is the Bible True?&quot; He attempts (and does a very good job) at listening to what people are saying on both (or all) sides of the issues, trying to understand who they are and where they are coming from, and then trying to make sense of it all. Although at times Sheler gives his evaluation of the merits of logic one side or the other, he never does it in a way that tries to force us to think his way.As when reading any treatment that seeks to be balanced and fair, if you take a strong position on the issues one way or another, you will probably feel that your position isn't being treated adequately. There were times when I wished he would have said some things that he didn't. There were some &quot;facts&quot; I felt he left out, which of course would have helped &quot;prove&quot; my own position. No doubt, both conservative and liberal Bible readers will find reasons to be unhappy or disappointed.But if you sincerely want to learn about what different people think regarding the Bible, you'll find some interesting and helpful input. What Sheler sets out to do, he does well. For a person who is trying for the first time to understand the questions surrounding the Bible, this book will give you a good framework to begin that search. You'll want to continue from there. I'd recommend N.T. Wright's &quot;The New Testament and the People of God&quot; as a next (although more scholarly) step in your search.Overall, I thought it was interesting, enjoyable, understandable, and helpful."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"Recently I have read a number of books in the &quot;holy bloodline of Christ&quot; genre (The Templar Revelation, The Hiram Code, The Tomb of God, etc.) in which the authors engage in cavalier exegesis of the Bible while accepting, uncritically, virtually every skeptical perspective on the historicity of scripture. This book is a great book on its own terms, but it is a wonderful balance to these other popular and skeptical books attacking the normal understandings of Biblical history. The author has the intelligence and the courage to include the perspectives of scholars in the evangelical tradition, thereby avoiding the uncritical canonization of scholars in the traditions of orthodox &quot;higher criticism.&quot; I especially appreciated his chapter on the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is one of the best books that I have seen for laypeople seeking to understand issues of Biblical criticism."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"REVIEW OF SHELER, IS THE BIBLE TRUE?It is unwise to base a world-view on science and scholarship because by their very nature science and scholarship constantly change (\\"Stay tuned!\\" is a very good motto), whereas philosophy begins by asking, What is it that does not change? Nonetheless, science and scholarship have their place and books like this are very helpful since few of us have the time to look into the research itself or the expertise required to evaluate it.Sheler shows unusual balance and fairness and obviously has great respect for his subject. Unlike many of the scholars themselves, he is willing to consider non-textual as well as textual evidence. Sheler does not however actually summarize the evidence for many contemporary mainstream scholarly views (e.g., the view that Mark's Gospel is the earliest), and does not in every case mention important minority views (e.g., the view that structural features of the text militate, in part, against widespread notions of multiple authorship). I might mention that only a few decades ago you could find Bible commentaries that took it as fact, rather than mere speculation, that Matthew's Gospel was not only the earliest, but was originally written in Aramaic.A few remarks:(a) The meaning of \\"scholarly consensus.\\" Consider p. 26, par. 2, line 2: \\"If there is any consensus at all...\\" It must be realized that \\"consensus\\" in the scientific and scholarly world does not necessarily mean, as one might suppose, that a group of researchers have independently arrived at the same conclusion. It may also mean that one or a few researchers have influenced many others, in a \\"follow-the-leader\\" fashion. Thus if, say, twenty scholars yield a \\"consensus\\" this does not necessarily mean there are twenty independent converging bodies of research.(b) Sheler does not compare biblical scholarship with scholarship on other ancient texts. Recall for example that in the 19th century multiple authorship for Homer's epics was widely taught by scholars; this is not mainstream thought today. It would be nice to know whether this evidence was similar to, or very different from, that for multiple authorship of the Pentateuch. Etc.(c) Sheler's Protestant background occasionally shows. In note 8 for Chapter 2, p. 258, speaking of the seven deutero-canonical Old Testament books, Sheler says \\"they were added to the Roman Catholic canon in 1546 at the Council of Trent.\\" This is factually true but misleading, because it sounds as if the Catholics \\"added something\\" to the Bible whereas in fact the Protestants \\"took something out.\\" The matter is explained in Sheler's text; it is only the footnote that is misleading.(d) We find in Sheler the common casual identification of the past (what actually happened) with written history (what we know). Thus \\"As a missionary, he [Paul] was chiefly responsible for establishing Christianity in the Greco-Roman world.\\" No doubt Paul was important; and his letters are foundational for doctrine. But according to the New Testament record, seventy-odd unknown apostles were sent out by Jesus himself; Jesus was on earth some 40 days _after_ his resurrection; there was Pentecost, which the text hints had far-reaching effects; we have that tantalizing note at the end of John's Gospel about the \\"many other things which Jesus did...\\" which would fill many books; and so on.Ken Miner"},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"I found this book &quot;by accident,&quot; and was intrigued to see what a mainstream journalist would do with such a potentially volatile topic. His readable, clear and swift style were pleasant surprises. Even more surprising was his fair treatment of opposing viewpoints/worldviews of the nature of the biblical texts.Because already-submitted reviews detail the strengths and weaknesses of Sheler's book, I would like to emphasize what I consider its greatest strength: Sheler's consistent revealing of the underlying philosophies/assumptions of the scholars and academics active today in biblical criticism. It is critical for those seeking answers and clues to the nature of the Bible to not accept blindly someone's opinion simply because of a hefty-sounding degree from a prestigious university. Many contemporary scholars approach the Bible with the underlying theistic or even atheistic assumptions, and you better believe that those presuppositions heavily influence their findings.Sheler is also to be commended for his honesty and fairness in showing where there is an existing paucity in historical evidence to support the biblical narratives. Also, he does a good job of introducing the idea that ancient writers did not write their works with the same intentions and &quot;standards&quot; that we take for granted 20 centuries later. It is important that we are able to read them as they intended, and not to superimpose our own standards of journalistic writing on them.Additionally, Sheler does a fantastic job of explaining and debunking the Bible codes in language readable and accessible to laymen (like myself) who would easily be thrown by heavily technical discussions of the mathematics involved.To interested readers, I would strongly recommend &quot;Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?&quot; by Craig and Crossan. While more focused in topic, it deals with the same issue of underlying assumptions and evidences as does Sheler's book."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"But it takes open-mindedness and a willingness to avoid both the extremes of hyper-literalism and hyper-skepticism to see it. Jeffrey Sheler makes a solid, even-handed case for the basic reliability of the Bible. It is enormously comprehensive, which is almost a disadvantage given his ambitious thesis. All the ground is covered here: archeology, textual criticism, comparative literature, anthropology, etc. Sheler does cite mainly from conservative sources (such as Brown, Wright, Hoffmeier and Blomberg), but he fairly represents skeptical positions as well. I think some of these negative reviews on amazon.com reflect the fact that some people just can't accept the fact that conservative views might, in fact, be better supported by the evidence. Since they declare that conclusion a priori impossible, anyone who weighs in for that position must be biased or selective. Sheler's arguments won't convince those already resolutely skeptical, but they are not rationalistic or apologetic either. They represent a balanced, measured view drawn from years of careful study. Overall an excellent book on issues of biblical accuracy."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"This book is well written, and easy to read. The author takes a non-biased overview of some of the historical and archaeological studies pertaining to the Bible. Of particular interest were the sections on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the search for historical evidence of Jesus Christ. The author does an excellent job at balancing out some of the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; with factual evidence of the texts themselves. The comparisons of some of the religious cults, which existed at the time the Gospels, were fascinating. The Book of John, which has often been decried as not being an eyewitness account may actually have been the first Gospel written, according to the author, due to some new cross reference with other sects at the time which place some of the language and images used by John as existing during the historical time period of Jesus. While much of the evidence may be found in other places the book is an excellent overview. Overall, this book is well researched, and well written. It is rare to find a non-biased overview of the subject matter, definitely worth the time. I would recommend this book for anyone searching for evidence of Biblical truth. The more archeology progresses, the more Biblical truths are validated, and this book does a great job of reporting that evidence."},{"Title":"Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures","review":"I'm not sure I know enough to evaluate this book, but I can at least describe it. The basic point of view of this book is: nothing in the Bible is conclusively disproven by modern archaeology. Therefore, it is more or less true. (Or as one Conservative rabbi I know stated: &quot;the Torah is truth but not precision.&quot;)Sheler's point of view is closer to middle-of-the-road Christianity than to either secularism or fundamentalism (though a look at other reviews suggests he gets more flak from the fundamentalist end of the spectrum--perhaps because atheists really can't be bothered with reading this kind of book).Sheler explains (or maybe I should say &quot;asserts&quot;; I don't have the knowledge to firmly agree or disagree with him) that the Christian Bible has plenty of inconsistencies (though he misses a few--for example, one of the Gospels has a lot more generations between Jesus and David than another), that some of the Gospels were written by people who were a generation or two removed from Christ, and that today's commonly accepted Jewish Bible differs both from the Dead Sea Scrolls and from other earlier versions--facts which would appear to create a lot of difficulty for people who treat every word in the Bible as true.On the other hand, Sheler asserts that these inconsistencies don't rule out the major themes of the Bible: the relevation at Sinai for the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament), the Virgin Birth for the Christian Bible (aka New Testament). In fact, he defends the latter, arguing that the Virgin Birth is such a weird story that it couldn't possibly be invented (ironically, pretty similar to a Orthodox Jewish argument for the Relevation at Sinai).Sheler understandably avoids the differences between Judaism and Christianity; for example, he doesn't discuss the fact that several portions of the Torah urge Jews to keep commandments &quot;forever&quot; which would seem to pretty much rule out Christianity."},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer","review":"This is a book about how a writer becomes a writer. The author, Joan Lowery Nixon, tells stories about her childhood and the things that influenced her to become a writer. I chose this book because I wanted to see if the author and I shared some interest in writing. I find writing to be a relaxing thing to do and sometimes enjoy it. The author knew as a little girl she had a passion for reading which she felt influenced her to become a writer. She love reading so much as a child and she wanted to be able write just like the writers.As a young child, Joan lived with her parents and grandparents. There was always someone to read to her. She loved to listen to stories. There was no television when she was little. They listened to the radio for entertainment and read books instead. Some of her earliest memories were of her parents and grandparents reading to her. She remembered climbing up on their laps with a bunch of books and them reading to her any time she asked.She had a happy childhood. She loved living with her grandparents and parents. She felt the many family members gave her a secure environment. Joan especially loved her father's scary stories he told her as a young girl. I think that really influenced her to write so many mysteries. One of her hobbies was putting on plays. Her imagination to do that helped her to write.One Christmas, her father built her a dollhouse. She started creating stories for her dollhouse. Joan turned the stories into plays and the neighborhood kids came to watch. She remembered one teacher who told her that a writer must always have faith in themselves, because if the didn't, no one else would. Joan never forgot that.Joan learned a lot about her amazing talent of writing through her love to read. At age 10 she knew she was destined to be a writer when her first story was published. She had a very happy childhood and that taught her that family was very important. If it wasn't for her close family always reading to her and watching her plays she might have lost interest in writing and became something else.By James LawsonTierra Linda Middle SchoolSan Carlos, CA"},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer","review":"\\"I was exactly what I had wanted to be.

The sources the author says he used are apparent- they are Jackie's youthful and off-season coaches, friends and business associates, as well as his second wife. They are not primarily baseball players. The account of any given year is strong on Jackie's off-season activities and weak on Jackie's baseball season, or anecdotes relating to it. An unintentionally humorous error stemming from the author's lack of baseball knowledge occurs in the wrap-up of Jackie's stats for the season prior to his first retirement. Mr. Martin mentally transposed the numbers in two columns in his own appendix, and credits Jackie with 67 stolen bases in 1959! Maybe Luis Aparicio was overrated! (Jackie actually had 20 SBs and 67 SOs in 1959.)As one might expect from such a source, the book is better-written by far than the standard baseball bio. But the choice of a subject famous for an activity that does not captivate the author creates a certain monstrous gap in the purpose, and a real loss in describing Jackie's climactic voluntary retirement from the game at his peak, a mere one year after winning the MVP. If Mr. Martin was half the baseball fan he is a writer, the book could have soared to something like a Greek tragedy. As is, it will appeal to those interested in the man, in the personal foibles and flaws inherent in all humans, and in the efforts of spirited people to overcome them. These efforts better grip the reader when made by one, like Jackie, who has attained greatness in one of life's pathways."},{"Title":"The Golden Boy: A Biography of Jackie Jensen","review":"What makes this book so great is that after reading it you have a new found respect for professional athletes and people who are thrust into the public spotlight. Jackie's life was not only interesting, but very demanding and trying for him and his family. This book dispelled my notion that people in Jackie's position were just part of the glitz and glamor of this nation and not so much a citizen like the rest of us. I wish everyone could read this not only because it's a great story of a man's life and all the historical events that took place around him, but also because it made me realize just how human and vulnerable even the seemingly 'mighty' are."},{"Title":"The Golden Boy: A Biography of Jackie Jensen","review":"Although the book reads like a laundry list of quotes and anecdotes gathered over the last 12 - 15 years, the book reveals a goodly amount of information. The writer does a hard job at not being biased against any one person or event in the life of Jackie Jensen. Though the union of Jackie Jensen and Zoe Ann Olsen did not produce another pro or Olympic athlete, the children have gone on to be happy and successful in their lives in their own ways with the future of their grandchildren still wide open. I would have liked to have seen this documented by the writer. The story reads as if it was a failed generation. Not at all like the reality."},{"Title":"The Golden Boy: A Biography of Jackie Jensen","review":"THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK ABOUT A VERY INTERESTING MAN. JACKIE WAS TRULY A VERY GIFTED ATHLETE.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL BASEBALL FANS."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"Gardner's work certainly won't appeal to postmodernists or other avant-garde scribblers who believe form takes precedence over content. His thesis is simple: all art purports to better the world, not hinder it; all art essentially believes in a form of goodness, truth, beauty, whatever you want to call it, in the sense that it affirms that there is an inherent value in life and no value in &quot;valuelessness.&quot; He comes down strongly on writers who write like &quot;writers,&quot; and where style becomes more important than the timeless art of storytelling. All this probably won't be very compelling to many of the readers who cling to the works of 60s writers like Pynchon, Gass, Coover, et al., who write thinly disguised treatises, not novels, and who people their books not with characters but mannequins. There is something old fashioned about Gardner's point of view, which won't win him many hipster fans, but his argument, this reader feels, stands up even stronger in today's climate where the main literary trends seem to consist of endless irony, facile references to pop culture and television. Furthermore, his book is lucid, trenchant, passionate, engaging, and of course, confrontational."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"This book created some stir when originally published, perhaps due more to the naming of names (of peers Gardner judged arrogant/irresponsible/careless) than to the deeper ideas/passions which inform it. One star is subtracted for poor strategy, excessive willingness to engage on turf occupied/fortified by his not at all innocent victims. Gardner does get lost, from time to time, in one abstract philosophical swamp or another. The book may be needlessly long. But the writing rings true, finally. This is the most ambitious literary argument published during the past fifty years, certainly, and it is essentially on the mark. The academic canon was tilting dangerously in the direction of empty opaque diddling during the seventies, choked with very talented hip and superhip cynics, often on university payrolls, weary of the ancient plain work of shaping stories. The vogue was so universal that Gardner fails to find a single working American high lit contender (excluding himself, we trust) to like without heavy reservations. He does favor one Englishman, at least. This ground is tricky. Some of the writing disdained/derided seeks, in various ways, to imitate James Joyce, who is granted a semi-pass, and Ezra Pound is not properly whapped until near the end. Connecting the wave of mean arrogant cleverness to its obvious roots counts, has consequences. Gardner, who died by motorcycle accident in the early eighties, may have been just beginning to fight."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"I first read this book in the 1970's when it was new. I've owned a copy ever since, and I've given so many away as gifts that I've lost count.It is easily my favorite book. From the moment I first read it, until today; I open its pages and feel as if I'm having a literary conversation with an old friend.The &quot;moral&quot; in the title puts off some folks, but don't be deterred. Gardner uses the term &quot;moral&quot; as you or I would use the word &quot;truth.&quot; All Gardner is imploring is that authors seek the truth when writing fiction and avoid cheap tricks and cheap effects. That is all.Yes, Gardner did feel that writing comes with a responsibility.

The avant garde and postmodernism seem to be placed, by these reviewers, at the opposite end of the scale from that which Gardner promotes. Meanwhile, Gardner clearly didn't believe that postmodernism and the avant garde were useless and irresponsible, as he himself wrote odd, postmodern novels while remaining within his own guidelines. He was also a vocal fan of much of Barthelme's work, as well as Beckett's. The avant garde is not the opposite pole from what Gardner intends, and he never suggested it was."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"It is dangerous to write a book claiming (to oversimplify Gardner's argument considerably) that the arts must above all be &quot;life-affirming.&quot; It opens one up to accusations of priggishness, of fuddy-duddyness.Gardner can indeed be difficult to take, especially when he rambles on at length about the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. It is more difficult, though, not to agree with him when he insists that the vast majority of art produced today is essentially worthless. (The title is slightly misleading: his focus is on fiction, but he discusses contemporary theatre, poetry, and music as well.) Those of us who have trouble thinking of guys like John Updike, John Barth, and Thomas Pynchon as &quot;major&quot; authors will find a friend in Gardner, who is not one to mince words.Fortunately, Gardner is aware that the world of art cannot be reduced to black-and-white contrasts; for all his self-righteous fire, it is obvious that he has considered his position well. Clearly, he knows a lot about the history of art.His argument here is, I think, largely sound--but I am personally not certain whether we would be better off if we had an army of young writers eager to affirm all that is Good, True, and Beautiful. Bad art is nothing new--the late Roman Empire was rife with would-be Homers. The existence of bad art has less to do with our hopelessly decadent times than with the inherent difficulty involved in creating timeless masterpieces, as well as the perennial scarcity of real talent. And one really does not have to be a &quot;moral&quot; critic to find fault with authors like William Gass. Gardner certainly has some valid points here, and this book is definitely worth reading, but as a call to arms I wonder how much value it really has. But perhaps you should read this book and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"Gardner defines the mission of the visionary novelist in a way that underlines the essential importance of storytellers to humanity's hopes and dreams--an approach as relevant in today's global village as it was when he first wrote it."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"It's a sad thing that anyone who has read and treasured Gardner's \\"On Fiction\\" should be put off by \\"On Moral Fiction\\" thinking it could be a lectionary of sorts. The book deals with the responsibility a writer takes on in being both honest with facts, true to details, and clever with words. This does not diminish when the author's work is fictional - there must be a seasoning of verisimilitude in every scene for a novel to function at all.

We recognize true art by its' careful, thoroughly honest search for an analysis of values. It is not didactic because, instead of teaching by authority and force, it explores, open-mindedly, to learn what it should teach. It clarifies like an experiment in a chemistry lab, and confirms.\\" - John GardnerI have of late been on a kick of reading whatever I can about writing, expanding... ah, better, reviewing my sparse understanding of art and craft, the business of it. Seeking ten best lists to guide me in the right direction, avoiding pitfalls of the trite and repetitive, looking for the seminal work, the singularity. Those lists more often than not holding up On Moral Fiction as a must read. With little previous knowledge of Gardner, having only read Grendel in high school, I gleaned what I could from general sources, Okay. The title was at once revolting and enticing, expectations of a preachy diatribe, subjective, anachronistic values; then again taken in morbid curiosity as to what that proposed morality might represent, at least in its' entertainment value. It was not what I expected.Gardner's definition of \\"moral\\" was not constrained in context of religious or cultural \\"morality,\\" but rather that fiction should aspire to discover, and inspire, those human values that are universally sustaining. Values he believed innate in the human animal, values necessary for our advancement.His statements, his very beliefs (and he always said what he believed) were disturbing to many of his people, readers, friends and followers alike, agreed or disagreed, often displayed to their exasperation... Poor brilliant Gardner! What will he say next? Yet, he's described as warm and generous with his time, willingly engaged in debate. Against the grain of the old adage - It's not what you say that counts; it's how you say it. To Gardner it was indeed what you say that counted, and it better be honest. The \`what' was the construct, and vice versa. He longed for \\"a return to the discussion of rational morality that his (Sartre's) outburst interrupted.\\"I typically skip introductions, forewords and prologues. I'm glad I didn't. Lore Segal's introduction is a far cry from the typical patronage, trivial and uninteresting anecdotes, mushy accolades raising the author to deity sprung full grown from the head of Zeus. Instead, taking the occasion to point out positions faithfully held by Gardner proven flawed by more than thirty years of inconvenient history. Specifically his attitudes toward modern art and music, and predictions of their ultimate demise, a natural selection of sorts, victims of their own hollowness and disingenuousness, their celebration of the trivial and nihilistic, \\"the freak\\", victims of their own immorality.Her personal relationship with Gardner gives her a special insight into his beliefs about what constituted moral art, and as importantly what didn't, to which he would rail, captured in his words - \\"Honest feeling has been replaced by needless screaming, pompous foolishness, self-centered repetitiousness, and misuse of vocabulary!\\" Does that sound mad, or is it just me? (I added the exclamation mark, it deserves it.)I will not be so presumptuous to put in a few words what Gardner expounds on. But I will say Gardner believed it was an artist's, and critic's, responsibility, even obligation to society and its' betterment that they zealously pursue morality in the process and the product. \\"Good art is always in competition with bad art.\\" - J.G. Moral art exerts influence on society, proposing, holding up models of behavior. The artist has intuition in place of scientific hypothesis, but it has to be as carefully examined within integral laws and tradition, \\"the morality of art... is far less a matter of doctrine than of process.\\" -J.G.Gardner's writing voice solicits sympathy, irresistible, at the same time despairing and hopeful, enraged and joyous, controversial and reaffirming, and always immediate. Mind you, it is not to say I could swim in the depths of his philosophy, missing much nuance, but his ideas, skillfully argued, guided and textured, will take you as far you can or want to go, whether limited by capacity or disagreement. There is something for everyone, artist, critic and enthusiast.If Gardner were alive today he would very surely dismay with society's trend toward the devaluation, even demonization of critical thinking. The state of personal communications, bits (a descriptive he would have certainly got a kick out of) of data exchanged poorly formatted, the rise of a didactic morality happier in provocative sound bites and expedient answers: Instead of one welcoming of a thoughtful, and civil, discourse aspiring to genuine solutions, to truth itself. John Gardner we miss you, and your brutal honesty.Xavier Morrison 8/15/12"},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"I empathize with John Gardner and his frustration with the mediocrity of modernism, postmodernism and nihilism, and the lack of what he refers to as moral fiction in much of the arts. I have struggled with it also as a reporter/captioner; and art, as he so pedantically stated, imitates life.Thomas Watson said, \\"The chief aim of man is to glorify God.\\" To glorify God is my standard as a writer. If I deviate from that, I need to find another avocation.I struggle with the fact that for the past thirty years I have made my living providing court reporting and captioning for broadcast television and that very few of those millions of words I have labored to accurately record have glorified God. They will burn up in the last days when God judges mankind and the world.In the sense of structure, I did my job professionally, but the content did not glorify Him. As a creative writer, I relish the freedom to write what I choose.As I was reading On Moral Fiction, Ecclesiastes 12:11 came to mind: \\"Of making books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.\\" I grew tired of trying to understand some of John Gardner's more salient points which oftentimes made little sense to me. I found a lot of what he said to be the ranting of a frustrated critic tired of analyzing art in a mediocre world that does not care for Good, Beauty, or Truth. While I agree with his attitude toward the meaning of art and the responsibility of the artist, I disagree with some of the conclusions he drew and found them depressing.Here is an example. I want to quote the following paragraph from page 181:\\"Art begins in a wound, an imperfection--a wound inherent in the nature of life itself--and is an attempt either to learn to live with the wound or to heal it. It is the pain of the wound which impels the artist to do his work, and it is the universality of woundedness in the human condition which makes the work of art significant as medicine or distraction.\\"I found this quote to be insightful and uplifting. But he lost me with his conclusion when he then went on to say:\\"The wound may take any number of forms: Doubt about one's parentage, fear that one is a fool or freak, the crippling effect of psychological trauma or the potentially crippling effect of alienation from the society in which one feels at home, whether or not any such society really exists outside the fantasy of the artist.\\"From a worldly point of view, I suppose these would be legitimate observations, but from a spiritual point of view, we know that God doesn't leave us in doubt, full of fear, a psychological cripple, or alienated; and He is more real than any fantasy that an artist could dream up, sane or crazy.Gardner failed to instill the hope of healing and that things can be better. I believe his idea of Beauty, Good, and Truth, while a good beginning, falls short. I hope to take his idea of \\"moral fiction\\" one step further which I will expound on in a moment.On page fifteen, Gardner gives a definition of moral as being, \\"...life giving---moral in its process of creation and moral in what it says.\\"According to Miriam Webster's dictionary, moral means \\"relating to principles of right and wrong in behavior.\\"Clearly these two definitions are not the same thing. Perhaps Immanuel Kant's philosophy is instructive in the use of the word \\"morality.\\" Peter Kreeft in \\"The Pillars of Unbelief--Kant,\\" The National Catholic Register (January February 1988), discusses Kant, and summarized Kant's philosophy that morality is \\"...not a natural law of objective rights and wrongs that comes from God, but a manmade law by which we decide to bind ourselves.\\"I normally wouldn't quote someone who espouses a belief contrary to Christianity, but I believe it makes my point. Morality is arbitrary depending on the situation, the culture, and religion.If one is in Nepal, it is considered immoral to kill a cow because cows are worshipped. In our culture I consider abortion to be immoral, but according to our laws, it is not immoral to kill a baby inside a mother's womb.In the Bible, Jesus turned over the money tables in the synagogue because the religious leaders had turned His house of worship into a den of thieves. What Jesus considered a moral and righteous act the religious leaders of his day considered immoral and sought to arrest him. Therefore the term \\"moral art\\" has an ambiguous meaning because it is too subjective.Gardner attempted to refine \\"moral art\\" to more precisely say that it should pursue Good, Beauty, and Truth. He believed good art would embody these qualities and bad art wouldn't.To talk about each of these words individually, Gardner discusses \\"Good\\" on pages 133 through 139, but he leaves out any understanding of God. Because man is inherently sinful, or immoral, leaving God out of this discussion came across to me as meaningless commentary.His definition of good is described as \\"...a relative absolute that cannot be approached\\"(page 139). Because it can't be approached, he states that, \\"The conclusive answering of a question has not to do with the Good but with the True,\\" and \\"...thus relative absolute \`Truth' through reason\\"(page 139).God is the ultimate source of Good and is not a relative absolute who cannot be approached. He came to earth and dwelt among us and indwells us with His Spirit--a deposit guaranteeing what is to come. It was interesting to me that when Gardner was unable to define Good in an understandable way, he then tied good to \\"...truth through reason.\\"As Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, Pilate asked the question, \\"What is truth?\\" I do not believe it is possible to come to an understanding of \\"...truth through reason\\" at the level that Gardner intimated and Pontius Pilate asked. This type of truth, humanly speaking can't be seen, heard, or written, but through art we can \\"feel\\" His presence and capture that longing for something beyond ourselves. If Truth could be arrived at through human reasoning, the religious leaders of Jesus' day would not have sought to crucify Him.I have found Truth to be the most elusive of the three--Good, Beauty, and Truth--because sin blocks the ability of each of us to recognize Truth. It takes a very honest person to confront his own sin and be willing to seek Truth at all costs.Despite the limitations of knowing Truth this side of eternity, I take comfort as a writer that I am pursuing Truth that is embodied in a person and not in a relative absolute.The third example he gave of moral art is it should portray Beauty. I recently watched the movie, American Beauty, and while it won five Oscars, I was struck by how ugly this movie was. Finding beauty in a floating trash bag, a dead bird, and perverted sexual behaviors is not my idea of beauty. Again, Gardner's use of the word \\"Beauty\\" is too subjective and therefore only partially instructive in what moral or good art should be.I also take issue with his railing against \\"bad art.\\" I don't know if it's fair to classify art as good or bad. I believe it's a matter of how redeemed we are and what our capacity is for recognizing what God would call \\"good art.\\"That brings me to what I believe the purpose of all art should be, and the most important point--it should be redemptive.Even though most art today is not redemptive, I don't believe that means we should get rid of what Gardner would probably consider \\"bad art.\\" In the end, God can use anything, good or bad, to teach us more about who He is. However, we have the choice, because we have the freedom, to choose what art we like and don't like. If someone chooses to like bad art, they should have the ability to enjoy it for what it is.Once we start putting labels on what art is, however, we become critics (like Gardner). Once we judge art as bad, we might believe it gives us the power not to allow it or to do away with it. Once we believe we can rid the world of bad art, then who is to say that someone, given the right circumstances, would not attain the power and do away with good art? Freedom is necessary for the expression of all art, good and bad, to use Gardner's words, and I for one do not want to do away with pluralism even though I cringe at much of the art today because it is offensive.It struck me as interesting that the authors whom John Gardner attacked in On Moral Fiction mostly have been forgotten. Bad art, if it's bad, won't last anyway, and so I don't see a need to categorize it. Pluralism is safer because then the Hitlers of the world and mockers can't take away our freedom for what is near and dear to us as Christian writers.Continuing with the idea of Redemption, let me give an example of the power of Redemptive art--the quality that goes beyond Beauty, Good, and Truth.In 1999, I was in Hanoi over Christmas. Displayed in the front window of one of the restaurants I frequented was a large Nativity. Vietnam is a communist country and there are many Christians who have been killed and imprisoned in Vietnam for their faith. But the Nativity scene was displayed prominently in the window as art--redemptive, full of Good, Beauty, and Truth. I may have been the only one who recognized it for what it was, but it spoke volumes to me about the freedom of art and how it can accomplish so much more than what we can didactically or academically.Art gives us the ability to speak the Truth in a way that can reach the masses. It reassured me away from home that God was with me. Who knows what it spoke to others--but that is the catharsis of art. The individual expression in the heart of the person works out Redemption in a way that goes beyond reasoning. God is at work bringing glory to Himself, and as I said in the beginning, the chief aim of man is to glorify God.The other piece of art I want to share comes from the same trip to Hanoi in December, 1999. It was Christmas Eve and there was a lovely Christmas celebration in downtown Hanoi. Uplifting holiday music wafted from the loud speakers over the noisy crowd. The music spoke a message of \\"tidings of great joy.\\" My soul felt enraptured with joy, a balm for my homesick heart. I found myself enveloped in oneness with those around me who were there for a different purpose.But it was the art of music that sung Truth wrapped in Beauty and Goodness, embodied in the person of Jesus Christ who brought Redemption. For me, that is the purpose of art.I do take comfort in the fact that God promises in Isaiah 55:11, \\"...it [my word] will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.\\"Perhaps someone in Vietnam heard the music or saw the Nativity and asked the question, \\"What is Truth? What is Beauty? What is Good?\\" We will never know, but I don't think it matters. We're just the bearer of what Gardner would call \\"moral art.\\" We pursue the purpose for which God made us, whether we are the planters or the reapers. In the end, God's will is done and we, through Redemption, can have a small part in it.I always like to end on a positive note, and so I will do so here. There are many great writers, in my opinion, where Beauty, Truth and Good have been used to achieve the ultimate purpose of art--redemption. The likes of C.S. Lewis, George McDonald, Madeleine L'Engle, and J.R.R. Tolkien have withstood the \\"isms\\" of the world and embodied hope in their writings that have impacted my life.My favorite quote from \\"On Moral Fiction\\" appeared on page 204: \\"So long as the artist is a master of technique so that no stroke is wasted, no idea or emotion blurred, it is the extravagance of the artist's purposeful self abandonment to his dream that will determine the dream's power.\\"As a creative writer of memoir, that would be my dream--that what I write will not burn up in the last days but will survive into eternity. Maybe, just maybe, one person will be drawn to the Creator because of the creativity God has given me. If that be true, I will have accomplished my goal as a writer--to glorify God."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"John Gardner was a good writer; but he could have been a better writer, if only his scale of values were that of an artist. The very fact that he thinks that art should work for its living and serve something more important, drags him into the sin of what Vladimir Nabokov called Poshlost-- Philistinism.Philistinism is the very belief that art is worthwhile only when it serves something more important. Lowbrow philistinism measures art by the price it fetches. But highbrow philistinism, like that of Gardner, while feeling better, still measures art by the usefulness it has for something more exalted: An ideology, a worldview, a morality, whatever. Whether this higher something is of the left, of the right, of the religious, or the irreligious variety, is immaterial. The very fact that the artist deems something else more important than his art renders him a philistine. In my humble opinion, John Gardner, with all his talent and good heart, was one such. He believed that Art was supposed to be Moral, i.e.: to teach a certain behavior. But this is nonsense. Art is a living thing, and as all living things, it has to do one thing only: To survive. But since it can survive only inside a human brain (or heart), it must first get into it. And so, to do that, it has to do accomplish two tasks,and two only. First, that when you pick up the book you can't put it down; second, that when you finish reading it, you cannot forget it. That's it. All else is tactics for the book's survival. Yet Gardner wanted his book also to do something Useful. And in this he was little different from Soviet Commissars, who believed that Art should seat Natasha usefully on the tractor. Gardner wanted to seat Nathasha on a tractor also-- yes, his tractor was of a different color, but by wishing his art to do social work he was still a tractorist.So yes, there's no doubt that he was a good writer, and produced good books, which I enjoy reading; but I only wish he had tried to write against his grain and prove himself wrong, so that his heart would bleed. Then he could have produced a great book, too, which would have loved to read."},{"Title":"On Moral Fiction","review":"I have to tell you, I don't get Gardner. To start with, he writes this book mainly as a gag to rile folks up. And some buy his confidence game, forgetting, as they do, that one of Gardner's favorite novelists was Melville. Because, if you're paying attention, he then goes on to write one postmodern novel after another. Grendel. October Light. The King's Indian. Mickelsson's Ghosts. Each more metafictional than the last. So what if his name's not Barth, or Barthelme, or Barthes, it might have been Barthgardner, for all the Barthing going on. He's as postmodern as they come. Don't let him fool you. Pynchon is his only rival as a writer of apocalyptic fantasy.You might put it this way. And this is the nice way to put it. Gardner's theories and his practice don't match. Of course the gulf between them isn't the same as the one between Wordsworth's ideas and their reality. His injunction to write in the language truly spoken by men runs counter to the bookish and allusive poetry. But where Wordsworth was harmlessly mouthing Coleridge's Kant-addled dream dictums, what Gardner is doing seems much more deliberate and foul. Or funny, depending on the way you look at it.

For those who has done that, I would not recommend this book. Then you should read C++: The Complete Reference instead! The explanations of templates, namespaces, exception handling and operator overloading are a little too simple for me. Also, the last part of the book, The Standard C++ Library, breaks the tutorial form of the book into a pure reference form!!! One of the programs has a very nast bug in it that should have been checked. It completely crashed my system, and I spent the rest of the day figuring out what went wrong!"},{"Title":"Using C++","review":"Very easy to read.

If you've got some programming background, then you'll catch them easily, so they'll be a nuisance rather than a serious source of frustration. The code examples are also rather trivial. It's not so helpful to see a fully coded and commented example of assigning a pointer, when it's already been presented in the text. Better to see a program that does something useful. The book could have been shortened by 200 pages by omitting excess whitespace and useless code examples. Straightfoward prose explanation seemed to suffer in places. Overall, a pretty good intro to OOP; not a terrible book, but you could probably find a better one."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"Laure Redmond asks us to examine our predisposition toward hating our bodies and offers us real-world alternatives: a different way to be in our skin, a different way to look at life, a different way to look at ourselves. It's a great gift she offers, made especially powerful by the fact that it is within reach. Redmond's program is down-to-earth and do-able. And her own story is so inspiring, you want to start following her advice as soon as you finish chapter 1; I implemented a couple of the steps she presents right away, and I felt uplifted immediately.I particularly liked the voice of the author. The honesty with which Redmond talks about her own trials makes me wish I could call her up on the phone and spill my guts to her. She's warm and understanding and has been through a lot. Because she's so frank about her own life--and she treats it all as grist for the learning mill--she makes me less afraid to look at myself, warts and all, and try to make changes.This is a great book."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"Yesterday while in a favorite bookstore, I happened upon Laure Redmond's amazing and inspiring book, Feel Good Naked. The cover and the title were enough alone to get my attention as well as pique my curiosity. For the next hour, I read nearly seventy pages with so many emotions. I knew that I had to buy this book because I wanted it to be the blueprints for my health for the rest of my life. Once I was home, I could not put this book down! I felt such a connection with Laure and the other women's stories, it was almost as if I was reading my own autobiography because the thoughts and feelings that were expressed were identical to what I've felt for my entire 21 years of living.I have been struggling with body hatred and a number of eating issues for over a decade of my life. I've spent so much time on every diet imaginable. The most debilitating &quot;diet&quot; of all has been my 11 year struggle with bulimia. I've been in and out of treatment programs trying to get help, but all the while, I thought by getting help, I should also find a panacea for my ugly, fat body. This book helped me realize that what I truly need is a cure from my own self-loathing when it comes to my body. Never before have I read a health book that affirms every woman's right to recognize her own individual worth. Several of Laure's statements had me in tears because they were so powerful and filled with love. Laure offers a rare kind of empathy for all women faced with body hatred because she herself experienced it on very dangerous levels. The statement that jumped off the pages at me was that a woman's worth is not measured by her dress size. It is how she lives and how she loves. I do not reccomend this book for women-I URGE EVERY WOMAN TO READ IT AND APPLY THE 10 STRATEGIES!!! :) The 10 strategies are not only practical and indicative of what our bodies have told us all along, they are so incredibly doable. This is a philosophy and movement that needs to be applied to our lives and the lives of future generations of all women from all walks of life in all parts of the world. I guarantee that this book will strike a chord with your own personal life in some respect, and you will come away with a sense of self-love that radiates from within."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"I just love the candor of Laure's writing. She is so open, genuine and tells it like it is. I could completely relate to her story and the stories of the other women in the book. I think that too much emphasis is placed on having a perfect body, instead of having a fit and healthy body. Laure helps women (and men) get to the root of their weight issues and overcome them. She creatively makes it fun to exercise and eat more healthy. She makes people be accountable for their own actions without blasting them and making them feel awful.I would DEFINITELY suggest this book to anyone that struggles with unhappiness about their appearance. Laure will help inspire you into taking charge of your own life and making it what you want it to be."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"Feel Great Naked is an excellent book for women who are unhappy with their bodies and looking to making healthy lifestyle changes. Author Laure Redmond--who appears naked on the book's cover--describes a simple, 10-step program which allows women to slowly introduce healthy changes into their lives. Redmond's easy 10 steps are as follows:1. Don't Deprive Yourself. Treat Yourself Once Week.2. Drink Water, Drink Water, Drink Water!3. Watch 10 Minutes of Exercise a Day Change Your Face and Your Life.4. Schedule Fitness Appointments in Writing Each Week.5. Don't Stop Eating. Stop Eating in Front of the TV.6. Pick an Idol and Let That Person Motivate You.7. Breathe Consciously for 5 Minutes Every Day.8. Take 30 Minutes of Private Time Each Day.9. Write Yourself a Love Letter Once a Month.10. Stand Up Straight and Tall.As you can see, none of the above ideas are revolutionary, but Redmond presents them in the form of a uniquely easy-to-follow, comprehensive plan. Furthermore, each step features an inspirational story based on one of Redmond's clients, and she shares motivating insights into her own struggles with weight/body image as well. Finally, as the title suggests, Redmond emphasizes the importance of being comfortable with yourself naked, which she works into her prescribed suggestions.My one (minor) issue with this book is that I think the title is slightly misleading. I already follow most of the guidelines which Redmond recommends, and I was hoping for more specific information on enhancing self-esteem/body comfort--while this information IS included in the book, it's not the main focus. Overall, however, I think this book is a great resource, and I would definitely recommend it to any woman looking for a straightforward guide to making small but vital changes in her life."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"I love this book. Laure writes with honesty and frank discussion about &quot;body hate,&quot; a distressing emotion that we've all encountered at some time during our lives.Laure used to be fat, but she overcame her problems with eating and is now a respected fitness and life-style expert. Her recommendations are simple and easy to follow. Drink lots of water. Treat yourself. Sit up straight. Exercise for 10 minutes a day. In all, there are 10 steps in her program. Nothing is grueling or so difficult that a regular woman (or man!) couldn't handle it.I'm planning on buying this book for my sister and my mom.Give it a try for 8 weeks, and I promise you'll feel better about your body."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"Do you feel good naked? You will after reading what Laure has to say about how we feel about our bodies. She knows of what she speaks......and is an authentic, loving, true, formerly fat girl who learned to accept herself. And more. Laure Redmond gets to the heart of the whole diet/weight/hate syndrome. She makes us WANT to feel good about ourselves, naked or clothed, and tells us how. Please, don't buy another weight loss or self help book. Instead, order Feel Good Naked ... today. You won't be disappointed. You feel liberated, empowered and enlightened. But like anything in life, it only works if you really want to change your habits and self image. It all starts with feeling good naked."},{"Title":"Feel Good Naked: 10 No-Diet Secrets to a Fabulous Body","review":"Laure Redmond has got it figured out. She's real. She's having a great time.

You can make changes but they take effort and you need to set realistic, life-long goals.I originally checked this out from the library and almost didn't get past the intro because of all of her name dropping of all the celebrities with whom she's worked.

The fact is no book, no matter how great is going to be able to help you change your mental body image. That takes more then a book, but the book is a starting place. Body hatred is so rampant these days because we are constantly comparing ourselves to the air brushes of the world. If you are working on loving yourself from the inside out, give this book a read.

As a Civil War story, it is more concerned with characterization and getting inside the minds of the bewildered and frightened young soldiers than in presenting a linear action structure. But this is not to say that Robertson loses focus on the battle at hand. This novel has plenty of action and is quite graphic and realistic in it's descriptions of the battlefield, which are on par with the film Saving Private Ryan in their visceral impact. Having also read Michael Shaara's wonderful CW novel, The Killer Angels, I can tell you that this book and the other two novels in Robertson's trilogy compare very favorably. Not to be missed by Civil War aficionados or fans of great Naturalist writing."},{"Title":"By Antietam Creek","review":"Does anyone remember Omar Tipton, the soldier with the cleft palate, face down in the woods, injured, sucking in wet dirt and leaves?

This one finds Gideon and Julie in the south of France on a trip that was intended to be part vacation and part research excursion for a book Gideon plans to write. It seems a dog has turned up some not-so-old human bones from a prehistoric site in the area. Police Inspector Joly asks Gideon to examine the bones for clues.Like all the other books in this series, Elkins manages to make the examination of a few bones fascinating. There is always some unique bit of information to be gleaned by the trained eye. On the other hand, these aren't the most intriguing mysteries ever. Sometimes the &quot;surprising&quot; developments aren't all that surprising. The clues are clever and the writing is witty, though. Gideon and Julie are familiar, easy-to-like characters and Elkins infuses the stories with a wry sense of humor. The result is a story that keeps the reader entertained and wanting to see what happens next. Even if it only confirms what you thought.I always hesitate to give a Gideon Oliver mystery five stars. These stories aren't really on a par with a classic creation like Sherlock Holmes. Of the light mysteries currently being written, however, these are among my favorites. I look forward to each one and always enjoy them. Inevitably, though, I have enjoyed some more than others. In my opinion, SKELETON DANCE is one of the better ones."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"Despite a nonsensical title, another well-crafted mystery from Dr. Elkins: full of clues and red herrings that give you a chance to anticipate plot twists. Atmospheric bits of real sight-seeing and eating in the southwest of France. More than usual attention to anatomy and skeletal forensics to reveal the surprise biography of the victim, laced with accurate and amusing presentations of current physical anthropological, and Palaeolithic archaeological, debates, with Gideon back in the European setting of two of Elkins' best early novels. Humor enlivens a potentially dry focus on bones: &quot;'How wonderful it must be to live in America,' [French coroner] Roussillot said. 'So many murders, so much to be learned.'&quot; Touche. Light summer reading; a puzzler rather than gripping terror.The Gideon book series could be read starting anywhere; oddly, there's no list of previous titles in this book. Aaron and Charlotte Elkins also write mystery series featuring golfers or art historians, if skeletons are too macabre for you."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"Basic story with average characters. Decent book without anything to write in depth about.I was disappointed with the lack of humor that was supposed to be in the story. I also dislike it when authors wrap a mystery with information that was not shared in the process of the book. While I was able to surmise most of the story line while reading, there was simply too much stuff to fill in the gaps at the end that wasn't in the book.This review is based on the book and the audiobook with George Guidall narrating for Recorded Books."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"Another book in the series featuring the always interesting &quot;skeleton detective&quot; Gideon Oliver. In this outing, a dog discovers a human skeleton which had been buried in a prehistoric cave in Southwestern France. It quickly turns into a murder investigation, and a local police detective calls in Dr. Oliver who, coincidentally, had been planning a research trip through western Europe. Once there, Gideon gets to work examining the remains. After he makes a tentative identification of the victim, everything seems to break loose and a 3-year old murder gets tied up inextricably with an anthropological hoax involving the director of the local Institute of Prehistory and his subsequent fall from grace and supposed demise in a plane crash. Gideon once again finds himself in the position of implicating of his respected colleagues in the dirty goings-on, in addition to finding himself square in the path of a murderer bent on keeping old secrets buried."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"This was my first Elkins book. I like trying new authors. I was impressed with this mystery. The main character,Gideon Oliver, is a Hercule Poirot with a twist.

The accurate information on relevant subjects is fascinating. The pacing is excellent and makes reading a real pleasure."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"As always with Aaron Elkins' books, we are treated to a tour of the area in question. This time, it's a part of France called Les Eyzies-de-Tayac. This is home to the Mus&eacute;e national de Pr&eacute;histoire (National Museum of Prehistory) and lots and lots of caves, which contain several important archaeological sites.Gideon and his wife check into the Hotel Cro-Magnon (a real place, see [...]), which is literally on the site of the discovery of Cro-Magnon man.We get lots of history, and descriptions of luscious menus of the region.The assortment of characters (scientists at the museum) are colorful and unique. Everyone becomes a suspect, and a friend. We go on a merry chase, trying to sort out all the clues, wandering all over the region.We learn a great deal about Cro-Magnon man, Neanderthals (and the difference), about bones, and more interesting ways to identify information about the person even when you only have a portion of the body. Elkins shares fascinating tidbits from his wealth of experiences as a forensic anthropologist.Some of the mystery, I figured out early on. But the ending is a bit of surprise.As ever, this was a lot of fun!(My only regret? I first discovered Aaron and Charlotte Elkins in June. As of now (Sept 6), I have finished reading their reading nearly every fictional work they have ever produced. I have only two books to go...please, please, finish the next one soon!)"},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"A fine author. I just felt this one fell a little flat for me personally. I enjoyed some of Julie's revelations toward the solution. And as always, I enjoyed Professor Oliver's inspection of the bones and time spent along those lines. Joly was fun. But this one wasn't my favorite. The institute characters were dull and annoying. I think I liked Twenty Blue Devils better for teaching me about the coffee farming business, and that one, IMHO, had a more interesting, and satisfying, ending. I just finished GOOD BLOOD (#9?) and LOVED that one. For a good mystery, I also enjoy authors Elizabeth Peters, Anne Perry, David Lindsey, and Nancy Atherton."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"My daughter had a really primitive computer game called 'Oregon Trail' where you would click on a person and that person would give you information. That is this book in a nutshell. Nothing much happens here except talking and talking and talking and talking and talking, and even then, not to real characters, but to a cardboard drawing so two-dimensional that his or her mouth doesn't even move.How about this for some terrible writing: Gideon has been chasing a killer, well, talking to a bunch of really cliche people about a killer who uses an AIR RIFLE for the last way-too many-pages, when another character he clicked on told him that the guy who disappeared didn't enjoy anything so much as anthropolgy, flying, and shooting his AIR RIFLE. Thanks! says Gideon and then walks away (walking away constitutes heart-stopping action in this blah-blah-blah 'mystery'). Then of course he freezes in his steps. AIR RIFLE! Better click on that character again. So the picture of the anthropologist's face duly vomits up loads of information about the make and model of the AIR RIFLE, where it is manufactured and what kind of ammunition it needs. Sure, all of the anthropologists I know are munitions experts. That's when I took this stupid book and gave it the fling against the wall. Give me my life back that I wasted on this book! I want it back. When I was younger I would have wiped my bottom with this book as well, because toilet paper it must be, it certainly is NOT reading material.I'm home sick and I'd rather examine my sputum than read another sentence of this stupid book. It's just terrible. How do books like this one get published? I just don't get it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"This is typical of the series. The characters are fine to spend time with, the puzzle grows more complex and there are nice twists related to bones. Unfortunately some questions of who did what are not dealt with succesfully. But all in all it's a good read. On a related note, I would like to see more of the author's wife's series on golf."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"I have been an avid reader of all Aaron Elkins books but I had a difficult time getting through Skeleton Dance.It's so slow moving and a bit boring."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"I wanted to wait a few days after I got this book to read it because I knew that if it was a good one, it would only take a day to read - and it only took a day. My house is a mess, but I spent a very enjoyable day with my nose stuck in this book, and it was nice to revisit some old friends in this latest Gideon Oliver book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"Aaron Elkins has written another enjoyable Gideon Oliver mystery. Anyone who enjoys richly detailled exotic settings and an unusual assortment of clues to puzzle over will enjoy this book. The author regales the reader with lovely descriptions of pastoral France as well as some pretty intriguing anthropological data (e.g. the current new twists on an old debate about the human qualities of the Cro Magnon vs. the Neanderthal add color to the central conflict of this mystery). Unfortunately, the dialogue between characters in SKELETON DANCE is not as witty and smooth as in earlier books of the series. Since Elkins relies primarily on dialogue to flesh out his characters, the book suffers a bit in this regard. Still, as the season of lazy afternoons is almost upon us, the book is a good addition to any bach bag or picnic pack."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"I have read &quot;Loot&quot; by Aaron Elkins and found that art can be a great center for a mystery novel. I was a little skeptical that Elkins series revolving around an archaeology would be as good. I am glad I gave it a shot. Gideon Oliver the main character in this series is a wonderful character that any mystery fan can get into.The story starts when a local dog starts bring home human bones from a cave in France. However these bones are no remains of any old Cro-magnon. These are much to new. Oliver is brought in to determine the age of the bones, and slowly uncovers a scandal in the local institute of archaeology. At the institute is a group of possible suspects of the unknown victim in the cave. Oliver along with detective Joly must put all the pieces together to solve this tricky murder.This novel remains me of Agatha Christie, with it's uniquue locatons and list of suspects. Elkins has a great ability to weace a great story along with not the most enthralling topics. However he makes it work and should be on everyones too read list."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"Forensic anthropologist Professor Gideon Oliver and his wife Julie are on vacation when his old friend Inspector Lucien Jolly asks for his help. The finding of bones in caves near Les Eyzies-de-Tayac is the norm as this locale is the center of numerous prehistoric finds including skeletons. However, these bones are human remains of the late twentieth century.Gideon was planning to come to the area to do research on hoaxes for his book. He changes his schedule and arrives at the famous site. Gideon begins an investigation into the modern bones. Other murders soon follow as Gideon gets closer to the truth that prove scientists can be as cold blooded as the extinct species they study.The return of Professor Oliver will please fans of anthropologic mysteries. His current tale, SKELETON DANCE, is an intriguing story that will entertain fans with its red herrings turning it into a difficult puzzler. The story line is slower than the Edgar Award winning OLD BONES although the novel remains fun to read. Action gurus should pass, but anyone who relishes a cerebral mystery will gain much pleasure from Aaron Elkins' latest who-done-it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"This is a amusing book. For readers who like their mysteries to have some basis in fact and preferably a foot in reality, this is a series with definite promise. Scientists are not as free from emotions and prejudices as the general public has been led to believe, and Aaron Elkins plays on this knowledge with terrific results. This was the first time I had picked up a mystery with the Professor Gideon Oliver in it. Since I love forensics and enjoy archaeology when it is well-written about, this book was loads of fun. The author gives plenty of background to the story plot; he makes sure that the fictional web he weaves has enough information for the general reader to understand the science behind the mystery without wasting a lot of words or time. I was fascinated by the descriptions of the 'abris', the information on how 'fakes' are made to look old, and the knowledge about the arguments in the anthropological sciences. Actually the basis of the whole story lies in professional jealousy, which is not far-fetched at all (I saw too many scientists who wanted to prove their theories at any cost, and have read about more!).I have never been to France so I have to take Elkin's word for his descriptions of this area of the world. His detailed account of both the countryside, and the anthropological discoveries makes for outstanding color and background for the mystery plot. I got a kick out of his narration of the little towns in this area of France who are proud of their place in science, and the picture he drew of all the townspeople going to listen to lectures on the anthropology discoveries in their area. How nice it would be if Americans would put as much interest into science and their own histories!As other reviewers have said, the story line was a tad slow, but well worth the wait. It is nice to find another intelligent mystery writer. His writing is better than good, his descriptions are wonderful, characterization is pretty good, and his plot line and the science involved are fantastic. This is a definite 'must-read' addition to my list of authors.

In &quot;Skeleton Dance,&quot; Aaron Elkins mails it in.Elkins has proven himself a talented writer and a creator of compelling and highly readable mysteries. He won much deserved acclaim for his Gideon Oliver series, and his most recent novel, &quot;Loot&quot; (which is not in the series), is even better. &quot;Skeleton Dance,&quot; his latest Gideon Oliver mystery, is a mess. Elkins is barely going through the motions here, and in a not very successful manner. The plot is as thin as can be, the characters are all two-dimensional stereotypes, and the writing is at times terrible. Consider this sentence from the very first page of the book:&quot;A moment later a squarish, black head with glistening, excited eyes and a mouth filled with shearing, crushing teeth thrust itself into the entrance, low to the ground.&quot;To my mind, that's a textbook example of bad writing (why use one adjective when you can use six?). Or consider this chapter opening:&quot;Inasmuch as the session wasn't scheduled until two in the afternoon, they decided to take the morning off and relax.&quot;\\"Inasmuch\\"?Later in the story, in a bid to create tension, Elkins reverts to the cheapest and most hackneyed of mystery-writing devices. A key witness calls the detective on the phone, and tells him, &quot;I have a dreadful confession...&quot; Naturally, he cannot reveal his startling news over the telephone, and our hero agrees to meet with him in person. I'm not giving anything away by saying that, of course, the detective arrives at their arranged meeting place only to find the witness murdered (and I say &quot;I'm not giving anything away&quot; because even a reader unfamiliar with mysteries will have already guessed as much, the set-up is so clich&eacute;d and obvious).Worst of all, when the story finally gets interesting, it ends very abruptly and the murderer is peremptorily revealed, almost as if Elkins has just given up and decided to get it over with. In fact, at a mere 246 pages, this reader at least feels he certainly didn't get his $23.00 worth. My advice is to skip this one and try one of Elkins's early Gideon Oliver novels, or even better, the excellent &quot;Loot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"I would describe this book as well-crafted but not a page-turner.

ALso, this story, which takes place at a French institute for paleo-anthropology, has too many characters introduced at one time and without giving us a feel for really knowing any of the &quot;suspects.&quot; On the other hand, I was interested in the discussions about Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon archeological sites and theories, and the author is clearly knowledgable."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"I was ecstatic when learned in February that a new Gideon Oliver mystery was about to be released. As the previous reviewer states, however, this is not as good as Elkins' earlier books. This is much better than Twenty Blue Devils, but the characters are primarily painted through their conversations, and I grew tired of how many people said &quot;um, hmmm,&quot; etc. In his earlier Gideon Oliver novels there was much less dialogue, and thus better stories. Old Bones and Dead Man's Hearts still stand out in this series. If you love the series, read this one; if you've not yet been hooked by Gideon's discovery of murder through bones, start with an earlier title and come back for this one when it hits paperback."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"&quot;Skeleton Bones&quot; is a delightful entry in the series of mysteries featuring Gideon Oliver, also known as the &quot;Skeleton Detective&quot; (a name that Gideon hates). One noteworthy aspect of the &quot;Gideon Oliver books&quot; is the wonderful camraderie that exists between Gideon and his wife, Julie. Rarely does a married couple add to a mystery novel, but Gideon and Julie are both intelligent and witty, and there is genuine chemistry between them. &quot;Skeleton Dance&quot; takes place in the small French town of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, home to many prehistoric fossils. Gideon is there with Julie to do research for his new book, but he is sidetracked by the discovery of bones that are far from prehistoric. A very amusing police inspector, named Lucien Jolie, is an old friend of Gideon, and together the two men try to figure out who is responsible for a series of mysterious murders. The characters in the book, most of whom are eccentric scientists, are delightfully depicted and the tone is light throughout. My only quibble is that the solution to the mystery is a bit forced, but I do recommend &quot;Skeleton Dance&quot; for fans of light mysteries."},{"Title":"Skeleton Dance","review":"When a modern skeleton turns up in a French Paleolithic cave, the local police call on visiting American archaeologist and &quot;skeleton detective&quot; Gideon Oliver to help identify the bones. Already probing at a sensitive wound (a fossil hoax perpetrated on - or by - the Insitut de Prehistoire in that very same cave) for a popular book he's writing on archaeological blunders, Oliver soon finds relations with his old academic Institut friends strained.Edgar winner Aaron Elkins delivers the sort of witty, well-paced bone puzzle readers of his Oliver series have come to expect. Poking gentle fun at mainstream publishing, the ferocious arguments of academia and French and American cultural differences, Elkins heaps up murder and mayhem while Oliver's wife Julie attempts to enjoy her vacation. The rural setting, in the midst of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon fossil-filled caves, and the smattering of science adds to the enjoyment of Oliver's spectacular Holmes-like bone reading and the friendly and productive relationship with his wife."},{"Title":"War Horse: Mounting the Cavalry with America's Finest Horses","review":"As the director of an history museum I am often asked to review books and such was the case of War Horse. I was amazed at the scholarship that went into this wonderful book. Its told as a story of the U S Army Remount service which supplied a standard mount for the Cavalry but much more it tells the story of the development of a &quot;using&quot; kind of horse. One of the best parts of the book are the wonderful side bar stories and photos about everyone from George Patton to Francis the talking mule! The complete data on almost every aspect of breading the war horse will make this book a valuable reference. If you like horses or if you just want to know how one of our country's first mass produced war machines was developed this needs to be in your hands.

The U.S. Cavalry found out the hardway that they needed better horses to perform their essential tasks. This book describes how they went about obtaining those 'better horses'. This is a little known 'Arms Race' that happened at the turn of the Twentieth Century. It's result is a destribution of quality horses to the American Public of unprecidented proportions. Scarely any breed has remain unaltered by this Remount program's benifits. Great History, Great Reading. Well illustrated and profusely researched and documented."},{"Title":"Working High Magick","review":"This book is excellent value for money and covers most details of 'High Magick' by explaining what high magick is and there are lots of spells and charms inside this book and I think I spied a couple of bits of black magick in it which I know lots of people are interested in. I did not buy this book from amazon but got it from a little corner shop somewhere in Scotland and paid well over [...]for it which is probably about [...]. Almost everything inside it is useful and the ingredients of some of the charms or spells could probably be bought in your local supermarket! It is a weighty book (at least 2\\"-3\\" thick) and covers every spell imaginable and how to reverse hexes or curses which are placed on you. Anyone who buys this book should know that I have tried a few of the spells concealed in here and they work! If you are reading this review-BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS WORTH [...]! I have a couple of other books by Nelson.H.White and each and every one of them are interesting! I would also recommend these type of books by Gillian Kemp and Pamela Ball.

The range maps of the various species are also quite excellent. As a life-long naturalist I have found this book to be very easy to use and I always take it along on outings, especially when I travel north.This work is sort of an \\"official\\" one, first being published in 1917 and detailing about 100 trees at that time. Since then the book has undergone numerous revisions and now covers nearly 140 tree species. There is a technical guide in the front of the book which explains some of the jargon (both in text and by illustration) including leaf types.The softcover Eighth Edition, published in 1990, is 380 pages in length which includes the index and various \\"keys\\" to identification. Of all my numerous tree books, (about 60), this comprehensive and authoritative work is in my top five.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Glossary Epistemology (Paragon House Glossary for Research, Reading and Writing)","review":"Very useful book for someone interested in philosophy and methodology of science as a professional career or master studies or for someone ho is preparing an article or even a theses in these fields."},{"Title":"The Silver Dolphin","review":"One of my freinds passed this book on to me and I read it while in Hawaii on vacation. Great read! The story is about a woman who swims with dolphins and how her husband is hurt. She falls in love with someone else but fights it evry step of the way. Her anguesh and the battles she has to fight make the book more interesting than the ordingary romance. I couldn't put it down and want to read another by this author but can't find any more."},{"Title":"The Silver Dolphin","review":"I loved The Silver Dolphin, and so did my two teenaged daughters. By the time we were finished with it, the book was dog-eared and badly needed replacement! Well, let's face it, who hasn't wanted to swim with dolphins at least once in her life? I felt a special affinity for the heroine, Carrie, who reacted to her husband's accident in a way many women, including me, might. The setting in Hawaii didn't hurt,either, especially during a long cold Vermont winter! It was truly hard to put this book down. One of my daughters has read it three times, and we have looked for other books by this author, but in vain."},{"Title":"The Silver Dolphin","review":"I love it when authors don't sugarcoat their characters and when they make mistakes like I do. Lord not only does that with this book, but she sets it in Hawaii, one of the most beautiful places in the world. Her descriptions are accurate and full of imagery. Her story is fast-paced and suspenseful. And the subplots are strong and moving--especially the one with Carrie's mother and her Japanese lover. I loved this book. It's real, enjoyable, and well written. Bring on more!"},{"Title":"The Silver Dolphin","review":"This book is poorly written. Nothing happens that is very exciting or unexpected and the ending is just drivel. Most of it is boring and I guess lifelike, and some elements are just far too far-fetched to be believable. The setting is the only redeeming feature of the book. I read it all to see how it came out and it just never got better and I feel like I really wasted my time. I came here to review it so you don't waste yours to read it. I guess the good part here is that I'm inspired to write a work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Silver Dolphin","review":"I found the book dry and the characters boring. Carrie Debary was the heroine--and I use the word loosely. There was nothing heroic about Carrie's behavior. Her husband, Alex was involved in a boating accident, which left him paralyzed, and instead of watching out for her husband, CArrie was contemplating having an affair with the man that worked for her and her husband.Carrie was so low-class with no redeeming qualities. While her husband was in a convalescent home, trying to regain the use of his legs, Carrie was running around on a motorcycle with a man she had the hots for, and drinking beer. There was a scene that showed Carrie drinking these men under the table. She was just terrible, as was the book.

It is simple to understand and teach. I coach a 7 year old team in Southern Ohio (Clermont County). We used one play from this book 95% of the time. The play was a fullback dive, with an option to hand off to the wing back or have the QB keep it. With the principles in this book, we compiled an 8-1 record and division title our first year ('00). It's a great starting book for those looking to develop an offensive play book/plan. Enjoy and Good Luck!Also recommended: Radar Blocking by J.

Because it was published in 1999, I thought it would be up to date, but it was woefully inadequate. For example, the growing area of the so-called &quot;Maya Rivera,&quot; for which I was particularly interested, is not current with the majority of resorts there. Also, I didn't feel Cancun was adequately covered.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Frommers (Fodor's too was not very current either), but I was very disappointed in this purchase."},{"Title":"Frommer's 99 Cancun, Cozumel & the Yucatan (Frommer's Cancun, Cozumel and the Yucatan)","review":"Complaints about this book:1.

Anyone wanting to do the same should read this book. There is new paradigm today for voiceovers that involves finding the human emotion in a script and conveying that emotion to the listener. That's why voiceover people are actors not announcers. But Adrian Cronauer's book is still a valuable exercise in the basics of copy interpretation. Before you can perform copy as an actor you have to know how to interpret copy--to make the writers words sound like they're your own and that you're speaking them just as you're thinking them. I hear many voiceovers, even on national spots, that break some of these basic rules. And when that happens it draws attention to the voiceover. The voice should be transparent--you shouldn't even hear the voice--only the message. The voice should be like a clean window, which only draws attention to the view, not a dirty window which draws attention to itself. The section of this book on marketing your talents is a bit outdated and there are many other fine books on that aspect of the business. But, all in all, this is a must read for anyone wanting to do voice-acting for commercials."},{"Title":"How to Read Copy: Professionals' Guide to Delivering Voice-Overs and Broadcast Commercials","review":"Yes, this is the real Adrian Cronauer of &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam!&quot; fame. And this book is heavily influenced by the radio of that era -- it's all about reading &quot;spokes&quot; copy, where an anonymous spokesperson describes a product or announces a sale. It sounds just like what you might hear on, say, a network radio program in the 60's sponsored by Anacin.Cronauer provides an audio cassette accompanying the text, and the reader is periodically asked to stop reading the book and listen to a specific cut on the tape. Unspecified but dire consequences are promised to anyone who continues to read without listening to the designated audio cut, or who dares to listen to more then one cut at a time. Only about half the cuts make points that are not already self-evident from the text.The book correctly emphasizes the need to sound relaxed and conversational in voiceover work, and provides a number of specific, if dogmatic, rules for how to deal with particular issues in spokes copy. Yet the reader is left with the vaguely dissatisfied sense that something is missing. With all the rules about what not to do, or where and where not to place emphasis, there seems little room for personality to enter the work. Although the author lionizes voiceover legends such as Mason Adams (even reproducing a &quot;Smuckers&quot; ad on the accompanying cassette), he provides no real clue to what makes such people so successful.It's as if the whole is less than the sum of its parts. There is value here, if the reader is willing to persevere through the minutiae of when to emphasize personal pronouns, how to handle definite and indefinite articles, how to distinguish function words from content words, when to end a question with an up-inflection versus a down-inflection, and so on. But the result of such mastery may have limited real-world value in today's voiceover market, because straight spokes copy is not as common now as it once was.Bottom line: An interesting book, but probably not a &quot;must-have.&quot;"},{"Title":"How to Read Copy: Professionals' Guide to Delivering Voice-Overs and Broadcast Commercials","review":"Yes, this is the real Adrian Cronauer of &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam!&quot; fame.

Some warnings for novice readers, there'll walkthroughs of graphical wizards, and this book is not for the light-hearted; it will require some basic understanding of technologies like Kerberos. Though if this is not a problem, this has clear explanations that will illuminate the inner secrets of Windows infrastructure without the need to be a rocket scientist for understanding.Some parts that I really much appreciated were scenarios about Windows interoperability. In particular, De Clerq detailed methods to integrate LDAP-Kerberos single-sign-on solutions with a Windows domain controller, or with Kerberos cross-realm trust. He should the various freeware solutions, but also delved into Vintella's (now own by Quest) solutions, and later touched on SAMBA's Active Directory integration. Additionally, he details how much in the way of standards Microsoft implements, and what proprietary additions Microsoft adds to Kerberos.I didn't get a chance to go deep into other chapters, but I briefly looking at them, I know De Cleq will give you a full understanding of the authentication process and also of the authorization process. He has some excellent sections on PKI infrastructure, something I am most interested (and sometimes confused about). I am most eager to really go through this book.Bottomline...

Hence this is an overview of contemporary mathematics, at about the level of a fully competent BA graduate, by someone fully qualified to talk about math. Important points. (1) MacLane is an expert on algebra and gives many examples of the unifying power of abstract algebra. (2) The book includes passages that amount to a gentle introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. MacLane takes exception to what philosophers have written about math, in part because they don't know enough math. (3) This book is also a good introduction to MacLane's radical claim that set theory is an inadequate foundation for math, and that the category theory he coinvented is better for this purpose. (4) Includes many fascinating &quot;road maps&quot; or &quot;flow charts&quot; of the intricate connections among the many branches and topics of mathematics.Slight disappointment: MacLane does not do justice to the lattice theory his frequent coauthor, Garret Birkhoff, did so much to advance."},{"Title":"Mathematics: Form and Function","review":"This is a survey of the whole of mathematics, at the undergraduate level, which attempts to give the &quot;big picture&quot;. If you read and understand it, you will have a better grasp of this big picture than most graduate students. MacLane has written a book which every mathematician (and perhaps philosopher) should read and savour.There are few technical details in this book. It is not a textbook per se, but a beautiful exposition of mathematics as a whole. It is not for learning any specific topic from; rather it is about appreciating the structure of mathematics as a whole, so that you know how each specific topic stands within that structure.Indeed, this is an excellent book. Too bad for fashion that it is out-of-print.N.B. There is a more advanced and technical book by Jean Dieudonne along the same lines.

Each discipline has its own chapter, and the chapters are arranged into three sections: Sociocultural Perspectives, Physical and Physiological Perspectives, and Psychological Perspectives.

The tortured, misunderstood hero, who may have murdered his unwilling bride. The intrepid widowed music teacher with her own secrets and regrets.

The heroine's challenge: determining innocence, guilt and deceit in a closeknit,self protective community. Can she stay alive, solve the disappearances and find true love?I think that this is one of Holt's most entertaining novels. It works as a romance and a mystery."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"A couple years ago, I found this book in a box of other used books each selling for a couple quarters and decided I'd buy it for my mother's birthday. I guess I secretly wanted to read it myself, but it was lost in the shuffle of things before either of us was given the chance to read it. Recently, I went to New Hampshire, and found it in my family's cabin. If you're someone who, like me, does in fact judge a book by it's cover, you would have been drawn to this book immediately. The 1969 edition that I have (I guess my mother didn't want it after all) has a painting on the cover of a girl standing on a cliff over the waves smashing into the rocks below. This scene was what persuaded me into reading the first page.What a mystery. A widow works incognito as a piano teacher to solve the mystery of her sister's disappearance. The title may give it away, but throughout the book, the reader is given many chances to figure out who, how, and why before it is actually revealed. There is an eerie &quot;haunted&quot; mansion, lots of shocking secrets, desire, and many disturbing encounters. This was a perfect introduction to Victoria Holt. Read it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"This review is for the Doubleday & Company hardback edition, undated but probably 1969 312 pages of story. THE SHIVERING SANDS did not make the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list, as USA Today did not begin tracking book sales until October 1993. Victoria Holt has two later novels on this best-seller list.Carolina Verlaine suffered tragedies. Her parents, both archeologists, died in a train crash in route to a dig. She forfeited a promising career as a pianist in deference to her husband Pietro who was more talented, but he dies, leaving Carolina a widow at age 28. Then Carolina's only sister, Roma Brandon, also an archeologist, disappears just as her team finishes excavating Roman ruins at the Lovat Stacy estate in eastern England. Carolina's former piano teacher who is teaching four young women at Lovat Stacy decides to retire and recommends Carolina to replace her, but without mentioning to her employer that Carolina is Roma's sister. Carolina, determined to learn what happened to her Roma, accepts the position without revealing her relationship to Roma.The story, in the 1880s, is set in near Deal on the eastern shores of the United Kingdom. Four to six miles east of Deal, across the Downs channel, lays the Goodwin Sands, shifting quicksand. Over the past couple centuries, the Goodwin Sands became the graveyard for an estimated 2000 vessels. Although Lovat Stacy and the nearby village, Lovat Mill, are fictional, the actual village Martin Mill appears to be close to the fictional setting between the exiting Walmer and Dover castles.The story gradually reveals the tragedies of the Stacy household over the past several decades leading to the conflicts and intrigues in the narrative present. SHIVERING SANDS is well written in the first person, giving Carolina the only point of view, which keeps the reader engaged in trying to solve the mysteries of Lovat Stacy along with her.After reading three best selling contemporary romance thrillers, which I rated three stars, I found THE SHIVERING SANDS without a dust jacket amongst our books of unknown origin. I began reading it without knowing the genre. What a nice surprise. This is a five-star historical, romance, mystery, psychological thriller."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"Caroline Verlaine was alone in the world, her husband Pietro, a brilliant concert pianist had died soon after their marriage, but not before Caroline had given up her own chances as a performer. Her only sister, Roma, had now disappeared mysteriously while working on an archeological dig of Roman ruins in the English countryside. Roma had followed in their late parents footsteps and studied archeology, Caroline had always been the outsider in the family and pursued music. When an opportunity arose for Caroline to take a post as music teacher to the children of the estate where Roma had been working Caroline took it with the idea to find out what happened to Roma.Caroline soon found herself enmeshed in the lives and scandals of estate and village of Lovat Stacey, including her students - shy Edith soon to wed Napier, the heir, quiet Alice, the housekeepers daughter, lively Allegra, Napier's illegitimate child and Sylvia, the vicar's daughter and the rest of the household - Sir William the patriarch of the family, his ne'er-do-well son Napier, Mrs. Lincroft, the housekeeper and Sybil, Sir William's sister as well as the ever present ghosts of Sir William's dead wife, Isabel and favorite son Beau. As Caroline began to sort out the truth from the lies and gradually uncover what had happened to Roma new complications arose in the unwanted attentions of Napier and the comforting ones of the new curate.This is a romance novel in the finest tradition, young heroine with a sad past finds herself in a romantic isolated spot as teacher/governess/companion to a wealthy family swept into danger complicated by old scandals and pursued by two handsome men. The formula never varies, the appeal is the variations on the theme, the clever twists and turns the author inserts into the story. Few do this better than Holt, her heroines come to life, the twists in the plot come as a total surprise, keeping the reader guessing until the end."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"Victoria Holt does it again in yet another spectcular Gothic romance, full of suspense and chilling atmosphere.

I could reread the book again tonight - since I have been buying as many of her books as I can afford, I must keep reading another and another. Wish I could afford the $400.00 ones, c.1941.

I am not American so my background could be a disadvantage and an advantage. The first difficulty with this book is the density of the writing. It is not easy to get through the book quickly. Attached to that is the the author assumes some prior knowledge on the part of the reader. For example, Adam Smith is quoted quite a bit but how many people know who Smith is? But then again, if one did not know about Smith, would one be reading Chomsky anyway?There are plenty of reviews which provide a sketch of the book's pathway. I am not sure how many Americans (or British for that matter) would relish the points Chomsky is making. However, our democracy says he should be allowed to and everyone reading the book can make up their own minds. There certainly is plenty of connection that can be made between the treatment of indigenous people in the USA and Australia. In the name of stability races and economies were demolished.Chomsky makes you read slowly and reflectively. There is a benefit to this as the reader can stop and ponder whether the issues are validly presented or not.There is no doubt about the depth of referencing (six pages of close type). Should the discerning reader wish to research further there is plenty of opportunity here.Some say that Chomsky has passed his shelf life. Who says that? If he is able to write and make some points indigestible for some then those people need to show how the author is wrong. I am not sure he is. I think he is presenting a point of view which some blind Americans (and others) may find distasteful. But that's western existence for you."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Another excellent book by chomsky.Two of the main recuring themes in this book are dependence on capitalism on the state through various subsidies and control. Ranging from early US protectionism, IMF planning of many third world economies and how even the most 'laisez faire' nations have all had enourmous regulation. Such as chile under pinochet.Espicially good are the chapters on cuba and the third worldazation of south america.A book no one should go without reading."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Professor Chomsky provides, as always, a stunning analysis of how power overrides stated principle. Chomsky's method is simple: use the same standards of evidence in understanding U.S. policy as one would in a discussion of the policies of any other power. I can understand Mr.Kamm's reluctance to discover any merit in this work as someone either totally ignorant of Chomsky's work or blinded by his own ideological fantasies of &quot;free-market fairness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"From Hispaniola to Haiti, from Cuba to Cambodia, Noam Chomskyfs daunting research, insightful commentary and scathing critiques help readers to formulate a more objective view of the post-Columbus-invasion era than is proffered in traditional histories. Year 501 is an invaluable reference for anyone wishing to refute the Lee Edwards, Henry Kissingers, Arthur Schlesingers and David Irvings of the right-wing revisionist historian guild. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Another excellent book from Chomsky that details the contradictions between actual American foreign policy and the disingenious attempts to cloud the debate by those complicitly supporting the elites (including the mainstream media, government bureaucrats, the corporate sector, etc.). A worthy addition for those enlightened enough to see through the nonsense that masquerades as political/economic discourse in America; for the rest (or those new to Chomsky) the book provides a nice detailed introduction to some of Chomsky's core themes (globalization, the role of the media, the corporate influence on political agendas and specific legislation, etc.) that shape American foreign policy"},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"This is a powerful book indeed. The facts are there for those willing to check them out. For some people this maybe hard to acknowledge , but Chomsky is writing an account of History that everybody should take a time to read and investigate.

A simply brilliant literary work."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Don't let the critics fool you, this is an excellent study on the economic, social and cultural history of the &quot;New World&quot;.

If you are a student of history, sociology, political science or economics you cannot consider yourself well read without reading this book."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Year 501 is a much needed antidote to the heaps of white-washed history and biased narrative produced on the past. In this vitally important work esteemed scholar and political activist Noam Chomsky, using the 500th anniversary of Columbus' washing ashore on Hispanola, dissects the history of the most serious and sustained campaigns of annihilation that the world has ever known. In these 500 plus years the indigenous populations of the Americas have have been reduced by over 90% and based on even the most conservative estimates this amounts to a population decline in the contiguous US alone of 18 million at their pre-Columbian levels to only 200,000 by 1910. This unprescedented figure speaks volumes on its own, the important thing that Chomsky offers in Year 501, however, is in his reasoned explanation of it. He does not simply focus on the actions of the europeans, instead he attempts to analyze the reasoning that sought to justify it, which as is still the casee today was/is almost exclusively driven by financial motives. And as one can see by the commonly insipid and wholly ad hominem criticisms heaped upon Noam Chomsky these facts cannot be logically refuted, for those selfsame critics are unable, no unwilling, to confront the true face of the devastation that colonialism has wrought.Although, it has long been in fashion to willing and knowingly distort and suppress these \\"distastful\\" facts, as one Harvard historian has referred to them, what this refusal to confront the legacy of colonialism amounts to is precisely what Chomsky calls the \\"murder of history\\" in this work. Chomsky is known for his intellectual prowess and reasoned expositions in the face of such illogic, to wit someone at the NY Times (not a bastion of liberalism by any stretch of the imagination)even ranked him as the 9th most important intellectual of all time, just behind Aristotle. After reading this excellent work of history you will see why. Year 501 is a must read for anyone who desires to understand the true history of the colonial enterprise and the excessive human costs which continue to support it."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Don't let the critics fool you, this is an excellent study on the economic, social and cultural history of the &quot;New World&quot;.

So I occasionally borrow one from a local library that makes a point of having some garbage on hand for those that truly appreciate the bouquet of detritus.Noam Chomsky caters to those that hate freedom and democracy but claim otherwise. This fraternity, fast disappearing in face of the international Muslim terrorism that does not accept live Jews or Christians as part of their secret organization, is now down to a few hundred lost souls spread all over the world. It is enough to check the number of books by Noam Chomsky sold over a given period of time to realize his utter decadence, even among the academia. His advanced age is no excuse for the ideas that embarrass all those that are part of his immediate entourage.In this book he thunders against the West - one of his favorite targets apart from Israel and the Jews - while trying hard to defend all those that are against America and the civilized world. Any moment now, Chomsky will write a book on how innocent all Muslim terrorists are. And soon, he will follow with another masterpiece on how misunderstood the followers of Muhammad, the inventor of Islam, have been throughout history. Among Chomsky's invaluable qualities, one cannot include \\"fair and balanced posture\\". This is more than evident. But then, this is his trademark: a senile rabble-rouser without cause or reason."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"This is a book by Chomsky that is probably even more scholarly than usual. At least in the way it is written. Chomsky wrote this book on the 500th anniversary in 1992 of the beginnings of the invasion of much of the world of what Adam Smith refered to, in a rather narrow context as \\"the savage injustice of the Europeans (\\"revealing himself to be an early practicioner of the crime of 'political correctness,'\\"Chomsky comments sardonically)\\". Chomsky begins his survey by analyzing the policies of the major European powers and the United States as they grew to dominate the world. Such policies., he explains, are not the free market doctrines stressed by right wing talk radio hosts, University of Chicago professors and other such bores and frauds but by massive state subsides, huge tarrifs to block foreign competitors, extreme violence and colonial occupation.Places like India and Bengal (Bangladesh) which were highly advanced industrial societies by the mid-1700's but all of the industries which were superior to their counterparts in Britain were deliberately undermined or simply forced out of existence by the British colonisers. India and Bangladesh became extremely poor, feudal agricultural countries supplying Britain with raw materials and as a captive market for British goods. The latter is a familiar pattern outlined by Chomsky in this book. The West, since World war II, dominated by the U.S., has always sought any way it could to block advanced economic development in the third world. The exceptions to this that Chomsky points to are Japan and its former colonies in Asia who violated all the laws of the free market to create very dynamic, if, of course, very far from perfect economies. The British, noted Chomsky, started to adopt \\"free trade\\" as policy as the United States would do later under similar circumstances, around 1846 when they had no competitors in their field but this changed around 1930 when they, along with the Americans, French and Dutch erected high tarrif walls around Japanese exports to their colonies in Asia with which they could not compete, a major factor in staring Japan's wars of conquest.He examines the U.S. role in the slaugter of half a million people in Indonesia in 1965 as the independent nationalist Sukarno was overthrown and \\"a staggering mass slaughter of communists and pro-communits.\\" The U.S. media, rejoyced at the massacre of landless peasants and the destruction of the only mass-based political party the communist PKI. General Suharto took power initiating ongoing plunder and exploitaion of Indonesia's resources by Western corporations while engaging in mass murder in the U.S. backed occupation of East Timor and elsewhere. He examines the media reaction to this slaugter and the reaction back in 1990 when this great event was brought up again by Kathy Kadane.He examines the showcases of capitalism in the third world like Brazil, whose liberal capitalist president Goulart was overthrown in 1964 with U.S. aid by a group of Neo-nazi generals who compiled over the next few decades a truly horrific human rights record but who were praised for producing an \\"economic miracle\\" as the population sunk into quite horrific levels of malnourishment and disease and land became ever more concentrated in fewer hands and millions of street children arose in the big cities. And Nicaragua where the massive terrorism, celebrated by the media liberals that Chomsky quotes, brought to force upon the Nicaraguan people a defeat of the Sandanistas in \\"democratic election\\" in 1990 (the 1984 election won by the Sandinstas dissapearing into the memory hole). This has predictably resulted in a terrible rise in starvation and disease and drug running and street children and on.He continues with an in-depth examination of the woes of Haiti and the American and Western efforts to ravage it since 1804, and particularly since 1915 when the U.S. invaded and reestablished virtual slavery, with a U.S. imposed constitution ratified with five percent of the voting public participainting under the U.S. marine bayonets, reversing the ban on foreign ownership of land.He compares the podering of the unique evil of Japan in being unable to fully face up to their past crimes and the comparable ignoring of things like the hundreds of thousand of tortured victims of U.S. chemical warfare in South Vietname, which occasionally elicits a comment in the science pages of the newspapers about how we are missing a great opportunity to study the effects of dioxin on a control population"},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Don't believe the critics for a second without reading for yourself. As alway, Chomsky states what is unthinkable in standard circles: that the free market is first of all a lie and second of all a disaster for world economies. A lie, because it is hypocritically championed by the US and Europe, who do not practice a 'free market' at all, except when it serves their interests; and a disaster, based on unending research on the real consequences of opening up Third world economies to foreign investment - leading to a near inevitable decline in wages, rise in unemployment, end of free speech, control by foreign interests, and brutal, usually murderous suppression of the vast majority of the population by the &quot;friends of democracy&quot;.Yes, this sounds like a paranoid left-wing conspiracy theory, especially given that the unending stream of facts presented by Chomsky are almost entirely omitted from mainstream discourse, even in such 'left-leaning' forums as the NY Times and the New Republic. Combine that with Chomsky's biting irony, and it is easy to go up in arms against him as a fringe figure with a &quot;breathtaking ignorance of economics&quot; - or at least the orthodox version of economic theory that so selectively pays attention to the most glaring of facts. It is easy to dismiss as &quot;politics more commonly found on bumper stickers&quot;. But these reactions are beyond unfair for such comprehensively researched work - and they tell more about the readers and about the pervasiveness of common myths than about Chomsky's positions, which are always irreproachably humane, no matter how critics may try to claim the contrary, utterly without foundation.Reading Chomsky will either send up walls of defensiveness in you, or else make you see the world in a different way - more accurately. There are no arguments presented in Year 501 that are not virtually common knowledge to the majority of the planet - everywhere but in the privileged sectors of the First world, where people have a gift for selective blindness. But this is essential reading all the same. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because, like other books by Chomsky, Year 501 could be more accessible than it is. Try one of the interview books for an easier read."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"I happened to be reading this on the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks; on the same day my local paper carried a Mallard Fillmore strip which tried to mock the liberal media by having a stereotypical liberal media commentator intoning, \\"Today the Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor. Let's examine how we brought this on ourselves.\\" Amongst many other topics, Chomsky actually does show how we brought Pearl Harbor on ourselves. The \\"Pacific War\\" as he calls it was not just an unprovoked act of aggression. The Japanese imperialists, even though (as Chomsky points out) they were every bit as brutal as their white rivals, had an arguably legitimate political goal: that is, they wanted Asia to be ruled by Asians rather than by Europeans.As others have noted, this is a pwerful, angry and wide-ranging book. As you can see just from the title: \\"Year 501\\" refers to the 501st anniversary of Columbus's first voyage, but Chomsky's story ranges all over the globe abd all over history.If you're like me, you know Chomsky's political works primarily from his extensive collaborations with David Barsamian, which are based on speeches and radio interviews. Chomsky voice is much more fiery when, as he is here, he speaks without Barsamian as a moderator."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Chomsky's Year 501 is another engrossing work from this erudite and learned treasure and scholar. A good place to start is the concluding chapter as it presents an incredible analysis with an astonishing array of facts and figures relating to the domestic American scene and the conditions that have befallen the average U.S. worker. He brings the same studious approach to this area of inquiry as he's done for the last forty years regarding the international arena and linguistics. Along with Michael Parenti's Democracy For the Few, it's simply some of the best work available on this pressing topic. Deindustrialization, increasing underemployment, rising poverty, the increasing gap between the super rich and middle class, and the business community's relentless assault on unions - Chomsky touches on all these issues. He summarizes these developments by writing that the United States is showing the characteristics of a Third World country by becoming a two-tiered society. That the child poverty rate in New York city is approaching forty percent is just one example of the many nuggets of information a reader can garner from Year 501.Of course the majority of the book covers an incredible amount of ground pertaining to international politics and economics with particular emphasis on Latin America. As always these passages shine with insight and brilliance while being backed up with rigorous documentation and research. Colonization to neo-imperialism are broached along with the two rip off machines known as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.Since he's always refused to punk out to mainstream corporate opinion Chomsky's a somewhat cruel reminder to the orthodox pundits and intellectuals of what intellectual responsibility is truly about. The New Yorker recently ran a hit piece against him; this of course demonstrates that he's still pontificating and writing truths the black-tie cocktail party set refuse to countenance. Year 501 follows in the tradition of a long line of Chomsky books that make the establishmentarians a bit uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"america wants to be the &quot;Global Policeman&quot;.

Chomsky's 501 is the perfect antidote to such revisionist nonsense, explaining that the real revisionists are those that continuously explain away their atrocities as manifest destiny, the imperative of those called to the 'noble work' of empire building. If the poverty of nations is a result of cultural deficiency, Year 501 makes it amply clear that the 'deficiencies' of the poor are a lack of brutality, manipulativeness and cruelty, a lack of commitment to genocide properly applied. Year 501 demonstrates this reality with ample sources and research. What really upsets his critics, though, is that his sources aren't 'leftist rags' or biased sources, they are the accounts of the conquistadors and the oppressors themselves, right up to the Wall Street Journal of today. Reading this book will give you the tools to unmask the pervasive political double-speak that has always been used by the powerful to justify their grand work of exploitation, not by citing outside sources, but by showing you the hypocrisy of the elite by laying their own works side by side. Chomsky's model of history, which he sets out in Year 501, gives you an analytical framework that can be applied with amazing consistency and accuracy; it would be taught in every high school in the country if the purpose of education were to develop a realistic and useful model for understanding history. An amazing book that should inspire you to act up."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Another entry in the author's voluminous expose' of what amounts to US imperialism, even if that inflammatory word is never used. Chomsky's main focus is on Haiti, though the lens wanders as usual. Haiti offers an especially valuable case study in US-hemispheric relations, since it was the first non-white republic in the western hemisphere, having freed itself from French dominion during the revolution in France. At best, Haiti's is a checkered history, though - as Chomsky shows - these last years of Papa Doc Duvalier's reign of terror and the Aristide reaction have been particularly revealing. How the US has manuevered to keep that impoverished country economically dependent is yet one more dismal chapter in the history of exploitation. The culprits include the usual suspects: hypocritical politicians, greedy business interests, compliant media, and brutal local repression. Once again, Chomsky confronts the official record with the public record and the results are devastating.I recall once seeing that all-purpose talking head Jeff Greenfield confronted by the unofficial media silencing of America's foremost foreign-policy critic. For a moment he looked puzzled as though only the bad old Soviets made non-persons of eminent critics. Then he responded something about Chomsky sounding like he lives on the planet Venus. That remark reveals a lot about how incestuous mainstream journalism has become and how undigestible the unvarnished facts, such as *the Year 501*, are to their sanitized frame of reference. Apparatchiks in the worst sense, they allow themselves no challenge to the Washinton party line. Truth be told, it is their feet that are firmly planted on the science-fiction soil of a benign and beneficent America, while the MIT professor remains, as ever, unflinchingly earth-bound whatever the cost."},{"Title":"Year 501: The Conquest Continues","review":"Dense like lead is dense next to tin, Chomsky's serial revelations of atrocious U.S.A. histories will leave you burdened to suspend belief.

These plotted histories(many times not linear by the way)spill you through hundreds of years of stuff you don't think 'we' could do and up into 1992. Instead of pushing the weary citizen reader to the safety of the beach and THE END you will realize it is 2004 and we, the U.S.A. are the same.If you cannot suspend belief you will bend over dazed, thoughts spinning like an errant compass, by the time you finish a few decimals of the first chapter, let alone if you can possibly fight through the moral exhaustion to reach 288.If you have heart you will finish. If this is your first Chomsky, 288 will not be the end as the Notes and Bibliography begin and spider into more places to go. This is the densest calorie of writing as behind each thought and twitch you sense the colossus of study behind that tiny notice called a footnote.

The billing on the book was that it was a good how-to on the batik process. I found it to be remarkably lacking. There was no advice as to how to deal with the more common problems mentioned in the process, and the process, itself was extremely lacking. There were a lot of pretty pictures of batik work from a modern standpoint - but they did not fit in well with the subject matter and seemed more like a &quot;look what I did&quot;. There were very few pictures, for example, of the various steps of the process while the artist was in action.I suppose at this low cost, you get what you pay for."},{"Title":"COLLOQUIAL ROMANIAN/CASSETTE T (The Colloquial Series)","review":"It is not often that, when a new edition of language course is published, it is actually much worse than the previous one. Unfortunately, this course is one of those exceptions. I'll briefly outline why you'd be much better off with the earlier edition of Colloquial Romanian by the same author.1. Help with pronunciation. In Romanian, any syllable of a word can be stressed. In almost all Romanian courses I've seen, this syllable is market to help the learner get the pronunciation right. It was marked in the earlier edition of Colloquial Romanian but for some strange reason it has been droppen in this edition.2. Vocabulary lists. In any good language course, each new chapter contains a vocabulary lists of all the new words in that chapter. That was the case in the previous edition, but not so in this one. There are still vocabulary lists in each chapter, but they are very short and arbitary.3. Grammar. In the earlier edition of Colloquial Romanian, the Romanian grammar was described in a detailed yet very user-friendly way. In the new edition, there aren't many explanations and they are likely to be confusing for the beginner.In short, this book is more mysterious than any detective store. I have no idea why the author decided to downgrade his own book to this extent. The one improvement made is that the conversations are more up to date and relevant in this course. If the author would have made those changes but kept the pronunciation help, stuck to complete vocabulary lists and maintained the same grammar explanations, this would have been the best Romanian course on the market. Now, it's not only a rather useless course, it's a course that's much worse than its own previous edition."},{"Title":"COLLOQUIAL ROMANIAN/CASSETTE T (The Colloquial Series)","review":"It is a very good book covering all the structures to live in Romania, and now to travel.

I have long used Linguaphone courses. I have always found their standards to be the best in language courses. They don't produce a course in Romanian, but they do recommend this one. That influenced my decision to buy it.Second. A good and effective language course has to have conversational speech in the language by native speakers. These can be variable. The old US military language courses were done on 78rpms or tapes in the 40s or 50s. Unscrupulous producers of language courses were able to buy that old [stuff]and repackage it pretending they had a decent language course in such exotic languages as Telugu and Tibetan and Albanian. The sentences were ok but the actual phonic reproduction was muddy and garbled. They are a complete ripoff.

His writing is clear and, unlike many modern writers, suggests the state of the human condition without obfuscation."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"\\"By a Slow River\\" is an apt title for this oddly flowing book. A thriller of sorts, \\"By a Slow River\\" moves through plot and story remarkably slowly and takes its time with everything, from character development to storytelling itself.I think I'm the only one who felt like this, but the writing was one of the things I liked about \\"By a Slow River\\". There's something disjointed and elegant to the flow and there are some sentences in the book that took my breath away, whether simply because of the truth to them or because of the elegance in which they were presented (\\"A house without odors is a dead house indeed\\", p. 166).The story itself is an intriguing, interesting one. Unfortunately, it progresses extremely slowly. Perhaps it's that elegant writing style. I'm not sure. There's something thick and slow to the entire book, something that makes it drag on quite a bit. The ending ties up nicely, in that the reader can plot quite a bit and imagine the entire situation. However, until almost 2/3 into the book, it's kind of difficult to keep going. The book progresses too slowly to be a truly edge-of-the-seat thriller (it's not - it's more of a foggy, mysterious read) and not enticing enough to make the read slightly livelier. The shifts in times and characters gets a bit confusing at times too.On the whole, \\"By a Slow River\\" is a nice book, if slow and if translated kind of weirdly at times. The writing is elegant and lovely, the plot interesting. Unfortunately, the entire first section of the book crawls along, aspects are awkward, and the overall feel at the end is a mostly apathetic one. Some readers may sincerely enjoy this novel. I recommend it to those seeking calm psychological thrillers. For readers in search of a fast-pace book, look elsewhere. This slow-flowing river is beautiful, but may not be for you."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"I liked this novel enormously.

I might have hoped for something different in the ending, but, when I thought about it, the ending was truer than what I might have wanted.

If his other novels, any of them, are close to this good, I'll be very glad to have the chance, someday, to read them."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"it could have been a 5 star but the writing was to disjointed , maybe because of the translation..."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"When during the reading of a novel, for which I paid good money, I feel frustrated, and then when at the completion of the very last page and word I feel annoyed, I think it proper to a least go to the trouble to post a single star alert amongst the glowing four star reviews of my fellow readers. Qui bono? Certainly not me, but possible a perspective reader. So here goes.Writers market their work, publishers hype them and distribute them. Professional critics write reviews and here is the suspect rub:these people who use terms that induce me to purchase the book like; heart-gripping, melancholy beauty, the author carves each scene with lexical precision, a page-turning whodunit with a subtle aftertaste, to mention just a few. Give me a break! I suspect these are the folks who somehow qui bono for those glowing reviews. This novel is a sniveling story of a small town in France that takes place, in part, during WWI. Sniveling because the narrator constantly reminds us that the entire population are, at best, something akin to draft dodgers in one way or another. Men and boys are dying in the trenches just miles away, while village life is better than ever from some minor and trivial war profiteering. The town is peopled by persons with flaws, probably no better or worse that one would encounter anywhere. These characters enter stage right through flashbacks galore, maybe not such a good literary technique when used as excessively as the author does. The first person story narrator, an ineffective policeman, describes cardboard characters, stereotypes that, at least for me, were difficult to care about one way or the other: A fat pompous bureaucratic judge, a nasty jailer, an aristocratic and somnolent, unfeeling prosecutor, the obligatory village idiot mayor, and an even more canned village prostitute with a heart and thighs of gold, etc.. All of whom the author tries his best to tell you, rather than show you, that you should care about. The narrative thread, when you can detect it, seems to be that when someone dies who is loved, some people can never get over their passing, as in decades and decades and decades of moping. There never was a credible case made by the author for any of this undying devotion to these shallow and poorly delineated dead people.The title in French is \\"Gray Souls\\" and that clearly and aptly defines the essence of the novel, but the English title \\"By A Slow River\\" is not far off the mark either. The last lazy writing technique, in my opinion, was the cheaply concocted revelations that allowed the author an exit to thankfully close the doors to a poorly constructed, weakly plotted, and clueless narration, of almost two-hundred pages.The writing was translated from French by Hoyt Rogers. Under his conversions I found the narrator joltingly breaking character with his use of some of the more American Anglo Saxon expletives; they just didn't fit into a French village dialogue during the early nineteen hundreds. Other than that I guess he did a credible job."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"I was especially fascinated by Claudel's handling of the theme of murder during a time of war (WWI): on a gut level it's a perfectly crafted who-dunnit, with an amazing twist. The policeman who narrates the story thinks he's a pretty sharp judge of human nature, but he learns a thing or two not just about his neighbors but ultimately about himself, as he tries to solve the murder of little girl while the sons of the nation are being slaughtered at the front near his town. Ultimately he finds you can't completely uncover anyone's nature, not even your own. This is such an interesting book and such a beatifully told story--like discovering a classic--I want all my friends to read it so we can discuss. You'll be thinking about these characters long after you put the book down. Held me from start to finish.

Its non-chronological construction gives readers snapshots in time and then backs up to show the confluence of events that conspired to create the gritty reality contained in those images.Profoundly touching, and full of observations that make me as a reader nod in agreement."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"Summary and review:The main part of this story takes place during WW1, in a village in France very close to the trenches where the horrors of the war are being played out.As thousands of young men die in that conflict, this tale focuses on the murder of a 10 year old girl, the apparent suicide of a beautiful school teacher, and the death in childbirth of the wife of the narrator - a policemen investigating the murder.The story ends with the policeman's findings, years later,As much as I thought this was a touching and profound story with a *devastating* ending, and despite the fact this is a relatively short book, I found this novel tedious at times and was often tempted to skim.Part of this problem may be due to the fact this is a translation from French, but I just think the authors particular style and manner of writing was just not my cuppa.Still, recommended.

On the other hand he wonders how everyone including him takes for granted that the nearby battles against Germans will leave both sides filled with uncountable numbers of dead.Dadais remembers how he struggled to uncover the identity of the repulsive killer.

Dadais is wonderful protagonist looking back at the case that obsessed him and his townsfolk when at the same time they understood the absurdity of caring about one death when millions were \\"legally\\" dying nearby.

Judging from past comments, the English version does it justice. I would have to remark that the beauty of the book, however, is in the prose, not in the story. Sure, the story is worthwhile, there are twists, and you will stay guessing till the end at what happens, yet the philosophical concept is what makes this book. I give this book 4 stars on content, but I have to say I am completely disappointed that the title of the book was changed from \\"Les Ames Grises\\" (The Grey Souls) to \\"By A Slow River.\\" Essentially, the book is summarized in a statement from the secondary character Josephine to the narrator: \\"'The drunkards, the saints, I've never seen them. Nothing is either all black, nor all white, it is the Grey that wins.

All of the deaths have connections to the passing of the wife of a prominent local citizen some years before. Author Paul Claudel's novel \\"By a Slow River\\" is the exploration of these four deaths and the slow revealing of the cause and effect of each. A parallel theme is the neighboring slaughter of millions in the trench warfare that continued unrelentingly for four years, with its direct impact on lives in the village.This is a beautiful, if very dark, story told in rich language and understanding of how commonplace and relentless human tragedy can be. The author is eloquent on the pervasiveness of human cruelty and tendency to folly as well. There is no effort made here to justify any of the story's tragedies, but all of them are well-explained in the end.An engrossing, intelligent read. Recommended."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"\\"I don't really know where to start. It is rather difficult. So much time has passed, that the words can never be recaptured, nor can the faces, the smiles, the wounds.\\" Still, he needs to try, to say what has been burdening his heart for twenty years. Philippe Claudel opens his hauntingly beautiful, dramatic novel with these confessions of his first person narrator. Later on, he explains that words are difficult for him. \\"During my lifetime, I hardly spoke. Now I write as if I had died since then. And, deep down, that is true. That's the real, true truth. For a long time now, I feel dead. I pretend that I still live a bit. I am on borrowed time. That's all.\\"The events that continue to disturb the nameless narrator of BY A SLOW RIVER (Les mes grises (Le Livre de Poche) (French Edition)) take place in a small town in northern France during World War I, in a region so close to the frontline, that the sounds of war provide a constant rumbling background. In the early days in 1914, town life follows its usual course and the war, assumed to be short lived, does not seem to concern the townspeople too much. The passing soldiers add good business for some and brings much needed work for others. As the narration touches on events later in time, Claudel convincingly evokes the impact on the town of the steadily growing viciousness of war: the hospital fills with wounded and near-dead and starving, exhausted, brutalized soldiers roam the countryside.However, it is the murder in 1917 of a beautiful ten-year-old girl, Belle de jour, that disrupts the still prevailing attitude of complacency among the important \\"gentlemen\\". The \\"Case\\", as it is introduced early on by the narrator, raises questions that dig much deeper into the society's fabric than a simple police procedural would be able to explore. In his recounting of the events surrounding Belle's death, the protagonist appears to hold his own - belated(?) - investigation by introducing, one by one, many of the ghosts, whose long shadows still haunt him into the present. What may have been his role at the time? Through a \\"parade\\" of richly drawn characters, who had been either directly, indirectly or possibly involved with the young girl's life or the Case, Claudel weaves a captivating, subtly structured web of evidence, rumours, suspicions, interrogations and deliberate disregard of clues. From the judge, the prosecutor, the father of the victim, to police officers and military, to other important persons in the town and even in the protagonist's own life, all the brilliantly brought to life as individuals with their strengths and weaknesses.The report, being put together by the narrator, is seemingly written in separate memory blocks (chapters), thus justifying the non-linear structure of his account. The reader's attention is constantly required to pick up clues and connections that will reveal much more than the reader would expect at any one time. The conclusion is dramatic and comes with more than one unexpected punch. It also epitomizes the meaning of the title \\"mes grises - grey souls\\" in a way that will keep the reader's mind ponder its deeper truth: \\"Nothing is either totally black or totally white, it is the grey that wins. For human beings and their souls, its the same... You are a grey soul, really grey like all of us\\". Having read the novel in its original French, all translations are mine. Claudel's exquisite language, that is full of nuance, rich in local colour and often complex structures, will provide a major challenge for any translator. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"This 2003 novel by the author of the recentBRODECKis set in a small town in Lorraine during WW1. Although the line of battle never touches it, it is close enough to the front for the fighting to be visible from a ridge near the town, and the dead and wounded from the trenches are brought to its hospital and morgue. But among so many men killed on both sides, the death that most closely affects the townsfolk is the murder of a 10-year-old girl, Belle de Jour, the pretty daughter of a neighboring innkeeper. What begins as a straightforward police story, somewhat in the manner of Georges Simenon at his most austere, turns instead into a penetrating examination of the shadowy moral territory in which most of us lead our lives, where nothing is either all black or all white -- hence the original French title:LES AMES GRISES(Grey Souls).The original is written in a difficult French, full of colloquialisms and unusual words. I would have thought it almost untranslatable, but from what I can see online, translator Hoyt Rogers makes a brave attempt here. The language and syntax are integral to the heavy and brooding atmosphere that Claudel creates. It is fascinating how he gradually reveals his information, moving backwards and forwards in time over a span of about fifty years, \\"calling forth shadows,\\" in the words of the nameless narrator. Synopses may tell you (possibly incorrectly) who this person is, but Claudel waits over 100 pages before revealing it, and the facts of his own emotional life do not fully emerge until the very end of the book. We will learn, for instance, that Belle de Jour, although the sole murder victim, is only one among four women whose deaths are important to the story. We find out about the others later, much later, when they have room to resonate as feelings rather than facts, as people who have been loved and whose loss changes those who loved them.Reading a description of this book shortly after finishing the magnificent BRODECK, I feared that Claudel might merely be recycling a few favorite themes. Both books take place in wartime (BRODECK spans WW2 and its aftermath). Both are set in isolated villages in Northern France, whose petty local hierarchies are mercilessly laid bare. Both are first-person accounts by lonely men suffering a personal loss. But they are totally different in effect. Whereas BRODECK turned outward, using the village to cast light on the mentality of the Holocaust, BY A SLOW RIVER turns its back on the war to probe the innermost recesses of the soul. What it lays bare is much more than solving the murder of Belle de Jour. It poses the question of why this one death, or four, should matter among the slaughter of so many. The answers come only at the end, not as a simple whodunnit (there are at least two plausible solutions), but as a matter of understanding and even sympathy. But with those answers come other questions -- moral questions, and deeply disturbing. Neither black nor white, but grey -- a color that turns out not to be colorless at all, but complex and surprisingly satisfying.[See also the first comment]"},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"I've always found the idea of crime in the midst of a war rather interesting, and so this French novel about a murder during World War I caught my eye. I suppose I expected some kind of literary thriller, and while there is indeed a strong murder mystery plot, the book is really an extended meditation on death.Death is everywhere in this book, as the narrator reflects on the horrific murder of a young girl in the small village he lived in twenty years earlier, in 1917. He was a policeman, but far from being deeply involved in the investigation, was instead relegated to the sidelines by the imperious judge who takes over the case. This murder was soon followed by the apparent suicide of a newly arrived young woman who had taken the schoolteacher's post. In the wake of this comes a third tragic death -- one which forever changes the policeman. Even as the first World War grinds up men by the thousands just over the hill from the town and pollutes its streets with mangled wounded, it's this trio of dead females that haunts the policeman. (Nonetheless, there are plenty of echoes of the war in how the judge and his strange sidekick \\"investigate\\" the murder, and it's hard not to think of Renoir's great film,Grand Illusion, while reading.)The book slowly (probably too slowly for some) and very lyrically meanders back and forth over the last twenty years, as the policeman recounts his attempt to unravel the mystery of the little girl's murder while also slowly revealing the secrets of the other two women's deaths. During the telling, the deaths of numerous supporting characters over the intervening two decades are also carefully noted. (I think there are something like 15-20 deaths mentioned in the story.) All of which makes for some beautifully written, but melancholy reading. (The translation is quite amazing, with a lovely turn of phrase or epigramatic expression on almost every page.) The secret of the third death, and why it damaged the policeman, is heavily foreshadowed early on, but only fully explained about 2/3 of the way in. The secret of the suicide is also explained well before the end. However, the bits and pieces of the little girl's murder are put together over time, as information is very carefully meted out in small tidbits at just the right moments. Then, at the very end, the author yanks the carpet out from under the story with a carefully constructed twist.This only further reinforces the book's overall bleak tone, as one is left with sense that trying to make sense of death is a meaningless endeavor, bound to end in disappointment.Note: The book's title in French translates roughly as Grey Souls, which is also the title it was published under in the UK and the title of the 2005 film made from it."},{"Title":"By a Slow River","review":"I can't imagine anyone wanting to skim a book this short and this hypnotic.

Written by the authors of The New St. Martin's Handbook, the best combination handbook/rhetoric out there, it contains more than just a subset of their excellent, revision-based advice on the principles of grammar, style, and usage. The chapter For Multilingual Writers is a fine treatment of the particular problems encountered by those for whom English is a foreign language.The comprehensive treatment of citation formats for MLA, APA, Chicago, and CBE is both complete and easy to use, as well as being much handier than any of those formats' full-length style guides.The glossaries of terms and usage are also particularly useful, in these days when it seems that the schools have adbicated their responsibility to teach the basic structure and terminology of the language.But what sets this guide apart from all the others is the inclusion throughout of material dealing with online communication, from discussions and examples of online style to listings of credentialed Web sites and the essential print journals for research in 15 disciplines, from art through sociology. This is one handbook that shows awareness of the ways in which educated people in all fields are writing, communicating, and conducting research today-both online and in libraries.Both authors are established, well-known, and highly respected scholars in the fields of rhetoric and communication, as well as effective practitioners of the arts comprised by their research. EasyWriter is by far the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and useful guide to writing in the contemporary environments of academia, business, and research.

The novel spans a 24 hour period in 1943, as the Allied aerial bombing campaign was reaching its height and the outcome of World War 2 hung in the balanceThe book can be read and re-read on many levels. It is a first rate thriller, and the reader's inevitable prejudices are soon set aside as the terrible cost to mind and body escalates. As an accessible documentary of the campaign, Deighton is unflinchingly accurate in blending fact with the necessary mechanics of characterisation. The book also serves as one of the most effectively subversive and persuasive anti-war essays of all time - if not the finestThis is a complex read, with dozens of characters and quite dense technical detail in parts. This, however, inspires concentration and repeated re-reading which constantly reveals new layers and depth of meaning. Deighton has never surpassed himselfIf the main text is chillingly effective, then the Epilogue is a heart stopper. Deighton brings the story up to date (at the time of writing) and the fates of those who survived 1943 are vividly captured in the most evocative and sparing writing style of all.Now, those who flew the bombers and those who fought and loved them are mostly gone, with none of the survivors under 75. Soon this book and a very few others will serve as an epitaph to a time when Europe was a battlegound where everyone, of all ages and races, civilian and miltary, was plunged into a lottery of life and death."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Though the title implies that this is the story of a single bomber crew over Germany in 1943, \\"Bomber\\" goes farther - much farther, only starting with the crew of the heavy bomber \\"Joe for King\\". Deighton proceeds to cover the families of the crew, other crew members and their superiors before cutting across the channel to the enemy - night-fighter pilots, their controllers in German air defense, various suspicious characters from across the spectrum of Germany's military - from \\"respectable\\" Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht personnel to shadowy types from the \\"Abwehr\\" and the SS. We also meet the civilian residents of Altgarten, a Ruhr-area town nobody would think of bombing, but which manages to get plastered all the same. It's mid-summer 1943, when \\"Joe for King\\" is sent into the Ruhr as part of a massive night-time raid against the industrial centers of Krefeld. Lacking night-vision goggles, RAF pilots drop their bombs on targets marked by flares left by directing aircraft - in this case, specially equipped Mosquitoe night-fighters. When the marking aircraft for the Krefeld raid is shot down too early, its flares are released over Altgarten. This error is compounded by inherent flaws in RAF tactics (like targeting bombs in the center of cities, where bombs are more likely to hit civilian homes than factories and military installations), and the town becomes the unintended target for the massive strike. \\"Bomber\\" is to RAF's wartime bomber command what \\"Traffic\\" is to the DEA - a story of massive scale borne by wide cast if characters that never stops growing. Deighton doesn't let something meaningless as nationality get in the way of determining who is good or evil (the Germans get the bombs here, but Nazi genocide also gets prominent mention, with plenty of nasty Waffen SS to remind us why people were fighting). On the British side, we see officers acting less like gentlemen than soldiers. Political correctness is the rule (this is the country that gave us \\"1984\\"; \\"Joe for King\\"'s commander is suspected of incipient Bolshevism - it's very name hints at Stalin). Those who won't fall in line risk being labeled as LMF (Lacking Moral Fiber) - officially branded as cowards. Though books with such a command of detail normally favor the efforts of those they depict, Deighton is uniformly negative on the subject, a tone reinforced by his many subplots. Lambert, \\"Joe for King's\\" rebel pilot, plays the best cricket in Bomber Command - leading his odious superior to compel his participation in an upcoming tournament on pain of getting LMF'd. (Worse - the commander puts pressure on Mrs. Lambert after her husband has departed for the big raid). The bombers fly from Warley Fen, a once verdant field seized from its original owners who now stare at the airfield, mourning for what they know they will never have again. In Germany, ADF is managed by August Bach, an aged warrior preparing to marry his young son's nanny, not knowing how her youthful looks have made her the target of vicious rumors through Altgarten. The pilots of a night-fighter squadron (nichtjagdeschwader), preparing for a feared RAF attack on the Ruhr, are thrown into turmoil when Abwehr and Gestapo appear in search of a stolen classifed memo. The memo, it turns out, details hypothermia experiments on concentration camp prisoners (this may be same memo mentioned early in Robert Harriss' superb \\"Fatherland\\"). The corrupt assistant to Altgarten's Burgomeister arranges for the downgrading of the town's remaining Jews (from 1/3rd to 2/3rd \\"Jewishness\\" - though these jews are even more likely to face deportation and certain death, they will have greater freedom to marry other jews). Altgarten itself is flooded with profiteers funneling goods looted from conquered parts of Russia and the Netherlands. It seems that war is the only thing keeping the world safe because it occupies all the amoral typed who have to fight it. The only morally just adults are the TENO - the civil safety personnel who dig people out of bombed buildings. Because they are stationed in Altgarten, they get the biggest break: when the raid comes, they have the shortest commute. With so much going on, you just know you're bound to miss something. This is the sort of book that speed-readers hate. You'll probably lose count of all the characters that Deighton throws at you, though this doesn't hurt the plot as much as make the book one you'll want to re-read. Be warned - once you pick up bomber, you'll probably be spoiled for any other novel on the war in the skies over Europe."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"The best fictional account of the \\"Other Side's\\" (German) view of being the \\"attacked\\". Mr. Deighton obviously has done his homework in showing how one massive,confused attack on a German town in the Summer of 1943 devastates everyone involved from the British RAF planners and pilots, politicians, and even more the German civilian home front, not to mention just about everyone else on the German side,from the SS,Luftwaffe, to the totally innocent on the ground. When the air raid alarms go off in the ficticious German town to the inevitable,terrifying end, mistakes and all, you know you're reading from a master. The ending is as terrible as you can imagine..."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This book is brilliantly constructed account of the 24 hours leading up to one of the maximum effort raids on Germany. Large cast of well portrayed character's recounts the incredible courage of the airmen of both sides and the appalling results on the ground.Only one in three Bomber Command aircrew survived WWII and over 50,000 perished bringing the German war machine to it's knees. There has never been a battle like it. Fought in the middle of the night for 4 years with the prospect of a horrific death ever present night after night.Imagine going \\"over the top\\" in WWI and surviving it, then being asked to do it again the next day. And the next.Not only that but after the war being branded as murderer's by the very people whose lives you were protecting. The post war government quickly distanced themselves from what Bomber Command achieved, and no gratitude was ever publicly forthcoming for these boys sacrifice.To this day it still beggars belief."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"It's a pity this book has been relegated to the status of 'special order'. As an account of a single Lancaster night raid, it's without peer in portraying the lives of people enduring the horrors of war in any age. Deighton's skill at depicting characters has few matches, and the scope of this book, set in both Germany and England [as well as the skies above both] only enhances his writing abilities. Following the lives of bomber and night fighter crews as well as those living under bombardment, he shows how meaningless war is to the most hawkish adherents. It's not possible to read this book without being moved by how well Deighton sees into the minds and hearts of his characters. None of them are false or overdrawn.'Strategic' bombing was implemented to maintain pressure on the Nazis in the hope of forcing sufficient discontent among the population. John Dos Passos once wrote on the futility of using 'terror' bombing to bring surrender of a people whose loved ones were killed and their homes destroyed. Bomber shows how barren this strategy truly was. It didn't work when London was blitzed. It certainly failed when even target cities were missed completely due to unforeseen circumstances. Deighton takes us step by step from the preparation of the aircraft and the defenses countering it through the raid and its aftermath. His portrayal of the 'military mind' is disconcerting when we reflect that the same attitudes prevail with little or no evidence of improvement. This book should be brought back on the active list and read by anyone seeing armed conflict as a mechanism of policy."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"In this meticulously researched and finely-wrought novel, author Len Deighton interweaves the stories of a large cast of characters, German and British, in the hours leading up to a night bomber attack on a fictional Germany city. Due to crew error, a small German town is accidentally bombed by part of the bomber force. The story revolves around the men who fly the heavy British bombers, the men on the ground in Germany who must deal with the carnage of the bombs, and the German airmen and radar men who try to stop the bombers short of their tragic attack. Deighton writes that he read over 200 books to prepare for this novel. He also interviewed many British and German veterans and civilians and flew in most of the planes described in the book. The result is a book that favors neither side but instead focuses on the individual humanity of the characters, with all their strengths and weaknesses. Thousands upon thousands of warriors and civilians on both sides died horrible deaths and in a war that was, without a doubt, hell on earth. Though there is no glory in war, the book is filled with individual acts of selflessness and heroism that elevate the participants above the slaughter. Their heroism is not without great price, though, from the fireman battling the blazes to the British pilot who fights to bring his plane home only to suffer a breakdown, and the German pilot who is being hunted down for disagreeing with Nazi policy. I highly recommend this book. It is a must-read especially for those who desire to learn more about the air war over Germany."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"To my mind, the two best air war novels ever written are THE LAST TALLYHO by Richard Newhafer and Len Deighton's BOMBER. Newhafer's chronicle of USN Hellcat pilots at war benefitted from the fact that Newhafer flew F6Fs in WWII and knew his subject intimately. Len Deighton, on the other hand, had no experience of Bomber Command ops and had to do endless research to create what is an authentic and tremendously gripping portrait of a fictional RAF raid on a German town in 1943. That's why I give the tip of the hat to BOMBER.Back in 1970, when I first read BOMBER, I finally realized what was meant by the phrase \\"compulsive page turner.\\" I simply couldn't put the book down. Piece by intricate piece, Deighton created a spellbinding story of a bombing mission gone terribly wrong. That story was populated by living, breathing, sometimes flawed human beings English and German alike. On top of that, he got all the technical bits spot on! Nothing ticks me off more than when an author, writing an air war novel, commits a boner concerning aircraft, weapons, tactics, etc. Time after time in BOMBER, Deighton got it right.Other reviewers have detailed the plot of BOMBER. Ostensibly, it is the story of a Bomber Command raid focusing on the crew of a Lancaster named 'The Creaking Door.' Yet, BOMBER is much more. It can be read on many levels. There are so many fascinating elements at work in the book such as the leisurely way Deighton develops the plot, the matter-of-fact manner in which he presents plot developments, the sympathetic portrayal of the British and German characters, the fashion in which 'minor' actions produce major consequences and so on.To my mind, BOMBER is Deighton's masterpiece. None of his other novels were as gripping as BOMBER; likewise his non-fiction work. Whether you vew it as a war novel or an anti-war novel, it's just one damn fine read!"},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This is a superbly plotted panel book in which every story ends with some sort of twist or irony. I write only to correct one error made by an earlier reviewer. Lambert's plane is NOT 'Joe for King', but 'the Creaking Door'. The CO is so out of touch that he mistakes the planes, thereby indirectly saving Lambert's life, much to his young wife's relief. (The casualty rates were horrific for bomber crews.)It is somewhat amusing that the reviewer made the same mistake."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Anthony Burgess includes this novel as one of his 99 best English novels written since 1930 and is absolutely correct to do so.It is the story a RAF Bomber Squadron and their German opposition over a 24 hour period. From the planning of a 700 plane attack on Germany until they land again back at their squadrons.It makes for a very harrowing read and it in no way glorifies war. It accentuates the exceptional bravery of those involved but it lays out for all to see the utter waste that war is.I didn't realise how young the pilots in WW2 were, you had 23 year olds captaining Lancaster Bombers with 18 year old crewmen and 21 year old Germans trying to shoot them down. Thousands of these young men died. When they got hit by a canon round, they didn't just fall down dead with a neat little hole in them, they vaporised, suffered horrendous burns, all terrible stuff.It is a great read and as it was first published in 1970, I wondered why it had not had the acclaim that other anti-war novels have garnered. My theory is that Deighton was primarily known for his spy thrillers at the time. It deserves to be a very famous book.It is a wonderful book, without the humour and cynicism of \\"Catch 22\\" but the message is the same."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Len Deighton claims, in the Acknowledgements, to have read over two-hundred books in research for this novel, including one Karl Otto Hoffman's three volume history of the development of German Radar from 1933-1945, and, after finishing this book, one can well believe it. Not one tick of a Lancaster's variometer is left undescribed, nor is one speck of phosphorous burning through flesh from an incendiary bomb, nor is one pipe in a small German town's water system and nor are any of the truly horrific ways in which one can become dismembered, have one's flesh liquefied, be mauled, suddenly frozen, buried alive, eviscerated etc. in an incendiary bomb raid. - All are duly explored and fully depicted herein. - The book bombards, so to speak, the reader's sensorium with detail upon detail.Some of this, for me, was very striking - especially the aeronautical details. My father was (and is) a pilot and an aeronautical engineer. And while never having flown in a military aircraft myself, my father was on some of the design teams for more advanced military aircraft still in use by the RAF (like the \\"jump jet\\"), and I went up with my father almost every weekend in our small prop-propelled aeroplane. I remember the altimeter, the mixture control, the stall light, the variometer (which tells one the speed at which one is ascending or descending), the smell of aviation fuel etc. ---They don't seem to have had horizontal stabilisers back then though, which for me, as a lad, when my Dad let me take control, was always the most fascinating instrument. It's VERY difficult to fly perfectly aligned with the horizon (nor is it necessary, basically an aeroplane flies in a rough sine wave according to the pockets of air it crosses), but it's rather a fun game for a seven year old to see how close he can get to perfection and how long he can maintain it. -Ahem, not very long at all. - But why am I mentioning all this technical rubbish? Because, again, the book is chock-full of it, and it's hard for me to imagine anyone except boffins like myself taking much of an interest in it. But there it is, even unto the ending of the book, where you are hanging on the edge of your seat as the battered planes land and wondering whether these chaps you feel you've come to know are going to cop it or come in safely or what, whilst ailerons, flaps and rudder control are still being explained in the greatest detail.Basically, the structure of the book is that of a thriller, tightly wound. One knows what is going to transpire, so the \\"catch\\" of the book, as it were, is the wait, amongst Germans, Brits and readers, to see, exactly, very exactly, how all this carnage and mayhem unfold. Herein lies my slight reservation about the book. You will be, by turns, excited, terrified, and exhausted in the reading of it. - Also, if you don't skip these technical parts, which constitute about half of the book, you will be informed as to all manner of things. - But, stylistically, this has a jarring effect. Leighton seems to want to cram something from each of those 200+ books he has read into the narrative, so that there is this constant switching and shunting between technical manual and narrative, from page to page, paragraph to paragraph and, more often than not, within a paragraph. This aspect, for me, detracted from the experience of the reading.I think Bomber is probably the best novelistic account a highly intelligent, technically savvy and curious reader could possibly find about British night-bombing in WWII. But the details put a drag on the narrative that, to belabour a metaphor, sends the tale that's being told here into a stall that's hard to pull out of at several points.To conclude, it's more difficult to pull a narrative out of a stall than it is an aeroplane. And, really, it shouldn't be required of the reader. On the other hand, for readers who enjoy such challenges, don't hesitate to lower the flaps, gun the throttle and take off into the reading of this fascinating book."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Briefly, this is an account of a single RAF bombing raid on a town in Germany, written from the perspectives of a variety of major and minor protagonists, in the air and on the ground, in Germany and England. The story takes you from the morning of the raid as the characters wake, go about their daily business and prepare for the raid, all the way through the raid itself to the end of the night as the bombers land and the survivors crawl from the rubble.It is a truly fantastic story, written by a master storyteller and to label it as fiction doesn't do it an ounce of justice. It is so meticulously researched that you'll put it down thinking you've read a dramatisation of a real event which, I suppose, it is - an event that was played out almost every night for four or five years in the middle of the last century. Indeed the research goes so far as to provide a glorious description of the design and cost of the Lancaster bomber, a chilling exposition of the tactics and effects of a typical aerial bombing raid on a civilian town and an AtoZ of a typical RAF bomber station. Despite this detail it is no \\"technothriller\\" and the story concentrates on the personality, problems hopes and fears of the characters and you will find yourself sympathising with many of them and disliking others (regardless of whether they're British or German). I love how the mundanity of the events portrayed in the early chapters starkly sets off the horror of the raid itself and while I have every respect for the bravery of the RAF bomber crews (as does Deighton) the book brings home just how brutal, cold-blooded and even murderous the concept of area bombing really was.Kingsley Amis rated this as one of the best books to come out of the 20th Century. I am not literary genius, but it's hard to disagree. This is one of those rare books that has sat on my bookshelf for nearly 20 years and has survived countless car boot sale culls and been read many times. In fact I think I might pick it up again tonight!"},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Excellent book of one day in the life of an RAF Lancaster bomber crew conducting a night bombing raid over Germany. Included are subplots involving a German night fighter squadron, a German early warning radar site, and the German town that is bombed by mistake. I have read it four times and each time it gets better."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This is LDs masterpiece, a fictionalised oral history about the British effort to bomb Germany into submission, as well as a minute by minute account of one bomber crew's last flight in 1943.LD (b: 1929) read over 200 books on the subject and interviewed countless ex-bomber crew members and other participants. He also talked with surviving defenders, such as a legendary aristocratic German WW II pilot, a wizard in any type of airplane, who enjoyed talking to LD and provided him with plenty of formerly top-secret information.\\"Bomber\\" fuses LD's three main strengths: (1)a burning interest in WW II, how it was conducted and won; (2) a life-long preoccupation with (advances in) modern technology; (3) the human factor, what prompts people to be or become heroes, how do they talk, think, dream?LD shows contemporary readers that during WW II bombing enemy territory and returning back to base was infinitely more hazardous and difficult than today. Bomber aircraft and their fighter escorts had to fly low on their approach to hit their targets and faced fierce opposition from enemy fighter planes and ground artillery. When returning to base the same dangers applied, with the extra risk of running out of fuel. Tens of thousands of British airmen never returned...Since WW II, technology has evolved exponentially. The highflying B-52, in service since the 1960s, cannot easily be hurt by enemy fighter planes or artillery. But modern bombers are invisible to radar and can fly from the US to Afghanistan or Iraq and back without interruption, because they are refuelled in the air.LD's warm and engaged description of a WW II bomber crew is a far cry from today's US-based specialist bombers, who drive to work their shift in a nearby Airforce base to direct an unmanned drone to kill a target by mouse click on the other half of the world. They will not be remembered in a warm and brilliant book such as this one."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"How truly delighted I am to see another reviewer's reference to Kingsley Amis supposedly having considered this to be one of the ten best books of the 20th Century. To this accolade can be added Anthony Burgess's opinion of it being amongst the finest 99 books written in the English language since 1939. After that, anything I can contribute will be of little consequence I suspect. But this is a book like no other so I'm going to weigh in.Five hundred pages, around one hundred characters and set within a single day and night, Deighton has pulled off an impossible feat. Further, I would boldly venture that this book should become the definitive work of reference about the British bombing campaign; the author, after all, claims to have read more than two hundred books in order to have written this one. On the one hand, the detail is mind-boggling in its rigour, whether it be the exact cost of a Lancaster bomber, the colour of the dashboard lights on a German night fighter or the arrangement of sewage pipes in a German town. On the other hand, the experience and reaction of ordinary townspeople to being bombed by seven hundred aircraft will surely never again be portrayed in all of its forensic horror like Deighton has done here. What makes Deighton unique, though, is his being a single voice in describing both sides of the story. It's probably impossible to remember all one hundred characters but one comes to care a great deal for almost all of them, whether British or German.And so for me, above all else, this magnificent novel gave me startling new insights into my own qualities of compassion and humanity, ones that perhaps I didn't really expect to experience within the confines of a novel about a vicious and savage war. Maybe this is Len Deighton's supreme achievement, and if so it's no wonder that Amis and Burgess should have shown this novel such high regard. Either way, this is a work of staggering accomplishment, and not a little genius. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"I concur with John Stedman's earlier review praising Deighton's work. This is a well-research fictional documentary that brought me the closest I've every felt to \\"being there\\" during an aviation campaign in WW II. And his detailed descriptions not only enhance the reality of events, but taught me many technical details about that warfare and the numerous civilians and military non-fliers who were impacted by it on the ground."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Reading this novel is as close as most of us will ever come to attacking Germany in an RAF bomber. It's a time machine, but so much more than that -- it's an unsparing examination of humanity. The action is relentless and absorbing. When I first read \\"Bomber\\" some thirty years ago, I finished around three in the morning and couldn't get to sleep for at least another hour. Having experienced Deighton's vivid narrative, you'll be thankful it wasn't you who had to make the sacrifices demanded by those uncertain days."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"I read this book when it was first published in 1970 or '71; I think I bought it while still in college. I have read it several times since then - five or six times for sure; perhaps more - and still believe it to be one of the best written descriptions of World War Two aviation available. The technical detail and minutia is stunning in both its inherent complexity and the manner in which the author devolves it into easily understood terms. I include in this the presentations of what it was like to fly in these aircraft. In this aspect, I have to take exception with the reviewer who felt the comment about how different flying in a jet is from a Lancaster was unnecessary editorial. Having flown in three World War Two era bombers (B-17, B-24 and B-25), I can state it is very different from what most of us consider flying. Modern aircraft \`punch' through the air, effectively overcoming it by brute force. The aircraft of WW2 tended to \`bob' in it, moving around like flotsam on the sea. In fact, a pilot of a Tiger Moth described it that way to me during a flight. Add to that shaking motion, air streaming in through a variety of planned/needed openings and having to maneuver through narrow spaces and around objects while wearing heavy clothing and you start to get the idea that it wasn't the clich&eacute;d \\"piece of cake.\\"And that was level flight without anyone shooting at you. Try to imagine being in one of these aircraft when it was in distress - burning, spinning out of control with centrifugal force preventing you from even getting to the narrow exit hatch. There were a lot of reasons so many bomber crew died.The basic story is a narrative from multiple points-of-view of a period of time before during and after a British bombing raid on a town in Germany. We are introduced to characters involved directly and peripherally with the Endeavour. We learn about the mission; how it is to be carried out and the preparations required to execute it and to counter it. The key twist in the story - be aware there are numerous smaller ones related to individual characters - is the bombing raid is misdirected. A \`fortunes of war' occurrence leads to hundreds of aircraft dropping their bombs not on a large city, but on a small town miles and miles away. Think of a planned bombing raid on New York City instead being carried out on White Plains or an attack on London destroying Hemel Hempstead. As one might expect, the mission is not without casualties on both sides. The book closes with a coda of sorts describing subsequent histories of participants.As stated, the story is brilliantly conceived and executed...unlike the mission. At the same time, there is some editorializing/propagandizing on the author's part. The archetypical anti-hero - a fixture in Deighton's writing - asks in the briefing what the target is. The briefing officer - after a surge of guilt - rattles about poison gas plants and munitions factories. This is mild slap at the British practice of nighttime area bombing - something that is still so politically incorrect in the UK that Bomber Command has yet to be honored with a memorial for their actions. One also has to deal with another of the author's penchants; namely depiction of what I'll call middle-management as marginally incompetent. Whether it is the Flight Lieutenant seeking promotion via politics or the Group Captain seeking to beat a peer at cricket, we are provided with the evidence of a betrayal similar to that done by British generals on the Western Front in World War One.

Probably the best book out there concerning the WWII bomber pilot. You meet interesting, real people involved in their own private dramas on both sides of the English Channel against a backdrop of total war. The flight scenes, both the Allied bomber and the German fighter point of view, are unbelievably exciting. The devastation of the actual bombing raids is felt all too strongly as it impacts German civilians that we have gotten to know and, in some cases, sympathize with.If you are a WWII aficionado--even if you're not--don't miss this great read!"},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Although a novel, it is historically accurate with precise detail. It gives a exceptional view of people caught on both sides of a part of history which most Americans seem to have overlooked."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Bomber Command sought to defeat Germany by destroying its industry. They declined to attack German tanks or their supply chain invading Belgium and France. They denied resources to Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and won thedismissal of its commander immediately after he saved the world from the Nazis. The bombers proved incapable of targeting and damaging German factories so \\"strategic bombing\\" became the incineration of cities. Studies showed no clear indication that the effort hastened victory in Europe by one day. The best rationalization for the campaign, after the fact, was that raids tied down ten thousand flak guns and one hundred thousand gunners who could have fought the tanks of the Red Army. The obvious explanation for the campaign is British fury to make the German people suffer for their war. The only good thing to say about any of it is that tens of thousands of educated people determined that nothing like it would ever happen again and it hasn't. Len Deighton's novel, written at the same time as Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, like that book also addressing the United States bombardment of our ally the Republic of Viet Nam, shows one raid from the air and from the ground."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This book is such a good read that I read it every 10 years or so. The detail was thoroughly researched. A pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"This is a good yarn well told by an excellent story teller. Deighton embeds the parallel themes in the novel in a matrix of solid facts that can only have emerged as a result of diligent, multi-facetted research of the circumstances of the war in the air in the 1940s between Britain and Germany. A relatively sympathetic and understanding treatment of the respective experiences of two of the principal belligerents in the massive conflict that was WWII."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Len Deighton's novel, the first done on a word processor, is a masterpiece...it functions as both a snapshot of the RAF's bomber war over Germany, and as a bitter condemnation of war.First, it dissects both sides of the bomber war with intense detail, both technical and human, by giving the full picture of a single \\"typical\\" night in the bombing of Germany (albeit a fictional one, June 31, 1943). We see the reality of the bomber war from both sides, British and German, ranging across the full spectrum, from planning to preparation to take-off, to outward flight. Then we see German defense mustered against the RAF, both military and civil. The two sides' operations are intertwined, and we see the stark heroism of the RAF crews trying to reach their targets and deliver the biggest punch, and that of the German defenders trying to protect their nation. Both sides are rendered with great technical knowledge, skill, and humanity. These are people we know, have met, and can relate to. They could be our grandfathers and grandmothers, living, suffering, and dying through mankind's greatest calamity. A reader who goes through this book will know what it was like to fly a Lancaster or a Ju 88 night-fighter, to man a radar station, to sit in a cellar under the bombing, to dig out a blasted house, to fight fires in a blazing town, and survive it all.At the same time, this book is a bitter and harsh condemnation of war and everything connected with it. Everything that can go wrong on this raid, does. The RAF hits the wrong target, a small town instead of a large city. The RAF Group Captain mistakes a pilot whose plane is named \\"Joe for King\\" with another one who doesn't want to play on his cricket team, and busts the latter for \\"lacking moral fiber.\\" A German lieutenant asks his maid to marry him, and she says yes, only to get a rude surprise. Another German pilot discovers the horrific truth about Nazi \\"science.\\" The town Burgomaster's party goes horribly wrong. The list and catalogue of personal disasters just goes on and on, rich with irony, as a whole world disintegrates for all the characters involved. The insanity and madness of war is revealed in a cool, understated, tone, without histrionics, but with great restraint.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"Bomber: Events Relating to the Last Flight of an R.A.F. over Germany on the Night of June 31, 1943Here in 2009 Mr. Deighton's famous novel sits beside Slaughterhouse-Five on many bookshelves as well as in the esteem of readers and scholars. The book needs no more reviews. I write only to point out a surprising technical error unexpected from someone like Len Deighton. Bomber is historical fiction narrated by an omniscient third party in the contemporaneous present tense. This style, a common one for this genre, keeps the reader very much involved with the plot as it unfolds. Then, on page 272 of the Jonathan Cape Ltd. edition, appears this sentence, \\"Today's pressurized, high-speed, high-altitude, jet-propelled traveller might find it hard to imagine the very different experience that flying was to these men.\\" Reading this I felt as if someone a row back had interrupted me during a really good movie. Tracers had just curved by my cockpit and splashed into the sea. What rude person was intruding with this inane editorializing? Mr. Deighton's entire novel is like an editorial on the horrors of war, but the genius of the book is how understated this message remains. Of course it does nothing to diminish the book. It is simply an interesting example of how difficult it really is to keep disbelief suspended and readers personally involved in a story."},{"Title":"Bomber","review":"I have just finished reading Bomber which is the first non-fiction work that I have read of Len Deighton. Like many other people, I have grown up after WWII and my impressions of war are mainly due to the Hollywood version. There is no glamour in war and this book shows its horror in unrelenting detail.The book encapsulates war by illustrating 24 hours of the air war taking place over Europe in 1943. The protagonists are the British for it was our Royal Air Force that was doing the bombing and the Germans who were doing the defending.It is ironic that only recently, records have been published which reveal how inaccurate and noneffective our mass saturation type bombing instigated by 'Bomber' Harris really was. Most bombs missed their target by distances of nearly a mile and the main storyline of the book relates how an 'innocent' rural town was eradicated by the chance event of one of the RAF's pathfinders being shot down.That single event caused the other bombers to mistakenly release their bomb-loads on the town rather than on their target several miles away. The moral dilemma is an acute one. Whose fault was it? Of course it must have been the bombers' fault, but if the pathfinder had not been shot down then it might have illuminated its intended target and the innocents would have been saved.What is certain is that all of the people who died in Deighton's masterpiece were either innocent and blameless or just doing their duty irrespective of which side they were on. Our society, raised on images of Bhagdad suffering Shock and Awe should read 'Bomber' before we plunge headlong into another war. It is a frightening yet sobering read.That Will Do Nicely"},{"Title":"U.S. Regulation of the International Securities And Derivatives Markets: United States Regulation of the International Securities And Derivatives Markets (2 Volume Set)","review":"I have used an earlier edition of this book to get some background for academic work.

Rarely does a writing book come along where you get half-way done and look forward to the plane ride home so you can enjoy the rest, but that's how I would describe RROW.

But those who do, say someone with an English major, or wants to be published in the traditional sense, this book might be too simple for you, esp. if you're looking for technical advice.

Out of all the books I have read on writing, this is the first one that seemed \\"writer friendly\\" and understanding of the fear and trepidation a new writer can face, also the sloth and confusion that can be created by trying to adhere to the rules.Far from being a volume on how all the other writing advice is wrong, Masello charts different territory, and rather than more rules, it seems like 101 Permission Slips signed by someone who has honestly walked the path and wants to encourage others to make the most of their writing.Moments of humor, candor, some tantalizing inside stories spice things up and serve to illustrate every rule on \\"rule\\" breaking. Some of these genuinely shocked me. \\"Stop Reading\\" (#14) in which he advises the writer to avoid \\"filling\\" their \\"head with other people's prose\\" was surprising but logical.If you are working at being a writer, and have more than two rule books on your shelf, please do yourself a favor and pick this one up as well, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Roberts Rules Of Writing: 101 Unconventional Lessons Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"Robert Masello is one of those valuable writers who also knows how to write about writing. In his two previous books, \\"A Friend in the Business\\" and \\"Writer Tells All,\\" Masello explained the inner workings of the worlds of television writing and publishing. Both books were sprinkled throughout with generous dollops of his dry wit. Now, in \\"Robert's Rules of Writing,\\" Masello distills his experience as a writer into 101 lessons that are of value to anyone trying to make a living in the field. \\"Robert's Rules of Writing\\" is not a book about grammar or technique, but rather, a charming conversation on how to cope with the daily issues of living as a writer. Personally, what I found most valuable were the rules that contradicted the ones we're been taught before. For example, Rule 56, \\"Buy the Smoking Jacket,\\" takes issue with the all the writing teachers who challenged their students with the question, \\"Do you want to write...or do you just want to be a writer?\\" Masello reminds us that there is nothing wrong with visualizing yourself as a success to inspire you to get your words written. Masello comes off as your favorite uncle, who has been there before you and wants to share what he's learned.In short, this is the perfect book for any writer. Buy one for yourself and one for a friend."},{"Title":"Roberts Rules Of Writing: 101 Unconventional Lessons Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"ROBERT'S RULES OF WRITING is similar to other books published by Writer's Digest Books. It contains good information presented in a clear and concise manner, and offers something for anyone interested in writing. The author, who has had a number of books published: some thrillers as well as books that give advice to writers, gives his thoughts about the art and craft of writing. Each of the chapters has a catchy title such as \\"Burn your journal,\\" \\"Skip the truth,\\" or \\"Strip down to your briefs.\\" For each topic, the author shares what he has found to be helpful and why. Much of what he has to say has been said by others, which adds to the wisdom of what he has to say. Other entries are things that he has found helpful that at times contradict popular theory, which makes this book slightly different from other titles.In the book, Masello states what he believes does and does not work. He believes that writers should set up a schedule and develop a routine for writing, but he is not in favor of writing for the sake of writing, hoping for inspiration. He is in favor of well chosen words and good metaphors, but he advises not to go too far in attempting to find the best word, believing plain language can be just as effective, and if not more effective that flowery language and words most people need a dictionary to understand. He believes in outlining, but recommends an outline that works rather than one that sticks to a particular form. He believes that characters should be well developed, not necessarily perfect, and that villains deserve attention as well since they are central in most books. In the end he offers good advice on organizing material, creating a plot, developing rich characters, revising, submitting s book for publication, and what to do while awaiting the news of acceptance or rejection.One of the chapters that hit me personally was \\"Skip the Starbucks.\\" According to Masello, people who bring their laptops to Starbucks are not writers but people who want others to think they are writers. Living in the Boston area, where there is a Starbucks on just about every corner, with two or three Dunkin Donuts on every corner too, I have seen many people with laptops busy at work. There is even a coffee house in the area that is supposed to be a haven where writers do their stuff. I'll admit the laptop has gone to many a caf&eacute; and coffee shop because I need a change of scenery. Some of what has worked has been written in coffee shops. So I guess I could say that Masello is wrong, at least as far as this advice is concerned. I have also kept a journal since high school and it has been helpful. Again, is he wrong? Well, since I am not yet published, that would just be arrogant, but his points are valid. If a person wants to write, taking on the perceived persona of a writer will not accomplish much of anything, but getting down to the business of writing will, and that's what this book does well with a little dose of humor to boot. It encourages would be writers and those attempting to get words on paper that mean something to work at writing, get something accomplished that is worthwhile, and hopefully one day be published.."},{"Title":"Roberts Rules Of Writing: 101 Unconventional Lessons Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"This delivers on the 3 Es of teaching: it educates, entertains and enlightens.

This book warrants being read in connection with his excellent history of Philadelphia in the first half of the century.In this book, Lukacs takes a rather negative view of cultural trends in the United States since 1900. These negative trends include: 1) the growing bureaucratization, not only of government, but also the professions, which can be seen as a weakening of the national character; 2) de-urbanization, the result of the automobile, and the implications of a less urban society; and 3) Inflation (and thus devaluation) of money (an economic issue) but also, of ideas -- a complicated concept. (The argument is that the huge increase in printed material and expansion of the media in the 20th century has created an \\"inflation\\" of words and thus ideas.)Lukacs might best be described as a small-c conservative; he has many critical things to say about the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations, especially re: the gaps between their rhetoric and their actions when it came to the issue of the size and role of the federal government in the nation's life."},{"Title":"A New Republic: A History of the United States in the Twentieth Century","review":"Written by one of our top historians about the quality of life in The United States as a New Republic. He has also written THREAD OF YEARS and AT THE END OF AN AGE. He is a noted voice of history in this country and says things they way they need to be said. He is an expert in the political life of America.Which two presidents died on July 4? As the new republic, the young country started out in good hands. Gradually, as the eons pass, it has fallen into the hands of the wealthy. They'd like to think they are modern Napoleons and his wars, but I'd like to remind them to remember what happened at Waterloo.It takes a lot of maneuvering to make politics in this modern age of favoritism and people in office who have no place there. Those with the government jobs locally are not qualified or trained and most dress up and play act, from the Mayor on down. Alas, this is the trend in most of the country. Will we become another fallen country who will depend on India to come to our aid? It's something to contemplate.

Elements de mathematique)","review":"After Cauchy, Fourier, Galois, French Math dominance in 17th & 18th centuries had been overtaken in 19th century by their defeated (by Napolean) enemy: Germany, which produced the \\"Prince of Math\\" Gauss and his bright students and great Gottingen successors (Riemann, Dedekind, Cantor, Kronecker, Wierestrass, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lindermann, etc).Before World War I, a group of Ecole Normale Superieure students (ENS which,like Ecole Polytechniques, expelled the Math genius Evariste Galois) , headed by Andre Wales, realised that French Math Textbooks were outdated and decided to form a Math Study Group nicknamed \\"Bourbaki\\" consisted of a few bright ENS classmates, met regularly in the Cafe near Jardin de Luxembourg in Paris, with the intention to rewrite the entire Mathematics based on the new SET Theory by Cantor, and followed the example of the Greek Euclid's 13-volume \\"Elements of Geometry\\", called their huge volumes \\"Elements of Mathematics\\" (Les Elements de Mathematiques). {Ref: \\"The artist and the mathematician : the story of Nicolas Bourbaki, the genius mathematician who never existed\\" by Amir D.

He always has something important to say and usually says it well. This novel is one of his shortest and one of his best. Like George Elliot and Charles Dickens, Trollope was dragged kicking and screaming into industrialized England in the 19th century. And, like them, he saw beneath the glitz and glamor of new-found wealth and the breakdown in social classes that followed the Reform movement in England. He seems at times to be overly preoccupied with the demise of the \\"lady\\" and the \\"gentleman,\\" but this concern reveals a well-founded alarm over the vanishing of such Victorian values as \\"nobility\\" and \\"duty to others.\\" In this novel he expresses many of those concerns while targetting the Evangelicals, an attack that is right-on and timely indeed. He reveals the hypocrisy of so many of those who are filled with resentment and hatred of their fellow humans while professing to bask in the love of Christ.I would rate this novel, alongside The Warden, as first-rate and excellent ways to come to Anthony Trollope, who is, in my view, a vastly under-rated writer, despite his flaws."},{"Title":"Rachel Ray","review":"Rachel Ray is (IMHO) the least of Trollope's longer works. Set in a pleasant country town, with a terribly pleasant cast of characters, the novel is, well, ..... pleasant .... without ever offering anything more for the reader. I suppose there are some who would say that Trollope's genius was to write a work that was as pleasant as its setting, but after seeing how good he is at social novels (e.g., The American Senator, The Way We Live Now) and more excitingly peopled romances (e.g., The Claverings) this book was, for me at least, a real let-down. The plot involves a young girl who is certain of the affections of her suitor even when (highly contrived) circumstances make it appear to all around her that he is, in fact, a jilt. Don't read this next sentence if you plan on reading the book: Surprise! Little Rachel was right all along and her lover in fact marries her. *YAWN!*Along the way, there are a lot of fairly typical Trollopian subplots dealing with country families putting on town airs, modernization of the brewing industry, and other fun stuff that does illuminate nineteenth-century country life for the twenty-first-century reader. But none of it is particularly compelling, at least not for me.Bottom line: I adore Trollope and have read most of his output, but if I were to rank his works Rachel Ray would be near, or even at, the bottom."},{"Title":"Rachel Ray","review":"Beer and evangelicals: that's what you'll find in Anthony Trollope's Rachel Ray.What Luke Rowan cares about is brewing good beer. He inherits a portion of the brewery of Messrs. Bungall and Tappitt, gentlemen who consistently made muddy, disagreeable beer. Naturally Mr. Tappitt objects to an upstart nephew suggesting ways to improve his beer. To Tappitt, beer is business; Luke thinks there is a great deal of poetry in brewing beer.He is \\"a young man, by no means of the bad sort, meaning to do well, with high hopes in life, one who had never wronged a woman, or been untrue to a friend, full of energy and hope and pride. But he was conceited, prone to sarcasm, sometimes cynical, and perhaps sometimes affected.\\" Perhaps the greatest compliment is that Luke \\"had the gift of making himself at home with people.\\"In the character of Dorothea Prime, Rachel's widowed sister, Trollope takes aim at pharisaical pietism. \\"Her fault was this: that she had taught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin.\\"Nice things aggravated her spirits and made her fretful. She liked the tea to be stringy and bitter, she liked the bread to be stale; --as she preferred also that her weeds should be battered and old. She was approaching that stage of discipline at which ashes become pleasant eating, and sackcloth is grateful to the skin. The self-indulgences of the saints often exceed anything that is done by the sinners.Sweet Rachel Ray is the antithesis of her sister. \\"She walked as though the motion were pleasant to her, and easy,--as though the very act of walking were a pleasure.\\" Rachel's sister wants to keep her cloistered at home, leaving only for church services and afternoon teas at Miss Pucker's house. Rachel protests, \\"If I was minded to be bad, shutting me up would not keep me from it.\\"Thus two views of marriage and courtship are at opposition. Trollope poses \\"that great question, What line of moral conduct might best befit a devout Christian?\\"1) Marriage is the happiest condition for a young woman, and for a young man, too. And how are young people to get married if they are not allowed to see each other?versus2) Men and women, according to her theory, were right to marry and have children; but she thought that such marriages should be contracted not only in a solemn spirit, but with a certain dinginess of solemnity, with a painstaking absence of mirth.I loved the storyline; I adored the writing. Phrases like \\"elated with dismal joy\\" and \\"she knew her mother must be appeased and her sister opposed\\" and \\"burial service over past unkindness\\" delighted me."},{"Title":"Rachel Ray","review":"An easy read, but certainly not the best Trollope wrote. The characters don't come to live, and the part about the elections, which quite often Trollope describes well, falls flat. The other Trollope speciality, a hunt, is missing. All in all, the book is rather bland."},{"Title":"Rachel Ray","review":"Having read all forty-seven of Trollope's novels, I would recommend Rachel Ray as the first one to read for someone unfamiliar with Trollope's work. The book is relatively short, Rachel is a delightful person, the plot is simple, the anti-evangelical theme is typical Trollope, the sense of place is good, and it all ends happily. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"Rachel Ray","review":"I was delighted with the condition and enjoyed the book.

This study package was just the key to bring me back up to speed. All the material is presented in a simple yet effective manner, so even people with little technical background can grasp it quickly. Concepts are also emphasized according to &quot;must know&quot; and &quot;recommended.&quot; That way, you know where to distribute your studying time. I would even go as far to say that this package is better than the materials that Kaplan and Princeton Review provide because it's concise and straight forward rather than a huge, discouraging phonebook. As far as the practice problems go, they're good for review and brush up as well as introductory learning, but if you're weak in any area, I'd suggest you go for the supplementary &quot;1001 questions&quot; books also available from examkrackers. Beyond confidence in one's mastery of the material, practice is the only way to ensure a high score. That's what I did to compensate for my shortcomings in the verbal section - I bought &quot;101 passages.&quot; In terms of time commitment, I studied one chapter a day in two subjects with verbal and a break interspersed every couple of days (which took a total of about a month). After completing the examkrackers stuff, I just did some practice tests that I ordered from aamc.org (along with two kaplan tests). I took the April 2004 MCAT, and I'm hoping for a score in the high 30's."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"I am studying on my own using only these books supplemented by old course material when needed. I have not taken the MCAT yet, so I'm not sure what my ultimate results will be, but in general, I find these books very useful in condensing the information in pertinent and coherent ways.But I just wanted to give prospective buyers a heads up - THESE BOOKS ARE FULL OF TYPOS, AND YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SEE THE CORRECTIONS! In the book's introduction, it suggests that you check the published errata on the website early and often, and post any errors you find. They spend a whole paragraph lavishing praise on themselves for being the only company to publish their mistakes. What they don't say is you have to PAY $20 EXTRA to have access to the errata forum, posting OR viewing.And don't believe their hype - there are MANY typos. More than I have ever seen in any textbook. Most are innocent enough, spelling errors and such. But some involve missing diagrams, confusing and/or contradictory explanations of answers, and typos in formulas or equations. I have no idea if Examkrackers is aware of these errors, since I refuse to pay MORE MONEY just to have access to the forum.I know $20 doesn't seem like such a big deal, but anyone going through the MCAT and AMCAS application process knows that, financially, it is like death from a thousand cuts. An extra $20 fee slapped on there \\"just because\\" is an insult.My ultimate suggestion: these books are helpful, but don't feel bad about getting these products used. I am not impressed by Examkrackers' unethical business practices."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"The books are good not doubt about it, they highlight the info in a very easy way. However, they do not elaborate on subjects that are problematic for typical students like acid/base chemistry and fluid motion and magnetism. I think they rely way to heavily on diagrams rather than actually discussing topics. Buy the books if you want the basics but realize that this cannot be your only tool - there is really not a lot of practice in them and you will still have to review major concepts on your own. Its a good start though.Stay away from the classes though! They pretty much hire anyone, do not have their own training protocal and charge you an arm and a leg!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"The MCAT is a difficult test and to do well, most people will have to study very hard. This series of books does not remove the element of personal responsibility and the need to study very hard- it does, however, help focus that valuable study time and provide some useful tips. They review the topics suggested by the AAMC and explain the information clearly and concisely. If you are serious about medical school, then you are most likely willing to do the time, make the effort, and give it your all- many students are, in fact, willing to do just that and it is not due to lack of trying or lack of hard work that they have a hard time with the MCAT. Often the necessary volume of information seems daunting, especially when it is buried in the text of thick textbooks- this resource strips away the fluff and reduces the information down to just what you need to know. No single resource is perfect for everyone, and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who is not willing to work hard- but to those who are, I found them to be an invaluable tool that I credit, in part, to helping me go from a 25S in 2002 to a 33S this summer. Whatever you end up doing, I think a substantial secret to success is to be honest with yourself and examine what your study time is producing- not every topic will be instantly interesting to everyone, but take the time, go sentence by sentence, and MAKE yourself be interested in it! Examkrackers helps with this, but the onus ultimately is with the student. Best of luck!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"I loved these books because they boosted my practice mcat scores from 11-11-12 to 14-13-13 in one month. The only weak spot I saw was in the electrochemistry and wave motion chapters in chem and physics respectively. The material was compact but dense, adding theyoy not on the MCAT as a way to explore concepts, while at the same time labeling it as such. I'd recommend having a chem and physics textbook, or the internet, nearby if you want to look up the SI units of a formula they give, the derivation, or similar expanded coverage. I only found 5 or 6 paragraphs that poorly explained their topics. The overall package is great, although you should have a reference nearby."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"I must say that the EK materials were extremely helpful for me in studying for the mcat. After taking practice tests and scoring well below par I bought the EK books and studied for 3 months striaght along with the AAMC practice tests. I took the April 2005 mcat and scored a 30 because of these books. The only thing I suggest is going over more in depth physical sciences concepts; the EK physics book is great, but the actual exam tends to make it look easier. The crucial concept behind the EK books, however, isn't in my opionion to provide you with info, but to teach you how the mcat works; how concepts are tested. And that makes all the difference.If you want to score well on the mcat you don't need to spend $1,000's on a course; just buckle down, study the EK books and maybe a physics book (notes), and take lots of AAMC practice tests. If you do that you should have no trouble. I definitely recommend this product!!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"This is book is very good not just for the MCAT but also for the regular pre med classes.

I read each section, took notes, and took the test at the end. After taking the test, I documented which questions I got wrong and why. I also kept a running list of formulas, etc. My one complaint about ExamKrackers is the way their test questions are worded. I did so badly on their practice test that I almost didn't take the real thing. I also used MCAT 45 to review the really tough stuff. These books did a great job of reviewing general information though. I even used them while tutoring students in O-Chem.

My story is not that amazing, but I did take the MCAT twice and was pleased with my second-time score, which did go higher than my first one. I am definitely sure that Examkrackers presents the same information as the other prep companies, but has advantages of its own. First of all, it is much easier to read a color-illustrated book, in my opinion (call me shallow?), and secondly, I think EK's \\"lecture quizzes\\" and exams are more useful than other companies' similar prep-books which fall short of providing extra questions following chapters. They usually just provide a few \\"full length\\" exams. If you're not going to take a class, and choose to buy the prep material, go with EK...it's the best there is, I believe!I also don't think a prep course is necessary with this material and the AAMC past tests (see www.e-mcat.com). I took an online prep course, used EK and also the material provided by the prep-company (since EK prep courses aren't available in my part of the country). I feel that the most benefit of the prep course was the full-length AAMC tests (since I made use of those the most, and also took some CBT \\"full-lengths\\" made by the prep company).

The information that is in here is correct, but it doesnt have all the information needed! Also there are numerous typing errors and in particular, the questions that are asked of you often require knowledge of information that hasn't been taught yet in the lesson! for example, for each chapter there is a set of questions. For the questions testing chapter 1, there are questions that ask you about things that are taught in chapter 5! what the hell?? There are also questions at the end of each portion of the chapter. these also ask questions that were not taught in that portion or in any other area of the book! believe me i know because I spent an hour searching through the whole book looking for some kind of explanation. what the?? This is a very poorly constructed review guide. Additionally, if you look at it, the person who wrote this is not even an MD or PhD. He is a BA in HISTORY! it says he sat for the MCAT 3 times between 1989-1996....ok....what the hell what he doing in the meantime? It says he got in the 90th percentile for all three sections while taking those tests...great. I'm assuming not all at once, obviously he didn't go to medical school. Plus if you're studying for the MCAT for 7 years you'd better do well on at least one section.

I wouldn't recommend this book to others!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"MY STORY:Lets start with my score on the first MCAT I took... 13. (8V, 3PS, 2BS) My score on the MCAT of Aug/03 was 35. (12V, 12PS, 11BS) I am not that smart but at the moment I am at Georgetown School of Medicine with a scholarship and I owe it completely to Examkrackers. I never took a prep course and I also only took 32 hours of science courses ever. I was a finance major.HOW I PREPARED:I studied at a bookstore for the MCAT and in addition to having my textbooks, every widely available MCAT resource, and every esoteric text I could buy on Amazon, I bought all the examkrackers stuff. I also bought the past exams available from AAMC. After the first month, I realized using anything but Examkrackers stuff and the AAMC stuff was detrimental to my progress. I spent around 450 HOURS STUDYING and taking practice exams. My practice exams came from Gold Standard, Kaplan, Examkrackers, and the actual past exams from AAMC. You should take a practice exam every week but only trust your scores from the examkrackers and the aamc's. The rest are just practice.MY ADVICE:TEXTBOOKS?!? If someone tells me they used their textbooks to study, I wonder if they have even been to the AAMC website. Look at the content description for the MCAT!Examkrackers is the only company that covers the stuff on the MCAT with great detail and ignores everything else. They also keep it interesting with illustrations, jokes, etc. Want proof? Why hasn't Kaplan changed their books or the content of their prep course (that course is a joke) after the AAMC changed the content of the MCAT? Examkrackers is interesting and it provides you with a plethora of questions to practice.If I had it to do over again, I would buy the past exams from AAMC (a must, you are cheating yourself if you don't) and everything possible from Examkrackers (the CD's are a must too). After doing that I would look myself in a room with them for around 400-500 hours and then sit the exam. This is a guranteed recipe for success.MY WARNING:You may be successful doing other things or spending less time studying but let me warn you that nothing is more time consuming or expensive then spending an extra year in college or doing some lame research because you couldn't get into med school on the first try. Dish out the money on these prep materials, put in the time and you will be in med school in august."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"I cannot recommend this set highly enough. I used these books and virtually nothing else to study for the MCAT. In fact, I recommend that you NOT use anything other than the ExamKrackers books (backed up by your textbooks as necessary when you need a particular topic clarified). They present absolutely everything you need to know -- and, more importantly, they tell you what you DON'T need to know. The MCAT covers an overwhelming amount of material as is, and these books tell you what not to waste your time studying. Every time I picked up a different company's study guide, I was sorry almost immediately due to their wealth of irrelevant content and confusing organization.The ExamKrackers books present their information with full-color drawings on glossy pages, written in colloquial language that holds your attention. Formulas that must be memorized are written in bold red centered font and compiled at the end of each chapter. If a topic is particularly important, it tells you so; if a topic is background and won't be tested directly, it tells you so. Helpful mnemonics and diagrams abound. The book on general math skills and verbal reasoning provides real, very helpful strategies. Even if you don't find their mascot, Salty the Kracker, amusing, his presence helps lighten the mood, which in turn helps you maintain your concentration.The ExamKrackers books were absolutely indispensable for my MCAT preparation. When I bought the set one month before the MCAT, I felt completely overwhelmed by the task of studying for the MCAT. Using these books (and devoting my entire spring break to them), I was able to wrap my brain around all of the necessary subject matter. I'm not a science major and I started taking the premed classes less than a year before I took the MCAT. Do these books work?

At my undergrad institution it is not typical for students to do well on the MCAT (they usually score in the teens). When I took my first practice test I scored a mere 15 in my junior year. Then the summer before I took the August MCAT I discovered this series and what a difference it made. I can't imagine what I might have scored if I had more than 3 months to study.Examkrackers only teaches the stuff you really need to know for the MCAT and puts it in clear examples so you can understand. It does not simply just reprint all of your science textbooks in one volume, like Kaplan and Princeton Review.Also the 30-Minute quizzes at the back of each book are extremely good indicators of how you will actually score on the real test. I found that sticking to a study schedule and actually working through the examples was very effective.Pay attention to Salty, he gives excellent memorization tips and they really stay with you.If you want to do well on the MCAT, then purchase this series. It will be well worth it."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","review":"Ek bio - this is the STUFF!! I pwned the BS MCAT by reading this book 3 times and difficult topics 2-3 more times. Was able to teach myself microbiology and human physiology with this book. you don't need advance classes like genetics, cell bio, physiology, microbiology, biochemistry etc.EK Orgo- Very condensed. Excellent chapter on experiments. Very solid review book but Bio book is still tops. note cards tear out of book that's on heavy stock of paper. memorize those. I needed to use a chart from my Pavia Ochem lab manual to figure out solubilities. Solubility Test is CRUCIAL for MCAT passages.EK Chemistry - Good book. Wish it had more examples in the Acid/base chemistry. Electrochem chapter probably needs a small amount of further explanation. Everything else is solid. Supplemented with textbook and kaplan comprehensive review(for more examples of problems). One caveat: I took general chem well over 10+ years ago.EK Physics - Good book. E&M; chapters needs more work. The Thermo chapter is actually very good. Thermo is just a tough topic. Should have an example on incline planes explained in the readings before heading into problems. The Optics chapter is actually very good if you spend some time on it. This is a solid book but I had to supplement 2 chapters with a physics text book and kaplan comprehensive review(for more examples of problems). One caveat: I took physics well over 10+ years ago.The end of chapter topic questions in EK PS/BS are right on par with the MCAT. I redid these with each reading and can say they are challenging so that you are not going to simply memorize the answers. You really need to activate the thought process. the 30 minute exams are great as well. Don't do the 30 minute exams until you feel comfortable with the material.If I took Chemistry and Physics within the last 2 years like I did with orgo and bio I'm sure I would not need to supplement with textbooks. When I took the exam I only completed basic sciences so need for upper division science classes. Get the AAMC MCAT Topic list then be sure to buy AAMC exams and EK Verbal 101.

This is not to say that their material isn't useful. I found Kaplan's test strategies much more helpful for getting my timing down on the individual sections, but EK provides better foundation review and retention methods. I suggest using both, but if money is a factor, go with EK. I have spent almost $3,000 studying for this exam and wish I had discovered EK earlier--it would have saved me some financially.

Then have your mind work like a great table in the book: &quot;Instead of this, eat that, and you'll save .... calories.&quot; If you can reduce your caloric intake by 500 calories a day, you'll lose a pound a week--since the magic number for losing one pound is a net deficit of 3500 calories. This means that, if you can reduce your old intake by 700 calories a day {not hard if you have been a dessert eater, a snacker, or have one or two beers a day or whatever, you will lose a pound every 5 days. This is 4-6 pounds a month, 48-72 pounds a year, plus more when you increase your exercise.Dr. Parsons warns, however, against the perception that exercise will play a major role in your weight loss program. It plays a role,but a minor one, and thinking it is a major factor can make you let up on getting tough with your caloric intake. {I have been so good with my exercise that it won't matter if I eat that piece of cheesecake.&quot;) But it DOES matter, and that kind of thinking can destroy your progress and ruin a program.He explains that the only exercise you will ever need is 30 minutes of brisk walking (the best you can manage) each day, which you must GET TOUGH and build into your day's schedule.TOUGH TALK lists 11 tips on how to design your own program, 16 strategies to reduce your intake before even think of a calorie number, and 20 ways to reduce your intake of fats, the highest in calories.

The dialogue in this book is positively silly. Pelon, the brutish half-Mexican, half-Apache, one hundred percent outlaw bandit speaks as if he was educated at Oxford, and has a sense of honor not normally found in your average outlaw bandit/murderer. Mackenna knows the map to the gold, so Pelon can't kill him, at least not until the location of the gold is pointed out. Mackenna, of course, is busy trying not to fall in love with the beautiful young hostage, and avoiding the amorous intentions of Pelon's Apache sister. Western escapest literature from the early sixties."},{"Title":"Mackennas Gold (Gunsmoke Western)","review":"While never a cimena classic, the 1969 film adaptation has always been one of my favorite \\"nothing special\\" movies, so that was enough for me to read the Will Henry novel when a used copy passed through my hands.The novel is radically different from the film, the novel is much slower and less exciting, but still good-enough escapist Western fiction on it's own terms. The previous reviewers have done a good job detailing the differences, so I have nothing to add there.If you are a fan of western fiction, you'll not be bored,and Henry is an established name in the genre. If you've seen the movie, check out the novel and see how different it is from the film adaptation."},{"Title":"Mackennas Gold (Gunsmoke Western)","review":"This is Will Henry's novel that was the basis for the movie of the same name from 1969 starring Gregory Peck and Omar Sharif. The movie is a fine adaptation. I love the movie, and found the book entertaining, if only for discovering the differences between it and the movie. For example, Heshke, the fetching but nasty Apache girl is called Sally in the book. And her nose has been cut off. And she doesn't meet her demise anywhere near like in the movie. The movie version is far better. In fact, all the characters are better developed in the movie. Colorado is called Pelon in the book and the deadly encounter between him and Hachita is much different in the book. And the words of Pelon, at the end of his fight with Hachita, are truly laughable. Cartoon dialog at its finest! In the book, there is no band of Apache's who enter the gold canyon while MacKenna is there. And the white girl helps out MacKenna much more during his fight with Hachita (in the movie, the final fight is with Colorado). Let's just say that she handles an ax better in the book than she does the belt in the movie.A character completely missing from the movie, Mal-y-pais, Sally's mother, survives along with our two heroes. She is one of the more interesting characters in the book. In the book, almost ludicrously, MacKenna cusses and beats the white girl at one point! And earlier in the book she suggests they get married after this is all over! MacKenna's treatment of the white girl (i.e. the cussing and beating) in the book might be more realistic, but definitely not in keeping with Gregory Peck's image! The movie wisely avoids these character defects. Tibbs is an Apache half-breed in the book. Pelon/Colorado does a lot more killing in the book. Watch out for that serape!"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2004 Classic Edition","review":"I've used the pocket pharmacopoeia for many years, and it's the only book I'll buy every year when the new edition comes out. It's amazing how they can stuff so much info into a pocket-sized book. Sure, ePocrates and other handheld databases have more info, but I can usually look up a medicine in the pharmacopoeia faster than it takes to open up a Palm and type in the med name. This and the Sanford guide are the two most important quick reference guides available - I only wish the Sanford guide was as easy to read as the pharmacopoeia.The medications are organized by specialty (e.g. cardiovascular, neurological), but all of them are indexed by both generic and brand names, so I usually turn to the index first. Dosing information, pill size, pregnancy class, and relative cost are all listed concisely.

Freudenburg's sabbatical experience led him to understand the needs of his family (him) and the need for the church to enable,allow and train parents to be the source of their childrens faith and practice of faith. This book will challenge your thinking about ministry and life in ministry. It will create a paradigm shift in your churches priorities which I believe would be the most positive move you could make.This book could easily be titled the Family Friendly Ministry. Change the word church to fit your organization and you will be challenged to a more effective and efficient ministry."},{"Title":"The Family-Friendly Church","review":"The Family Friendly Church is the chronicle of personal discovery by Ben Freudenburg. The discovery may seem simple but it is an area missed by many churches. How about yours? Ministry to children and families with young children is often overlooked and undervalued.Often when a church grows or adds staff, the first position to be filled is the youth pastor. Unfortunately this is a plan that follows traditional practice and not conventional understanding. One must look no further than current statistics to determine this.According to the Barna research group, children are the most available to receiving and accepting the Good News. If you are spending the majority of your church's momentum, manpower, and resource on something other than children, you may be unwisely using your talents. Children are the future and most likely the best way to reach the adult population in your community.The Family Friendly Church will offer suggestions and simple resources to reach families with children. Employ your leaders and families in the process of building a strong Family Friendly Church."},{"Title":"The Family-Friendly Church","review":"Ben Freudenburg has established himself as one of the most respected Christian Education directors of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. His glimse into home-based Christian education, as opposed to the conventional church-based Christian education, has changed many individuals views on how the church reaches out through traditional Christian education methods. This book presents a wonderful philosophical basis for beginning the shift to a home-based Christian education system. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Family-Friendly Church","review":"Should the Christian family support the church and be church-centered, or should the church support the family and be family-centered? The Family Friendly Church, by Freudenburg and Lawrence argues that to reach the needs of Boomers and their families a shift needs to take place from a church-centered family to a family-centered church. By facilitating ministry with the families, not to them, the church accomplishes its mission and develops strong families."},{"Title":"The Family-Friendly Church","review":"Great book! The first two chapters alone are worth the price of the book. It does represent a paradigm shift so some church staff and pastors may be tempted to bolt before finishing the book. For those who persevere, the reward is great. Some of the examples toward the end will make more sense from readers of a similar denominational background but the principles apply equally across denominational lines. A more contemporary read is Mark Holmen's Building Faith at Home and Rob Rienow's Visionary Parenting. None of these books are about disciplining your children or running a youth ministry. All of them address the need to move away from isolating our children in programs and getting the parents involved in the spiritual lives and upbringing of their children."},{"Title":"The Family-Friendly Church","review":"This book was purchased as a text book for a graduate course at Campbell Divinity School.

It's a solid overview of the big Maya topics--modeling, rigging, lighting, keyframe animation, dynamics, particles, MEL. In fact, it's the most comprehensive overview I was able to find.I read it to get a sense of the big-picture concepts, rather than pick my way through the tutorials themselves.

Unfortunately the authors tend to limit some parts of their 900+ pages explanation to a simple remark, like 'Using a selection mask, pick the end hull of the torus and scale it down.' - without telling what where the selection mask can be found, or how to invoke the hull. So then you're stuck and have to get help in another way.Even the index in the back doesn't mention 'hull', which is one of the basic tools of Maya. This book is focussed on a project (Mighty Muskrat), but it's too bad everything else had to go for it.

The reviews are informative and entertaining, and never talk down to the reader (a fault found in many film books). The big draw here for me is Curry's personal interviews; not only with Lewis and his longtime partner David Freidman, but also with some of his players, including Fuad Ramses himself, Mal Arnold! This book is a valuable addition to my collection... one I will turn to many times for reference."},{"Title":"A Taste Of Blood: The Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis","review":"A Taste of Blood will surely become a treasured part in the collection of every fan of the Godfather of Gore. The book is a comprehensive guide to the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis and an insightful and candid look into the world of exploitation films. It is one exceptional fan's tribute to H.G. Lewis and a fond look back at some of the defining films of the drive-in era. The author provides a detailed look at each and every one of H.G. Lewis' bloody and bizarre (but always entertaining) films. The book contains exclusive interviews, behind the scenes information, detailed plot summaries, and plenty of great insights provided by H.G. Lewis, David Friedman, and many others. Also, the book is overflowing with tons of rare pictures that you will probably never find anywhere else. A Taste of Blood is an entertaining, educational, and engrossing book for the veteran or novice horror/exploitation fan. If you're an H.G. Lewis fan, this book should already be on your shelf. As a long time fan of the Godfather of Gore myself, I'm in awe of the wealth of information included in this book. Give Christopher Curry some well-deserved credit by ordering his book.

Lewis. Taste offers capsulated reviews of all of Mr. Lewis's films as well as interesting interviews with key players. This book is definetly a work written &quot;by a fan, for the fans&quot; and lacks the objective insights to make it a five star work. It is ,however, a compasionate and long overdue tribute to one facet of a multitalented gentleman who deserves the title &quot;Wizard of Gore&quot;."},{"Title":"A Taste Of Blood: The Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis","review":"This book is a great resource for anyone interested in Herschell Gordon Lewis, or exploitation films in general. Curry has done a remarkable job collecting information on Lewis's somewhat obscure oeuvre giving us a nice plot synopsis, stills or exploitation artwork, and some insightful and often humorous anecdotes. However, if you are hoping for scholarly material, this title is sadly lacking. Curry qualifies more as a \\"film buff,\\" than a \\"writer\\". Much like a Herschell Gordon Lewis film, Curry's cumbersome prose is often unintentionally hilarious. He possesses the grammar and vocabulary of a high school student and one wonders how much of the material could slip by without notice from an editor. Nevertheless, it's difficult to be upset with Curry because his presentation is completely sincere. He's does not write the book just to become a published author. He simply loves these films and wants to share them with others. Overall, I highly recommend this book.[Since writing this review a year ago, I've collected more of the Creation Cinema books (19 more to be exact). I can no longer completely fault Curry for his amateurish prose style. The Creation Cinema books as a series are quite frequently sloppy in much the same way. The value in the series is the examination of areas of film that previously went virtually unnoticed by mainstream film criticism. The difficulty is that I can't feel great about buying a book that I could have written better. Curry does a good job as far as research and content are concerned, but I'm sure there are many writers who could communicate with more grace and skill. It's unfortunate that these studies weren't conducted by more seasoned scholars, but since they are rather unique, they remain essential for anyone interested in the obscure, arcane, and just plain weird. I still recommend A Taste of Blood, but don't be disappointed by the style.]"},{"Title":"A Taste Of Blood: The Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis","review":"\\"A Taste of Blood\\" is a book I would never have gone out and purchased, but under some unusual circumstance I came to read this book.Not having heard of H.G.

I was hoping (given the $22.95 price tag) for more social, cultural, and filmic analyses. The book briefly reviews each Lewis film, encapsulating the plot and perhaps a funny anecdote or two. It also contains interviews with Lewis, David F. Friedman, and a few others. Unfortunately these interviews are surprisingly vapid, as if the interviewer is more interested in showing off his knowledge of exploitation trivia than actually extracting interesting information. The interview with Lewis in \\"Incredibly Strange Films\\" is better. I also found myself quite annoyed by the author's free-and-easy use of the terms \\"genius\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" in connection with Lewis's oeuvre. Now, I'm probably the first to defend the works of Bava and Corman in the face of elitist disdain, but, c'mon, a genius Lewis ain't. You can still like his films--even though you admit they're pretty pathetic.

Matt Christopher: The #1 Sportswriter for Kids","review":"Perhaps more than any other children's author, the prolific Matt Christopher reminds kids that in order to succeed in life, you must work hard and never give up. After entertaining youngsters for more than forty years with dozens of stories that contain this important message, his son Dale now tells his story.The son of Italian immigrants, Matt Christopher was born in 1917. A good student, and a better athlete, he had hopes of becoming a major league ballplayer. He actually played in the minors for a time before realizing he didn't quite have what it took to make it all the way. Perhaps it was this experience that made him sympathetic to the yearnings of his readers and more realistic in their eyes.His family could not afford to send him to college, so Christopher held many jobs as a young adult. But in the back of his mind, he always wanted to be a writer. As any member of that profession can tell you, it's a very difficult career, one that can be quite harsh in bursting dreams of aspiring authors. Christopher suffered many drawbacks in the form of rejections for his stories, but it never stopped him. His persistence was rewarded fifty years ago when his manuscript for THE LUCKY BASEBALL BAT was accepted by Little, Brown and the book was published in 1954.Following this debut, Christopher kept coming up with new ideas, updating his stories with the changing times to incorporate other sports as they became more popular, such as soccer and skateboarding, and using girls as his main characters rather than in supporting roles. (He also published mysteries for young readers, although his publisher insisted he do so under a pen name.)Christopher also wrote several sports biographies for kids, including such inspirational favorites as Lance Armstrong, Wayne Gretzky, Mia Hamm, Tony Hawk, Michael Jordan, Mark McGuire and Tiger Woods, among others.Dale Christopher's examination of his father --- who passed away in 1997 --- is affectionate, proud and honest. Things weren't always easy for the Christopher family, but they stuck together and were favored with a degree of fame within the children's literary community. At the conclusion of this tribute, the son cites the father's philosophy, which was the focal point in many of his stories:\\"Don't ever stop doing what you believe. Don't ever let anyone stop you from realizing your dream.\\"--- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan (ronk23@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Behind the Desk with...

The author looks at the relations between men and women in peasant communities in Mexico, using concrete examples of real families that went through the justice system. But not just husbands-wives--he addresses daughters-parents (mother/father), sisters-brothers, AND fathers-sons, brothers-brothers... Priests-parishioners... he really looks at patriarchy as a system that organized society NOT as static and merely oppressive, but dynamic and unstable. And he looks at how patriarchy not only organized men-women relations, but relations between the rich and poor AND politics and power, in the most convincing way I have read so far.

Mark Shand's matter-of-fact writing style and unshamedly romantic account of a trip across India on his elephant Tara, will make you curious about India and fall in love with this beautiful creature that became a grown man's best friend.

Shand writes honestly and insightfully about his experiences on an elephant Trek through India which makes the book all the more refreshing. An easy afternoon read by the fire with your map of India on your lap."},{"Title":"Travels on My Elephant","review":"The British seem to be particularly adept at coming up with whimsical ideas, making them happen, and then writing about them (cf. comedian Tony Hawk's Round Ireland With A Fridge, and Playing the Moldovans At Tennis or journalist Andrew Marshall's The Trouser People to mention just a few recent examples). Shand continues the tradition, concocting a scheme to buy an elephant and march around India on its back. This quick-reading book is an account of his adventure in India, where he purchases an emaciated 30-year old elephant ... from a pair of saddhus (mystic holy men) in the province of Orissa (a few hundred kilometers SW of Calcutta). His goal is to walk her from the coast to the great elephant market on the banks of the Ganges at Sonepur Mela, some 1000 kilometers north, in Bihar, where he would sell her.However, as he soon discovers, elephants have a lot of personality, and he quickly falls in love with his. The pleasure of the book is not its travelogue description of the sights and sounds along the way (although these do break things up), but the mischievous antics of the elephant and the discovery of its personality as a loving and lovable creature. Tara, the elephant, displays remarkable intelligence and wit over the course of the journey, although at times Shand does veer into anthropomorphizing her. While he doesn't go deep into the role of the elephant in Indian and Hindu culture, it's clear from his travels that they are widely revered as symbols of Ganesh, as bystanders often often small prayers and alms to Tara.Shand's own lessons in becoming a \\"mahoot\\", one who is versed in the ways of elephants and able to ride/guide one, is an equally fascinating and touching story. An older and younger mahoot are along to train him, as is a photographer friend and two rascally drivers with a support Jeep. It's a fun adventure, with a suspiciously fortuitous climax at the market, when Shand discovers he can't bear to sell his elephant for use as a moneymaking curiosity. It's a touching book in many ways, although some readers may be put off by the notion of a Westerner traipsing around a poor country on an elephant, especially given India's colonial past. Still whatever one may think of that, Shand's love for the animal is clearly genuine. He's written a followup book (Queen of the Elephants), that's apparently not as good."},{"Title":"Travels on My Elephant","review":"British writers, writing about India are of two types. One are genuine humanists who look at today's India from an objective albeit sometimes sympathetic point of view. Mark Shand falls in the other category- ruminating nostalgically about the Raj, although, the present story is somewhat melodramatic and about an elephant.One good test to distinguish between the two is to ask the question, what would the person be if the 'Raj' was still alive. I am positive, Mark Shand would fall into the class of people who would live secluded in \\"McCluskeygunge\\" (a closed gate communty of Anglophiles) and sneer at the poor natives with an upturned nose!Unfortunately, fair skin on its own merit(?) still attracts salutes in India. The three hundrend years of oppressive british tyrrany has been hard to shake off. Shand lives by the power of his white skin and rules with his green currency and day dreams about the serenity and glory (for the english) of the Raj.I have yet to come across a genuine expression of guilt or shame in a britisher about their colonial sins. To take the case of India, the richest coutry on the planet, sucking it dry of all its resources and riches, and leaving it to fend for itself. And now Shand returns to satisfy his whim of travelling on an elephant and revel in touristic sightseeing of the poverty and the overwhelming deterioration! Utterly disgusting!!"},{"Title":"Healthy Living in Wisconsin","review":"This is a good book for anyone living in Wisconsin. Also good for someone thinking about moving to Wisconsin. It is loaded with information and numerous resources on many different topics, from recreational activities, to raising children, to staying healthy in the winter, and Wisconsin's environment and wildlife."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Sarah Orne Jewett, through cloudless vision into the souls of her characters and deep connection of their relationship with nature, lures the unwilling to her sanctuary. Captain Littlepage, who identifies with the sea for example, is drawn out through his mysterious stories of voyages. Mrs. Todd finds peace and fulfillment in healing herbs and hospitality. Joannah exists on an isolated island a reader is able to feel that they know. As one customer commented, &quot;personalities are shaped and distilled into persons of real character&quot; (&quot;a short story collection centered around the people of Maine&quot;). A sense of genuine devotion the people of the close knit community share for each other is certainly captured in Jewett's chronicles. William's repeated abandonment of his inhibitions is a model of the tenderness exposed throughout the tale. &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot; is a story that deserves respect and commendation for it's gentle picturesque style that relates so appropriately with common people Jewett illustrates in a different light.Still, valid criticism is generated by our action-based, youth-oriented society where quietly unfolding &quot;wisdom&quot; (&quot;Old Time Country Charmer&quot;) has little opportunity to gain appreciation. If you're looking for action, you won't find it here. Nor will you travel through the thoughts of complex, fascinating characters. It is far from surprising that not all readers want to be removed from the high-paced world in which most of us take part. Maybe &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot; remains uninviting to youth because such a generation does not want to take part in the details of a story that describes an unrecognized fear: aging. This is truly a work that will be what is brought to it. Older people might have a more mature sense of the beauty and peace that could come from a stop to smell Jewett's roses."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Jewett's Country of the Pointed Firs seemed like a good choice for reading while summering in Maine. Indeed her character who narrates the book is a woman author spending the summer in a small seaside Maine town.Sara Orne Jewett gets a mention in American literature classes as a local color writer. This book demonstates her style with its descriptions of the Maine countryside, village life in the 1890s, and insight into the lives of island dwellers and retired fishermen and sea captains.There's not much that would be considered a plot, just casual meetings with interesting characters in the area. To glimpse life in coastal Maine more than a centruy ago, this is the book for you.I look forward to visiting the author's home in South Berwick. It's a national historic site."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I thought that Sarah Orne Jewett's, The Country Of The Pointed Firs, was a highly creative and illustrative work of art. Jewett's depictive style of a calm and satisfying life, combined with breathtakingly beautiful detail, was unlike anything I have ever experienced. I could actually imagine myself on a desolate island of green fields and trees, while being surrounded by calm blue waters. Though repetitive, and dull at times, I found myself plunging within the depths of the book to uncover a wonderful, yet almost hidden meaning. The meaning of lonliness, and the satisfaction the characters find within the essence of their lonliness. Simple satisfactions like the beauty of the countryside, picking herbs and fishing, visiting family and friends, or recalling the memories of their lives past. The book began with the narrator, a writer who left the busyness of a hectic city, to discover the peacefulness of Dunnet Landing. The novel simply concludes with the narrator's regret of having to leave the island, in order that she return to her life in the city. On arrival at Dunnet Landing, the narrator encountered Mrs. Almiry Todd. While living as a guest in Mrs. Todd's home, she not only discovered the peacefulness of the countryside, but also the satisfaction that was found among its dwellers. As her stay progressed, the narrator developed a loving relationship with the island and its inhabitants. She encountered people like Mrs. Todd, William, Captain Littlepage, Mrs. Fosdick, the Bowden's, and of course, Mrs. Blackwell. The narrator also enjoyed engaging in conversations about people who once inhabited the island, like Johanna and Nathan. Throughout the book, the narrator discovered the calm and satisfying pleasures of enjoying the simple things in life. While putting aside the pleasures found within city life, she discovered the joy of picking herbs, recalling memories, visiting people, or just taking a walk. All in all, Jewett describes a novel about finding the satisfaction within a lonely life, a life that is characterized through maturity. The characters on the island portray lonliness, which is the basis of our human condition. However, despite their lonliness, the people of Dunnet Landing share strong bonds connected through families and friendships. Through the context of their isolation on Dunnet Landing, they are able to achieve the satisfaction of all desired nature. Finally, I thought that some readers were harsh in reviewing the book. If people would broaden their horizons by opening their minds and hearts to this passive style of writing, they might uncover a valuable perspective that one day they will cherish!"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Before I sat down to read Sarah Orne Jewett's, &quot;Country of the Pointed Furs&quot;, I read the reviews that were posted on this page. The first review lead me to believe that this was going to be the worst book that I have ever read. The reader said, &quot;The whole class, including the teacher, thought that it was a complete waste of time; and that we lost a valuable week in our lives by reading this book.&quot; This was a really strong negative reaction to a piece of literature, but never the less it made me fearful of beginning the book. In contrast to that review, yet another review reads, &quot;Jewett definitely has a way with words and makes you wish you were in Maine, witnessing the events of the novel.&quot; In addition, a fellow reader goes on to describe the work as &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;A must read if you are interested in 19 C female authors.&quot; Needless to say, I was confused wheather or not I was going to like, love, hate, or despise this literary work. As I read through the book, I understood where a person could get confused or fall asleep during all the &quot;action&quot;, but I also understood that this piece of literature was like no other I have ever read. It's slow moving, plot about nothing special, is mearly a device that Jewett uses to introduce one of the major themes of the book, lonliness. In reality, we all struggle with lonliness, and it is through struggle that we strive to live out our lives to the fullest. In many scenes, the characters may seem bored, but in actuality, they are very content to be where they are. In Maine, this society is dominated by older people who may look at life differently than those from Philadelphia. If you try to put yourself in the characters place, and take the work for what it is, the reader may find a soothing glimse of another world that was previously unfamilar to them."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I first read this in grad school and have reread it almost every year since. As other reviews said, there's not a lot of action, but Jewett pefectly captures time, place, and characters in this wonderful book. If you like quiet books (like Miss Read), or American regional fiction, this should delight you."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This is a beautifully written story. The author provides the reader with words that one can sink his teeth into. The characters are so well described that I would know them if they walked in my door. A beautiful escape from everyday life !!"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"In the novel &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot;, Sarah Orne Jewett invites her readers to journey with her through rural Maine with its green landscapes, hushed scenery, and quaint townspeople. A place where nothing noteworthy or earth-shattering seems to happen. The author and her companions seem to drift through their days carefree, as they relish the simplicity of existing peacefully. The narrator spends her summer in a seaside New England village and develops friendships with her hostess and her family.As with most novels, I read page after page anticipating the &quot;big moment&quot;, the &quot;turning point&quot;, a &quot;climax&quot;, anything to cite as the work's purpose or point. I never did quite accomplish that.I found myself reading and rereading looking for the part that I must have skipped over accidentally. I have yet to find the secret chapter.But what I accomplished wasn't known to me at the time but became clear after reflecting. The goal of the book is to help its readers acquire an inner peace within themselves; one that I found to be best appreciated in one's older years. I dont think that I was ready to read the book presently, but can see myself one day rocking in a glider totally enjoying and appreciating Jewett's novel."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"As a son of ms. Jewett's neighborhood I must admit a certain bias in reviewing her work. The landscapes she describes in such loving detail are the very fields, hills and forests of my youth. Even the names of many of my schoolmates and other local families have not changed since the time of her writing. As a collection of -linked- short stories, this volume was well suited to reading in installments and I treated myself to a session with Sarah at the completion of other books. I sometimes found myself rushing through other works in anticipation of a trip to Deephaven and a visit with her characters, who quickly became as old friends.The pace of her stories is measured but never gave me a feeling of plodding as I've encountered with other 'local color' writers of her times. She manages to convey concise and convincing portraits through careful observation of characters' actions, as these hardbitten Yankees don't say very much.I was happy with the approach of taking the volume in installments, giving myself time to miss the characters and wonder what they're up to. As a lover of the written word who has settled half a world away from the hills and forests of South Berwick, each session with this collection was a short holiday among the warmth and comfort of familiar places and old friends."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Sarah Orne Jewett's collection of sketches of life along Maine's coast in the 1880s would probably pass as creative nonfiction if it debuted today. There is virtually no separation between author and narrator, and the subject matter isn't just taken from life, it is the life of the place she describes. It is a charming exploration of people shaped by place--and as such it delivers many satisfying aspects of a novel--character, situation, setting, dialogue, theme, with the plot being the unfolding psychology of the people and place.The book begins with the narrator's arrival in Dunnett Landing, a village that had thrived in the seafaring era that the Industrial Age had all but eclipsed. She had visited it as a child and has returned to it for the solitude it affords a writer. At the center of the book is her landlady, Mrs. Todd, an herbalist who does brisk business as the town's pharmacist of folk remedies. Through her the narrator comes to know aged sailors whose day has passed and the people who live even more remotely than the Dunnett Landing folks, on the outlying islands. She hears of the most extreme case, a woman who had fled to the outermost island to live as a hermit for years after a disappointment in love. At a large family reunion that serves as the book's climax, the narrator sums up what she has learned about the intersection of people, time and place.A word about this particular edition of The Country of the Pointed Firs: It is something of an enigma. The cover begins interestingly enough, a photograph of a shoal of beached rowboats, a common sight in Maine harbor towns framed by what appears to be a handwritten page from a notebook set with a brown background to the black ink. But then it gets a bit strange, with an oddly worded, unfinished description of the contents set on the first cover, and set off by even odder punctuation. Inside, it is devoid of all publishing identification and there is no dedication, there is a plain title page, followed by a contents page followed by another plain title page in a different font, and then, the first page of the book appears on the back of that, on the left side. The paper looks and feels like copier paper; in fact, it looks like it was produced on a photocopier. There is a catalogue listing for other minor classic texts produced by the same publisher and the descriptions are, again, oddly worded. That said, aside from a couple of offset lines and odd treatment of punctuation here and there, I had the sense that the text was ultimately complete."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I found this to be an extraordinary novel because it really didn't seem like fiction at all. No plot, no bodice ripping, no contrived literary conventions, nothing; Sarah Orne Jewett constructs each episode to blend into the next as seamless as a conversation with a close friend, and the overall effect makes something like a landscape painting, only in print form. Each character she writes about was deformed by the weather, the soil, the isolation, the struggles, and the sea, yet in their faults, they are human and thus dignified--it is beautiful in a simple way.I would recommend reading this book some afternoon with the telephone unplugged, sitting on a porch with a teapot full of Earl Grey nearby, with your feet propped up and your cares let down. It's as subtle and delightful as a waft of air from the garden after an afternoon shower. It's a haiku in prose--the memory of the book is better than the reading. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"My book club read Country of the Pointed Firs one month when I didn't participate and I really didn't think I'd go back and read it. Last summer when my daughter and I visited Victoria, British Columbia I found the book in a bookstore for one dollar and bought it. I read it on the ferry traveling home and it was wonderful to read of the Maine woods and look and see the woods of the San Juans. A lovely set of stories, with lovely people. I'm so glad I got the book."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"A female visitor arrives in a small town in coastal Maine, having the very good fortune to stay with Mrs. Almira Todd, the kind of woman you wish you knew yourself. After the visitor's episodic wending through the summer and her visits with the people of the fictional Dunnet Landing and environs, she, as well the reader, leaves refreshed and rejuvenated yet saddened to leave behind the quiet pace and the many worthy people introduced along the way.And that's it. There is no story in the traditional sense, no building action, no conflict to resolve. This in no way detracts from the work's many charms, most particularly the quirky yet endearing characters and the poetry of Jewett's language.Her poetry is backed with many lines too good to leave behind once the book is done:\\"\\"Conversation's got to have some root in the past, or else you've got to explain every remark you make, an' it wears a person out.'Mrs. Todd gave a funny little laugh. 'Yes'm, old friends is always best, 'less you can catch a new one that's fit to make an old one out of,' she said, and we gave an affectionate glance at each other...\\"My favorite bit of mild snarkiness - because really, that's as unkind as any of the characters gets - is about a woman, \\"Mis' Peter Bowden,\\" who traveled to a family reunion. While there are many folks with excellent voices in attendance, alas, hers is not, as Mrs. Todd remarks: ...\\"I couldn't help thinkin' if she was as far out o' town as she was out o' tune, she wouldn't get back in a day.\\"If character studies and travelogues (fictional though it may be) aren't your thing, steer clear. Otherwise, find a copy and be prepared to immerse yourself in the depths and the heights of a life lived near on the coast, of a life lived with the pointed firs."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I had never read this book, but stumbled on someone else's review recently and decided to give it a go. It's a lovely book told in a leisurely way, painting a picture of life in a small New England fishing community. The main character, a young writer, is boarding with an older woman who has lived in the community her whole life. The writer gradually becomes acquainted with this small community and comes to love and appreciate the character of the place and people. Lovely story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"The Country of Pointed Firs is comprised of a series of stories, unified in the setting and interaction among the the characters. The values of the characters are revealed clearly. They are people of an earlier time in New England, specifically Maine, living on islands, small towns, and farms. The book contains vivid description of the ocean, the country side, gardens, and the fir trees. The style is simple, direct, and Jewett uses local idiom, bringing a charm to the book. A series of stories, each complete in themselves, is similar to the style of Willa Cather in her novels and Sherwood Anderson in Winesburg Ohio. There is no complex plot, but rather a development of character, revealing profound emotion and people touched by a complexity of events. It is not accurate to see the novel as sentimental episodes or an idealizing, or romantizing of small towns and agrarian life. Her legitmate place in American Literature is becoming more and more secure. The book is a comfortable read, with beautiful passages and deep insights.The kind of book that one would like to go on for another fifty pages. It is fine reading. Don't miss out on it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I was required to read this book for an American lit course but was pleasantly surprised with how short and sweet it is. Jewett definitely has a way with words and makes you wish you could be in Maine, witnessing the events of the novel. Charming!"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"The Country of the Pointed Firs by Sarah Orne Jewett is a masterpiece of world fiction. True, nothing much happens in this novel. It is just a series of sketches about regular people in New England in the Nineteenth Century living out their daily lives. But in that simplicity lies the real beauty of the novel; Jewett finds beauty and meaning in the &quot;small&quot; happenings of &quot;small&quot; lives.The characterizations in this novel are delicate and well-developed. The prose is extremely clean and readable. The overall picture of the life in the village is magnificent. People from small towns (like myself) will certainly enjoy it the most. The Country of the Pointed Firs is a fantastic novel which ought to be read more often. It is rare to find a novel that creates such an epic scale by just looking through a small scope."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"(see my review of that edition, which I also purchased, when I realized the illustrations were missing from this one)"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I liked this book. Even though it was written a long time ago I think there were things I could relate to. And it was a fairly short and easy read."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I came upon the book quite by accident while browsing library shelves. Though I have no qualification as a literary critic I found Jewett to be a great observer of nature and people. Reminded a bit of Annie Dillard. As I become more knowledgeable about the life and writings of Willa Cather I more deeply appreciate the era in which Jewett wrote. I can't imagine any New Englander (or one wanting to visit there) not enjoying this little volume"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"No one's education is complete without reading the New England local color writers. Sarah Orne Jewett was a perfectionist. Her stories are little gems."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This is a delightful little book filled with memorable characters from a bygone era. It's really a series of sketches which lacks a strong plot, but it evokes an incredibly vivid sense of place that was throroughly enchanting. A must read if you interested in 19 C female authors"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"After reading The Country of the Pointed Firs, I felt indifferent about the novel, although I considered recommending the book to my mother. Even though the characters were fully developed I could not relate to or identify with any of them. Therefore I finished the book without any strong reactions, negative or positive, about its content. I could not identify with the characters such as Mrs. Todd, Mrs. Blackett, Captain Littlepage, or William because they were all senior citizens and Jewett never described their interactions or relationships with young people. The closest look the reader gets of their relations with younger people is through the characters' memories of earlier stages of their lives. For instance, Mrs. Todd takes the narrator to her and her late husband Nathan's favorite spot. Captain Littlepage reminisces about his seafaring days. Mrs. Fosdick described the hermit behavior of poor Joanna. In addition to the memories of the characters, Jewett included articulate descriptions of her natural surroundings as well as the details of the characters everyday lives. For example, she described the atmosphere of the funeral procession as well as Mrs. Todd's occupation of picking and selling therapeutic herbs. I found these passages difficult to get through since my attention drifted several times while reading them. Even though the passages were boring to read I think that if I actually experienced the moments Jewett described I would find them fulfilling. Floating along the water, seeing those pointed firs, and listening for the tide would be breathtaking, but reading about it made my eyelids droop. I would recommend this book to my mom because she enjoys visiting and chatting with older folks. Plus, she always talks about moving to Maine because she thinks it is so beautiful. To truly appreciate this book, I think the reader must possess a level of maturity that most people don't achieve until they have lived a good 40 years. In general the other readers who reviewed this novel made good points about its content. The reader who responded on February 10th explains the book in the second sentence excellently by recognizing that it is a novel about personalities in a beautiful place. The experience of the reader in Sacramento is an example of my theory that you must posses a certain level of maturity to appreciate Jewett's writing. What seemed pointless at twenty for that reader was wonderful at fifty. Kavlie's review was one I didn't agree with because it was very closed minded. While this student may not have found anything meaningful in the novel, the response that it does not deserve to survive a library fire is ignorant. If a reader takes the time to examine Jewett's writing, he or she should be able to recognize that The Country of the Pointed Firs is a good literary work. So if you read this book and are disappointed keep it on your bookshelf for a later day because it may surprise you."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Country of the Pointed Firas falls right in the middle of a one to five scale. I had to read this book for a college course at first I could have strangled the Professor. However, I started to read this book and I hated it because the writed was going nowhere with the plot. If you start to read this book and hope to go somewhere you had better hope that you have an extremly long time to find it. Then when you realize that this book has no point except for the fir trees, you might be able to appreciate the large amounts of detail. Another aspect of this book is the author goes into great detail and describes every little thing there is to describe which at some points in the bookwere nice and other times I just felt like screaming at the author to get to the DAMN point already. Maybe when I am older I will read the book again to appreciate the slow and borningness in which it represents, but for now it will sit down in the deepest depth of my dark basement. If you are only looking for beautiful imagery which I think is the love hate irony, then this is the book for you. If there was a course in creative writing then I think this book should be a requirement. I didn't find anything that was short and sweet about this book, were we reading the same book. I image one can only injoy this book when he/she is older. I thought that the first reveiw was the most funnest thing ever."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Nothing happens in this book. It is incredibly boring! It superficially evokes a time and place - (rural 19th century Maine) but that's all it has to offer. The characters are uninteresting and there is no development of stories or character. It's a total waste of time. There are brief mentions of possible poignant events in a couple of characters' lives but they aren't developed in any meaningful way."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"In Sarah Orne Jewwtt's The Country of the Pointed Furs we find ourselves sucked in to a dull town of the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and as the narrator recounts her visits with the towns people we sit and wait for something to happen but it never does. Her rhetoric and grammer I find both beautiful and very appropiate for the novel because it draws you towards a town that is surrounded by simple people and wonderful scenery. Even though the narrator's desriptive language draws you closer to the town, you still wish that something somewhat interesting will occur.To me Chapter Six gives the only spark in the novel because of Littlepage's tale of the seas.&quot;They could see the place when they were approaching it by sea preatty near like any town, and thick with habitations; but all at once they lost sight of it altogether,...they could see the shapes of folks, but they never could get near them...&quot; This is why I proceded to read the novel, because it showed great potential and you wanted to read the crazy adventures of someone else in the town. Of course no one had anything important to say and in my opiniont this book falls short of its potential, but then again I am just an ignorant reader who does not really enjoy a novel that does not have an adventure."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This book was a requirement for an AP American Novels class.

I'm an avid reader, but since treatment began I haven't been able to focus so well.I happened to pick up this book on a whim, and I do no regret it.

You have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate it though.I've been sick a lot through treatment and when I've tried to read \\"lighter\\" books, they've barely aroused my interest for long.This book is in no way light. It is quiet and subtle and still and profoundly deep. It is exactly what I needed, a literary balm for the soul--taking me to a place and allowing me to meet people long lost to time, immersing me in a beautiful world I don't really wish to leave.It draws you in, as if it's winter and you are welcomed into a warm room with a cozy fire--and it wraps around you with all the comfort of heaven.I'll be disappointed when I reach the last page and thus the end of this particular journey."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Sarah Orne Jewett's THE COUNTRY OF POINTED FIRS is a visitor's tale. Set in the fictional Maine coast town of Dunnet Landing where the author/narrator has settled for the summer to write. As a visitor, the narrator inevitably recounts only the pieces of history she comes in contact with through her landlady and the people she meets in the community. The stories are portraits, bits and pieces, of lives that exist outside the narrator's brief visit. As a result, the reader feels like a companion on this holiday. The novella moves at the pace of a quiet seacoast village, and is refreshing to read for that very reason. Like a vacation, outside cares fade while focusing on the lives, habits and landscape of this place. The writing is finely wrought. A real affection for a place and people one knows briefly shines through the work and makes one wish for a time and place when travel, life and writing unfolded at a the speed of a long walk.Some editions incorporate other stories written about Dunnet Landing into the body of the novella. This can lead to a change in the narrator's voice that is incongruous with the rest of the work. Look for a version that preserves the order of one of the early publications with other short works in a separate section."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Willa Cather, a friend and protege of Sarah Orne Jewett, ranked The Country of the Pointed Firs along with Huckleberry Finn and The Scarlet Letter as the American work of fiction most likely to be acknowledged by posterity as an immortal masterpiece. While readers can easily quibble with Cather's top choices, it is easy to see that The Country of the Pointed Firs is a masterpiece--though perhaps not one for every taste. The leisurely, closely detailed novella has an unnamed narrator who describes her two summers living among the kindly, easygoing residents of Dunnett's Landing, a seaside town in Maine. It begins with an offstage funeral and ends with an offstage wedding, and very little in the conventional sense happens in the book--herb gathering, visits to neighbors, a reunion of mostly elderly family members. Very little happens--and yet the reader gets an overwhelming sense of the ties of love and gratitude that bind people on earth, as well as a keen, poignant apprehension of the passage of time and the finiteness of existence. It is somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Our Town,&quot; but The Country of the Pointed Firs is the more profound work of art. This meditative little book could probably not be appreciated fully by any reader under the age of 40. Yet for the right kind of reader, it has a power and poignancy that outstrips its minuscule size."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Sarah Orne Jewett keeps her readers interested from page to page, not through action and adventure, but through intellectual conversation. Usually I would not have picked up The Country of the Pointed Firs, because nine out of ten of the books that I read contain constant action sequences from one page to the next. Although after reading this book from beginning to end, I began to understand the characters in the book and could relate to the peaceful community that they belonged to. The narrator brings us into her everyday peaceful life through the emotion and laid-back style that she puts into every description. The narrator's love for nature helps us to understand New England as she sees it. She helps all of us &quot;city people&quot; to accept New England for what it is, paradise. The narrator, with the help of Mrs. Todd, Mrs. Todd's mother, and William, help give the reader some background and history of New England specifically Maine where they live. The small part that I enjoyed most though, was the narrator's discussion with the old and wise Captain Littlepage. His description of the island that he had visited while he was out at sea brought a very mysterious feeling to the book. I was upset to find out that this was where the mystery ended. I also enjoyed Jewett's ability to describe some of the close and personal family relationships in the story. At times I felt like I knew the entire life story of all the characters in the story. All in all I really enjoyed the book. I do not recommend it to a younger crowd, but I know all old and young adults will enjoy it as I did. Sarah Orne Jewett has created a masterpiece that will last for years to come."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Perhaps the finest example of the type known as a &quot;local colorist&quot;, this quiet book radiates peace, tranquility, warmth, and, at least implicitly, small town values. While the stories are sequential (at least in the work proper - this edition also includes some first-person narratives that fit contextually, but are actually outside the body of the original work) - and unified (all take place in a small portion of Maine, and takes place over the course of one summer), there's no real overlying plot or climax to the book, and blessed little action. Instead, the reader is treated to a few relaxing months in the country, with nothing to do but listen to the crash of the surf, breathe in the pungent smell of the herb garden, and enjoy the nodding conversations of the sparsely-drawn and just-sufficiently-colorful locals. Beloved and respected relatives abound, and one of the add-on stories even compasses a wedding. No stress, no worries, and no problems to solve - this is a book that could help one get to sleep on some too-tense evening. Of course if you're hoping for something a little more from a book, best look elsewhere. There's really nothing more than light, quiet entertainment here, but it's of such a refined and delightful quality as one rarely finds in the literary canon. As such, women will probably enjoy this book more than men, and mature readers will probably appreciate it more than young people. But when you've had enough excitement, and the toils of your savage work day are weighing heavily on you, don't forget that Mrs. Todd will still have a spare room waiting for you in her quiet New England home."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Many have said you need to be older (at least 40) to appreciate this book, but I loved it and I'm only 26. Jewett made me feel like I was really there in Dunnet Landing, and since the narrator is never named, I felt like I was the narrator, living her experiences (it helps that the narrator in this story is a writer and so am I). I loved Jewett's descriptive language and rich characterization. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates beautiful imagery and unforgettable characters. My favorite character in the novel is Mrs. Todd's mother, Mrs. Blackett -- I wish I was as loving and giving and self-forgetful as she is! My husband and I are planning a trip to coastal Maine this summer, and I will be thinking about this novel while I'm there."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I've read many wonderful novels but I could count on the fingers of one hand those that seemed to transcend literature and, in Kenneth Rexroth's phrase, bring me face-to-face with the meaning of existence. Of that glorious few, &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot; is by far the shortest and yet, mysteriously and inexplicably, the deepest. It's a still and quiet book; it will not show its face it to you if you read it while riding the subway to work. It's the sort of book to read on sitting alone in a graveyard while a cool breeze blows the last autumn leaves from the branches. That's the best description I can give you; it's too subtle and beautiful for summaries. Just read it, please."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"The Country of the Pointed Firs is definitely a book that should be read when there is time on your hands. It can be read quickly, but it will not be appreciated as it should be. It is a book that definitely does not go quickly, but it is not one that is lacking in incomparable descriptions and peaceful concoctions. As a reader, I definitely was not drawn in by the artistic writing of the author, but it did help in continuing the reading. One reader states in her review that &quot;Sarah Orne Jewitt draws the reader into The Country of the Pointed Firs with scenic descriptions, honest characters, and conversations written with true dialect and emotion.&quot; The scenic descriptions, honest characters and dialectical dialogue were an asset of the work in which I enjoyed very much. They depict the style of life that was lived during that time. The intricate detail that the narrator uses to describe life in Maine and to describe the people that she came in contact with was not overdone as some people described. One review stated that &quot;Each person...seems to find satisfaction in his or her life's course....&quot; I completely disagree with this critiques statement in that I see the narrator portraying the characters in a lonely light. She describes them as if they have all been defeated in some way by love. This is portrayed vividly through the narrator's description of Mrs. Todd in Where Pennyroyal Grew. Mrs. Todd speaks about her long-lost husband and the other man whom she really loved; yet he never knew. The narrator writes, &quot;An absolute, archaic grief possessed this country-woman; she seemed like a renewal of some historic soul, with her sorrows and the remoteness of a daily life busied with rustic simplicities and the scent of primeval herbs&quot; (48). This is also portrayed in the story of Poor Joanna and when she speaks of Mr. Elijah Tilley. The Country of the Pointed Firs speaks of finding fulfillment in a life where loneliness is the human condition. It is a very uniquely simplistic depiction of the everyday life in a peacefully fulfilling place."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"A collection of quiet &quot;sketches,&quot; this volume is a reminder of the fine writing produced by some of the earliest American realists. Critics have recently revised their first opinions of the book as a &quot;small success&quot; and now consider it a classic of American literature. The stories revolve around a young writer who goes to the coastal town of Dunnet Landing, Maine. In the company of Mrs. Todd, a venerable and locally revered herbalist who gives her lodging, the writer comes to know and write about the people of the area. The result is a fascinating look into personalities shaped and distilled by life on that severe coast into persons of rare character. This edition also contains eight of Jewett's best short stories, including &quot;A White Heron&quot; and &quot;The Queen's Twin.&quot;No plot devices or car chases here--this is a book to read on a rainy afternoon when nostalgia and melancholy threaten to overwhelm. It's comfort food like grandma used to make--reassuring, soul-fortifying, and full of the capacity to cheer. It's also addictive--once you take a bite out of Pointed Firs, you can't stop.Similar author: Mary Wilkins Freeman"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This short novel is evocative of a Maine and Canadian Maritime way of looking at the world that still exists if you know where to look. The writing is as beautifully rendered as the subject matter. There are few writers who can command the attention of readers without a tightly constructed, if improbable, story line. Sarah Orne Jewett is one of those rare writers for whom the vissitudes of daily human existence and the explication of character form the plot. Her works transport you to a place of mysterious and sometimes dismal beauty in which the setting of her stories is as important as the individuals who people them. The Country of the Pointed Furs is a piece of literature that is as masterful and unforgettable as the regions about which she writes. If you should come to visit the coasts of Maine and Nova Scotia, you will know that the type of people Jewett memorialized still exist in these breathtakingly beautiful northern places. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"Though this work has been written about before as a sketch, I don't think these people,places, or heart rendering moments could fit together any better."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This book had been suggested by a friend. It is not full of action or suspense, but shows a different way of life than what I know. Since we had just been to Canada & New England & saw the little fishing villages this was an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This is an enjoyable read. Characters and setting are described with feeling and observation. Mrs.Todd is such an interesting ordinary person. She has suffered loss, but she performs a great service to her community. I especially enjoyed her botanical side. The narrator might have an opinion on someone, but Mrs. Todd might have a different opinion. And yet there seemed to be a sweetness and forbearance in all the characters. The narrator had the gift of listening; she might advance the conversation a bit, but she seemed so receptive. The characters she spoke with (for that is most of the action in this tale) would then begin to reveal their stories. And that is the fascination for the narrator, a self described writer. She was interested in their stories. She was interested in the life of the town in general, and allowed herself to participate when invited. When I read of the lives of women who lived and worked a century or so ago, I am struck by their competence. They could do so many things! They worked hard to exist. This is a story where the understanding is that women could fish, use a boat, knit, formulate medicines, garden, cook. These activities are not described in detail; their mention indicates that readers would understand these activities because they too did these things. The strength of this book is in the characters, their speech, their stories and the setting."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I was looking for something not commercial, something old fashioned but enjoyable.

The author captures the place, people and atmosphere with a visual style that brings this period to life. If you love good writing and character development this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I enjoyed this book because of Jewett's turn-of-the-century language and simply accurate descriptions of the people living in a fishing town. Although some may wish for a more detailed plot (or any plot at all), \\"Pointed Firs\\" is an escape to a seemingly more innocent time. The characters struggle with many of the same issues we do: relationships, war, disease, and death. However, their sense of community, faith, and attitudes toward the sea form and strengthen their relationships with each other. Jewett is worth a read, merely for the beautiful way she creates a picture with the English language."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"This book is full of timeless short stories that can either be read as a whole story or separately."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"At last after many attempts at finishing The Country of the Pointed Firs I have done so. Although I did not find the book very entertaining I can not truthfully state that it was a dreadful book and an awful waste of time. Honestly though if this was not a mandatory read I would not have read it. There were a few moments of interest and intrigue such as the stories of Captain Littlepage, Poor Joanna, and the Bowden Reunion. Other than those events I found the book very hard to read I had great diffuculty immersing myself in the story. Jewett's great art of describing things in detail can be both fascinating and aggrevating at the same time. At times I found myself yearning to be relaxing amongst the flowers and trees of the Maine countryside. Other times I thougt enough already with the herbs and plants this is not Nature 101! But I suppose there is something to be learned and appreciated about this book as there is with everything experienced in life. Making an educated guess I would have to say that it is the appreciation of the simplicities on life such as visting someone and having them truly appreciate and enjoy your company. Yes, I believe this is the message Jewett is trying to convey to us whien she writes, &quot;It is very rare in country life...that any occasion of general interest proves to be less that great &quot; (Jewett 457)."},{"Title":"The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories","review":"I read this book when I was 20 or so and found it abysmally boring, all about old folks in an out of the way place, and nothing happens. Lucky for me, 30 years later Willa Cather's essays sent me back to it and I was entranced by the lyricism, wisdom, insight and grace of the vignettes of late nineteenth century life on the coast of Maine. Jewett is a kind heart but not a romanticizer, and her characters are true and deep. I'm eager to read more of her work."},{"Title":"When Charlotte Comes Home: A Novel","review":"WHEN CHARLOTTE COMES HOME is a beautifully written story. Fred was a sensitive young man growing up in a Catholic family in Omaha when the death of his spunky younger sister caused a deep and far-reaching affect on his entire family and broader community. With the bleak backdrop of the 60's and 70's, Fred looks back on his early, formative years and his own sexual awakening and coming of age as a young gay man. Beautifully written, evocative of a definitive time and place, this story of one family's loss will resonate for anyone who has ever lost someone they love. And young people deciding who and how to love will find solace here too."},{"Title":"When Charlotte Comes Home: A Novel","review":"This is the story of Fred Holly, growing up in Omaha in the 1960s and 1970s; and the Holly family--Fred, Sarah, Laurence, who has Down's syndrome, and Charlotte, the youngest.The Holly family gets to know neighbor James Day well, as he takes dance lessons at the same studio along with Sarah. Their parents, Morgan and Eileen and Serena and Ronald, become close friends. The children grow up in an almost idyllic world--with performances for the parents and friends in the attic that is their space, and art and dance classes, and a special school for Laurence.Fred early on realizes he longs to live in the ivory tower that is the Joslyn Museum. He he takes classes there, volunteers, and dreams of being a museum director and leaving Omaha. As he gets older, he and his best friend James are exposed to the world of rock and roll, and first loves. Fred loves from afar, and helps his beloved though a rocky relationship with another boy. He is also angered by James' attraction to his debate coach, Neil; and does not quite understand his anger.As they near age 18, the Vietnam War is raging. Suddenly Charlotte is ill--the annoying 11-year-old little sister who wanted to always hang out with the teenagers, who borrowed records and stole change--and their lives change forever.This is Maureen Millea Smith's first novel, and it is a true gem.

In her first novel, Millea Smith creates the well-detailed universe of Omaha in the 1960s and 1970s, and the results are breathtaking.

In March of 2001 her newest book, Inventing Herself : Claiming a Feminist Intellectual Heritage was published, and it is also an examination of the personal and political realms of Feminism. In it, she illustrates the lives of some of her personal heroines, women who have lived from the 18th Century on and whom have contributed to women's rights. She starts out with Mary Wollstonecraft, whose revolutionary book Vindication on the Rights of Women was one of the first pieces of feminist writing, and ends with modern heroines like Hillary Clinton, Princess Diana, and Oprah Winfrey. With each woman's story, she not only shows what they did to change politics and society, but also how their personal lives had an effect on those of other women living during that time.Elaine Showalter, whether writing about Janis Joplin or Germaine Greer, always draws similarities between the public importance and personal apprecation of feminism.

Unlike countless other writing books that promise the moon but but deliver the doldrums, Yudkin's advice is sound, practical and relevant. The subtitle -Breaking In Without Selling Out- summarizes the theme of her book. Her chapter on Informational Interviewing is timeless. After numerous articles and interviews, some good, some bad, some disastrous, I read her chapter on interviewing and found a kindred heart. Many of her experiences and observations are the same as my own. One example of this: &quot;You can often trace mistakes in articles based on interviews to a reporter's failure to ask for clarifications.&quot; As true a statement as ever made about the need for clarity in interviewing. In chapter six - Constructing an Article - Yudkin resists the temptation of so many writing teachers who o-v-e-r t-e-a-c-h, who don't allow room for growth and a writer's own discoveries. She states, &quot;... the general structure for magazine and most newspaper features run like this: lead-backgroud-development-close. She discusses each aspect, but doesn't overwhelm with opinion nor irrelevant information. Several other chapters: Productive Work Habits, Building Momentum, and Succeeding As A Writer are well written and provide timely advice. I have read countless books on magazine and newspaper article writing, and none of them, including those weighty volumes with 200-300 pages are more practical than Yudkin's Work.

You'll learn about query letters; constructing an article; contract details like first serial rights, second serial rights, one-time rates, kill fees, and more; dealing with editors; style and voice; even managing your time.

Yes, I did write for some newspapers (Chicago Daily News, Christian Science Monitor and various other publications) and even did some contributions to National Public Radio (All Things Considered) from Madrid.

The words &quot;journalism&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot; are not always linked these days...so her approach is to lift the craft and develop the craftsmanship.Even if you don't totally like her approach, she includes a list of annotated resources for freelance writers that's worth the cost of this book. Many of these resources are additional how-to magazines and books. So her book is the perfect starting point since it'll get you off and running and guide you quickly to places where you can learn more.The basics on query letters, targeting an audience, interviewing are all there...but I especially liked her chapters on the importance of revision and maintaining integrity.

My traditional Latter-day Saint upbringing fostered an abiding interest in Mormon history. Thus, I gratefully accepted an offer from Wendy Lochner, the Columbia University Press editor who sponsored Clyde Forsberg's book, to review a prepublication copy.My excitement turned to disappointment. Dr. Forsberg's confused views of Mormonism (founded 1830) and Freemasonry do disservice to both. For example, he asserted that the Scottish Rite's philosophy was &quot;the inspiration for the Book of Mormon and the rationale of the Mormon faith.&quot; He supported this view by referencing Morals and Dogma (which actually expresses the post-1857 philosophical meanderings of Albert Pike). Forsberg did not understand that post-1830 sources do not necessarily reflect earlier Masonic ideas.Dr. Forsberg's errors were rampant. He claimed that Mormon founder Joseph Smith Jr. was a 33 Mason (he was not), that there is no reference to Hiram Abif in the Hebrew Bible (there is, in 2 Chronicles 4:16, &quot;_ganash huram abiv la-melech shlomoh_&quot;), that there were three Degrees in Masonry in 1717 (there were two), that the Chevalier Ramsey invented a system which included the Royal Arch Degree and a &quot;fanciful tale of Enoch's Golden plates.&quot; All this is wrong.He also claimed Benjamin Franklin abandoned Freemasonry and its &quot;macabre business of secret suicide pacts.&quot; In fact, Franklin was an active Mason from about 1730/31 (when he joined Old Tun Tavern Lodge) to the end of his life, and there are no such &quot;suicide pacts.&quot; Forsberg called the Scottish Rite &quot;a decidedly Christian application&quot; (it isn't), and asserted there are &quot;religious tests&quot; in Freemasonry, which include a belief in the &quot;resurrection...of Hiram Abiff&quot; (both are untrue).Dr. Forsberg's occasional sarcasm is forgivable, and even amusing. However, it does his book no service when he suggested that Freemasons are awaiting the discovery of documents to testify to the truth of allegorical legends. In another place, while discussing the Knights Templar, he wrote, &quot;...according to the Masons....&quot; Sadly, the reference is to a book almost universally dismissed by serious Masonic scholars.In a prepublication conversation, Dr. Forsberg admitted to me that he didn't have any authentic pre-1830 Scottish Rite documents or rituals to support his opinions.I informed Ms. Lochner that I read the prepublication copy cover-to-cover. I expressed my dismay with the book, stating that I was not *at all* persuaded by its arguments, as they revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of Freemasonry's history, rituals, and purposes. Dr. Forsberg's superimposed (and seriously flawed) views subsequently do disservice to both Mormonism and Freemasonry. In brief, I have *no confidence* in Dr. Forsberg's &quot;thesis.&quot;After receiving a copy of the published book, I was further disappointed to discover that he &quot;corrected&quot; the errors I observed above by simply altering the book on a point-by-point basis. This was inadequate and the book remains fundamentally flawed; it cannot be fixed with a masking-tape approach. My advice is to save your money.Arturo de Hoyos, 33Grand Archivist and Grand HistorianThe Supreme Council, 33, S.J.Washington, DC"},{"Title":"Equal Rites","review":"Forsberg's book advances the thesis that Mormonism is a reformist Masonic movement, intended to reverse the tide of evangelical Christian advances in early American society. In the service of this thesis, Forsberg offers a reading of the Book of Mormon that downplays the seeming parallels to evangelical religion within the book's narrative and theology -- and that also disregards texts that seem anti-Masonic in nature. Forsberg further posits a version of early Mormon history in which Joseph Smith had a grand design, including a vision of Nauvoo temple ritual as developed in 1843 and 1844, from the very beginning of the Book of Mormon project in the late 1820s.Forsberg's prose is often pleasant and well-crafted, making clever use of puns and wordplay. Unfortunately, the argument is not equally well-designed. Does it matter to Forsberg that the primary sources reveal no evidence of the hypothesized careful advance planning of theology and ordinance on Joseph Smith's part? Does Forsberg care that primary sources show no evidence that early Mormon converts read the Book of Mormon as a Masonic text, as his argument requires? Does Forsberg find it relevant that primary sources indicate that at least some readers in the 1830s saw the Book of Mormon as actively anti-Masonic? Evidently not. After all, why should a historical study allow something as trivial as primary-source evidence to get in the way of a good (conspiracy) theory?Readers interested in questions about early Mormonism and its relationships with other early-19th-century American movements would be better served by Mark D. Thomas's work in the journal Dialogue on parallels between evangelical revivalism and the Book of Mormon, Richard L. Bushman's two books about Joseph Smith and early Mormonism, or D. Michael Quinn's Early Mormonism and the Magic World View."},{"Title":"Equal Rites","review":"This book exhibits deep flaws and methodological failings. The author advances his argument--that Mormonism is some sort of Christian/Masonic populist movement--through speculation, a dubious and selective reading of historical sources, and \\"cherry-picked\\" parallels. I have no idea how this work made it through the peer review process at Columbia University press, although Forsberg mentions that one of the reviewers was John Brooke, whose own speculative work on Mormon origins has come under fire. Still, at least Brooke's speculations were interesting and consistent with existing literature. By contast, Forsberg's \\"examples as evidence\\" approach will convince no one (LDS or otherwise) who knows Mormon history. This book should not have been published, least of all by a press like Columbia."},{"Title":"Equal Rites","review":"Clyde Forsberg's \\"Equal Rites\\" is an ambitious, intriguing, captivating, stimulating, frustrating, infuriating, and less than fully satisfying book. It is sometimes exciting, sometimes unnerving, and sometimes infuriating but always provocative. Forsberg uses the tools of the \\"new historicism\\" and the deconstruction of texts to analyze the origins of Mormonism, especially a posited relationship to Freemasonry in the early national period. I think most historians will find Forsberg's effort to reinterpret this important episode in Mormon and U.S. history intrigung but somewhat unsuccessful.Forsberg advances the exceptionally bold and maverick thesis that Joseph Smith Jr. patterned this new religion after radical American Freemasonry. While he focuses initially on the Book of Mormon--for which he claims numerous parallels to Masonic conceptions, ceremonies, and conventions--Forsberg extends his incessantly restated thesis to most of the founding prophet's ideas. Forsberg presses his belief in Smith's indebtedness to Western esotericism and occultism--especially concerning Freemasonry--beyond all reasonable possibilities. Even so, \\"Equal Rites\\" helps to explain some of Mormonism's early attraction, for Smith's efforts hit at the center of humanity's desire to know something that is ultimately unknowable from secular rationality.Forsberg's key contribution may be in forcing a re-situation of early Mormonism in the historical context of American politics and culture, ethnic and gender relations, and religion. Equal Rites ranges broadly to place Joseph Smith and the rise of a new religious tradition squarely within a fresh context. Forsberg is concerned with Mormon origins, especially the elements that came together to make the Latter-day Saint movement such a powerful and compelling force in the 1830s and 1840s. He, in essence, dares anyone to ignore his challenging reinterpretation of the influence of Masonry on the origins and development of Smith's esoteric religion. Certainly, this work leaves many previously asked questions unanswered and raises a host of new ones. This should make his ideas the target of exceptional investigation, if only to refute them. In addition, Forsberg's witty prose make this an entertaining book to read, something usually not the case with Mormon historical works which as a genre emphasize the mundane and trivial.Forsberg's case is overstated and subject to considerable criticism. His thesis is circumstantial at best, wishful thinking some of the time, and a downright concoction at worst. There are quite a lot of qualifiers in this book, words such as \\"may,\\" \\"perhaps,\\" and \\"arguably\\" lacing the connections between a Masonic idea and a Mormon one. These suggest the tenuous nature of the relationships that Forsberg tries to draw between Mormonism and Masonry. While there are undoubtedly some legitimate relationships, as in the incorporation of Masonic ideas and ceremonies into the temple endowment developed in Nauvoo, those connections are not the ones that Forsberg seeks to draw. He insists on the close intertwining of Mormon/Masonic concepts and ceremonies from the very beginning of Smith's religious journey. I am intrigued but certainly not persuaded by his argument.Let me offer but one of many examples of Forsberg's overreaching that I could discuss. Concerning Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" an experience everyone recognizes as seminal to the origins and development of Mormonism, Forsberg tries to draw parallels between Smith's account of his experience and Masonic initiation ceremonies. He writes: \\"Smith recalls coming to his senses [after wrestling with forces of darkness] sometime later, flat on his back and staring upward toward heaven. One may compare this to the initiation of the Master Mason: blindfolded and not permitted to speak, the initiate must lie flat on his back and await the moment of release when the Grand Master takes him by the hand, lifts him up in an embrace known as the five points of fellowship, and, removing the blindfold, whispers the great mystery (the Grand Omnific Word) in his ear...\\" (pp. 57-58). Is this an interesting set of commonalties between the Masonic ceremony and Smith's account of the \\"First Vision?\\" Yes. Does it require a conclusion that one was the source of the other? No. But Forsberg would have us believe that this is the case. This is the type of argument made repeatedly in Equal Rites. I am unpersuaded.Even with these reservations there is much of interest in \\"Equal Rites.\\" Ultimately it makes a circumstantial case for accepting Masonry as critical to the formation of Mormonism. It should stimulate a lot of historical inquiry. I welcome the book's publication on that basis."},{"Title":"The Omega Expedition","review":"Fans of vast, epic future histories in science fiction will undoubtedly appreciate Brian Stableford's concluding volume in his look at near-immortality for humanity, \\"The Omega Expedition\\". This is a good luck at human aging and how it is defeated successfully by a post-human culture in the solar system more than a thousand years in the future. However, stylistically as a writer, Stableford falls short of such distinguished fellow Britons as Michael Moorcock, Brian Aldis, and China Mieville. Even Bruce Sterling had a more fascinating, more intriguing look at humanity's struggle against the ravages of aging in his splendid novel \\"Holy Fire\\". Stableford's latest describes the travails and successes awaiting Madoc Tamlin, who awakes a thousand years after being frozen, unwitting finding himself on the front-line of a Solar System war between different factions of artificial machine intelligences. Still, this is a captivating novel of ideas worth reading by science fiction fans."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial : a pictorial history","review":"This is an easy to read pictorial history of Pearl Harbor and the 184 ft.

Unfortunately, although I ultimately found it pleasing, this is a long way from being the book I wish it was. If you plan to buy this book, I think it is important that you know what it is that you are spending your money on. This is the Ph.D. dissertation of a philosophy student at the Banaras Hindu University in India. It is not the work of a person who writes about Buddhism based on their own wisdom gleaned from a lifetime of practice and study. I would, in fact, be highly surprised to learn that the author was a practitioner of Buddhism at all, or had ever gone for Refuge to the Three Jewels. The book is strictly academic, and, even as such, quite clearly not at a level of maturity beyond that of a student. The flow of its overall organization is not very smooth nor clear in places, and the grammar and spelling and proof-reading are so bad that it actually aroused in me on many occasions an amused curiosity to try to figure out just what English meaning the author had tried to convey. The task of deciphering was made even more challenging by the heavy use of Sanskrit and Pali terms, often untranslated, co-mingled with the English: anyone not too familiar with these languages (unlike the professors who were its intended audience) will find this book rather rough going indeed. This book is also of very poor physical quality even by the rather primitive standards of Indian publishing: it is bound in a most haphazard way that had it almost falling apart from the moment I opened it. But now, having thoroughly bashed the book, let me say that I found it useful and even grew rather fond of it. Concerning its intended subject matter, it covers the waterfront, so to speak, and I know of no other book that does it so thoroughly.

This includes breath meditation, the Divine Abodes, and other practices familiar to contemporary Western meditators. Unfortunately, it's written in mind-bogglingly opaque and prolix prose; classical usage doesn't always translate for the best.

The so-called juveniles he wrote for Charles Scribners Sons had an immediate and lasting impact. None of them has ever been out of print. This is despite their awful titles and their original target audience.Maximilian Jones is from a poor family. The star of the family was his late Uncle Chester who was a member of the Astrogator's Guild. Max runs away from home with his Uncle's astrogation manuals with a vague notion of following in his Uncle's footsteps. Along the way he meets with and is robbed by another tramp, Sam.In a interesting twist of events, this thief becomes the best friend a man ever had. Between the Max's brilliance and Sam's avarice and cunning,their mutual loyalty, and series of fortunate and unfortunate events, Max achieves his goal.Obviously a novel written during the fifties has dated technology. The ships computer is two steps above Eniac. There are effectively no female crewmen. But none this detracts from a fine story. Along the way lessons are given, regarding leadership, friendship, responsibility and of all things rule of law.Having read this as a child, I did not understand everything at the time that I read it. But as I grew older the lessons learned helped me in life.The book is still an excellent read even if you're an adult. Personally I have gone so far as to track down an old library hardcover with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"It is unfortunate that Heinlein has received a lot of press for some of the worst things he wrote for an adult audience, such as _Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_. His genius was in his \\"juvenile novels\\" -- the stories he wrote for serialization in boy scout magazines, later published as books.Max Jones dropped out of high school to support his lazy irresponsible stepmother by working on their farm, which has only those amenities that would have been commonplace in 1850. But he dreams of becoming an astrogator aboard a starship like his late Uncle Chet, who instructed him in that profession. When his stepmother marries a man who is uneducated and cannot appreciate his ambition, Max leaves. The world being badly mismanaged, he must hitchhike to the city of Earthport to find out whether he has been appointed his uncle's professional heir.I will not give away spoilers, but herewith I will tease you a little bit. Heinlein was a graduate of the Naval Academy, where he learned some of the laws in force aboard ships. While Max is serving aboard a ship that has become lost and set down on an unknown planet, with no realistic hope of finding its way home, the First Officer explains to the passengers and crew certain legal rights and obligations that apply in such an emergency. A passenger objects: \\"There are no laws HERE.\\" The First Officer corrects him, saying the law goes where the ship goes. That sets the context for a climax several chapters later, involving legal, moral, political, and psychological aspects of leadership in an emergency.The book dramatizes the role of intelligent purposefulness in human life. A scene occupying about the first four pages of the second chapter is a beautiful example: Max is alone facing difficulties and using his head.The book has various readily identifiable flaws, which it would be easy for me to list. Those don't matter at all."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"Max Jones is a young farmer, working hard to support his unlovable stepmother after his father's death, but he dreams of the life his Uncle Chet lived, as a member of the Astrogators' Guild. Chet had promised him that he'd nominate him for membership, but died while Max was still too young to join, and then Max's father, before he died also, made him promise to take care of his stepmother.But when his stepmother remarries and she and her new husband sell the farm out from under him, he runs away, taking his uncle's astrogation books with him. The books get stolen from him by a deceitfully helpful conman, and then he discovers that his uncle had died before nominating him for the guild, and all his dreams seem crushed forever. But then he meets that charming conman again, who decides that they can help each other get what they both really want-a berth on a starship. For Max, it's a berth as a steward's mate, and he's tending farm animals again, but he's on a starship, and he's a plucky, resourceful, just plain likable young Heinlein hero, who makes you buy into every improbable plot twist along the way to his dream.Once again, great fun."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"Wow, what a nice little sci fi story. I'm just so glad that Heinlein lived in this world and wrote so many enjoyable books. Starman Jones falls into his juvenile period, where he writes for youngsters. This doesn't mean that you wont enjoy them as an adult.Heinlein played with this story scenario in a few of his books. I'm thinking of Citizen of the Galaxy and there are probably a couple of others. Here, he has a kid, Max, who is leading a hard life. He dreams of going to the stars. What transpires follows a path of rags to riches. Thats it. Simple. But elegantly enchanting at the same time.This book was published 60 years ago. Two sociological points really stood out for me. One is that women in society and the rolls they play are VASTLY different today than they were in 1950. I like to think of Heinlein as a progressive fellow, but his idea of what it meant to be a woman was so backward, it was kind of shocking. Secondly, its sort of amazing how far computers have come. The whole plot of Starman Jones revolves around a kid who could do complex mathematical problems in his head. Something that any computer could do millions of times faster.I guess I have a third sociological point to make. That is Heinlein was very liberal. I make that assumption based upon his work. He portrays a future society that has seemingly almost choked to death on unions and workers rights. Its a bleak place. I don't think that Heinlein intended to call out socialism or the New Deal in a negative light, but here it reads as pretty gloomy.If you think about it, Heinlein's future could sort of be summed up as the New Deal carried forward 200 years. Contrast him to an author like Gibson who's Neuromancer captures a world overwhelmed by freetrade capitalism. Maybe unintentionally, both authors have created a glimpse of \\"what-if's\\" that works primarily as a warning in regards to completely following one political movement or another.so... a simple story. A good story. A story you will probably have a good time reading even though it is dated. I can't imagine any author ever writing from such a viewpoint again. This is sort of like a time capsule gussied up in the form of a sci-fi novel. THIS IS NOT Heinleins best work. He has 10 that I would recommend before this. It just goes to show the strength of this authors writing. No sci-fi author has come close to matching Heinlein's prowess."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"I believe this is the first science fiction novel I ever read -- shortly after it came out, when I was in [...]. It certainly hooked me on adventure stories about space and aliens, and it increased my interest in future technology, . . . as it was understood at that time, with slide rules and printed logarithm tables, and with huge \\"computing machines\\" filled with wires and tubes. Max Jones, the hero of the story, is a self-confessed hillbilly who yearns to get into space. (The author seems to feel the animal-powered cultural isolation of the Ozarks in the mid-20th century would continue into a time of extra-solar colonization, in a rather hidebound society run by inherited guild membership.) He comes under the questionable influence of an ex-spaceman and, through forgery and chicanery, gets his wish as a low-ranking steward's mate on a commercial star liner. But Max also has considerable talents as a mathematician -- plus a very handy eidetic memory -- so he's shortly being pulled up the ranks into the ship's control room itself. And as the emergencies begin to stack up, Max, naturally, becomes a hero, even as he confesses to his earlier fraud. It's a better-than-average yarn, with good dialogue, a worthwhile moral, and engaging characters. Even with the lack of \\"modern\\" technology, it's still worth recommending to adolescent readers."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"I reread this book recently after nearly thirty years since my first reading, as a high school student. I was amazed at how much I remembered. It must have had quite an impact on my young mind because so much of it came back as I read. Unlike the story's protagonist, my memory for past reading is abysmal.This story is wonderfully crafted. I had to check the publication date a couple of times, because I've read far less convincing descriptions of FTL travel in more recent novels. The drama and interplay of the crew and officers on the ship is excellent, particularly so for a young man learning his way in society.In my opinion, the conversations between the protagonist and his female love interest are of a different character. These seem stilted, awkward, and less credible. Heinlein has been taken to task for this in other venues so I won't belabor it here. I have to wonder if my own early lack of success communicating with the opposite sex was influenced by his juveniles, but I suspect the problem is more widespread and genetically based.Speculation...Spoiler Warning: The following reveals some plot elements. Stop reading further if you haven't read this book, and plan to.At the end of this novel, an intelligent species of centaur-like beings bent on the enslavement of humans has examples of our \\"advanced\\" technology, plus two complete sets of Astrogation Manuals. These manuals were hidden, but the planet has various species of creatures that excel at spying on humans.I have to wonder if the Grand Master wasn't planning a follow-up novel in which an older Starman Jones (or descendant) is tasked with helping to defend our civilization from these aggressive creatures.\\"Hello, Spider Robinson? Ready for the next round?\\""},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"Max Jones could not seem to ever get a break, first his mother dies, then his father leaving him a run down farm in the Ozarks and a shiftless step-mother to support. Still it did not do any good to complain so Max dropped out of school and worked the farm and dreamed of roaming the stars like his uncle had. When his stepmother arrived home with a new husband, one who promptly announced that he had sold the farm and that Max would now answer to him, Max decided that it was time to go.Unfortunately his bad luck seemed to go with him, he was robbed, he found that his uncle had not left a will naming him heir to enter a Guild. Just when it seemed as though every door was firmly closed against him Max's luck seemed to change....but for better or worse?This is one of the 'juveniles' that Heinlein wrote in the '50's. Most of these stories were originally serials in magazines, usually ones aimed at boys and told from a young man's point of view. The technology described was amazing stuff at the time but most of it now seems quaint. The attitudes of the times toward women and social class also appear as foreign to today's reader as any alien culture. Despite all this Heinlein still spins a good story, one that will leave the reader with something to think about long after.Fans of Heinlein will recognize bits that will appear in later works, young Max has lots in common with Andy Libby of the Future History stories, descriptions of life aboard a starship liner will be revisited in later works as well as the idea of an idyllic planet hiding subtle dangers. Those who are not familiar with Heinlein's works would do well to start here enough though it is not one of his better known works."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"Heinlein told one of his greatest coming-of-age stories in this novel. The characters are perhaps more varied and interesting than in some of his other great juveniles and the things that they go through are fascinating.It will be difficult for a juvenile reader to envisage a future with interstellar flight but without computers that could make astrogation trivial, and thus destroy much of the story. If the youngster, or adult, who reads this story can suspend his or her disbelief about this matter the reward will be one of the best juvenile novels of all time."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"A fine old SF yarn, laced with intelligence, about a young farmboy trying to realize his dream of venturing into space as a trained \\"astrogator\\", a kind of space navigator. I liked the way the book shows young Max Jones making some bad decisions and mistakes in judgement early on, but thanks to good advice and honest self-examination, recovers from those mishaps and gets back on the right path. The result is a story that sends a nice message to its intended audience of young people that nobody's perfect and one can not only recover from mistakes but become a stronger person because of them.Nicely juxtaposing elements such as high adventure and romance with tough decisions and the realities of life, this is a great little book, and I can see why it's still in print 50-plus years after its original publication. And I didn't even talk about the scene-stealing alien pet, the \\"spider-puppy\\" known as Mr. Chips!

When I read it, I think I wanted to be Max.There are a large number of future technology ideas in this book. I hope several of them come true.Please remember that this novel was written when 'computers' were huge masses of vacuum tubes and barely could add two plus two and used IBM punch cards as their input device. This is why the \\"Starman Jones\\" ship computers seem so poor today.Max is memorable. I really liked him. However, he does have a few talents that are unusual.

Good story, read umpteen times. The setting, starship cruise liner, gets recycled for the novel Friday.The book is a really, really good example of a science fiction author setting a story a hundred years or more in the future, but not predicting correctly technology 15 years into the future. A major plot point is the protagonist's ability to memorize logarithm tables so that the starship crew can interpret the binary output of the navigation computer. Can't remember if the computer actually used vacuum tubes. It must have had kilobytes and kilobytes of drum memory, too.Strangely enough, although the author relied on relativity as a plot point in \\"Time for the Stars\\" for a similar setting, he completely ignores it here.If only my kid was interested in reading my (older!!)

It is a great inspirational story for reading to children (grandchildren) to spark their imaginations. And it is a lot of fun to read for your own restful pleasure."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"Reputations accrete in funny ways, and often we end up with a mental picture of a person or his work that's less than accurate. Take Robert A. Heinlein for example, the so-called dean of science fiction writers. Though Heinlein's career spanned nearly half a century, most folks today know him for the militaristic Starship Troopers, whose characters blasted not only intergalactic arachnids but Marxism as well. But theme-heavy SF doesn't compose the entirety of his oeuvre. Indeed, most everyone except his devotees seems to have forgotten that Heinlein began his career by writing juvenile fiction, a good example of which is his farmer-turned-spaceman adventure Starman Jones.Ever since he was a child, Max Jones has yearned to go into space. His uncle, a space navigator (or astrogator, as they're called), used to regale him with stories of interstellar travel and let him peruse his manuals, thick compendiums stuffed with calculations used to guide spaceships through charted territories. But he had little hope of getting into the astrogator guild. After his father died, Max ended up working the family farm day in and day out, which left little time for anything but dreaming. Then one day Max's mother showed up with an unwelcome surprise -- a new husband, one Biff Montgomery, a man whose sole achievement lay in avoiding honest work like the plague. Now Max has to discover if he can break into a guild or, barring that, an actual ship. Apprentice or stowaway, either option sounds fine to Max. With Biff in the picture, it's off-world or bust.There's plenty in Starman Jones that hasn't aged well. I had to suppress a smile when reading about Max cooking up biscuits and ham at his farm on one page and then calculating inverse cubes on his slide rule the next. Anachronisms abound, as one could rightly expect from a book coming out of the golden age of science fiction. But if you look past the outdated stuff, you'll find a novel with surprisingly strong bones. Heinlein's characterizations are quite deft, from a mysterious interloper who may or may not have a checkered military past to a headstrong ambassador's daughter with more gumption and savvy than is immediately apparent. And the action picks up nicely once Max makes it into the void. (Honestly, with the word \\"starman\\" in the title, was there ever any doubt?) Jones may be a little creaky in the joints, but it still gets along pretty well in the end."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"When I was a young lad I read everything that Robert Heinlein wrote, and that was a lot. In the 1950s Heinlein was far and away the most prolific writer of what have come to be called \\"juvenile\\" SF books -- essentially science fiction novels aimed and youngsters. Many of these books have gone on to become minor classics from which many derivative novels have sprung. Certainly Heinlein's writing influenced many young people to imagine a human future in space and understand the importance of science, engineering, and mathematics. This novel is such a one. I recall after reading this novel contemplating my C+/B- grades in math and vowing to do better. A book that can inspire that has a lot going for it.\\"Starman Jones\\" is the story of a youngster in a poor rural family with no future except to labor in grinding poverty and ignorance. But he rejects this prospect and vows to rise above his class to become an Astrogator -- the navigator of a starship. This story, which I found inspiring at the time, is about Starman Jones' climb against horrendous odds to become a starship captain.As others have noted, the science in this novel is highly dated; this is true of most or all of Heinlein's works, most of which after all were written before the invention of the microprocessor. Characters use slide rules and computers are big, clumsy, and do not do all that much. No matter. This novel still retains its zip and deserves the reader's attention. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"I read this book when I was a youngster, and as remarked by other reviewers, it stuck with me. It is a well-told tale of a young man fighting to change his situation in life, even bucking the system. The \\"world\\" of the story is well developed.But... a central point of his universe is the utter lack of computing machines. There is a huge \\"computer\\" used to navigate and possibly to use FTL travel at all. But it is programmed by hand in binary. Things to be input are tabulated on paper, then encoded by hand, and finally converted to binary (I think it was binary, might have been hex?) to input in that form. And the people doing this never learned, never got the hang of it, so Max was seen as a freak when he didn't have to look them up in the appendix of the handbook (no wall charts?). Now, I can do exactly that, and picked up codes through repetitive use, sometimes in the span of a day. Expressing a number as binary isn't even that hard to figure out, if you don't have it memorized.That central flaw, though, is what made me think about it and remember it after many years. Having starships co-exist with sliderules is a central feature of much SF from this era."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"I loved this novel as a boy, and I recently listened to the audio-book with my 16 year-old son. It's a sweet, old-fashioned story, and very dated, but I did find that I enjoyed this 40 years later. This is a feel-good story similar to a Disney family movie. This novel is dated in terms of technology, where an astrogator running a space ship must do lots of calculations quickly and accurately. The characters lack depth, but are likable. This story feels like it is written for a 10 year old, but it appealed to the 10 year-old in me. It's a fun story of a boy who is in a tough situation, and bends the law to fulfill his dream of space travel."},{"Title":"Starman Jones","review":"This is one of the classic Heinlein juvenile novels in which a precocious teenage protagonist throws caution to the wind and risks life and limb on adventures in space. Max Jones is a young boy in an unhappy family situation who decides to leave home and jump on a spaceship. Overall, this is a good, but not outstanding novel. There are definitely some dated ideas (Max memorizing tables of logarithms, for example) that would be absurd to the 21st century reader. The story follows the development of Max as he goes from stowaway to valued member of the crew, and ultimately everyone's life depends on him. We watch Max gain confidence, both in himself and of the crew around him. Not Heinlein's best, but worth a look."},{"Title":"Gifts of Sobriety: When the Promises of Recovery Come True","review":"I've read this book twice already.

Most of the writing is about the weather and how his cotton crop is doing, however, there are a number of annecdotes which are amusing (reflecting his sense of humor) and comments which today are startling. The startling comments are those about the actions of and his treatment of the slaves on his plantation. While regarded as a kind man, he frequently talks of administering &quot;light whippings&quot; when the slaves did not meet his expectations on cotton picking. It's hard to relate to that at the end of the 20th century.The author of the diary is my great, great grandfather and through this book I feel that I have gotten to know him.

Within three days, I read everything that he has written. The beauty of Comfort and Joy is not found in some sort of fantastical melodramatic voyage to perfection. That is to say, it is not an escapist novel that seeks to take the reader off into some land where everything can be okay for one day. The emotional portraits Grimsley paints of the love between two men who struggle to love is stirring. I was haunted by the imagery and the pain of the characters. Just as in life, though, without black there could be no white. Without pain, what could one know of joy? Comfort and Joy ends with the final view of two men who, despite emotional scarring and familial distress, are willing to work so very hard to stay together. It reminded me that romance isn't simply some habit or character trait you fall into. It's an investment and a risk. You love someone so much you would die to stay with him/her. And couching that passion are hard work and the ability to confront each other's pasts.The emotional and psychological portraiture is perfected in this novel. Grimsley is a fine author who dared to write a beautiful gay novel."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Jim Grimsley has taken the very essence of gay love and transformed it into a wonderful tale of struggle and dedication. The characters are easily believable. My boyfriend and I both loved this book."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This is the 1st novel I've read of Grimsley's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. His use of time and rendering of human emotion and feeling greatly outweigh the tendency for repetition in descriptions of emotions and actions. I did appreciate his descriptions of places and events, like the harrowing medical procedures that Dan has to endure and Ford administers. Ford and Dan's relationship is an unlikely one, but that made it all the more lovely to envision. I really fell in love with both characters, found myself wanting to know more of them and felt sad to see them go at the end, which is my surest sign that I loved the novel."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Being from the North, it was gripping to see a Southern culture that I hadn't a clue about incorporated into a lifestyle that I have spent my life figuring out.

Deliberately paced and sparsely written, Comfort and Joy finds two men who love each other but fear that love. It presents two families who love their sons very differently but who both, to be fair, want what they earnestly think best for their sons. It is about trust, tenderness and surrender. I am glad that I pulled this volume off the shelf."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Question: What do you do when you can't wait to take your gay lover home to meet your parents' and why would you even want to? This is a remarkably bitter sweet novel about a part of gay life which receives very little attention. Grimsley has crafted a finely tuned and socially astute piece which centers on the relationship between the &quot;upper class&quot; Ford and the HIV medical worker Dan. Of course they both steal each others hearts' and face a life together full of seemingly insumountable obsticles. The novel raises many important issues: gay commitment, safer sex, sero-discordent relationships and the tempestuous relationships that gays can have with their blood relatives. The decision to come out to them is always difficult and fraut with impossiblities. Using wonderfully three dimensional and well rounded characters Grimsley handles these issues with taste and tenderness and shows that there are no easy solutions: Fords father cannot get beyond years of insitutionalised homophobia. Confronted with a family like this you feel like telling them both to relax and not to worry. Anyway they DO transcend their situation which is perhaps the most positive message of the novel. They both have what is most important which is their love and commitment for each other.This is a wonderful slice of reality and the ending is far from predictable. Don't let the simplistic, austere style put you off. This is a fine piece of work which sensitively handles many of the issues confronting gay men today. Comfort and Joy begs a sequel as I'd love to revisit Dan and Ford in a couple of years."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I fave liked or loved all of Grimsley's work, which tends to focus on the first syllable of his name. This one outshines them all, allowing plenty of the sadness of the earlier work, while adding a new dimension of love and commitment. It is amazing how truthful the relationship is, with so many problems and doubts trading with love and shared peace. I do not think I have ever read a novel, gay or not, which gets this tug in a relationship so right. Yes, it is semtimental, as are its character. No, it is not simplistic, ase its characters are not. The rich parents are a bit of a stereotype, but even they have lucid and human moments which really shine. Best of my year so far."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I hate to stereotype BUT...there is a lyricism in Southern writing that borders on a musically-paced, poetic prose yet is definitely a straight read. Comfort and Joy is a solid member of this genre. Wow, this book, first of all is so aptly titled. All through it I has hoping that it was true, that the feelings of comfort and joy would champion the human cause. In reflection after finishing the book, I lingered with a comforting blanket of joy-not the sugar coated kind, but of the comfort and joy the real world can provide, the kind that takes real hard work, the kind that triumphs over demons.We can banty about words like dysfunction, class divisions, repression, the ties that bind and a myriad of other psychological terms that bespeak these characters and their lives. What I would like to point out a bit more is Grimsly's ability to bring us passionately into his most intimate world.Jim Grimsley's writing is first of all intelligent and graceful. His storytelling comes in a close second. These skills are wrapped in an a talent to allow us the space to silently (or perhaps not so at times!) tell the characters what to do, why don't they just..., and my God, SAY IT! In getting us involved to this degree, Grimsley uses us as counterpoint (again writing words as if composing music). By the very absence of what we consider the obvious the story's unfolding provides us with the dynamic that makes it so endearing. We want to believe in and embrace the comfort and joy each and everyone of us deserves."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Another achingly beautiful novel by Jim Grimsley, who is fast becoming my favorite writer. While his \\"Dream Boy\\" took me on a haunting journey into it's lyrically gothic Southern world, \\"Comfort and Joy\\" made me feel the excitement, heartache, anguish, anxiety, and amazing joy of Dan Crell and Ford McKinney's tentative new relationship. Like Dan's haunting voice, when Ford first hears him sing at the hospital Christmas concert, both characters have gotten under my skin, and I don't think I want them to leave.Told in present time and in flashbacks, and from both Ford and Dan's perspective, it's not only the story of their relationship, but of Ford's struggle with loneliness, coming to terms with being a gay man (although he hates that word), asking Dan to live with him (what will everyone think!?), and eventually coming out to his family. The major events of the novel unfold at various Christmastimes.And athough the novel asks, \\"Why do men stay together?\\", the characters could easily be any gender, and from any social background. Common relationship issues abound: money, family, living together, public displays of affection, needing their own space, sex, work schedules, making time for each other, what to do with the cats. But lurking behind it all is Ford's priveledged upbringing, the stress of disappointing his family, and the fact that his parents have his life all planned out (including marriage to a suitable woman). Dan's issues - illnesses, a haunted past, his fragility and his courage, his embarrassment at growing up poor, his need for independence - are in the forefront as well.I loved being inside both their heads, especially when they're going over the myriad reasons that they shouldn't be together. At one point, they both think, \\"You're really not as bright as I am, and that's a problem\\". Fortunately for us, their reasons for being together far outweigh their reasons for breaking up: that they each fill in the missing spaces inside the other, and can't even rest when the other isn't there.Grimsley's gorgeous prose-like writing brought me to tears many times. This is a novel that I know I'll read many times, and I'd highly recommend."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Simple and poor attempt at a novel. That is all I have to say. If you want to read a very well written gay novel, read Edmund White. If you are, more spacifically, looking for a gay love novel, there are many far better choices (might I recommend Boy Culture by Matthew Rettenmund.) If you would like to give Grimsley another chance, though, read Dream Boy. While dream boy is anything BUT a well written literary gem, I cherish it all the same for it's heart, sentiment, and pure nostalgia of those adolecent emotions that are never to be relived unless through a book.Though also be warned that the author has a huge ego and responds bitterly to any criticism in reviews. If you loathe something of his you read, either don't your email adress, don't review it at all, or be prepared."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Emotional ties bound up in family Christmas traditions complicate but ultimately help strengthen the bond between two gay men, who are sympathetically portrayed, but sadly conceived along stereotypical cardboard-cut-out-gay-character lines. Why must the good-looking tall doctor be rich? Why must the suffering but sensitive hospital administrator (a hemophiliac no less) be HIV+? Why must a moment of unprotected sex be glorified as the impatient imperative of true love? Why must the form of the novel confuse several Christmas periods that shape the relationship? Better gay fiction than most, with honest observations about flash points in a budding romance, but ultimately a bit soggy with its own sentimentality."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Comfort and Joy reminded me of the books that I had read as a teenager. The conflicts seemed artificially black and white. The dialogue felt forced and overused. The story lacked signficant creativity. The characters felt like unreal archtypes.

I might have even found the conflicts of the main characters intriguing.

It seems that the usually brilliant Mr. Grimsley wrote this story while he was half asleep. The characters are so slight and underdeveloped, you'd never guess they were created by the author of &quot;Winter Birds&quot; and &quot;My Drowning&quot;.The story revolves around the unlikely pairing of Dan Crell and Ford McKinney. Let's be honest - there is no way we can believe that a relationship could form between a Captain Marvel-Ken Doll- Doctor with tons of cash and an emotionally-stunted, homely, poor, HIV patient. Maybe it's Jim Grimsley's feverish fantasy to land such a prize lover, but it doesn't work for the reader.People who remember &quot;Winter Birds&quot; with the same fondness that I do will hate the fact that Ellen Crell, Allen and especially Amy Kay have grown into people with no dimension."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This implausible tale of a gay relationship between a handsome doctor and a homely guy with not much going for him seems &quot;calculated&quot; by the author as a romance to appeal to gay men. Unfortunately, when writers try to write deliberately for a certain market (instead of just writing a good book), the results are usually wooden and predictable, as is the case here. I would definitely pass on this one."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I can hardly believe that the talented Jim Grimsley of Winter Birds is the same author of Comfort & Joy (and of Dream Boy for that matter). Mr Grimsley here delivers a story and characters he himself is not convinced about. Without mentioning his seedy, amateurish style, all his characters are lame and stereotyped. Take Ford's mother for example. Take her phone conversation with him before Christmas. She clearly comes down as an idiotic upper class woman. Only not a believable idiot, but a clich&eacute; one, straight from a soap. I can understand a brilliant young writer being pressured from agents and publishers, but why accepting to tarnish one's career so indelibly?"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"i loved this book. i truly cared about the characters.it is a tender and affecting love story. the issues in the book--gayness, hiv status, money, childhood trauma, etc--are dealt with deftly but not heavyhandedly. the characters struggle with them; they are not the point of the story. there are several threads, large and small, left unresolved, which actually adds to the overall sense that this story is true to life, since life doesn't wrap itself up so neatly most of the time. the sense of place is great.by the way, this book centers around christmas time and takes its title from a carol, but it is not a &quot;christmas book&quot;--read and enjoy anytime, whether you celebrate christamas or not."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"In Jim Grimsley's latest novel &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;, theauthor goes beyond stereotypes to create a couple with emotionaldepth. Ford McKinney is a handsome doctor from a well-established and wealthy Savannah family, and while it would have been very easy to have made his romantic interest in this story a man equal in physical attributes and social standing, Grimsley determines to provide an attraction that goes beyond the outward physical. Both characters have childhood issues to resolve, issues which bring conflict into their adult relationship. While Dan's family has been aware of his homosexuality for many years, one would have to categorize their &quot;acceptance&quot; as uneasy at best. Ford on the otherhand has yet to reveal his sexuality to his socially conscious family. Both men's situations present plenty with which many readers can identify.Overall, an excellent read and one that may well stay in your thoughts long after turning the last page of this story."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Jim Grimsley's &quot;Comfort &amp; Joy&quot; is a deceptive little piece. The story explores interpersonal relationships but it also has a lot to say about where we stand in the year 2000 with our country's level of maturity when dealing with variations from the &quot;norm&quot;. The well constructed meeting, courtship, dating, mating, and sharing the newly formed couple unit with both families of Dan and Ford goes far beyond the problems usually asociated with same sex marriage. And the problems encountered in this voyage are not solely external traumas: gay homophobia ( as in closeted people), self perceptions, dealing with disease that just happens to include HIV, the work place and personal life boundaries. Grimsley draws likeable chaps and then introduces lineage and tradition of family, both derived from wealth and privilege and from poverty and trauma. His ability to maintain a flowing tale - describing memorable places (few have made a trailer-park home inside a cemetary seem more real and ultimately more inviting), sharing real circumstances of hospital based life, giving us the scent of the South - displays a novelist who is gifted, and he manages to be succinct enough that our attention never falters. The Afterburn? Putting this easy read aside upon completion we feel sensitized to our own vulnerability in dealing with a world not always friendly. Can we make it better.....?"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Some of the reviews mention that this is, at last, an adult book about a gay relationship, and it is. But it is also a coming out novel, since one of the main characters does not accept himself as \\"gay\\" at the start, but learns how to cope with inhibitions (like touching in public, coming out to colleagues) and how to integrate being what he is with his internalized expectations from a very traditional upper class family background. Also, don't expect a cheesy love story. The title \\"Comfort and Joy\\" shouldn't be taken too literally. Agreeing on their feelings is a permanent struggle for both partners and both barely manage not to break up whenever that seems an easy way out. I found it refreshing to read how you can love a partner and hate him for little things at the same time. How coordinating private time can be a strain. How money becomes an issue when both partners earn their living, but one always has considerably more. There is no gloss. Some have objected to the reactions from Ford's family as too stereotypical. I found that far from true. Coming out isn't rewarded by all. In the case of Ford, the rejection he feared and which then materialized seemed part of a self-fulfilling phrophecy - you can't keep telling your family you are still looking for the right wife until your late twenties and then expect your deceptions not to haunt you when you suddenly knock at the door with your same sex partner. The writing is superb. Grimsley once again proves himself a master in observing human reactions, but better prepare to linger on a page for a while - though the novel is just 300 pages long, you can't just browse through like you would with a YA romance. You might want to know that the novel is set in Georgia and covers a stretch of roughly 2 1/2 years in the second half of the 1980s, when cell phones did not exist, computers were fed with disks, and there wasn't yet an effective treatment for HIV."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"A reviewer for a local weekly newspaper recently trashed this book. While I didn't agree with the first half of the review--which suggests that the book contrives its characters to make a desperate plea for mainstream acceptance of gay men--I thought that the second part nailed down the essential problems with _Comfort and Joy_: the dialogue is sophomoric and stilted, and the faux-lyrical descriptions often provoke unintentional hilarity. For example, I had to close the book when the narrator describes Dan's nipples as &quot;tender-tipped and roseate.&quot; The reviewer made an apt comparison to a bad Harlequin romance novel.Grimsley's last book, _My Drowning_, remains one of the best books I have read in the past five years. His portrait of rural life in eastern North Carolina (where I also grew up) is spot-on accurate, and every scene and every word the characters speak to one another ring true. My mother was unable to finish the book because it brought back such vivid, bleak memories from her own childhood. So it is a mystery, then, how a writer who can produce as masterful a book as _My Drowning_ can follow that up with the minor performance in _Comfort and Joy_."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"What draws two people together? What makes them decide to be a couple? How do they overcome the barriers that divide them; the things they hate about each other in spite of their love?\\"Comfort & Joy\\" is a beautiful book in the tradition of Eudora Welty--a very southern story that nonetheless resonates across any such regional distinction. It is about two men, but the pieces of their stories could be assigned to any two people's lives. Grimsley fills the book with seemingly inconsequential minutia that offer the reader a crystalline vision of two people's lives as they slowly begin to merge. It demonstrates in a mature, adult way both the accidental quality of love, and its ability to endure and thrive in spite of the essential brokenness of human nature.The set-pieces that make up the structure of the narrative, which spans the time around two consecutive Christmases, are all familiar from both film and literature. Clashing backgrounds, difficult families, traumatic childhoods--and yet in \\"Comfort & Joy\\" they are specific to these men and their lives. Grimsley has tailored broad realities to the uniqueness of Ford and Dan. He manages to dance around the edges of stereotype (rich Savannah, poor backwoods North Carolina) without ever falling into caricature. These people feel real, like people I've met.All of the ingredients of a typical \\"gay romance\\" are here--and yet not one of them is used in a romantic way. There is nothing easy here, and yet the discomfort is never so great as to ruin the pleasure of reading Grimsley's prose and following these two complex, sympathetic men on their journey.As usual, I ignored the rave reviews and read the negative ones. Everyone's entitled to his opinion, but the negative reviews were idiotic. As someone who's shared a life with another man for 37 years, there is a goldmine of truth here, unmitigated by violins and unbridled declarations of love. If you know nothing about gay people, this would be a good place to start. If you are part of a couple of any sort, you'll find echoes of your own life in these pages, even if the basics are unfamiliar."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Glad that I managed to purchase this out-of-print book through Amazon market sellers. I read Winter Birds some time back and was discomforted somewhat by its tragic bleakness. I am very pleased that Grimsley has continued with Danny's life in Comfort and Joy. This is a beautiful book about two men's love for one another, their bond ultimately strong enough to achieve what they really wanted despite all the odds against them. I am just glad that Grimsley gave a happy ending to Danny's painful life. Grimsley writes from his heart, his words soulful and heartfelt. His characters shine, each one with a purpose in this beautiful story. Yes the story was a comfort and a joy to read."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Having just returned from a vacation with my family and reading Comfort and Joy while I was with them, I can truthfully say that Grimsley hit a home run rich with truth and honesty.

I was haunted by this book and look forward to reading it again and giving it as a gift to my friends."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I bought the book on a Thursday evening. By the following Thursday, I had read it twice and couldn't wait to read it again. Grimsley's writing style is the best I have read in quite some time. He uses, so well, traditions placed with Southern Literature- the people, language, sensory impressions, the place of the past. I have read all of Grimsley's work and am ready to place him next to Faulkner when it comes to quality of a Southern Writer. So much so that next semester I am including him in a college lit. course I'm teaching."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This is the 1st novel I've read of Grimsley's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. His use of time and rendering of human emotion and feeling greatly outweigh the tendency for repetition in descriptions of emotions and actions. I did appreciate his descriptions of places and events, like the harrowing medical procedures that Dan has to endure and Ford administers. Ford and Dan's relationship is an unlikely one, but that made it all the more lovely to envision. I really fell in love with both characters, found myself wanting to know more of them and felt sad to see them go at the end, which is my surest sign that I loved the novel."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This is a beautiful book which can be read by both straight and gay readers.

To be honest, it was an easy read...two sittings for me. But the characters were two dimensional and the love story (along with the requisite drama) was trite. It's a story we're all familiar with...1) issues of class and the pressures of equity, 2) the gay preoccupation with the beauty standard and how it plays out in relationship &quot;cache,&quot; 3) family, homophobia, and the expected clashes with queer life and love, 4) peripheral support from straight male friends and a lesbian couple...and so on and so on.Mr. Grimsley didn't write a bad novel here...just one I would not have expected from someone who wrote so eloquently in other works."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"It seems that many people don't know that this is one of Grimsley's early novels.

Third generation doctor, he has always followed the steps his parents have setted for him. But when he is expected to marry a good girl from a wealthy southern family he begins to question some of that steps. Cause almost by accident, he discovers that he is more attracted from men than women.Told be truth, till almost his late twenties years, he pleases himself with the adoration from other men. Ford is an handsome man, wealthy, a doctor, and he is used to be spoilt first by his family and then by his friends and lovers.First time he sees Dan, he is impressed by the angel voice of the man singing a Christmas carol. But Dan is a shy man and probably in that moment Ford is not ready for love, and so neither of them make a move. An year after they have the change to meet again and this time Ford finally makes that move. But as always Ford takes the lead and dictats how their relationship should be. Dan, even if shy and average plain jane, is not willing to loose himself in Ford's aurea.The relationship between them is not simple: even if Ford, step by step, tries to find his way out of the closet, he never claims that Dan is his lover, he uses direct words like \\"he sleeps with me\\", but he never one calls him other than my friend. On the other hand Dan comes from a very poor family and he is very stubborn in searching to prove his independence: accept to live with Dan and risk to cancel all his independence's claims is a very hard step. Plus Dan has a critical illness that put at risk their life together: from one part Dan tries to hide the problems his illness affects him, cause it's one more thing that puts him on an inferiority level from Ford, on the other hand Ford, even if conscious and caring of Dan's illness, sometime regrets the boundaries that cause them.The story travel in two time levels: the main story tell us the journey of Dan and Ford to spend Christmas with Dan's family, and between loving and conformtable family's pictures, we read how Dan and Ford's meet, of all the problems they have to overcome to be together, how always love is never put in question, but that they will succeed.

Families with a past of expectations and of darkness had threatened to seperate the two boys, but their love was strong enough to not let it end.The descriptions of both Dan and Ford are amazing.

The connection between Dan & Ford is incredible. They deal with the same issues that normal gay relationships go through (insecurity, confidentiality, etc.) and for once, no one has to get beat up or abuse drugs.

Grimsley also provides an excellent description of Ford's brief relationship with a drunkard named McKenzie that I found to be one of the highlights of this book. My only real complaint is that Ford's parents were a little too stereotypical of rich white Southerners. I guess I wanted them to be a little less predictable."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I must admit to not be a true connoisseur of gay fiction. Some of the stuff I tried reading in the past is a conglomeration of a convoluted plot that usually ends up with the main character sleeping with all of the other characters in the book before the yawner close. However, my boyfriend, who reads far more gay fiction than I, has been steering me around this world and introducing me to gay fiction that's not only rich, but compelling. Thus is the truth about Jim Grimsley's book, \\"Comfort and Joy\\".He writes the story of Ford, dashing doctor who's struggling with his identity despite his intense feelings, and Dan, an introverted, kind man with secrets to hide. Off the bat, the pairing of these two characters grabbed me: that the handsome Ford, who so easily could have fallen into caricature, finds within Dan a world of possibilities, not entirely based on appearances. In fact, what initially grabs Ford is Dan's voice, after hearing him sing in a hospital Christmas concert.In fact, Christmas keeps rattling around this couple as they decide to spend the holiday with each other first, and then to travel to meet Dan's somewhat accepting parents in North Carolina. This scenario is played out well, as we know Dan's initial shyness would be such a huge barrier to truly get to know him, that we finally learn more about him through his interesting family. Grimsley here too doesn't fall into stereotypes, but makes Dan's poorer family diverse enough to question Dan's sexuality but still welcome the couple with open arms.As all of this swirls around, the main focus is the couple hood of Dan and Ford. From it comes a sense of honesty, and permanence. You know, despite the major issues they must deal with, the strong undercurrent of their affection and love will hold them steady.In an age where breakups are a dime a dozen, and we celebrate the disposable relationships, \\"Comfort and Joy\\" adds its beautiful discordant tone to that chord, and makes for a wonderful, engaging read."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Readers of Jim Grimsley's earlier novels--&quot;Winter Birds,&quot; &quot;Dream Boy,&quot; and &quot;My Drowning&quot;--might be surprised by the title of his new novel, &quot;Comfort &amp; Joy,&quot; for there is little of either in his other writings. But this one has both as Dan Crell and Ford McKinney put their fragile, unlikely relationship to the test of coming out to their families--because they refuse to spend another Christmas apart.Grimsley's style is unadorned and understated. His familiar gothicism is replaced by a modern South with conflict set amidst affluence--the conflict of two men's vastly different backgrounds and their families' vastly differing expectations of them. Their pasts constantly threaten to swallow up their chances. Dan is an HIV+ administrator in the Atlanta hospital where Ford McKinney is completing his residency. (Readers of Winter Birds remember Danny, the hemophiliac child who narrates the drunken binges of a father who terrorizes his family with violence just short of murder.) Ford is the privileged, only son of old Savannah gentility: his parents have his life planned. Like grandfather and father, he'll be a physician and marry into Country Club society. They even pick the girl. When Ford insists he'll make his own choices and may not be the \\"marrying type,\\" they still don't get it.Dan's mother isn't exactly comfortable with her son's homosexuality, but her life on the brink of disaster has taught her that what counts is the love between herself and her children. That Danny is gay could never diminish her love for him, and when he brings Ford to her trailer in the back woods of North Carolina, she welcomes them.As divisive as the strain between Ford and his family is, the most intense struggles are waged within the lovers themselves as they fight against their own cultures and natures. Both have pride bred in the bone, and Dan's dirt-poor heritage and hemophilia along with Ford's inability to conceive how money could be an issue often threaten to undo them.&quot;Comfort &amp; Joy&quot; is about uncovering the self and discovering a relationship. While every gain is forged in pain, it is a book of hope--a story ending on the day after Christmas full of tidings of comfort and joy."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Although _Comfort and Joy_ shares characters with an earlier work by Grimsley, _Winter Birds_, the two novels could not be more different. Whereas the earlier work is a dark, harrowing tale of violence and domestic abuse, the present novel chronicles the hesitant, tender romance between a grown-up Dan Crell, coping with hemophilia and HIV as well as the scars left by his upbringing, and Ford McKinney, a handsome doctor from a rich family. They meet at the hospital where Dan is an administrator and Ford is a resident, fall in love and struggle with the issues so many gay male couples face: intimacy, money and their families. Though occasionally there is clumsy expository dialogue, surprising for a writer as skilled as Grimsley, and a false note or two in the romance, ultimately the author convinces the reader of his central argument. The contrasting holiday scenes in the Atlanta household and the humble residence of Dan's mother, now remarried, in South Carolina show that the rigid gentility of Ford's well-to-do Atlanta family constitutes its own kind of domestic abuse. One roots for the survival of this unlikely couple, and is uplifted by the ambiguous but hopeful ending. I read the earlier _Winter Birds_ some time after finishing _Comfort and Joy_ and realized that, despite the dramatic contrast in tone between the two, knowing the former adds depth to the later story and increases one's appreciation of both works."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Originally published in 1999, I'm surprised I didn't get around to reading this book earlier. I enjoyed Grimsley's other books, particularly \\"Winter Birds\\" and \\"Dream Boy.\\" I think this is one of those books that I thought I had read some time ago and forgotten. I think I also figured it was a Christmas book and didn't want to read it \\"out of season.\\"It is a Christmas book, sort of. Ignore the reviews that say \\"this is what happens when you bring your significant other home for Christmas.\\" Trust me, that's just a plot device. The title refers to the chorus of the carol, \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\\" In a nutshell, Dan, a shy hospital administrator, takes Ford, his goodlooking pediatrician boyfriend, home for the holidays. Dan's family is poor, Ford's is rich. Dan is completely out, Ford is still closeted. Dan has hemophilia and is HIV positive, Ford is completely healthy. These differences escalate into conflicts as the book moves back and forth between the present and flashbacks of their developing relationship.Though the book is set at Christmas, in fact, Christmas is an excuse for Grimsley to write a meditation on why men stay together.From the book:\\"And they would wonder, without words, without sound: Why do men stay together? It is easy to understand why they f*ck, but why do they stay together, what is the answer? Why do they live in the same house, share meals together, argue about money and parents, why do they have pets, plant begonias, bring home birthday cakes? Where are the children, where is the sense of permanence, what is the tie that binds?Yet they slept peacefully, side by side, and the body of one became adjusted to the rhythm of the other, and the breathing of one slowed the breathing of the other, and they dreamed in tandem and shared fragments of each other's dreams, and they grew more like each other day by day, not in personality but in the fissures of the brain, because, seeing the same things every day, day after day, they laid down crevices in themselves that were the same shape, that were the same events written into memory, and this was enough, without words, to keep them silent about the fact of their hates and their fears, their deep concerns about each other, and the certainty that one of them would die first and neither of them knew which one it would be.

Where are the children, where is the sense of permanence, what is the tie that binds? (p.207)&quot; It is in pursuit of questions like these that this that we are lead as Dan and Ford explore how intimate gay relationships are initiated, negotiated, and finally, consummated - in the fullest meaning of that term. How is it that two unlikely beings can come to the point of finding that living can only be complete when it involves both of them; together? It is also a wonderful examination of the fears and anxiety as well as the 'comfort and joy' of both discovering, and ultimately being true to ones self.This is one of the most satisfying novels I have read in years. There is enough plot interest to keep the reader engaged, but the real treasure in this read is in watching the author weave together the delicate fabric of a committed relationship between two men - in a society where this is still not accepted as the norm. We are permitted to feel the pain which is experienced by these two men as they seek to develop a strong and meaningful relationship, but we are also given full measure of the comfort and joy that can come from the effort.Because the novel is as real as it is exciting, it allows the reader to reflect on their own experience with forming and keeping intimate relationships in a way that is as helpful as it is full of power and passion. A great novel not only for gay readers but for anyone who wants to better understand what's involved for gay people seeking to form lasting relationships."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"I have to read Mr. Grimsley's other books now.

I usually am reading 3 to 4 books at a time, but this one caught and kept my attention, mainly because of the gorgeous prose and the similarities to my own life. Everything in this book rang true for me. Coming home for the holidays, coming out to your family and co-workers, the bittersweet, often fragile family relationships, the fear of coming to terms with your own gayness, from the first feelings of desire all the way through moving in together, the parents who will not accept you or your partner, the class differences between your partner's family and your own...all are explored in this poignant, deeply felt novel. This is one of my all time faves now."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Readers of Jim Grimsley's earlier novels--Winter Birds, Dream Boy, and My Drowning--might be surprised by the title of his new novel, Comfort &amp; Joy, for there is little of either in his other writings. But this one has both as Dan Crell and Ford McKinney put their fragile, unlikely relationship to the test of coming out to their families--because they refuse to spend another Christmas apart. Grimsley's style is unadorned and understated. His familiar gothicism is replaced by a modern South with conflict set amidst affluence--the conflict of two men's vastly different backgrounds and their families' vastly differing expectations of them. Their pasts constantly threaten to swallow up their chances. Dan is an HIV+ administrator in the Atlanta hospital where Ford McKinney is completing his residency. (Readers of Winter Birds remember Danny, the hemophiliac child who narrates the drunken binges of a father who terrorizes his family with violence just short of murder.) Ford is the privileged, only son of old Savannah gentility: his parents have his life planned. Like grandfather and father, he'll be a physician and marry into Country Club society. They even pick the girl. When Ford insists he'll make his own choices and may not be the \\"marrying type,\\" they still don't get it. Dan's mother isn't exactly comfortable with her son's homosexuality, but her life on the brink of disaster has taught her that what counts is the love between herself and her children. That Danny is gay could never diminish her love for him, and when he brings Ford to her trailer in the back woods of North Carolina, she welcomes them. As divisive as the strain between Ford and his family is, the most intense struggles are waged within the lovers themselves as they fight against their own cultures and natures. Both have pride bred in the bone, and Dan's dirt-poor heritage and hemophilia along with Ford's inability to conceive how money could be an issue often threaten to undo them.Comfort &amp; Joy is about uncovering the self and discovering a relationship. While every gain is forged in pain, it is a book of hope--a story ending on the day after Christmas full of comfort and joy."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Grimsley makes it look easy: the mark of a good writer. A well-developed plot, likable (and hate-able) characters, believable dialogue. No cosmic ah-ha's, but then, I wasn't expecting any. Grimsley's two main characters are multi-dimensional and real enough to be occasionally ambivalent about each other. Their love is expressed in actions instead of the simplistic verbal declarations of love most writers (and real people) fall back on. What I really liked was Grimsley's weaving of past and present, giving the reader history and motivation without solving all the questions he engenders. As a writer myself, I know it's difficult to let the reader draw his/her own conclusions, but Grimsley allows it, adding depth to a plot which on the surface might seem overworked. But after all, let's face it: most plots are overworked. If a writer can touch a heartstring or two, to me, they've accomplished their goal. I find myself thinking about the lives of the characters and wondering how they're doing, even weeks after reading the book. For me, that's one of the signs of a good read. I would love to read Comfort &amp; Joy in first person point of view, from either Ford's or Dan's perspective."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Finding this book, withot prior knowledge of the author or his other works, was an act of serendipity. Seldom is one given the opportunity to read of characters so well drawn,so real and so fragile, that when finishing the book, one is sadded by the loss of such friends as these. Mr.Grimsley has written of human emotions, not just those of gay men and women. If the exotic characters of Ethan Mordden's New York Greenwich Village stride over our lives, Grimsley's tip-toe down the hallways of our minds in endearing but no less memorable footsteps.Familiar topics are presented here,HIV,phobias,rejection,fear,love and indeed hope. Yet, each are given a fresh approach that blends so well with the spare but oh so poignant writing. A hint: upon finishing the book, re-read the first chapter. Truly it will complete a circle; almost as if the book never ends.I held my copy close to my heart when I finished reading, and promised myself to return to it in a year and a day."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This was the second Jim Grimsley novel I have read, and it sent me searching for more books authored by him. In \\"Comfort and Joy\\" we meet Danny and Ford, two gay men who fall in love. The story is about making a relationship work, coming out to family and friends and remaining an individual while growing as a couple. The characters seem real with real emotions, and Danny and Ford remind us that love is not about being straight or gay, but about being human. The author handles the love scenes in a beautiful and sensitive manner, which makes for a very touching book."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"A beautiful exciting love story. Alternatly told from the view by Dan, a hospital employee, originating from a poor family and by the view of Ford, a doctor, brought up in a noble family, whos path seems already predetermined due to its family tree. But those are not the only difficulties, for those two to overcome.-with the help of translates-(Eine wundersch&ouml;ne aufw&uuml;hlende Liebesgeschichte.

Although the book &quot;jumps&quot; around (I got confused) a little it is still a superb work. Mr. Grimsley had effortlessly caught the emotion that many gay men feel when they go home to their parent(s) for the hoildays. (with partners of not) The barrier of differnce still exists. I like the many opposites this book had, the richness of Ford's family compared to poor, humble family of Dan. (Is it any wonder that Dan's family is more accepting?) The family scenes fly by and I would really like to see a movie made out of this book, I think it would sell! I wish all the new modern Christmas stories were as good as this! Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"a sweet little gem, my first by grimsley, and not to be the last. the book itself covers so many areas of beginning a new relationship from that first look to the final enduring love and everything in between.we are introduced to ford, a man who has basically had his life set out before him, directed by his strong, upscale upbringing. once out on his own, he finds a bit more about himself than he thought existed, but because of his familys standing within their own history, feels trapped. then there is dan, a man who has dealt with all sorts of trauma, things most people only read about. he knows where he is in life and where he wants to be, but sometimes getting there is not easily done. once the two meet, things change for them together...they help one another become the people they are and the road there is filled with trials and tribulations making for one great adventure!"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Although this book is well written and fairly brief, I am never clear as to why the handsome, rich doctor(Ford McKinney) was attracted to someone older, HIV+ and an administrative staff person (Dan Crell) at the hospital where he is interning. What ignited the passion between them? Danny's singing? It made for an interesting story but I was never convinced of the logic of the relationship. On the other hand, stranger arrangements have been successfully developed.The reactions of Doctor McKinney's parents are described realistically and are understandable given the formidable heritage of Ford's family and their high expectations for maintaining their social standing. Ford's sister's reaction is a little too neat. Dan Crell's family situation is substanitally different but their reaction is mitigated by the family's past abusive, circumstances. Although the book stands alone on its own merits, it might be helpful to read Grimsley's earlier book about the Crell family."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Sad, really, that the story ends with such a \\"formulated\\" way for Grimsley's Comfort and Joy. Without giving anything away, I can say that this books seems a little like a \\"rush\\" work. At times I wonder if Grimsley needs to rush through this book for a book deadline he has in the contract with his publisher. Put that aside, the book deals with many fundamentally gay issues. HIV status, HIV prejudice in the gay community and for couples, money problems for couples, social status difference, etc. There are really some really great plotlines that the author could have definitely developed further. Having read Grimsley's \\"Dream Boy\\", I am very confident that this book has not nearly exhausted Grimsley's literary power at all.The protagonist, a rich late-20's doctor from a countryclub family struggles with his sexuality with himself and everybody else around him. The ideas are all great, but obviously not enough words were put into \\"cooking the literary stew\\". The books looks like a thick 300-pager, but it is much less element than you would expect from a normal 300-pager. While \\"Dream Boy\\" is also short, it is also enormously powerful, which is something I cannot bring myself to describe Comfort and Joy. Not a must-read, a good, semi/pseudo deep gay novel, however."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Well Mr.Grimsleys done it again. He could not have picked a better title for this book. I was unaware that he had put another book out.I had been waiting for his next novel with great anticipation. I am a bit angery with the book store I buy from. They never so much as ran an ad in their paper. Dan and Ford's relationship comes across as being so real, that it left me feeling like they were old friends, or even family at times. The reaction of Dan's family at their Christmas visit was very touching. They may not have had open arms ready, but they tried. I have not finished the book yet, I almost don't want to. You shold really read Winter Birds before this one. Also if your looking for a good cry with a hopeful ending you must read Dream Boy..Can't wait for the next book..now back to C&amp;J"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Jim Grimsley is one of my favorite authors and this book did not disappoint. It was refreashing to read a book about a committed gay relationship.Before you read this one, pick up a copy of Winter Birds. You do not need to read it first but it makes the experience of Comfort and Joy even richer."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Grimsley has given us a superb, tender and genuine portrayal of homosexual love with its pains, fears, struggles and ultimate hope of fulfilment: all of this very powerfully written. Dan and Ford are flesh and blood and what you see is what you get. Well almost for the characters reveal themselves slowly and with great agony of soul. Especially so for Ford the rich intern from Savannah who struggles,fears and torments over his love for Dan. And the reader agonizes with them. Fictional or real these people are a gift to those whose lives they touch. I found myself yelling and screamng for Ford to seize the day and Dan to deposit the money issue at the local bank. Thanks Mr. Grimsley! A wonderful piece of literature. Beautifully written indeed. I read it so fast I had to reread it in order to catch the flashbacks: all in three days."},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"This book has an appropriate title for it serves to comfort the reader as well as bring them joy! I am only 3/4 of the way though, and all I can say is that this book is a very well written, gentle, flowing story about men, love, family, and overcoming obstacles from the past as well as the present. Jim Grimsley's book is a refreshing change of pace in the world of gay fiction...in that it focuses on the &quot;REAL&quot; side of people and relationships, and provides a glimpse into the lives of two men who love one another without selling itself by being overly sexual or sleazy. Everything has it's place, including sex and sleaze, but Mr. Grimsley's book will take a place in your heart and mind unlike so many others. An excellent read. Devour it!"},{"Title":"Comfort & joy: A novel","review":"Everything I've read by Mr. Grimsley has a haunting, seductive quality. In _Dream Boy_ his prose was RIGHT ON and often wobbled on the line between lush sensuality and histrionics. In _My Drowning_ every phrase and sentence and anaolgy was RIGHT ON. In _Comfort and Joy_ -- I dunno. The novel was laced with schmaltzy moves and over-the-top similes. I still enjoyed it, ultimately, because of that engaging seductiveness, but I was continuously jerked out of my suspended disbelief into a sort of 'disbelief' that really read something as corny as what I just read. I would suggest this book to anybody who had a tolerance of periodic preciousness: with that caveat, though."},{"Title":"Quick Tips: The Guide to Golf's Best Shots (Quick Series Guide)","review":"I am an average golfer, weekend warrior to be exact and I shoot on average about mid-80's. Since I do not have the skill to be anywhere near a tour and don't have a wealth of trick shots in my arsenal, I use this little book anytime I come to a situation where I find myself unsure of what to do. It is very brief and can be used/viewed in between shots. Because it is so brief it offers advice on uneven lies, chipping, putting and strategy, it also has a great troubleshooting section so if you are having trouble (i.e. slicing, or hooking) it will give you a few quick notes to review and if you are astute enough to make adjustments or recognize the actual flaw it will give you a remedy for what ails you.This is not a book for working out you problems, it is as the title indicates a quick reference guide for you when you are on the course.Best couple dollars I ever spent..."},{"Title":"Quick Tips: The Guide to Golf's Best Shots (Quick Series Guide)","review":"This is a great book, with easy to read pages.

My biggest complaint overall was the grammatical errors, which is a pet peeve of mine and I kept running into them on just about every page. It made me wonder who exactly did the editing, because they obviously weren't doing their job. The writing just also seemed kind of week, also, although the story was interesting, I feel like the quality of writing brought it down."},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"Scary, fun, keeps you guessing until the end.

The police procedure was totally incorrect; in addition to the glaring inconsistencies between proper FBI procedure and what the author tried to get the reader to believe. As a result, I was constantly turned off by the book. I found my attention wandering every time that I came across a mistake in procedure.Walker's portrayal of a female Law Enforcement Officer was much too trite and Hollywood. I found myself rolling my eyes and shaking my head at passages involving the Duval County Sheriff. It was almost as if he was writing his characters with specific actors and actresses in mind, instead of real people doing real jobs.My advice? Stop dreaming of Hollywood, start doing some procedural study, and for pete's sake...research the REAL people that do the real jobs in your books."},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"This is the first of his I have read' will NOT go back and read the previous ones.

Once Grant snatched the innocent young woman, Phillip would take over and surgically cut the brain out and eat it. He believes that eating fresh human brains will increase his awareness and achieve cosmic consciousness. Grant is modeling his behavior after Daryl Thomas Chockil \\"The New Jersey Ghoul\\" who dug up the bodies of dead children in 1990 and ate a part of their brain.He was incarcerated in a hospital for the mentally insane but has gotten out a month before the skull-digger started killing his victims. The FBI immediately focus their attention on Daryl but medical examiner Dr. Jessica Coran thinks the real killer is setting up The New Jersey Ghoul to take the fall. She persuades her superiors to look for someone who keeps logging on to Daniel's website and after a ton of digging, they find a likely suspect but Jessica almost gets herself killed when she tries to take him in.Robert W. Walker can always be counted on to create an exciting crime thriller with a villain that readers love to hate. Told from the point of view of the killer, the audience learns that the character suffers from multiple personality disorder but he is so evil, he illicits no sympathy. The novel is also told from the protagonist's point of view and readers sympathize with her feelings of impotence and frustration as she tries to convince her superiors to go after the right person, not the easiest one to blame.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"Grave Instinct is a huge roller-coaster ride from start to finish. It begins at lightning speed and just gets faster from there. Those who can't follow Walker's complex sentences need to go back to school. His style is similar to Martin Cruz Smith -- Gorky Park. He's closer to Faulkner than to Hemmingway. So you don't find a lotta easy sentences and you can't go out for a snack until the scene is finished, but the payoff is amazing. My favorite author and I can't wait to jump into his Absolute Instinct and his new series City for Ransom."},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of this in paper back having read all previous Instinct books! The previous books were so well researched, Jessica was smart, savy and knew her proceedure inside out. Nothing slipped past her and she outsmarted everyone!This book she is like a rookie patrolman. It's like someone else wrote this book and just filled it with shock value murder scenes.Oh Mr. Walker, this is such a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"This is a remarkable, fun, scary forensics forray and a forray into the madness not only of one maniac but many, and the madness of our law enforcement systems, especially the prison system which allows a crazoid like Manson to deliver his rantings on his website to potentially \\"poison\\" young minds. This is cutting edge stuff and recalls to mind themes Walker wrote about in his first Edge book, Cutting Edge, in which it is noted anyone with a PC or a Mac today can and does often set him or herself up as a demi-god or a conduit from God. Walker always deals with complex issues, and perhaps this is why his readers are so loyal to him. They know with each of his books they will get into meaty issues, and this is no soap opera as with so many other forensics titles that fall far more into the category of romance or as i said soap opera. I liken Walker's books to a TV drama that you CAN'T sleep or blink through or step away to make a sandwich, or drop the ball, because everything in the drama matters. There are surprises on every page. There is action on every page. As for the person calling herself traffic cop...for a traffic cop to be telling Mr. Walker he does not know anything about forensics, well that is crazy, isn't it?? Suffice to say that this book is a TEN. And don't miss FleshWar, and Mr. Walker's Geoffrey Caine novels on Fiction Wise now, and the return of the Chicago ME Dean Grant on Fiction Wise as well. But most of all don't miss his City for Ransom."},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"The story was typically spun with Walker's usual aplomb and finess. The characters progresses futher along that usual and you are left to wonder whether Jessica really is, after all this time, going to give it up. I hope not. But Walker may be tiring of the character for a while at least. I have all the books of the series and have read them more than once. This tale is one of my favorites>"},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","review":"I agree with all of the previous negative comments, and I won't repeat points they made.I have never read this author before, but picked up this book at the library based on numerous plaudits on the (paperback) book. Based on this one, I won't bother to read any others. I don't write many reviews, but I was moved to write this one just to warn others away.First, I will say that the basic premise of the book was intriguing and sufficiently interesting that I read it completely through. Maybe my frustration comes from the fact that the story development was handled SO poorly. (It coulda been a contender)The book is riddled with-- errors, like \\"Angora\\" [not Angola ??] Prison, \\"Pittsburgh Pennsylvania University\\" [not the University of Pittsburgh] Steps leading to a house are made out of cypress-- when a few pages earlier, they were made of cedar. Supposedly the bobbing movement of the room shown on a video help the good guys to figure out that it is on a boat. But the camera and room are fixed in position on the same boat, so there would be NO apparent movement in the video.--and---- hackneyed or unrealistic plot devices Split personality is a very rare condition used far too often in fiction, so perhaps I shouldn't complain. But, eating fresh brains is so compelling that even police pick up the habit quickly ?? We're told that a hurricane is hitting to the south, close enough that local helicopters have been sent down for rescue work. But around here, the air and water are so calm that the fog is inpenetrable ?I don't understand why there are so many unconnected vignettes of unknown people reading mostly technical material about brain anatomy on web sites. It comes across to me as if some research assistant had taken the trouble to copy that technical information down, and the author had to fit it in SOMEWHERE.Enough.

Janice includes many stories outside the work place that demonstrate how her ideas impact the personal life of her clients and herself. Well read or trained business people will be familiar with a lot of the concepts, what is unique and useful is; the different perspective, the connection of the ideas and the exercises Janice presents to the reader. The understanding of human nature gained as a psychotherapist is clear in each chapter as Janice explains how to change the way people behave in organizations. The ideas and tools are carefully woven into a logical progression throughout the book, however you can get value by starting anywhere or reading a single chapter. At the end of each short chapter you will find some exercises often phrased as questions to the reader. I found the exercises very useful for putting the ideas into action. The saying good things come in small packages applies here, a physically small book with a big impact."},{"Title":"Shift: Secrets of Positive Change for Organizations and Their Leaders","review":"I picked up Janice Calnan's book mostly out of curiosity since I have a keen interest in the smooth implementation of new projects and ideas. Shortly thereafter, and with very little warning, organizational convulsions suddently started to happen. My department was changed overnight. Some people were let go, others reassigned, new roles were in store for those that remained. &quot;Change&quot; was now very up close, personal and not a lot of fun. The book helped me focus on the right things in order to get through it all.The &quot;secrets&quot; are a collection of new and simple ideas that caused a shift in my assumptions and behaviours.

In just the five minutes I had to scan the opening &quot;Letter to the Reader&quot; and Introduction, I knew I was onto something special. I have been involved in the work of quality and organizational improvement for about 20 years. I am a certified &quot;business book junkie,&quot; consuming dozens of titles a year. Janice Calnan's SHIFT is a remarkable piece of work. Ms. Calnan offers a simple, clear path for people to begin the process of personal change needed to craft more effective and successful organizations. It is obvious that Janice Calnan has spent a great deal of time working with, and learning from people at all levels of organizational structures. She has distilled the complex and seemingly arcane art of organizational improvement into a clear and transformational process. The book's ideas are set out in a simple, straightforward style, that is likely to appeal to even the most entrenched &quot;old thinking&quot; business practitioner. Janice Calnan's book has earned a top spot on my own reference shelf, along such classics as Peter Scholtes' TEAM Handbook, and the works of Deming, Juran, Townsend, Peters, and Wheatley. If you are engaged in the work of organizational change, I would highly recommend this book.ABOUT THE REVIEWER: Bruce Waltuck is a 25-year veteran of the United States Department of Labor.

The book isn't the best I have seen and if I hadn't had a really rigorous prep in AP Chem I would have been lost in the reading. I didn't think the book was very clear with the formulae. It spent a lot of time explaining how a formula was derived, a student should have an understanding of the reasoning for the formula (or George Berkeley will yell), but this text does not give the formula and what all the variables are at once point. This makes review and looking up formulae rather labourous. The text misses a few important ideas (intensive vs. extensive properties) but spends a rather excessive amount of time on \\"present sources of energy\\" in an attempt, I presume, to relate the text to daily life. The data in the back of the book doesn't match up with a good deal of the data I have encountered elsewhere (while the difference isn't huge, it is present). Also, this may be because I came from a background where strict usage of sig figs was required, no points could be awarded if there were mistakes in the sig figs, I have noticed that the text plays rather \\"loose\\" with the sig figs. Also, it has comments like \\"We are keeping track of the sign value for this number in our heads.\\" Furthermore, some of the vocab usage is off from what it should be (i.e. \\"All values are assumed precise to at least plus/minus 1.\\" is noted on the list of thermodynamic data, it means the data is accurate, how close to the \\"true\\" value, and not precise, how close the tests are to one another). These are all minor problems, but proper use of vocab and sig figs are vital to the ability of a student to communcate properly and therefore I feel that the text should provide a model for the student.Of the GenChem textbooks I have used, I vastly prefer Chemistry : The Central Science by Brown, LeMay and Bursten."},{"Title":"Chemical Principles","review":"Why does my university use this book? The University of Washington uses this book to weed out the pre med students. Why do they choose this book? Zumdahl purposely wrote this book to be confusing. Try reading pp. 668 through 670 in the fifth edition. He wrote this to be especially confusing by not being consistent with phase signs nor giving clear statements, such as \\"When the phase of the right orbital is reversed and combined with the left orbital.\\" What orbitals is he talking about? The ones on a figure, that happen to be on a different page, which is not in view when reading this page? This book is horrible and is designed for the student to fail.

Reading through even a single chapter of this book will lower the intelligence quotient of any sane individual.

Please don't read if you have not yet read the book.I loved Mary Stewart's \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\" and think it was one of the best of that genre. Since then I have read several of Mary Stewart's books, hoping to find one as well done as \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\" and have been disappointed. \\"The Ivy Tree\\" was no exception.I agree with the reviewer who complained about the type face used - I almost put the book down and chose another from my stack after seeing this clunky, old-fashioned type. The book was pretty clunky, too. So boring at times. I really didn't enjoy all of those descriptive paragraphs - especially when character development was so lacking. I had to make myself keep reading this book~that never happens to me, but it just seemed so lacking in things to keep me interested. The hero that Anabelle ends up with is barely developed, and I was left not caring one bit that she ended up with him.I found the reveal about Anabelle so subtle that I had to go back and re-read the chapter just to make sure I had interpreted it correctly. And the plot seemed convoluted - hard to follow. Maybe if it hadn't taken me two weeks to read this book due to it being so lackluster, I could have followed it better.Anyway - another disappointment for me from Mary Stewart. I think I'll go read a Victoria Holt now to wipe away the memory of this boring gothic."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I liked this book a lot, and according to the other revews, I'm not alone. It was suspenseful with a great plot with a little romance thrown in. My only problem- I guess I'm the only one who didn't understand this- is the relationship between Annabel and Mary Grey... Those of you who have read this will know what I mean, but it went completely over my head. Anyway, it was a great book otherwise and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"So, I after reading all the superlative reviews of this book, I wished for and received \\"Ivy Tree\\" as a gift. First off, what was with the font used for this book? It was painful to read. And, anyone who is a lover of mystery books can figure out the plot within the first few pages. I wish I could compare the book to an ivy tree, but if I did, it would I would have to talk only about pruning. Like, cut this book back to its roots and start over. Not even the copy-cat Jane Eyre/Edward Fairfax Rochester, mad wife, fire and scars can make this book worthwhile. If you want to spend time with ivy, come on over to my house, I have some ivy on my back fence that needs to be cut back..."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"For those of you who enjoy straight-out romance, or the Nora Roberts brand of a little suspense thrown in with a lot of romance, Mary Stewart is not the author for you. Stewart requires indepth reading, her plots are intricate, her characterizations strong. She is incomparable; her words are literature. Although descriptions abound, there is not any graphically detailed sex, so if this is not your cup of tea, read no further and look for another selection.This particular book does not fit into any of the usual Stewart categories----the great chase as in 'Madam Will You Talk?', the closed room police procedural as in 'Wildfire at Midnight' or the Evil Relative with Nefarious Intentions as in 'Nine Coaches Waiting'----rather, it is a story of impersonation. . . and one of Stewart's best offerings in terms of just about everything: plot, tone, description, dialogue, characterization etc.Mary Grey accepts a 'job',posing as Annabel Winslow, the long-lost cousin and heiress to Whitescar, a lucrative North England working farm---her employer, her 'cousin' Con has much to gain once Annabel's cantankerous old grandfather passes on. At first, after careful schooling by Con and his half-sister, Lisa, Mary takes to her new position smoothly, easily edging her way into life on the farm with a barrage of lies that seem to be second nature to her. No one doubts her identity until she discovers the presence of an unknown lover that may blow her cover. The real reason Annabel Winslow left Whitescar eight years earlier hits the reader with tour de force revelation which Stewart masterfully manipulates.I won't spoil the story any further. It must be read slowly and savored like a good $100+ bottle of wine. The language is glorious,meant to be read aloud. The words paint wonderfully lush and powerful images of life in the north country. The characters likewise are finely drawn, flesh and blood human beings whose emotions thunder off the pages with the same potent electric charge of lightning that finally splits the old ivy tree in two towards the end of the story. Even the secondary characters are not to be missed. Mrs. Bates with her nosy northerner's distrust of anything 'London', Julie, the pettish young adult who is Annabel's mirror image, and Donald Seton, the stuffy, but warm-hearted Scot archaeologist with a soft spot for the greedy cat Tommy and his litter of kittens. Even the colt, Rowan, has a personality all his own; Stewart knows and loves her animals and this like all her other novels is a tribute to the creatures and places she loves best.I have read and listened to this book over and over again. Each time, even though I know the ending, I find new techniques to ponder and wonder over. Stewart is simply fantastic; shame on anyone who prefers lesser works to her masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"If you want to discover how perfectly plotted this book is, you must read it at least twice. You will be stunned by the clues that are there from the beginning (starting with the opening paragraphs) and sprinkled throughout the text. Over and over again, the answers are there - hiding in plain sight.Of all the Mary Stewart mysteries (and I have loved them all), this has long been my favorite. I have always been drawn to questions of identity (from fictional characters like Josephine Tey's Bratt Farrar to Anna Anderson's claim to be Anastasia).This is a quiet book, haunting in it's depiction of loss - a grandfather's loss of a favorite granddaughter; a woman's loss of place and name; a lover's loss - of promises, of time; a man's loss of wife and health. And a lost note, the delivery of which might have changed much of what ensued.The echoes of the past build and build until they crash resoundingly into the present and affect all of the lives of all of those around Whitescar.Read it through, and then re-read the first couple pages. It was all right there to begin with."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I have read and reread this book so many times! I already know the plot but the descriptions and dialogue are really enjoyable. The atmosphere the author creates is so indefinably romantic and enjoyable, I don't know how the author does it but I am grateful, I only wish there were even more of her books out there, if anyone is looking for more Mary Stewart check out Madame, Will You Talk, Nine Coaches Waiting, Wildfire at Midnight, Airs Above The Ground, Touch Not the Cat, and My Brother Michael, they are also incredible!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"As the story opens Mary Grey is enjoying her day off taking in the local tourist sights near her new home. She has recently left her native Canada to return to Northumberland where her greatgrand parents had been born. Suddenly a young man confronts her, calling her Annabel and insisting that she is his cousin who disappeared eight years earlier. Mary manages to convince him of her identity but soon finds herself embroiled in a plot to impersonate the missing Annabel in her family home, Whitescar.Gradually it becomes apparent that all is not quite as it seems, everyone there seems to have a secret, her Grandfather has not disclosed who will inherit the family farm, 'cousin' Con has not revealed the depths of his ambition, the missing Annabel left behind secrets when she fled, even the estate itself has been keeping things hidden. Eventually all is revealed with the usual Stewart flair for drama and romance.This 40+ year old book has aged well. There are some references that place it firmly in the early '60's, for example, a cell phone would have eliminated much of the tension, it is still a thoroughly enjoyable story, very reminiscent of BRAT FARAR. As usual with Stewart's work the setting and characters all come to life. The plot is cleverly handled, the clues to the mysteries are all there for the reader to follow but so subtly done that it will be a very rare reader who does not get at least a few surprises along the way including true identities of more than one character."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Among Mary Stewart's books, and I have read most of them, this would probably be known as a &quot;sleeper.&quot; However, having read it through three times plus scanning it several other times, I feel it is one of her best! The first time I read it I was aghast at first because Mary Stewart's heroines were always very moral women--the stuff good role models ate made of. Mary Grey doesn't seem to fit the role! After the first time I read it I had to go to England and see the area where the book was set. However, my husband wasn't as eager as I was to search out the setting and I came home disappointed.Seven years later, after having my husband read it and reading it twice more myself, we returned to England, and this time found Crag Lough by Hadrian's Wall, where the book opens. We tried to imagine which of the farms we could see from there was Whitescar and where Forrest Hall would have been.I have searched the book several times for looking for flaws, but it is perfectly executed. Like all good mysteries she does include an important clue in the very first chapter. Yet, I read the chapter four times before I found it!This book still &quot;haunts&quot; me even today as I gaze at the pictures we took of Crag Lough and Hadrian's Wall. Originally published in 1961, it is as exciting today as it was when it was first published, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good suspensful romantic mystery."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"The Ivy Tree was the first book that I had even read by Mary Stewart. Let alone I read it for my British Literature class. It was great. The suspense just about killed me at the end. I just kept on turning the pages. She describes the scene and the characters so well that I felt like I was right there. It was a great book! I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Definitely not clueless writer - she left plenty of them.I didn't love this book when I read it. I felt that she betrayed an implied contract with the reader. But then on second reading, I realized that in my rush to devour it all, I had been clueless. So few romance and fiction best-sellers - including Stewart's later contemporary works - demand anything of the reader the way Stewart's early novels did. On the other hand, readers don't get the extra dividends. She leads us by the hand and teaches us that the reason great literature has endured - in this case folk ballads, but in earlier novels Shakespeare and Greek plays - is that they entertain and move us.This book is as richly textured as any of her novels."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I've loved this book since I discovered it in a pile of dusty paperworks at our summer cottage, 20 years ago. I can't even tell you how many times I've read and re-read it. As I get older, I see the story from different eyes, but never fail to be intruigued by it. Its such a wonderful twist, I highly recommend it. I guess I won't pay the $.. they are trying to charge for the audio version, but I think I'll replace my old paperback, since its falling apart from so much reading."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I have probably read this book at least ten times over the years and I still love it. My oldest son is even named Conor, because I had always loved the name from the book. I only wish I could find another romantic mystery as good as this one was."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"In her usually elegant and sophistocated style, Mary Stewart weaves a suspenseful mystery that leaves the reader guessing until the very end.On the English countryside, a young Canadian woman, Mary Grey, is resting on a ruin while on holiday when she is suddenly interrupted by a furious man. The man, Connor Winslow, recognizes Mary as his cousin and long-dead lover, Annabel Winslow. After Mary explains that there must have been a mistake, Connor tells her about Annabel who disappeared years before and makes her an offer...Mary can arrive at Connor's home, Whitescar, and masquesde as Annabel. She will inherit Annabel's fortune,if she gives Connor the land of Whitescar.A woman does arrive at Whitescar. Is she, Mary Grey working to inherit money that is not her own? Or is she, Annabel Windslow returned home?Upon arriving at Whitescar, Mary delves into the mystery of Annabel. Why did the woman disappear without a word to anyone or perhaps was she forced to disappear?With her usual genious, Stewart leds the reader down a dark but exciting path. Hints deeply embedded into the dialogue reveal the truth."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"The first time I tried to read this, I didn't get beyond the first chapter as the characters seemed edgy and strange. However, since I have enjoyed many of the author's other works, I decided to give it a second chance. It was worth the time and I got pulled into the story. Mary Grey visits the moors and is accosted by a man who thinks she is his cousin who disappeared 8 years ago. She gets drawn into a plot to help the man (Connor) get the estate that he feels is rightfully his by impersonating his cousin Annabel. There are many twists and turns in the romantic mystery suspense tale and you were never quite sure on what was going to happen. Will she be found out? Is Connor as sinister as he appears? Will Annabel's secret lover cause trouble? The romance is understated, but the suspense will really keep you going. It was a good story and was well written."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"The Ivy Tree, by Mary Stewart, keeps the reader wondering right from the first page. I first found this book as a paperback 50 years ago!Last year I noticed how yellowed the pages now were, so bought a hardcover copy from Amazon. Many years had passed since I had read The Ivy Tree. When I began it this past year, I realized just how much of the story I had forgotten. So the mystery was there to be unraveled all over again, and it really does keep one's attention throughout. It certainly is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Mary Stewart has a special way with words. She can turn a noun into a verb and describe a scene in a way that makes you a part of the scenery. Her knowledge of local flowers and their smells brings you right into the book with the characters.This is a love story of a young married man and a very young woman who leave letters for each other in the Ivy Tree. Because of the circumstances, the young woman, Annabel, leaves her home and returns years later not knowing what she will find. Her introduction into the family is through a secret held together by greed. Annabel returns to be with her grandfather again. There is a chase against time and on horseback. Mary Stewart always has a chase in her books and this one is especially well written with emphasis on trust between rider and horse. This is definitely one of Mary Stewart's best work."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I read this when I was much younger, probably around 12 years old. It was a great inspiration to my early creative fiction writing back then, and my current prose writing later, and I still remember it and think of it throughout the years. I moved several countries since I read it and I lost the book somewhere along these years (it wasn't really mine to begin with...I think I 'borrowed' it from my mother) and have been searching for it. Finally it hit me to try the internet and of course, Amazon.com! Duh! I need to catch up with the age (especially since I've been using the web for everything for so long now). It's a very unforgettable book for its plot and story, for the emotions that it so easily evokes within the reader, and the beautiful painting of the landscape through the author's words. I can't wait to get the book again in the mail and finally have it in my library and read it once again."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"This book was a really great book. It had the perfect classic plot with a great twist. The ending was cool and the charector's were well developed. Mary Stewart is a good auther and a great inspiration."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Mary Stewart is a great writer. I'm glad that I discovered her again. This book keeps you guessing until the end. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I have loved Mary Stewart's books since I first read them when I was in school. I have read this one, Moonspinners, and My Brother, Michael over ten times each - enjoying them as much the tenth time as I did the first. I really wish they would be brought out in ebook form here in the US as they are in the UK. Since committing to the cost of an ereader and running out of physical space for paper books, I no longer buy \\"book books\\". It would be great to be able to add this wonderful author's books to the ereader."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"\\"The Ivy Tree\\", first published in 1961, was written as a contemporary novel, but is now something of a period piece. I was immediately struck by how much the protagonist smokes! More subtly, the attitudes to the \\"place\\" of men and women, and the power [im]balances between them, make it impossible to forget that this is a novel of an earlier time.There are plot elements that I can't refer to without revealing major spoilers, so I won't. But I found this a gripping story, with well-drawn characters and an intriguing plot. Towards the end, the tension is ramped up to the point that I almost became breathless at times.The setting (near Hadrian's Wall) is attractively described, and Stewart manages to slip in some geology and Roman history without ever remotely overdoing it. She also appears to know a lot about horses; I enjoyed the horsey bits very much.Whether or not the \\"mystery\\" remains mysterious (I unravelled it early on, but that did not spoil the pleasure of reading), this is a thoroughly good yarn."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"When I decided to read &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; by Mary Stewart, I was hoping for an engrossing mystery that would keep me captivated. Unfortunately, this book just never managed to grip me, and I found myself struggling to finish it. I'm aware that my opinion is in the minority here, so I guess it comes down to the fact that Mary Stewart's writing just isn't my cup of tea.The story revolves around Mary Grey, a woman who has recently come to England from Canada, and who looks amazingly similar to glamorous missing heiress Annabel Winslow. &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; starts out with a great first chapter as Conor, a distant relation of Annabel's who now runs the farm at Whitescar, verbally attacks Mary believing her to be Annabel. But once the misunderstanding is straightened out, Conor begins to see what an asset Mary could be.Conor is convinced that Annabel's ailing grandfather is not planning to leave him any part of Whitescar when he dies despite all the long years that Conor has worked there. So, he hires Mary Grey to come back claiming that she's Annabel, so that she will receive most of Whitescar in the old man's will and then can give it to Conor. The only thing that could present a problem is Annabel's cousin Julie, who will almost certainly be in the will as well, but Conor is confident that she won't get in the way. After convincing a reluctant Mary to go along with his scheme, they put their plan in motion.But things don't run as smoothly as they should. Tensions run high at Whitescar when Julie arrives for a visit. Conor begins to show a violent and unsettling side to himself that makes Mary wonder what kind of man he really is. And Mary herself is hiding a shocking secret that could put her in serious danger if anyone, especially Conor, were to find out!The ending of &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; really picks up, but for me, the majority of the book just dragged on and on without enough action to keep me genuinely interested. Though the quality of writing is good and the characters are well developed, this story just didn't hold my attention. But even though I found this book a bit hard to get through, I did still enjoy it, and I would recommend you form an opinion on &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; for yourself."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I'm currently reading this book. I started on it about a month ago. I'm not even half way through it. No, I'm not busy doing other things. This is the kind of book where I can't even force myself to finish the chapter before I put it down. I would normally finish reading a book this size in a day or two if I liked it. I just can't get into the story. While the writer is very, very descriptive it seems she forgot to add depth to the characters. They seem so one dimensional. I can't care about them, identify with them- nothing."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"This was a really awsome book. I couln't stop reading it. It has a really good opening chapter and unfortunatly not every book has that. This book is full of mystery and suspence. The ending of the book is what you would never expect. It has your heart racing at the turn of every page. It is such a joy to read this book. I know that there are alot of books out there but this is a must."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Back when I was in high school, my bookshelves were filled with the Gothic romances of Mary Stewart, Victoria Holt and Phyllis A. Whitney. In my mind's eye (especially on a dark and stormy night!), I liked to cast myself as one of the the intrepid governesses who finds employment at the manor house of a devastatingly handsome but brooding lord with a plethora of mysterious, murderous relatives and eavesdropping servants. While I always questioned why these young women used to traipse out at midnight into the fog-shrouded moors - wearing only a diaphanous nightgown - to investgate a spooky noise, I was nonetheless captivated by the way all three of these authors could spin such breathtaking ambiance and make a reader feel as if they were right in the scene. I was, thus, delighted when an associate sent me a paperback copy of the newly re-released \\"The Ivy Tree\\" by Mary Stewart. Her heroine is a plucky lady of mystery who or may not be who she really says she is, and the scintillating underscore of sexual tension throughout the chapters makes this the kind of read that should be enjoyed with a pot of herbal tea, a fire in the fireplace, a cozy comforter, and a storm outside one's windows. Even with the passage of 40 years since I originally read this title, it's a cleverly orchestrated mystery that still feels timeless.Christina HamlettAuthor of \\"Movie Girl\\" and \\"Screenwriting for Teens\\""},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"First Sentence: I might have been alone in a painted landscape.Annabel Winslow has been dead for four years. Mary Grey, over from Canada, looks enough like Annabel to be her twin. When Conner, foreman at Whitescar, stumbles upon her, it takes a bit of convincing that she is Mary. Con, and his half-sister, Lisa, work up a plan for Mary to pretend to be the missing Annabel long enough to ensure her grandfather passes the ownership of Whitescar to Con in his will. Annabel Winslow has been dead for four years. Or has she?This is Mary Stewart at her very best. With lovely nods to Josephine Tey's \\"Brat Farrar,\\" which I also loved, \\"The Ivy Tree\\" is a more complex, layered book, although the clues are there for us to find. Stewart's characters come alive and even have reader questioning just who is Mary? There is that constant threat of danger. Her descriptions and use of imagery make me go back and re-read passages for the pure pleasure of her words. It is a story of love, loss, and hope is wonderfully timeless. Stewart is always such a pleasure to read and this is one of, if not the, best of her works."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Connor \\"Con\\" Winslow is the great-nephew of Matthew Winslow, master of the Whitescar estate. Con works the lands and is considered a \\"poor relation,\\" which means that the estate will be left to one of his young female cousins instead. Annabel, who became his fianc&eacute;e, left eight years ago and is now presumed dead. Now Matthew is considering leaving everything to his other granddaughter Julie. But then something happens. A young woman named Mary Grey appears as if from nowhere. She looks so much like Annabel Winslow that Connor at first thinks it is she who has returned to claim what is hers. But when this is proven otherwise, he makes an offer the girl cannot refuse: pretend to be Annabel Winslow so that her grandfather makes her his main beneficiary. Then, after the old man dies, she'd pass everything on to Connor. She'd get a good sum of money for her troubles. Mary has traveled to England all the way from Canada and is barely making ends meet working as a waitress. She could use the money. What could possibly go wrong?As I read the story, I was mentally giving The Ivy Tree three stars, possibly two. Why? Well, I was confused throughout most of the thing. For about three quarters of the book, the storyline and narrative were sketchy at best. I'd give the story away if I supply further details, so I won't do that. Suffice it to say that everything makes perfect sense by the end of the book, making this one of the cleverest suspense novels I have read in a long time. Mary Stewart is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. I loved Nine Coaches Waiting and I adore this one. What's more, you can truly see the novels that have influenced this particular story. Whitescar reminds me a great deal of Manderley in Rebecca (especially when Mary describes the rhododendrons) and Connor seems like a more sinister version of Max de Winter. In some areas, the story of Annabel and her secret lover is kind of similar to Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester. Stewart knew her gothic classics, and she emulated them without losing her very own touch of literary magic. I cannot recommend this novel enough. I wish it had been longer though. Two-hundred and twenty-three pages are simply not enough."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Every year, I reread my collection of Mary Stewart paperbacks, and every year, The Ivy Tree gets me excited and nervous, with squeals of delight, and chills up my spine. This book is amazing. It never fails to enchant me, and I love all the characters in the book-- from Annabel to Mary to Adam. Mary Stewart is definitely the Queen of romantic suspense. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"My mom convinced me to read this and when I finally was persuaded to read it I found that Mary Stewart is a literary genuis. She has a rare ability to bring her writing to life. Even if you think the endings to her books are predictible, the trip ther is the best part. I would recomend this to anyone who likes good writing, romance, and life endangering mystery this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Of the many stellar books Mary Stewart wrote, The Ivy Tree just might be the brightest. Expertly plotted, several mysteries are woven through the story, but it's also a treatise on the meanings of 'home' and 'family'. The ivy tree of the title refers to an oak which is being strangled by a vine. In the book's climatic scene, the tree is destroyed, just as the stranglehold of expectations that stunted all the Winslows is destroyed.Because of her resemblance to the daughter of the house, Mary Grey is recruited to play the Prodigal and return to Whitescar, but just who is Mary Grey? Is she a consummate actress, or is she really Annabel Winslow? Mary/Annabel, who tells the story discloses little though there are plenty of clues. Whitescar seems to be a minefield of emotion and hidden agendas and if at first Mary/Annabel must second-guess her every word and action, she soon relaxes and begins relating to everyone in her orbit. Though Annabel had a cruel streak, Mary is frequently described as 'nice'. So who is it really who has come to Whitescar?With various subplots involving horses and archeology, starring a large cast of characters, The Ivy Tree is a wonderful read. Though it's catalogued as romantic suspense, Ms. Stewart's skill at evocative description makes it more than a genre piece. The characterizations are masterful also. Some of the best reading in the book are the interactions between Mary/Annabel and Julie, Donald and Adam. Let's not forget the animals, either. One of my favorite scenes is the tea party when the cat Tommy is the illicit beneficiary of crab and ham sandwiches.The reader cannot help but be reminded of that other great imposter story of the twentieth century, Josephine Tey's Brat Farrar.If you like Brat Farrar, you'll like The Ivy Tree."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"My favourite of all the Mary Stewart romances I read 30 years ago, the one I remembered best and recently purchased. When I read it again I realised that although I'd forgotten some of the passages, others remained crstal clear.Superficially in the same vein as the others, \\"The Ivy Tree\\" is more complex, I would say more ambitious. The interplay between the characters - their emotions, their intersecting (sometimes conflicting) goals - this is drawn into marvellously sharp relief. The description of scene and atmosphere is exquisite - the opening sentence is a gem. The plot contains a few uncomfortable patches, where maintaining the flow looked to be rather contrived, while some of the parallels with other literature might be considered somewhat explicit. But for me these do not detract from the reading pleasure.A book to read, preferably, alone in a painted landscape."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Mary Grey finds herself in the north of England, working as a waitress, when one day she decides to go for a walk along Hadrian's Wall. While there, Mary is accosted by Con Winslow, who mistakenly thinks she is Annabel, his cousin who disappeared to America eight years ago. He and his sister Lisa convince Mary to engage in a act of deception: to impersonate Annabel Winslow so that Con might inherit her grandfather's estate, Whitescar.It's a short novel, and likeNine Coaches Waiting, The Ivy Tree is very plot-driven. Stewart's novels are tinged with a bit of magic, and in most of them, she chooses to give her characters rather romantic names (Annabel, Connor, Crystal). On the surface, it's a deliciously wonderful story of deception, but not all is as it appears.The Ivy Tree is an emotionally-charged novel; and though Stewart doesn't do very much in terms of character development, this book contains the right amount of romance, danger, suspense, and fantasy, with a little bit of Roman history sprinkled in. Stewart also does a great job of unfolding the mystery, such as there is, choosing not to give it all away until it's almost too late. This is one of those stories where it isn't until after you've learned the solution that you go back and think, \\"now why didn't I figure that out?\\" And then you realize that all the clues were there all along. I'm very glad that Mary Stewart's novels have been re-released; another of her novels,Thornyhold, is on my TBR pile."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"One of the best of thrillers told in the deceptively simple style of Mary Stewart, who holds a Master's Degree in English. Her prose is peppered with figures of speech, sometimes more than three a page, drawn from a seemingly inexhaustible well of creativity:\\"The long flushed clouds of sunset had darkened and grown cool. Below them the sky lay still and clear, for a few moments rinsed to a pale eggshell green, fragile as blown glass. The dusk leaned down slowly, as soft as a bird coming in to brood. Later, there would be a moon.\\"The characters are so well drawn you'll remember them for a long time, from the impudent cook to the manipulative grandfather, to the ominously attractive Irishman, through to the smart, fetching (and grasping?) heroine. With a plot to simply marvel over.Who, having read a Mary Stewart book, has not used (in modern times) Google-earth to examine the locations she so evocatively describes.I note an earlier reviewer was not impressed by this book, praising instead \\"Madam will you Talk?\\" and \\"The Moon-spinners\\". Stewart rarely stumbles, but the former is poor and the latter average (and what an appalling film which mauled Stewart's story). Almost every other Stewart book is far superior to these two, the top of the tree being the \\"Ivy Tree\\", \\"Nine Coaches Waiting\\" and \\"Airs above the Ground\\" in no particular order. Not to forget \\"Wildfire at Midnight\\" and \\"This Rough Magic. And many others.A unique story-teller."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"Mary Stewart's books are a well-written blend of romance and suspense in a style that leans toward the literary. Although the romance element in The Ivy Tree is weak -- there were no moments where I felt even the slightest spark -- the suspense is strong and the writing is lovely.Stewart's trademark style is to include a lot of passages that give descriptive detail of the landscape and setting. So while this may make her books feel a little \\"slow\\" to those who like the spare, fast-paced style of more contemporary writers, it makes her books very evocative. She creates a strong mood and the reader becomes immersed in it.In The Ivy Tree we meet Mary Grey, a young Canadian woman who has moved to England, and who shortly thereafter agrees to impersonate an English heiress of her same age, who has been missing for eight years and who she happens to look just like. For the first half of the book the reader (or this reader, anyway) has absolutely no clue how it is all going to turn out (which makes for a great suspense read), or who is really good or bad. None of the characters are really likeable: certainly not the gorgeous-but-greedy Con Winslow or his sister Lisa, who persuade Mary to impersonate the missing Annabel in order to secure Con's inheritance of his great-uncle's estate; not the great-uncle, whose irascibility and preoccupation with his own death and legacy is a bit overdone (and makes him the weakest character); and not even the heroine Mary, herself, who makes the reader doubt her integrity when she allows herself to become involved in the nefarious impersonation scheme.The tone of The Ivy Tree is moody and serious. There is none of the sparkling, witty dialogue of The Gabriel Hounds, for instance, although there are a few scenes that verge on being funny -- such as the one where Mary/Annabel is rescued from Con's unwanted amorous attentions by a horse who suddenly juts its head between them and blows half-chewed grass all over the front of Con's shirt. And even when Stewart does begin to peel back the layers and reveal what is really going on -- about 70 pages from the end -- she does it with skillful subtlely.For a fast, captivating and entertaining read this one is hard to beat; Stewart's writing is timeless (and nearly undated, except for the continual cigarette smoking) and she works some great twists and turns into the plot."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I have read all of Mary Stewart's books.

Forty years later, the intricate plot and wonderful characterizations still linger in my brain. The other gift is the love of poetry. Mary Stewart's novels drove me into poetry books. Annabelle and Adam are as fresh today as they were when I first picked this novel.If you are looking for a graphic sexy novel, this isn't for you. But, if you are looking to let the beauty of words delight you, pick up this book. This was Mary Stewart's finest. The Merlin books were more popular - but this was the best."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I recently read 'Nine Coaches Waiting' by Mary Stewart and loved it. I thought I'd try another one of her books and 'The Ivy Tree' sounded the most compelling to me.The story revolves around a case of mistaken identity. Annabel Winslow ran away eight years ago. Then one day a woman named Mary Grey comes to the area, Mary and Connor Winslow cross paths. Mary Grey looks so much like Annabel Winslow that her cousin Connor is convinced that they will be able to trick her ailing Grandfather and the rest of her family into believing she is Annabel. He enlists Mary's help in order to get his hands on Annabel's Grandfather's estate.Stewart writes the first half of the story in an intentionally ambiguous way. The characters that Stewart creates are not the most dynamic or sympathetic, remember this is a story of suspense. But once the author lets the reader in on the secret, the story begins to build with tension. The plot line grows more complicated and the events that unfold are exciting and surprising. I enjoyed the ending very much.I did enjoy this book but not as much as 'Nine Coaches Waiting'. Part of my problem was that I didn't care for the unsympathetic characters who were trying to manipulate the elderly Grandfather. In 'Nine Coaches Waiting' I identified with the main character and knew who I was pulling for. Stuart has a knack for making the reader leery to trust her characters.This was an exciting and suspenseful story and I will be reading more of Mary Stuart's work."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"At first I thought \\"The Ivy Tree\\" was a silly tale of contrived identity mix-ups.

This is one of her best mysteries."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"To my mind, this is one of Mary Stewart's best works, although inevitably it reflects the views and attitudes of the time in which it was written, as well as some very deep-seated provincial prejudice that might surprise the modern reader. The novel opens on a sunny, warm day in spring with our heroine contemplating the beautiful panorama of fields and farms from somewhere along Hadrian's Wall (not far from Newcastle, in the north of England). However, the peace of this idyllic scene is very quickly shattered by the arrival of a voluble and compelling young man with a secret obsession. The story moves along at first at a leisurely pace, as connections are made and the blocks of a complex deception are carefully stacked into place. There is a clear reference toBrat Farrarand that is recommendation enough for me. I have already bought a copy and will be reading it next.Lady Stewart deftly incorporates archaeological and geological elements (on which subjects she is particularly well versed), and the descriptions of the Northumberland countryside are lyrically exquisite, but is it really always that warm and sunny in June? Apparently not, as the story, gradually building in pace and intensity, mirrors the development of a weather front which eventually explodes into a devastating summer thunderstorm and, suddenly, everything happens at once. From this point onwards, the book becomes a page-turner and I'm finding that even now, on my fourth reading, I can barely put it down.Apart from the gripping plot, we are introduced to a group of very complex characters, by no means entirely likeable, in fact the whole reason why so many 'extreme' events take place is directly related to the strong personalities involved and the way that they keep clashing at frequent intervals. Stewart is a master at turning the tables on any given situation and, even though we may have our suspicions, we are never quite sure of how things really sit until all the cards have been played and the score tallied. And, as in real life, the happy ending often entails a lot of compromise and a willingness to take responsibility for our mistakes. Superior fiction and intelligent entertainment."},{"Title":"The Ivy Tree","review":"I read this book first as a teenager, and I have re-read it over the years at least 5 times.

C.V. Wedgwood wrote this book as a revaluation of her earlier work when she didn't have the access to many of Wentworth's papers. What we have here now is a more balanced view of Wentworth's life and his contributions to history. To many, he was known in history as Earl of Strafford although he held his earldom title for less then a year before his death at the hand of a man whom he so ably served. Some movie goers will remembered that title from that movie \\"Cromwell\\" where he make a brief appearance.The books read very easily and the author's writing skills proves to be superb. She can make the most mundane matter bit more interesting then it should be. The book appears to be well researched, you get a clear understanding of who Thomas Wentworth was and why he did what he did, as a ruthless servant of the crown and his desire for power and acknowledgement from his leige lord, Charles I. If he had survived to serve Charles I during the Civil War, he would have been a great service to him.Overall, a great book about a little known political figure who had an impact on English history."},{"Title":"Thomas Wentworth: First Earl of Strafford 1593-1641: A Revaluation","review":"I was reading this same book that I had borrowed.

I had seen the Elizabeth Taylor/Robert Taylor film in the 40s (saw it again recently; it was really bad) and of course I knew the Robin Hood legend. Scott, like Dickens, creates characters with depth - even his villains are not all evil - and the most heroic is the Jewess, Rebecca. Key to this story is the attempt of John to wrest the throne from his elder brother, King Richard the Lion-Hearted. (They are the offspring of Eleanor and Henry featured in The Lion in Winter). Saxon-bred Ivanhoe joins Richard's forces against his father's wishes. His father also messes up Ivanhoe's plans to wed his love, Rowena. There is lots of familial infighting. There are disguises, jousting tournaments, tensions between Saxons and Normans, Jewish prejudice, and the heroine is very nearly burned at the stake.

The deviation between Scott's times and language and current modes is considerable, but the original shows why the modifications for movies and/or mini-series produce plot warps that makes one wonder at times if the screenwriters were reading the actual source novel.If I were asked to do a relative review the three movies, I would do so for entertainment value, not as fidelity to Scott's original.

Two contrasting heroines, one a Saxon princess, the other a beautiful learned Jewish woman. Stick with it, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"If you enjoy tales of knights, castles, and kings, then you owe a huge debt to Sir Walter Scott. A literary superstar and pop culture phenom in his day, this master of the historical novel was instrumental in reviving the public's interest in medieval times. With the publication of Ivanhoe in 1820, Scott created the sword-and-chivalry genre that is now represented by countless books, movies, TV shows, and Renaissance fairs.The story of Ivanhoe takes place at the end of the 12th century. While his knights return from a failed crusade to the holy land, King Richard the Lionheart is held captive in Austria. In his absence, his brother Prince John rules England with an oppressive and avaricious hand. The Normans, having conquered England in 1066, continue to treat the native Saxons as second class citizens in their own lands. One powerful Saxon noble, Cedric of Rotherwood, maintains a defiant attitude toward the Norman oppressors. He has even disinherited his son, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, for serving the Norman King Richard. Cedric acts as guardian to Lady Rowena, a beautiful Saxon maiden, whom he hopes to marry off to a Saxon prince. Her heart, however, belongs to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. After an exciting tournament of jousting and melee, a group of Prince John's Norman minions led by Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a fierce Templar Knight, captures Cedric and his retinue for nefarious reasons and holds them captive in the Castle of Torquilstone. To free them from the clutches of the Normans, a ragtag band of fellow Saxons lead a desperate attack on the castle.This is a rich, deep story with dozens of characters and a complex plot. Even Robin Hood and Friar Tuck make supporting appearances. Also included in Cedric's party are two Jews, Isaac of York and his daughter Rebecca, a mysterious beauty who practices the healing arts. The undeserved persecution of the Jews is one of the main themes of the novel, and Scott shows a great deal of sympathy for their plight. Rebecca forms one corner of a love quadrangle with Ivanhoe, Rowena, and Brian de Bois-Guilbert, yet her devotion to the faith of her ancestors places an impenetrable wall between the Jewish maiden and the gentile man she loves.The main problem with Ivanhoe is that it peaks in the middle. The siege of Torquilstone is really the highlight of the book, but when it's over there's still half a novel left. The plot of act two has the potential for an equally high level of drama, but gets sidetracked with several chapters of long conversations that just seem to lead circuitously to foregone conclusions. The back half of the book is satisfying, but lacks the drama and excitement of the front. It all leads to an ending which is a bit anticlimactic. Nevertheless, even in its dullest moments, Scott's prose is a joy to read. Each sentence is an elegantly crafted exemplar of the English language, and perfectly captures the romantic atmosphere of the middle ages. With so much epic grandeur, a story like this runs the risk of getting bogged down by its own pompous gravity, but Scott never fails to inject a refreshing dose of humor into the proceedings.Though it dabbles in folklore and myth, this is no fantasy novel. The story of Ivanhoe is firmly grounded in English history. There are plenty of thick woods, clammy dungeons, and fog-shrowded bogs, but you won't find any dragons, sorcerers, or supernatural apparitions. Ivanhoe is a great read for anyone who enjoys historical novels or adventure fiction. Its epic story and remarkable characters are truly unforgettable."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"It is somewhat ironic that Sir Walter Scott's most famous novel is the one he wrote for - shall we say - \\"less than inspired\\" reasons. With his popularity as a poet on the wane, his Scottish-based works not reaching a particularly wide audience, and the costs of his lifestyle and a recent illness taking their toll on his income, he decided to write a novel that existed primarily for the purpose of entertaining its audience. Thus \\"Ivanhoe\\" was born, a story that deals with the age-old ideals of chivalry and courtly love, tournaments and adventure, virtuous knights and dastardly villains and damsels in distress. First published in 1918, it proved a success for its author, kick-starting a renewed interest in romanticism and medievalism.With very little regard for historical accuracy, \\"Ivanhoe\\" tells the story of the titular Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a knight who returns to England from King Richard's Holy Crusade, hoping to win back the love of both his estranged father and his childhood sweetheart Rowena. Things are in turmoil in England, with tensions between the Normans and the Saxons at an all-time high, particularly with ongoing attempts by Prince John to usurp his brother's throne. Ivanhoe's father Cedric is devoted to the Saxon cause, planning to wed his ward Rowena to a Saxon prince and thus cement the strength of his dynasty for future generations. Rowena is not quite so keen on this plan.Elsewhere, Isaac of York and his beautiful daughter Rebecca attempt to negotiate a way to safety: two Jews in the midst of a hostile Christian country, hated and despised by nearly everyone they come across. All of these characters, each with their own faith and nationality, will converge on a tournament hosted by Prince John, where three villains have their own designs on the individuals present there, their motivations based in greed, ambition, and lust. What follows is an unashamedly dramatic story of kidnappings, sieges, swordfights, jousts, disguises, subterfuge, and a witch trial to cap it all off. Oh, and Robin Hood is in there too. For instant awesome, just add the man in the hood.But perhaps the most extraordinary thing about \\"Ivanhoe\\" is its protagonist. That is, he's out-of-action for most of the book, either unconscious or mortally wounded. In lieu of his input, the action lies mainly with the secondary cast of characters, all of whom are infinitely more interesting than our indisposed hero. Of particular interest to readers is Rebecca of York, the brave Jewess who goes toe-to-toe with the evil Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who desires her for her beauty and spirit. The their interactions far surpass anything else in the novel when it comes to tension and character interaction, and it is Rebecca who goes through the greatest ordeal, gets the best lines, and remains the most memorable figure in the story. For many, Rebecca is the true heroine of \\"Ivanhoe\\", and even Scott himself commented on his audiences' disappointment that she is passed over in favour of Rowena when it comes to who Ivanhoe eventually marries. (In fact, William Thackeray Makepeace, author ofVanity Fair, was so disappointed with this resolution, that he wrote his very own fan-fiction in order to amend the situation. Google \\"Rowena and Rebecca\\" for his preferred conclusion to the tale).However, sometimes a bittersweet ending is more striking than a happy one. As Scott points out in his introduction, a marriage between a Christian and a Jew would have been unthinkable by medieval standards, and I'm grateful that Rebecca is allowed to remain true to her faith and integrity. At the time of publication, the portrayal of Jewish characters in popular literature were still largely stereotypes and caricatures, and it is a rare thing that *any* female character be allowed to keep her independence and find fulfillment in life outside of marriage, as she states: \\"among our people, since the time of Abraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the sick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will Rebecca be numbered.\\"In terms of the writing, some readers might find it difficult to wade through the dense prose. Rather likeTreasure IslandandMoby Dick, this book has a reputation as a rollicking adventure, and like those others, the reader might be caught by surprise when the pacing and content of the tale ends up being rather sluggish - at least at first. I say without exaggeration that at the introduction of each new character, an entire page is devoted to describing their clothing in minute detail. Scott is also not adverse to using deus ex machina or contrived coincidences to get his characters where they need to go, and ends with a rather bizarre anti-climax.In many ways, the value of \\"Ivanhoe\\" is not in the story itself, but on the impact it made to literature. Its publication increased interest in Romanticism and Medievalism, as well as starting a new wave of historical fiction. On the legends of Robin Hood it also made its mark: for the first time Robin Hood was explicitly linked to the name \\"Locksley\\", used here as his pseudonym, though from this point on is considered (almost without exception) to be the name of his home-village. Scott also popularized the use of the Norman/Saxon conflict as a backdrop to the Robin stories, even though the two factions were fairly well integrated by this time, and the time-frame of Robin existing at the time of King Richard (rather than the ancient ballads that place him during the reign of some unspecified King Edward) was more or less solidified by this story.Plenty of other anachronisms are littered throughout the story, of which Scott was well aware, stating in his introduction that \\"it is extremely probable that I may have confused the manners of two or three centuries,\\" but comforting himself with the assumption that \\"errors of this kind will escape the general class of readers.\\" Basically, he was more interested in telling a good story than rendering it at all accurate. And this he does. Despite some of the plot contrivances, there is seldom a dull moment, and although the characters fall across a black and white spectrum in terms of their affiliation to good or evil, they are painted in primary colors when it comes to their memorability."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This classic novel includes all the archetypes of a medieval story: knights, castles, tournaments, battles, damsels in distress, etc. Amusingly _ with debatable concern for historical accuracy _ it also includes famous characters such as Richard the Lion Heart, Prince John, Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.Strangely, narration is not linear and often the action is rewound to look at the same events a second time, from the perspective of different characters. This makes things a bit difficult to follow, especially in audio format. There is also a surprising emphasis on Isaac and Rebecca, of Jewish faith, who appear practically more prominently than Ivanhoe himself. It must be mentioned as well that there is a strong anti-Catholic bias, the Church, its priests and its rituals being somewhat ridiculed throughout the work.Still the result is entertaining and those unfamiliar with this famous work will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This a famous classic, set in King Richard the Lionhearted's time, more specifically, when Prince John was trying to take over rule of England. Robin Hood is also from the time period. Ivanhoe was a pretty good book, full of adventure, intrigue, and romance. Ivanhoe is a knight who traveled with King Richard on the Crusades after being banished by his father for trying to marry against his father's wishes, and in Scott's novel, he returns to England to try and find Lady Rowena, who he wants to marry. Robin Hood is present in this book, known by many names (Locksley, the Outlaw) and only at the end is he called Robin Hood. I did enjoy this book very much, but at that time people treated Jews horribly. Some priests accuse Rebecca, a Jewess, of being a sorceress. She is very good at healing, but she has only used it for good by healing wounded Christians. It was so unfair! And her father, Isaac of York, has to suffer so much throughout the book. It made me really mad at the hypocrisy of Christians. They always say that their religion is forgiving, but then they want to burn Rebecca at the stake. Even the good characters (Robin Hood, Ivanhoe, King Richard) are scornful of Jews. It's so frustrating. But it was still a good book, though slightly overwritten, as 19th century books are apt to be. Ivanhoe highlights a tumultuous relationship between the Normans and the Saxons, something not present in any other historical record of the time period (so it's probably not accurate.) In the 1939 film about Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn), much was drawn from Ivanhoe.*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"During the recently contested NBA playoffs, one of the television networks advertised their coverage of this seemingly interminable series of games with the catchy phrase: \\"A Champion Will Rise\\". It was a brilliant marketing ploy, for both my wife, who is much more of a basketball fan than I, and I used this phrase often to provide prelude to the next game or series. It happened that I was reading Sir Walter Scott's wonderful novel, \\"Ivanhoe\\" during all of this. Imagine my surprise to discover that the marketing geniuses of 21st Century television were merely copying the lilting prose of Sir Walter Scott. For it was he who brought this phrase first to the attention of the literary world now nearly two hundred years ago in this highly and rightly esteemed novel.The novel is set in 12th Century England, a nation still in the process of recovering from the Norman conquest and the dislocation of the Crusades to the Holy Land. The ethnic conflict between Norman and Saxon is a major aspect of the novel, which is not portrayed as clearly in the excellent Hollywood movie that was based on the novel and which starred Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe and a young and stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as Rebecca of York. The historical setting is important. But far more important is Scott's illustrious portrayal of the very human aspects of nobility and integrity that he imputes to his characters. The asinine atheist Samuel Clemens, who used the pen name, Mark Twain, charges Sir Walter Scott with advancing these ideas of nobility and integrity, wrapped up in the concept of chivalry, into some wicked brew that forever tarnished the Old South, caused the Civil War(I kid you not. You can look it up.), and overturned, in the popular mind, the wonderful \\"blessings\\" of the French Revolution. Well, Sammy, the French Revolution was really not all it was cracked up to be. And the slaughter of innocent men, women, and children that was the most fundamental characteristic of the revolutionary time you hold so dear would have been disdained by sober observers of later years and prevented, with extreme vigor, by the chivalrous characters who populated Scott's novel.To these characters, we now must turn. The title character is Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Knight of Saxon descent, who follows King Richard, the Lion-heart, to Palestine on his mad and glorious Crusade. By so doing, Wilfred alienates himself from his father, Cedric. King Richard, you see, was of Norman descent, and the aforementioned ethnic rivalry between Saxon and Norman caused Ivanhoe's Saxon father, Cedric to dispossess his son, Ivanhoe, for having had the temerity to engage in what Cedric held to be Richard's Norman foolishness. King Richard is also a major character in the novel. He is portrayed as more an adventurer than a sovereign. And this is perhaps an accurate depiction when we examine carefully the historical record. The jester, Wamba, another lowly Saxon, provides excellent comic relief and, when the situation calls for it, amazing courage and integrity. But perhaps the greatest character of the novel is Rebecca of York, the amazingly beautiful Jewish damsel who is as spiritually appealing as she was physically beautiful, if not more. In fact, the heading of this review is taken from a speech Scott imputes to Rebecca. She is to be tried for witchcraft by the sinister and woefully bigoted Grand Master of the Knights Templar, with the implicit idea that she is to be burned at the stake when the show trial finds her guilty. But Rebecca refuses all attempted bribes to renounce her faith, her character, her selfless actions, and her heritage. She holds rather, finally, that a champion will rise to defend her honor in trial by combat. One does. And his name is Ivanhoe. It is truly delicious.In all of this Rebecca of York emerges as perhaps the most unforgettable character in literature. I would have previously assigned this title to Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean. But the centricity of Rebecca's honor and integrity gives the great lie to the silly pretensions of Samuel Clemens, mentioned above. Scott's novel is first and foremost, I believe, about these wonderful human characteristics. And his characterization of the Jewish damsel, Rebecca of York, best exemplifies these fine principles. As we were watching the movie based on this novel, my wife looked over at me and said, effectively:\\"Modern Americans do not behave or even think like these characters any more. Most would not even understand.\\"Her statement is true. And more's the pity. In this novel, Scott introduced the literary world to the legend of Robin Hood, the Prince of Thieves, to the glory that was Merry England when she was unified under One Faith but still divided by ethnic, and other, prejudices, and to so much more. We all need to read Scott's wonderful and timeless novel, and to reflect seriously on the characteristics so beautifully portrayed therein.

The fun starts with a tournament that reads just like the tournament in Disney's 1973 Robin Hood, and ends with the blurb on the back cover of my Penguin classic, \\"The brave and noble knight Ivanhoe returns from the Crusades to claim his bride, Princess Rowena. But King John has usurped the English crown from his absent brother, Richard the Lionheart. Before Ivanhoe can wed his love, he must first help Richard regain the throne...\\" The fun in the blurb, of course, is recognized after reading the book - specifically, where does Ivanhoe help Richard do anything?Marketing license aside, Ivanhoe has some great moments. It is, however, largely a loosely connected collection of anecdotes covering a large array of characters rather than anything as focused as Ivanhoe helping Richard regain his throne. In fact, I'd say competitive bigotry - Christian/Jew, Norman/Saxon, Church/State - and crossing those boundaries, is a more telling theme and plot narrative than Richard vs John for the throne of England.The loose-connectedness of Ivanhoe makes it, at times, a pain to read, and there is a lot of context setting, probably 19th Century politics in nature, that causes the book to drag. The arcane language also demands more patience and concentration than novels from a similar period - that may, however, be more a function of the fact that I read Dumas and Hugo in translation, rather than in the original.All said, I enjoyed Ivanhoe for the most part. The conflict - physical and ideological - is interesting, although the book carries a fair amount of baggage in (lack of) plot cohesion and contextual filler."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"My version of this book was abridged for a middle-school audience, and published in 1936 as part of the Heath Golden Key Series. That said, it was still 464 pages long and written in early 19th-century English purporting to be Middle English. What that means is that it sometimes takes Scott three paragraphs or longer to have a character say \\"No thank you, I'm not hungry.\\"Ivanhoe is a stupendous work of historical fiction, mixing the best romantic chivalrous pursuits of knights, fair maidens, and swashbuckling peasants and outlaws with double-crosses and villainy straight out of an Errol Flynn movie (until you realize that Hollywood in all likelihood stole their greatest plot devices from Scott and the rest of the canon). It's a love story full of virtue, friendship, trust in combat, ambition, and, most unsettling, anti-semitism. In fact, it was very hard for me to get past the rampant anti-semitism in the writing and dialogue, even between the good guys (Richard the Lion-hearted, Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe).The story gets a little weak towards the conclusion -- the fate of Athelstane comes to mind, as does the unsatisfying end to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar -- but that's okay. It's a page-turner of a classic, full of funny-named helpers (Gurth, Wamba), knights in disguise, and virtuous women.Recommended."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is an 1820 historical novel by Sir Walter Scott. In 1194, in the time of King Richard the Lionheart, Prince John and Robin Hood, disinherited Saxon knight Wilfred of Ivanhoe returns from the Crusades and seeks revenge against his Norman nemesis Brian de Bois-Guilbert.But the story is so much more than that. Ivanhoe features an ensemble cast with perhaps a dozen noteworthy characters, and of these, Ivanhoe himself plays a supporting role at best, as he's absent from massive portions of the novel. Yet it is he who ties all the characters together.The modern reader may be put off by a number of things, particularly Scott's tendency to devote entire pages to the descriptions of his characters' garb, and the unnaturally expository dialogue he puts in their mouths. But Ivanhoe is nearly two hundred years old, and some of these things we just have to get over. More just criticisms might target the book's sometimes too leisurely pace, the somewhat anticlimactic conclusion, and the unquestionably contrived and hackneyed, silly and pointless return of Athelstane, which is so literarily amateurish that Scott felt compelled to insert a footnote to acknowledge this fact, but that he was doing it anyway.Ivanhoe is a three-act quest/reward adventure, and in spite of the book's more plodding characteristics, Scott usually keeps the pages turning in an impressive manner. His writing is clever as well as verbose, and quite frankly, there are a lot of exciting things going on here.As far as the narrative, Scott sometimes has difficulty juggling all his characters, as he has to jump around chronologically, impeding the novel's flow. Neither does Scott feel compelled to wrap up all his many plot threads; some prominent characters, notably Prince John, are dropped by the wayside as the novel progresses and then only mentioned in passing later on.Ivanhoe features an astounding degree of anti-Semitism from virtually every character, whether hero or villain (in addition to a historically accurate depiction of medieval persecution, this is also a political commentary contemporary to Scott's day, as England was moving toward the emancipation of its Jews). Yet for the point Scott is trying to make, Isaac of York fits very well the stereotype of the miserly Jew. But his daughter Rebecca is the noblest character in the novel.Of similar historicity is the frustrating level of ignorance and superstition displayed by so many characters - it makes something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail's witch/duck scene seem hardly a bit farcical. And saddest of all is the time's horrendous misunderstanding of Christianity - the finding of virtue in unvirtuous acts, particularly the slaughter of any and all unbelievers.While Scott took a number of liberties with other historical matters in Ivanhoe, no offense is egregious, and because of the degree of detail Scott provides, most everything is believable enough to the uninitiated. Ivanhoe is also noteworthy for its lasting influence. It sparked a renewed interest in the Middle Ages. And every single Robin Hood tale or film I've ever seen has used it in some way as source material, as have a large number of other medieval and fantasy stories.In spite of its flaws, Ivanhoe remains a pillar of medieval historical fiction, and is a must for fans of that period."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Scott's Ivanhoe ranks among my favorite books. Although the language can be a bit difficult(and sometimes humorous), the story and characters make Ivanhoe well worth the trouble. This is a fast moving and thoroughly enjoyable old-fashioned adventure story."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Sir Walter Scott demonstrates his storytelling prowess in this epic novel of intrigue, love, chivalry, and loyalty. Ivanhoe is a fast-paced, well-crafted tale in which the reader is also educated on medievalism, though it is not necessarily the author's intent. Oddly, the title character receives only about fifty pages of coverage, while the remainder of the book is dedicated to the many colorful characters that make this story so compelling.Scott blends history with fiction and occassionally makes some gaffes, but by and large his blending is successful. At one point he has one character explainhow his grandfather had fought at Hastings (1066). Since the time frame of this novel is circa 1197, it is nigh impossible, especially given life expectancies of the age, that a grandfather had been living 130 years prior. He also stereotypes Jews as moneylenders and lovers of naught but profit, as if he has little understanding of Judiaism. Finally, cotts ending is very fast-paced, almost too fast. The reader comes away with a sense that he really wanted to get the book finished.This particular edition has an introduction and conclusion by a Nancy Springer. She puts the book into context claiming the real hero of the story is Richard the Lion Heart and the real heroine is the Jewess, Rebecca. Scotts writing certainly gives Springer's conclusion credibility, but one could go further and say that the real heroes of the book is integrity and honor.This was my first exposure to Sir Walter Scott, and I'm not going to say I've become a fan. But the story remains worth reading as it fills in a gap between the two films \\"The Lion in Winter\\" and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\\""},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I can't help but feel that this book is a little bit overrated.To begin with, it is a sprawling mess. The title character appears in the book less than a half dozen other characters- Wamba the Jester, the Black Knight, Isaac the jew, Rebecca his daughter, and more- and except for two singular feats, is not that involved in the drama. The overriding themes of the book are many- from the specific situation in which Prince John attempts to usurp his brother Richard the Lionhearted's throne to the centuries long struggles between Normans and Saxons and Christianity and Judaism- and Sir Walter Scott bounces back and forth between each seemingly at random. The evolution of the plot appears to move along much like that of the 90's film \\"Slackers\\". We start with one set of characters only to abandon them once we meet another set of characters only to abandon them once we meet another set of characters, etc. It is entertaining at first, but loose ends begin to pile up and the randomness at which we follow characters (and the large number of them) begins to weigh the action down.Many flaws yes, but the book is not without its strengths. Scott's strengths are his set pieces, and in \\"Ivanhoe\\" we have several memorable ones. The Tournament of Knights which sets up the action for all that is to follow is the template by which all other medieval action is inspired. Fans of Disney's \\"Robin Hood\\" (a character who makes an appearance in this book) will recognize many similarities between the scene as described here and the one in the animated film. Also, the siege of the castle Torquilstone manages to unite the disparate threads for a brief while and provides some of the most exciting action of the novel.Without a doubt, \\"Ivanhoe\\" is classic medieval literature and clearly paints a picture of English life in the time of knights and Templars and rivalries over the throne. As a piece of literature, however, the book fails to achieve greatness and ultimately fails to live up to the hype. Worth the read, yes, but not the best thing you will ever read."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"If you have never read historical fiction before -- Sir Walter Scott is the author to start with. Ivanhoe is one of his most enjoyable works. Cynics may be too jaded for this noble story, but all others will come away impressed."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This may not be an easy read (okay, sometimes it was torture) but it's well worth the effort and time. The expected medieval themes are there--jousting, knights in shining armour, princesses in need of rescue, and fortified castles. But it's the unexpected that catches your attention--the plight of a Jewish moneylender and his attractive daughter, the raging antisemitism, the cruelty of the Dark Ages, and the surprising amount of humor in the novel. It's clear that this type of writing formed the basis for subsequent heroic adventures and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"As knights battle to the death, the fate of England hangs in the balance. This is a great tale involving the honorable absence of Richard, while in the Crusades, and the dishonorable presence of Prince John scheming for power.From the back:England is in turmoil-torn by fierce and bitter hatreds between Norman and Saxon. Rival claimants to the throne have plunged it into bloody civil war. Prince John-taking advantage of Richard's absence while fighting in the Crusades-plots to make himself crowned king. Richard returns and vows to take revenge on John.But he will need a courageous and able warrior at his side-a warrior like Wilfred of Ivanhoe.Disinherited by his father, disowned and dishonored, Wilfred allies himself with Richard. In many adventures he will battle knights in deadly tournaments, scale castle walls, be wounded, captured and rescued by the infamous Robin Hood, find true love with the fiery Rowena.In what has become Sir Walter Scott's most beloved and rousing adventure, Wilfred helps Richard I foil John's plot. More importantly, Wilfred of Ivanhoe reclaims his good name."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Depending on your tastes Ivanhoe could either be considered a favorite or despised. Make no mistake - for today's average reader \\"Ivanhoe\\" is an extremely difficult read. The language was considerd archaic 200 years ago. Also, the reader must have a fair amount of knowledge about the Middle Ages - if you have never heard of the battle of Hasting or why it is significant... this is defintely not the book for you!Personally, I found \\"Ivanhoe\\" to be both enjoyable and enlightening. While I do realize that Sir Walter Scott did make some historical errors - I found his despriction of \\"the Lists\\" to be informative.The quality of the plot for \\"Ivanhoe\\" can not be questioned. It has all of the elements for a great read... deceipt, honour, a love triangle, prejuidices, castle sieges and battles to death! Scott's mastery of detail (sometimes a little TOO mastered) engulfs you into the world of the 12th century.I especially enjoyed the involvement of Robin Hood, Richard The Lionheart and Prince John as main characters. Their historical involvement really helped to hold my interest.The treatment of Jews is an interesting development throughout \\"Ivanhoe\\". Despite all the characters treating people of the jewish faith as sub-human \\"Ivanhoes\\" the last three pages show the prejuidices can be overcome and people of different faiths should learn tolerance. This is suprising stuff for the perion in which Sir Walter Scott penned it!I found \\"Ivanhoe\\" to be very enjoyable - and at times a page-turner. The difficulty of the language was a challenge at times (and I am sure their are few plot points that I did miss), but as a whole I would suggest it to all readers who enjoy a bit of a challenge."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"It was fashionable during my school days (the 60s and 70s) to dismiss &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; as just another medieval romance replete with damsels in distress and their knights in shining armor. In retrospect, I think that was just a lazy excuse (certainly my own) to avoid wading through this rather lengthy, densely written historical novel. Take my advice, fellow reader: wade through. It is well worth your time and energy.The story, of course, is set in Merry Ole England, with Richard the Lion-Hearted on the throne and his malevolent kid brother (the future King John of Magna Carta fame) plotting to take it away from him. From the history we do know of this period, King Richard rarely spent any time in England, much preferring to immerse himself in the Crusades or any other errant knight adventure which struck his fancy. In this setting we find the Saxon-bred Ivanhoe, who against his father's wishes joined Richard in the Middle East to fight the &quot;Infidel.&quot; Ultimately, Ivanhoe finds his way back into his father's good graces, and I suppose at one level Sir Walter Scott's Classic is about their estrangement and final rapprochement. But &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is so much more.Perhaps the over-arching theme to &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is the nascent reconciliation between the proud, yet vanquished, Saxons and their equally proud, conquering French Norman overlords. The story takes place about a century after the Norman Conquest, and it took a great many more years than that before the antagonists successfully blended together to form the greatest nation on earth. Equally great was the emergence of the language we now call English, which is in large measure a synthesis of the Saxon and Norman tongues. But at the time of &quot;Ivanhoe,&quot; two distinct languages exist (and Scott never allows us to forget this essential fact), and the friction between the two races is palpable throughout.&quot;Ivanhoe&quot; can be divided into three major scenes: the Passage of Arms at Ashby, the siege of Torquilstone, and the final contest at Templestowe for the life of the Jewish heroine, Rebecca. The entire novel can be viewed as three successive peaks separated by long, undulating transitional valleys. I hesitate to voice any criticism of Scott's greatest work, but maybe a brave editor would have made him shorten his transitions a bit. But no matter. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; at its worst is still better than most, and the rather lengthy transitional passages slow the pace down for the players to utter Shakespearean-like commentary on the world as it is.&quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is an enduring classic for so many reasons. For one thing, Sir Walter Scott is simply incapable of rendering one-dimensional characters. Even the evil triumvirate of Front-de-Boeuf, Maurice de Bracy and Bois-Guilbert is rendered (at times) in a sympathetic light. By the time they are besieged at the Castle of Torquilstone, the reader is salivating over the prospect of them dangling over the battlements, with or without their armor on. And, yet, as the stranglehold tightens, Scott has them utter some of the funniest and wittiest lines in the entire novel.No review of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; can be made without some reference to the stunningly beautiful Jewess, Rebecca-- one of the most honorable and sympathetic characters in all of literature. Whether she is hounded by libidinous knights, or being held for trial as a witch, Rebecca maintains her calm dignity throughout. She is unswervingly devoted to her faith from beginning to end, which is no mean feat for a Jew in 12th Century England. And there is simply no pretense to the woman. She is who she is, and she wishes us all to accept her for nothing more, nothing less.The same cannot be said for many of the other central characters in &quot;Ivanhoe.&quot; No doubt they are all heroic, but they all act heroically behind a mask. King Richard, Robin Hood, and even Ivanhoe are all in disguise, and that's what strikes this reader as so odd! Now, I understand &quot;disguise&quot; as a narrative plot device, but methinks there's way too many disguises floating around in &quot;Ivanhoe.&quot; So, what does Sir Walter Scott really have in mind?Well, here's one idea that harks back to a theme I touched upon earlier on. The story of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is the struggle between Saxon (rights) and Norman (prerogatives). Their eventual assimilation occurs centuries after the events in Scott's Classic, but the seeds of their reconciliation are thoroughly sown in &quot;Ivanhoe.&quot; By having his central characters assume disguises, Sir Walter Scott has effaced (at least symbolically) all Saxon and Norman identities to aid in their eventual amalgamation as one great race.All of which leads, perhaps, to a grander theme that Scott had in mind when he penned &quot;Ivanhoe.&quot; His very first scene begins with the court jester, Wamba, seated on an ancient Druidical monumnet, and lecturing his companion, Gurth, on the proper use of Saxon and Norman words. The setting reminds us of just how old the Island Kingdom really is, and that the history of England is, indeed, the history of invasion. The Norman Conquest of 1066 displaced Harold and his Saxon vassals, but don't feel too sorry for the Saxons. They had their run, defeating various indigenous tribes of the 7th-9th Centuries, not to mention fighting off one Viking raid after another. And, of course, the Romans crossed the Channel as far back as Julius Caesar whose initial inroads were eventually consolidated by the Emperor, Claudius, who defeated the Celtic Queen Boadicia.Now, my history may miss its mark a bit, but I think you get the point. What, precisely, is an Englishman? Norman, Saxon, Viking, Roman, Celtic, Pict, Druid? I think the Scottish-born Walter Scott, whose native language was not English, thought very deeply about that question, and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is his eloquent, meditative response."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This the first,the classic, novelized medieval Romance. Written the same year as Queen Victoria's birth, it gave us much of our modern conception of medieval tournaments, King John, Robin Hood, Richard Coeur de Lion, etc. (I realize I stretch things a bit by calling Sir Walter Scott \\"modern,\\" but I speak only by comparison with medieval ballads, King Arthur, Robin Hood legends, etc.)If you've ever thought \\"ok, that was cool\\" as Robin Hood split an arrow with another arrow at the Great Archery Tournament, or wondered where the idea of Robin Hood as the defender of Saxon yeomanry against the Villainous John of Anjou, Regent for the absent Richard, got its start -- it started here.The book isn't all about Robin Hood, though; mostly, it's about Knights and Tournaments and foul Norman oppressors. There's a tournament, a trial by combat, a castle seige, a little bit of anti-racist message (in the person of a beautiful and noble-in-spirit Jewish beauty unjustly maligned and accused of witchcraft), multiple anonymous knights (including a Black Knight!), and in short all the important highlights of medieval ballads, conveniently arranged in the format of a historical novel.Scott's historiography is a little off (for example, at one point a character pretends to be a Franciscan monk, when the order wasn't founded until about twenty years after the novel's action takes place), but Scott does make a real effort to avoid most anachronisms (moreso than many writers of \\"historical novels\\"). This kindle edition also includes Scott's introduction and notes, which show that he put real effort into basing many of the events in his book on excerpts from period ballads and tales (rearranging them, of course, as per his authorial prerogative).This one's a classic for a reason. Entertaining, archetypal, and with massive influence on everything since, from Howard Pyle to Errol Flynn to video games like \\"Defender of the Crown.\\" The prose style might be a little offputting to more sensitive modern readers -- it was, after all, written the same year that Queen Victoria was born, and is a little dry in some places and a little overblown in others -- but if you can get past that, you'll find a classic. Enjoy.[If the reader wishes more in this vein, I'd point him, as mentioned above, to Howard Pyle's _The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood_, also available for free online; make sure to find the version with Pyle's original illustrations]."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"\\"Ivanhoe\\" is Romanticism writ large. The author's style is elegant and lucid - often very funny - and the interpolated poetry is fine, too. Dialogue, action and description are all well handled. Scott established the historical novel as a popular literary form, paving the way for Dumas, Fennimore Cooper and countless others since. Fennimore Cooper in particular, was directly inspired to take up writing by Scott's enormous success.Although he has been criticized for historical errors, Scott includes a wealth of authentic detail and he certainly stays far closer to the truth than Hollywood ever does. (Here's a thought; why have we become ever more demanding of historical accuracy in our authors, yet able to accept the most glaring errors on the cinema screen?) The sensibilities reflected in this book are mostly those of a conservative gentleman and scholar of the nineteenth, rather than twelfth, century. In particular, the depiction of the Jewish characters and the master-servant relationships tells us as much about nineteenth century Britain as about medieval England. Nonetheless, it is in many ways a convincing portrait of life in the Middle Ages. Having lived in what is now the industrial wastescape of South Yorkshire (you saw it in \\"The Full Monty\\"), where much of the action of \\"Ivanhoe\\" takes place, I enjoyed Scott's vision of a still green and pleasant Merry England where deer roamed vast forests and knights went in search of adventure.The varied cast of characters is one of the novel's great strengths. The reader cares what happens to them because they are so real. Oddly, the eponymous hero plays a minor, albeit crucial, role in the tale and the putative heroine Rowena is overshadowed by the more interesting Rebecca.Scott is best known however, for his storytelling skills. \\"Ivanhoe\\" has a terrific plot. At times, credibility is stretched a little too far for my taste. For example, characters rather too easily adopt disguises that fool even those who know them intimately. But you keep wanting to know what happens next, which is the essence of good plotting, and the story is blessedly free of the incredible coincidences that plagued eighteenth and nineteenth century English novels.I think \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" (despite what I call \`the curse of the coincidence'), \\"Vanity Fair\\" and especially, \\"The Cloister and the Hearth\\" are all better examples of historical novels by nineteenth century British writers, but \\"Ivanhoe\\" is still well worth reading. Most editions include Scott's introduction, spoof 'dedication' and copious notes. Modern readers may be tempted to skip these. They are well written but not essential to enjoying the novel itself. BEWARE; the introduction and the notes include spoilers. My advice is to read the novel first and then, if you enjoyed it, read those other sections. They do give some insight into the book's genesis."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This was the first Sir Walter Scott novel I'd ever read, and I was hooked! The plot is epic, the characters are iconic and vibrant, and the details are lush and engrossing. Scott is so entertaining that the book often veers into a sort of sensationalist &#34;pulp fiction&#34; kind of vibe, but that's part of the charm. The real genius of this story is the characters--they are all intelligently constructed and very likeable. The romantic heroes have foibles and the villans have dignity, and best of all, there are two major female leads with lots of personality and volition. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I once read an article saying that it took a reader five and a half months to finish Ivanhoe. Intrigued by the proposition, I bought this book purely to see how long it would take me to lose consciousness in its wake.If sedating the reader was its goal, Ivanhoe failed miserably. Scott's writing is refreshingly witty and it shouldn't take the reader more than three pages to become fully acclimated with the slightly archaic dialogue. Once you do, the story unfolds into a truly majestic tale of gallantry and adventure, intermixed with more than a little tomfoolery. The descriptions, particularly those of raging battles and impassioned vitriol, are vivid, and place you squarely in the middle of thirteenth century Norman-Saxon England. Additionally, the subtle and sometimes startling methods that Scott chooses to introduce his (often incognito) main characters are fantastic.Critics have commented on the historical inaccuracies of the novel (the name Rowena was, apparently, anachronistic), but these minutiae are so completely blind-sided by the plot that they hardly warrant mention. If you don't normally read this kind of thing and are expecting a beleaguered, boring historical romance filled with stuffy and uptight characters, you will be very pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Overall, I liked this classical tale, which included knights, damsels in distress, chivalry, and adventure! There were a few surprise characters in the story that I never realized were part of Ivanhoe. You'll have to read the book to figure out who I'm talking about, but you'll immediately recognize them.I will admit the book was a little hard to read at times as the author would go into elaborate descriptions of what people were wearing, and there were a lot of old English words and Latin phrases that I didn't know."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Being a mediaevalist by trade I expected &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; to press all the wrong buttons - ludicrous inaccuracies, two-dimensional stock characters and a Disney-esque storyline. So I was pleasantly suprised when I found myself physically incapable of putting it down.This sudden love affair with &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (and, as a result, all Walter Scott's historical novels) is even more surprising given the fact that it is indeed inaccurate, somewhat two-dimensional and very predictable. Yet, it is partly these &quot;faults&quot; that inspired me to enjoy it so much. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; embodies all my favourite childhood misconceptions about the Middle Ages, most of which have now been destroyed, or at least suppressed, by long years of studying the period. But it is still impossible to resist the inherent charm invested in such veritable floods of buckling swash - knights, tournaments, ladies, dark forests, honest outlaws, sieges, hermits, swine-herders, jesters, evil Kings and crusades.The story arc is incredibly simple: Ivanhoe, banished by his father, Cedric, for falling in love with Cedric's ward Rowena, wins the patronage and friendship of Richard the Lion-Heart on Crusade in the Holy Land. On his return to England, eager to reclaim both his birthright and his fair lady, he is drawn into the struggle between honourable ole' Richard I and his scheming, moustache-twiddling brother John (*boo!*). Then follows tournaments, sieges, intrigues, kidnaps, a mysterious Black Knight in disgiuse, an alliance with Robin Hood (and his merry men, of course), a witch trial and some evil villains (all moustache-twiddling). Add to this a not-so-ascetic hermit with an incredible appetite for pies, a beautiful and sincere Jewess, Rebecca, her rich father Issac and a bundle of memorable Saxon &quot;yeoman&quot; and the stage is set.Scott eagerly caricatures the mediaeval period, with a self-reflexive understanding of his sources and historical reality. The framing &quot;Dedicatory Epistle&quot; to one Dr. Dry-as-dust alerts the reader to his purpose, which is not to relate historical fact but to create historical myth. This he does with a good helping of satircal humour and deprecation, evoking a parody of both of the mediaeval period and the Romantic period.Yet, the parody is sincere. Scott understands the main attractions of mediaeval life and yokes them to his purpose, writing a romance which is both exciting and self-critical. Every character and actions is memorable in its ability to overwrite, and reinvoke, ideals already blooming in our minds.When Scott's London publisher first received the proofs for the first Volume of the novel, he apparently took them to read on his journey from Edinburgh to York. He wrote to his Scottish associate the next day exlaiming: &quot;I read it so anxiously that I did not take any exercise or physical relief at the stages. It is a most extroadinary book.&quot; I cannot recommend it higher than that."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"It took me three separate attempts, over the course of my life, to successfully read Ivanhoe. The first two times, I didn't make it past page 50. This third time, I almost stopped again... but, resolutely, I continued on, because I'd heard so many good things about the novel over the years that I knew there'd be reward waiting, just around the corner.The reason why I had stopped reading the book two-and-a-half times was because the language and syntax seem so very heavy and dense to the modern reader. And, this isn't just a \\"19th Century British\\" thing (though that does play a part), but, I believe, a Walter Scott thing. He has a style that seems a little impenetrable, at first. But now, having read the work to completion, I am happy to report the following: that, over time, the reader's \\"ear\\" becomes accustomed to Scott's storytelling; and that, the journey, for all of its initial difficulties and obstacles, is absolutely worth it. As advertised, Ivanhoe is a great novel.Set during the reign of Richard the Lion-Hearted, who is absent from an England suffering under the stewardship of the much-maligned Prince John, Ivanhoe is the tale of Saxon partisans chaffing under the yoke of their Norman masters, and of the romances and battles which result. Wilfred of Ivanhoe, son of a Saxon noble, recently returned from service in the Crusades, becomes embroiled against Norman knights during a tournament, and risks the loss of his lands and lady-love when he is gravely injured and she, kidnapped.While this happens, we also get to meet a host of widely-diverse characters, some of which are already familiar, such as Robin Hood, Friar Tuck and Allan-a-Dale, and some of whom are new, but wonderful heroes in their own rights, such as Cedric the Saxon Thane, Wamba the Jester, and Issac, the Jewish money-lender and his daughter, Rebecca. To balance such a scope of heroes, we of course need great villains, and Ivanhoe does not disappoint, rounding up (among others) the infamous Prince John and the Order of the Knights Templar.The plot is a wonderful bit of romantic action, taking us from a tournament, to an attack on a castle, to a trial-by-combat, etc. It's everything you'd expect from a story set in the Robin Hood genre.I've heard some complaint of Scott's shoddy historical details--that there are anachronisms aplenty to be found throughtout the work. As a one-time history major, I suppose that I'm the sort who ought to care about such things? And yet, I believe that the virtues of this novel, including its exciting plot, complicated characterizations (especially that of the Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert) and engrossing narrative voice make any substantial attention given to these temporal flaws a little off-point. We admit that Ivanhoe is not a solid history textbook; it was never meant to be one, and if you're looking to learn the history of the time, you should find something a bit further removed from the fiction aisle. What it was meant to be was an exciting, entertaining, enjoyable novel, and in that, Ivanhoe succeeds admirably.Beyond just being entertaining, Ivanhoe is also a fairly sophisticated social statement, through Scott's representation of his Jewish heroes, Issac and Rebecca. Rebecca, especially, who never acts as anything less than a saint in the work, and yet is the only hero denied a happily-ever-after ending (an interesting bit of dischord at the end), points up the hypocrisy of religious intolerance rather well. I've heard that there are lots of readers who had hoped that Ivanhoe would wind up marrying Rebecca, instead of the Christian, but rather bland, lady-fair, Rowena. I am of that number, and I suspect that Scott planned it out that way.In summary, I'm awfully glad that I managed to make myself press on, this third time around. Ivanhoe is a novel that might demand a little patience and perserverance from the modern reader, but stands ready to amply reward the efforts made. I plan on investigating Scott further in the future, and hopefully soon, before my ear once again dulls to his older, but rich and worthy voice.A true classic and a wonderful read.

King Richard lies in prison in Europe on his voyage from the Crusades.

Together with the help of a mysterious Black Knight, they fight members of the Knight's Templars, rescue the fair Rowena, whom Ivanhoe has fallen in love with, and perform other feats of heroism.This is a great adventure novel: a disinherited knight who is forced to fight several times when the odds are against him in order to win his love. Many characters are featured as well, including Robin Hood and his merry men. Any reader with an interest in chivalry, medieval times, English royal history, or good ol' fight scenes will appreciate this novel.The book does feature a character worth mentioning: Isaac is an elderly Jewish man, and he has a daughter, Rebecca, who falls in love with Ivanhoe. Though the anti-Semitic rhetoric by some of the villainous characters runs pretty thick at times (this does take place during the Crusades, after all), it's pretty clear the author despises such treatment. In actuality, Rebecca turns out to be the strongest heroine of the novel.It is clear why this book is still so popular. It's a great story, with great heroes (and even better villains).

Upon finishing the book yesterday, and having taken until the age of 40 to actually read this classic novel, it was all well worth the wait.Being an avid reader of historical fiction, both classic and contemporary novels on the subject, I am inclined to want a fast paced, intricate plot, well developed characters, and a good, in-depth read. Ivanhoe, one of Scott's Waverly romances, brings to life the story of the return of outcast Wilfred of Ivanhoe, son of Cedric the Saxon....banished from his father's favor for simply falling in love with the maiden Rowena, who is Cedric's ward, and promised to Cedric's friend, Athelstane.Upon returning to Cedric's kingdom, Ivanhoe proves himself in battle, yet is wounded in the process. Enter the damsel Rebecca, daughter of the wealthy Jewish merchant Isaac of York, who takes up the charge of tending to Ivanhoe's wounds and restoring him to health.Thus begins the story, which then turns on some famous characters of history, such as Richard the Lion Hearted, as well as a not too difficult to identify Robin Hood (though appearing under the name Locksley for most of this book) and the efforts of Robin's men, along with the famed 'Black Knight' to rescue Cedric, Rebecca, Rowena, Athelstane, Ivanhoe, and Isaac from the clutches of the dastardly Maurice De Bracy and Knight Templar Brian de Bois Guilbert, who have imprisoned the heroes and heroines in the castle Front-de-Boeuf after they have ambushed them on the road.Danger, disguise, intrigue, romance, shocking deaths and even more shocking returns await readers as they read on in Walter Scott's highly engaging and likeable tale of Chivalrous derring-do. A wonderful novel, a wonderful read, and a wonderful way to learn more about the middle ages, the Knights Templar, and the exploits of Robin Hood. Though Ivanhoe himself is what I would deem a 'minor' character in the work, this still does nothing to take from the enjoyment of reading it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is one of those books I thought I should have read as a child, but hadn't. Finally, at age 62, I've read it -- and loved it. I had no idea it would be so funny. I wonder how it got its title, though, since Ivanhoe himself seems to have a pretty minor role."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Classic book about knights, damsels and chivalry. It is difficult to read because it is in 17th century English, but well worth the time to read. The book is an adventure with notable characters such as Robinhood and company, Richard the Lionheart and of course the title character Ivanhoe who are all fighting to keep Richard on his throne. Great read for those who love medieval tales."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"i tried to read this book back in high school (10th grade, exactly) and i couldn't get past the first chapter. i tried again about 15 years later and drudged through it and still didn't 'get it', because of the way the dialogue was set up. Then, when i took a screen weriting class in college, i became obsessed with the idea of adapting ivanhoe into a screenplay. so, i purchased the book and a copy of the 'cliff notes'. the cliff note helped me to understand the dialoge and the action a lot better and i could not put the book down. i've read it at least a dozen times dirung the last four yers. though i've yet to adapt it, i still enjoy it every time i pick it up. two characters stand out: the independant minded Rebecca and the strong, powerful Richard the Lionhearted. a great read and i recemomend it to anyone whomay be a little older than your high school kid."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"THE POINT of reading a book is in fact to learn what those ''here were a lot of old English words and Latin phrases I didn't know...'' terms, concepts, and descriptions that we will again come across throughout our education. So read as much as possible and keep the english language alive and well and better your vocabulary....and this has a great ending."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This great book has escaped me far too long, but is now amongst my favorites.As tales of nobility and chivalry go, Ivanhoe scores a ten. It is superbly written and easy to read. The cast of characters seems nearly endless, as even secondary characters take on great living qualities and consume the reader.Reviewers may focus on King Richard, his evil brother John, or Ivanhoe, but there are so many strong characters. For instance one \\"DeBracy\\" is a stout hearted soldier of fortune and happens to be working for the ill minded John. His knightly character is challenged and defeated by the Black Knight of the Fetterlock and he quickly champions fair play and chivalric form when that defeat, by one more noble than he, rekindles his manhood and loyalty to his vow of knighthood.Another character, Brian de Bois Guilbert, plays a villain and strong crusader of christendom against any foe of the cross or his own gain. Sir Brian is a member of the Knights Templar and is vexed or enchanted by every worldly thing that he has denounced . His love for a beautiful Jewish girl is completely absurd to all around him, but he is completely consumed by her beauty and purity. Willing to give up fame, fortune, and power for her; we find him nearly mad with his passion so far out of control.I reccommed this book to lovers of great novels and historians alike. You won't go wrong with Ivanhoe!"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is a great book, It was one of the best books that I have ever read.

In his next match he gets hurt very badly and he is being taken through the woods and he is captured by some fake bandits and taken hostage in a castle. That is all that I can tell you with out telling the ending."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Of all the books that I have read or had to read, I always loved Sir Walter Scott's classic novel, Ivanhoe, more for it's female Jewish character of Rebecca who is the better alternative than princess Rowena. Anyway, it is Rebecca that I think is the heart and soul of the novel. Because of her background, she is ostracized and forced to live a Jewish nun's life caring for others. No British man like Ivanhoe would admit his love for this beautiful woman. Rebecca is persecuted not just because she is a woman but a Jewish woman in England at a time when they were hostile to anybody different including Catholics as well. I love this novel. I know that they adapt it a million times but I don't think they ever focused enough on Rebecca."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This will be a short review as many have already said what I can say but much more clearly. Growing up in the 60's, I never had the opportunity to read this novel or many other classics, which I am now attempting to rectify. This is a great timeless novel and definitely worth the reading. It was, however, a very slow read for me, mainly because of Scott's very archaic prose. This novel is almost two hundred years old and was written in a prose, that was meant to be more archaic than the time it was written. It could probably stand for more contemporary translation to make it accessible to modern youth. I just don't see the average American teen or preteen reading this novel, which is ultimately a shame, as there are many interesting facets of this novel worth contemplating and discussing. I read it on a kindle, so, I had very quick access to word translations as well as the accompanying notes. The difficulty, however, comes from more than just simple word translation. Some of the sentence constructions seems to fly against modern usage logic and requires a stop, slow down, and slow contemplation of the particular phrase. There are likely some very well annotated editions out there which may provide insight to what is being communicated and I would urge people to seek out these particular editions if they exist. As time marches on, the gap between contemporary English and the English used in this novel will only widen. Certainly, this is not a criticism of Sir Walter Scott, who was simply writing to appeal to his contemporaries, but like Canterbury Tales, it may be time to consider a more contemporary translated version, to assure future generations continue to read the novel."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Walter Scott does not seem to be properly regarded (nowadays) in the pantheon of true classic novelists such as Dickens, Defoe, Hardy, Stevenson, Austen etc... but he should be!The first thing to point out, is that this is a historical novel in the style of Bernard Cornwell, for instance, with more inventiveness, and fewer historical details. In fact, it is possibly more of a mythological/legend type history, but I don't pretend to have a clue about the real history of the 12th century.It has a very weak first chapter, for some reason, but it does give a quick background to the history, as Scott sees it. However, from the second chapter it is all go, and definitely a page-turner in the best sense. In fact, this is the first time that I've felt that a novel is similar to a brilliant movie, in a good way (and I prefer reading books). If I had children, I would definitely give them this book to read if they asked me for a \\"grown-up\\" book which they might enjoy, it's that type of story!It may not be historically accurate, but it gives a great insight into 18th century views of early britain, as well as insights into a pre-victorian britain, where prudishness and puritaness are definitely not in evidence. This is romantic in a very different way from my idea of victorian romanticism. It's swashbuckling and uncompromising - not afraid to offend church sensibilities for instance.I don't seem to be able to explain how impressed I was with this novel fully, but for a fair comparison with a modern book I really like - it's as good asTwelve Bar Blues!"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I readily admit that there were several times when I was tempted to put Ivanhoe aside. The story is a wonderful historical tale of knights and political intrigues with all the details normally associated with a tale of medieval chivalry. Each time I almost gave in, I reached a point in the narrative that suddenly engaged me and so I continued and finished what is in retrospect a fabulous read.Sir Walter Scott's tale is grounded in history , though as many have cited below not necessarily historically accurate. Nevertheless it is entertaining and well worth the effort. The language can be a challenge at times but for a fantastical view of Norman England during the Crusades it is quite a ride."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I really enjoyed the book and the characters some of whom were good, others clearly evil, and others a bit of both. Although what characters were good or evil was not always clear. Was Friar Tuck such a good guy? I don't recall a single clergy member that was honest. I felt Rebecca was interesting in that she was brave, kind, courageous, and spirited. Rowenna took a back seat as a hollow character. Bois-Guilbert was truly fascinating. One sees a progression towards introspection in this valueless but brave man of action. You start to hope that he will evolve through love and contact with the good into a true hero. Although some progress seems to be made, where he is morally at the end is unclear. We never can tell if he would have lost the last battle on purpose. Perhaps the book should have been titled \\"Brian and Rebecca.\\" Ivanhoe was not present during so much of the book and the ending is a bit unhappy and not satisfying. Overall it is a great read."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Yes I know , this is the kind of book you read when you are a child. I did it. But if you read it again when you are older suddenly there is a totally diferent book.It is a dark story. A book full of conflicts not only political ones. But brother vs. brother, father vs. son; Christian vs. Hebrew; pure love vs. passion.It is still one of those classics that you can read and read again. It is easier than other Scott novels, but I think is deeper. Because here Scott is completely focussed on the story. It is out of Scotland and perhaps this is the reason.But why is still one of my favourites? Brian de Bois Gilbert. I konw he is the bad guy. But what a bad guy! The confrontation between He and Rebecca is one of those that you never forget. Both are pasionate, and strong. Of course is , by far , more interesting than the story between Rowena and Ivanhoe.Maybe if the story had been written now the love story will be between Rebecca and Bois Gilbert.But apart from that I suggest you to read again this book or try it if you never did. It is still full of adventures and romance. A classic."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is a classic story of love and triumph.

In the meantime the sniveling little brother of King Richard as taken the thrown and plans to take the kingdom as well, and he's well their until the homecoming of out long lost hero returns. He returns to an unexcepting father and a girlfriend may or may not still love him. Ivanhoe hides his identity to find if their love is true or not. Will another woman take her place? And who is that man in black?Through fighting and love, hardships and false accusations this classic book and movie is extraordinary. It shows the true thought and feeling of medieval times and may be enjoyed by all. The realness of this story is amazing and thrusts you into a time of hardships. A story of regaining what's rightly yours and finding true feelings. Through heart and will Ivanhoe finds the answers he's truely looking for. I highly recomemd this book, and if your short on time go for the movie!"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Let me start off by saying: if you can't appreciate details, do not even think about touching this book. Sir Walter Scott writes in the flowery language of the Renaissance, and he does it very, very well. The first five pages of the book are extensive (although MINOR)details of the surrounding countryside. Another thing that I wasn't so fond of was the obviousness of the whole situation of the black knight. You had to either be pretty stupid or very bored not to find out who the black knight is. For those of you who don't like to read this kind of book, I can only recommend it to you for studying the War of the Roses or the history of Britain. I read this book for my Honors English class in my freshman year, and suffice it to say, many of the kids thought it to be a total yawn (they also had to get cliff notes to pass the exam). I gave it a chance, though, and it truly is a good book (it'd probably be even better without the annoying writing style). When I mentioned romance in the review title, please understand that it's not a kinky/mushy type of romance like what you find in Harlequin novels (no offense, anyone); it's of chivalry and such. Give it a shot and try to stick with it. The story in itself isn't half bad at all once you get into it!"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"That's my one problem with the plot. Otherwise, this book is quite enjoyable. Yes, the history is a little fanciful, but Scott is masterful at establishing a milieu, creating memorable characters, and using achronological chapters. Deservedly a classic."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"A great cast of characters, all lovingly crafted and memorable. The book is filled with drama, adventure and humor not taking itself too seriously while set in one of the most interesting times of England (the time leading up to Hastings being the most interesting - ahem, did you hear that Bernard Cornwell?). Sadly, there are not many books like this out there.There are a lot of disguises used which might be overdone. And the penguin version does not have the notes on the corresponding page but in the back of the book. There is a free version on google books with the notes on each page which is more convenient and the author's side comments were actually very interesting at times. Don't sell yourself short, go ahead and read this."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"It is odd that right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchists might find much to dislike in Scott's romantic tale of Catholics and monarchs. Although Scott's book pays fitting homage to tradition, justice, virtue, and piety, there is an undercurrent of criticism of the Church and men tasked with defending the common good. Individuals of noble character fight injustice, yet their leaders can seldom be prevailed upon to do the right thing at the right time. And, like all moderns, Scott puts virtue not in service of God, but in service of nation. So Ivanhoe is more a tale of an oppressed people who must rise up and show their national character than it is a tale of God-fearing men dedicated to serving throne and altar.Romanticism serves a roll in correcting the truncated understanding of humanity proposed by Enlightenment thinkers, but it suffers, like postmodern criticisms of modernity, in being a corrective that accepts the basic assumptions of the illness for which it seeks remedy. In spite of its failings, it's still a very good read and probably contains enough romance to be enjoyed even by chicks."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This seemed a rousing romantic tale when I read it many years ago, but it now seems rather cumbersome. The dialogue is stilted, not to say unbelievable; the characters are wooden, and that Ivanhoe should prefer the snobbish Rowena to the lovely and talented Rebecca is absurd. And King Richard could leap tall buildings at a single bound(!). Too much. Maybe 3 stars is too much."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This book is awesome.

Perhaps a bit heavy on the Latin, but you can figure it out. His Saxon comic, Wamba is most amusing. Just remember, the answer to everything is Pax Vobiscum.

It really gives you a great description of the mid-evil times! Its not the most easy book to follow! But it is worth reading! (im not the best review writer!)"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Sir Walter Scott was the first, and is still considered one of the best, historical novelists of all time. His first novel, Waverly, which concerns itself with the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland in 1745, was published in 1814 and was an overwhelming success. He followed that with two dozen other Waverly novels, including Rob Roy in 1818. In 1819, he began a new series of novels based on medieval England and Europe, beginning with Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe is still considered one of his best and most endearing works.One of the things about Scott that makes him so significant is his mastery of the English language. He is a type of bridge between Shakespeare's Elizabethan English and the English of the modern world. In Ivanhoe, he captures the flavor of the language of the age of chivalry without overwhelming us. We have a touch of \\"thees\\" and \\"thous,\\" but the meanings of passages are still quite clear. His writing is rich and multifaceted, but it always has purpose. He uses words with precision, but he does not try to impress us with what he knows.A second thing about Scott that is significant is his knowledge of history. His research is impeccable, and it bears fruit in the lavishness of his details. Yet, we don't get bogged down in detail. There is just enough to paint the scenes of the period and make them come alive. A perfect example is his handling of the tournament in Ivanhoe. Never has there been a clearer, more perfect description of a medieval tournament. It is breathtaking, and we feel we are a part of the action.I wish that Scott had written about King Arthur. If he had, he would have been the greatest of the Arthurian authors. Unfortunately, Ivanhoe is as close as he came. Yet, we get so much from that one book concerning chivalry and knighthood, that it could almost be used as a handbook on the subject. It is also quite critical of the faults of the period, such as the mistreatment of Jews and the excesses of the nobility. It is a most honest handling of a most romantic period, and yet he does not tarnish it or disturb the blush on the rose.A third thing about Scott is his incredible story-telling and his ability to develop so many interesting characters. Every chapter in Ivanhoe is a complete scene that ends in such a way so as to draw us into the next scene. Scott could easily have been a screenwriter. The personalities that fill those scenes are unforgettable and endearing, such as Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, King Richard the Lionhearted, Locksley (Robin Hood), the Lady Rowena, Rebecca, Isaac of York and Wamba. There are also a host of detestable villains, such as Prince John, Maurice de Bracy and Brian de Bois-Guilbert. No wonder Hollywood wanted to make this into a major motion picture. The 1952 version with Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe, Elizabeth Taylor as Rebecca, Joan Fontaine as Lady Rowena and George Sanders as Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is unusually good. Robert Taylor is a bit stiff; but then he never felt as comfortable or looked as natural in tights and armor as Errol Flynn. There is also a 1982 TV version, staring James Mason and some other notables, with which I am not familiar.When you compare current novels, even historical ones, with Ivanhoe and other Scott works, there is no comparison. What you gain in readability in the modern works, you lose in pure beauty of the language. Scott is an education, not only in language, but history, culture and human relations. But he is also one of the most entertaining authors who ever put pen to paper. I highly recommend him, and especially Ivanhoe.Waitsel Smith"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I first read this book when I was thirteen. My English teacher suggested it to me and my friend as a 'challenging' book to read for a paper. My friend and I agreed to read it together, but were both instantly bored with the overwhelming detail. To get through it, we made a contest to see who could finish the book the fastest, and this was probably the only reason I continued to read it, but I'm go glad I did! Once I got into the plot and action and intrigue, the detail was hardly superfluous.It was a bit thick for me at thirteen, but I read it again a few years later and absolutely loved it! Every time I read it I'm so caught up in the action and so invested in all of the characters. There's a clear line of who is on whose side in the story, and Ivanhoe is clearly the 'good guy,' but the 'bad guys' are the real source of action. The do awful things like kidnap women and they have unrequited love, and they are so alive and vibrant that I can't help but like them."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe. The very name seems to evoke romance when knights jousted in hopes of winning love bestowed by a fair and chaste maid! Ivanhoe was the first novel set in England written by the great romancer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) the Scottish lawyer who wrote fiction.The tale concerns Wilfred of Ivanhoe a young knight recently returned from the third crusade. He seeks to win the hand of the fair Rowena a Saxon girl. Ivanhoe has been banished from his father but wins Rowena following adventures pitting him against evil knights. Richard I King of England appear as do Robin Hood Friar Tuck, Allan A Dale and the merry men of the forest The court jester Wamba provides the laughs. Also featured is the loyal servant Gurth who serves Ivanhoe. The madwoman Ulrica is an early version of the daft Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca!The least interesting character is Ivanhoe! Far better characters are the rich Jewish merchant Isaac and his beautiful and kind daughter Rebecca. Rebecca is tried and condemned as a witch. Will Ivanhoe rescue her at the last minute? Cedric, the father of Ivanhoe, is also a brave man who seeks to have his ward Rowena wed a Saxon claimant to the throne.The book rambles over 500 densely written pages filled with poetry, long speeches and sporadic action. The literary sins of Scott are multitudious. He:1. Writes in a turgidly pompous style alien to the eyes of 21st century readers.2.His characters are one dimensional puppets who have no depth.3. His plotting is slow moving and somewhat dull. The highlights are the tournament of knights, a caste's siege and the trial of Rebecca at novel's end.Nevetheless Scott's works live because:1. He practically created modern historical fiction.2. The story is interesting if the reader will pay attention to the course of the tale. Scott could spin a tale!3. Some of his characters are witty, wise and wonderful. Famous authors such as Balzac and Dickens were influenced by his oeuvre. Even Jane Austen perused Scott with pleasure and joy.Sir Walter Scott wrote this book in 1819. That was a long time ago! He may not be your cup of tea and you may have hated to have to read this book in school! If so give it an adult reread. It is a great work of fiction for all of its many flaws."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"One purpose of this review is to encourage the millions of people who read Sir Walter's Scott's Ivanhoe in a watered-down, condensed version in school to read the complete novel as an adult...and for those of you who have not read it at all to enjoy for the first time this great epic historical novel. When I was 18 years old I saw the movie version of Gone with the Wind and thought it was a grand spectacle about war. When I saw it again 30 years later I realized that the war was just the backdrop for the real meaning--the struggle for existence in a rapidly changing world. Ivanhoe is full of spectacle, but real meaning, in my view has to do with morality and values. For me a key moment in the story happens on pp. 247. Ivanhoe and Rebecca are being held as prisoners in a castle and a large band of men has gathered outside and are preparing to storm the castle to rescue them. The wounded Ivanhoe yearns to join them as Rebecca describes the fighting to him. Noting the bravery of one particular knight Ivanhoe says, \\"Under such a leader as thou has spoken this knight to be, there are no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant enterprise...I vow by the name of my bright lady-love, I would endure ten years' captivity to fight one day by that good knight's side in such a quarrel as this!\\" Rebecca disagrees, \\"and what is it, valiant knight, save an offering of sacrifice to a demon of vainglory, as a passing through the fire to Moloch?\\" As a boy, I would have agreed with Ivanhoe; now, having seen the horrors of war (and even as I write this the ongoing death in Gaza) I stand with Rebecca.It was the year 1193. Richard I, the Lion Hearted, after leading the Third Crusade to rescue the Holy Land from the infidels is on his way back to England when he is imprisoned by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, leaving his younger brother, Prince John, in charge of the country and anxious to secure the throne for himself. But Richard is released and is making his way back to an England that is in turmoil with Saxons eager to throw off the yoke of the conquering Normans, Norman barons carving out independent fiefdoms, and marauding outlaws making things unsafe for everyone.The cast of characters is all larger than life and can be divided, more or less, into the good guys and the bad guys. The good guys include Cedric of Rotherwood, a patriotic Saxon hoping to restore the Saxons to their former independence; his ward, the Lady Rowena, beautiful, proud and of high birth whom Cedric hopes to wed to Athelstane, a powerful, but slow thinking man who is also of royal Saxon blood; Wilfred of Ivanhoe, the son of Cedric who was disinherited by his father for loving Rowena and who consequently went off with Richard on the Third Crusade; the Black Knight, also known as The Sluggard, a mysterious knight who saves Ivanhoe from defeat in the jousting competition and then goes off without claming the reward for his performance; Locksley (aka Robin Hood), the leader of the outlaw band and an outstanding archer; the Clerk of Copmanhust (Friar Tuck), an erstwhile monk who is a key member of the outlaw group; Isaac of York, a rich Jew whose travails and actions infuse the story; and last and certainly not least, his daughter Rebecca, also beautiful as well as courageous and high minded.Arrayed against this group are the bad guys, who include Prince John, now in power while Richard is away, but scheming to take the throne for himself; Maurice de Bracy, a Norman knight who lusts after Rowena, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, another Norman Knight who is anxious to take away Ivanhoe's lands to add to his, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Norman knight of the Templar order, that is to say both a military man and a religious one, who hates Ivanhoe and lusts after Rowena and then kidnaps Rebecca; Fitzhugh Waldermar, advisor to Prince John, a lesser character with a Machiavellian-like mentality. Philip and Albert Malvoisan, the latter being a key personage in the Templar organization, Lucas Beaumanoir, the Grand Master (head) of the Templars whose ascetic mentality is affronted by the seeming corruption of this order, and Prior Almer, a religious man who attends to the Norman cause.Finally, there is Ulrica, who as a young girl lived in the castle of Torquilstone with her Saxon father and brothers. The castle was attacked by Front-de-Boeuf's father and all the men killed and Ulrica kept alive only to serve the sexual and personal needs of the conquerors. She is now old and bitter and she plays a key part in the novel, getting revenge on the Normans.Ivanhoe is a tale of derring-do highlighted by a jousting tournament, the siege of a castle in which some of the \\"good guys\\" were confined, and the trial of Rebecca as a witch which ends in a contest between de Bois-Guilbert and Ivanhoe who acts as Rebecca's champion.The novel is particular valuable as a guide to the cultural, social and political values of those times. It features two Jewish characters, one of which (Isaac) is largely described in stereotypical terms. But the other, Rebecca, is one of the greatest heroines in fiction. Her courage and steadfastness and kindness stand in mark contrast to the immorality of the men around her. Finally, novel reveals the true nature of the reasons for the Magna Charta which the by then King John was forced to sign. Rather than being an enlightened document of democracy as it is often portrayed in history books, it was really an effort by a power hungry elite (the Norman barons) to advance their own power and wealth at the expense of a capricious monarch.Five stars all the way, but read it as a serious work, not a romantic adventure."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"A 'disinherited knight' returns home from the Crusades to find the world he left turned upside down.

The language is a bit complicated, and though the description is vivid at times it is overly detailed. Historical purists will find a large number of anachronisms. Nevertheless, the speed and quality of the tale make it hard to put down. Ancient combat, romantic triangles, scheming princes, this is where the tradition of the historical romance began.

Set during the Crusades, in the era after the Norman conquest of England (1066), it is the story of a disinherited knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who has been cast aside by his father, Cedric of Rotherwood, because of a forbidden love between young Ivanhoe and Cederic's ward, the lovely Saxon girl Rowena. Cederic want to re-establish Saxon rule in England and to do so, he has plotted to marry off Rowena to Athelstane, a Saxon noble of pure blood, thereby creating a legitimate Saxon ruling line. This intimate story of forbidden love is set against the grand historical backdrop of a political drama that pits Richard the Lionhearted, who has been away on Crusade against his corrupt brother Prince John, who has been plotting to seize power with the help of treacherous nobles Waldemar, Fitzurse, Font-de-Bouef and Malvosin. The pageantry of a medieval tournament at Ashby is the backdrop for the dramatic introduction of the character of the Disinherited Knight, supported by the Black Knight, Le Noir Faineant, who vanquish all of Prince John's favorites in combat. The Disinherited Knight, is of course, revealed to be Ivanhoe, the hero of the Scott's epic tale. An interesting sub plot is the story of the sensual Jewish beauty Rebecca, daughter of the merchant Isaac of York, who came to Ivanhoe's aid. In an era of rampant anti-Semitism, Sir Walter Scott drew his Jewish characters with great sympathy and Rebecca's sad story of her trial by the Knights Templar, enrichens the novel. Ivanhoe is a beautifully written and the story takes many twists and turns to reach it's conclusion. It's dense plot and intrigue are said to have influenced the later writings of Alexandre Dumas. Full of fascinating characters, dark deeds, swordplay, humor, pathos and of course, a rich, romantic story of star-crossed lovers, Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe is mythmaking at its finest. Jeffrey Morseburg"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This review is of Ivanhoe strictly as a fun FICTIONAL book to read. I can not vouch for any historical accuracy nor is that my intent.I turned onto Ivanhoe because I had heard that this story influenced Dumas when he wrote the Three Musketeer saga and I am really glad that I gave it a chance. The story of Ivanhoe is about the return of the Wilfred of Ivanhoe and King Richard from the Crusades. Wilfred is the disinherited son of Cedric of Rotherwood, aka Cedric the Saxon. Cedric dreams of restoring the Saxon monarchy and has been trying to facilitate a union between his ward, Rowena and Athelstane, whose pure bloodline would give credit to a claim for rule. A strong affection between Rowena and his son Wilfred (henceforth called Ivanhoe) has caused him to exile his son - his sacrifice to promote the Saxon cause. The disinherited Ivanhoe went to serve with Richard the Lion Heart in the Crusades. While Richard and Ivanhoe have been gone, Richard's brother, Prince John, has been gathering friends and making schemes for wresting control from Richard before he could get back and squelch his efforts. The conflict between the Normans and Saxons and the absence of King Richard (Lion Heart) has created the perfect conditions for a rebellion of the Saxons and/or a coup by John - both of which seem almost imminent.The twists and turns are great. When Richard and Ivanhoe return incognito and fight in a tournament, besting all of the strongest, the wheels start turning that will see damsels abducted, the storming and sacking of a castle with the aid of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, a witch trial and more swordplay. Great, great, great. It's no wonder that this work is still being read almost two hundred years later and influenced what I consider to be one of the best adventure stories ever - the Three Musketeers. If you like Dumas, you will more than likely like this even though it is not as involved or long as a Dumas novel."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is perhaps the greatest of classic medieval literature that I know of. In its pages you will find adventure, love, personal sacrifice, honor, greed, lust, ambition, loyalty, faith and devotion. The language is difficult to grasp for most contemporary readers I would suspect, especially for the younger generation. Still, the quality of this classic tale is beyond question."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"In 1819, Walter Scott's \\"Ivanhoe\\" was like Harry Potter meets the Twilight series, a mega pop-culture milestone, its biggest challenge for readers being how to put it down.Today, the challenge is a little different: Can you make it all the way through before putting it down - for good?The story centers upon England in the second century after the Norman Conquest. At this time, Scott informs us, the Normans \\"still felt the elation of triumph\\" while the subject Saxons \\"groaned under all the consequences of defeat.\\" Enter Ivanhoe, a Saxon knight who distinguished himself in service under the Norman king Richard, and is now back to inspire Saxons and others under the boot of Richard's usurping brother John, who is taking advantage of Richard's foreign imprisonment to rule the land. Can Ivanhoe bring England together, reconcile with his father, and restore Richard to the throne?No, he can't. At least not alone, or even for the most part while conscious. \\"Ivanhoe\\" is one of those novels with a central figure most conspicuous by his absence, as he is laid up by injury for most of the book.Scott has a deep bench of secondary characters to hold our interest. Among them is the strange Black Knight who rides to Ivanhoe's rescue; a fellow named Locksley who traipses around the forest with his merry associates stealing from the rich to give to themselves; the Saxon jester Wamba, who offers up some clever barbs; and the scheming Waldemar Fitzurse, the scheming mind behind John's usurpation.The two most indelible characters, as any reader can attest, are Brian de Bois-Guilbert and Rebecca the Jewess. Bois-Guilbert is Ivanhoe's sworn enemy who hides his cynical relativism beneath a mask of hypocritical piety that begins to slip when he falls in love with Rebecca. There are a lot of emblematic characters in \\"Ivanhoe,\\" but Rebecca stands out for her do-or-die devotion to Ivanhoe, as well as her willingness to assume a Christ-like burden in defense of her Jewish faith.\\"Embrace thy religion?\\" she tells off Bois-Guilbert. \\"And what religion can it be that harbours such a villain?\\"You finish \\"Ivanhoe\\" wondering what Rebecca or Scott saw in the title character. He's a wholly altruistic yet dull character with no inner life to speak of. Bois-Guilbert is a hundred times more interesting a villain than Ivanhoe is a hero. No wonder Scott kept him off-stage so long. Yet with that extended absence comes a loss of focus the book never regains, spinning off instead in assorted directions with long periods of sometimes charming but still pointless discussion in-between.Scott has the bones of a great story, but after a drawn-out showdown at an evil knight's castle, he seems to run out of ideas for it. Instead we get a lot of dead-end side alleys like a parley in a hermit's cell, a trumped-up witchcraft trial, a shakedown involving a rich prior, and an implausible \\"resurrection\\" scene. There are also moments of revelation where various characters reveal who they really are, the sort of thing that went down well in Scott's day but strains credulity now.\\"Ivanhoe\\" does have a great build-up. After you get through 50 pages of scene-setting, the next 150 are a fast-flying breeze. Scott envelops you in the world he creates. As knights tilt at each other and John broods and plots his crimes, the book begins to suck you in. The story of Rebecca and her father Isaac, victimized because of their faith, present a sense of conscience unusual for its time, as well as an additional rooting interest to deepen the dramatic tension.I don't think Scott sustained that tension, and the ending felt like a right hash, but the ride was still fun."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I have always liked medieval situations, and therefore enjoyed the book a lot.

I remember hearing back in elementary school (early 1980s) that Ivanhoe was the ultimate medieval adventure novel so I bought a copy second-hand, I think it was the Watermill Classics edition. Never read it, it just stayed on the shelf. The Prisoner of Zenda by Anthony Hope was another one that I bought around the same time and never read.Well when I went to college I'd kept a lot of stuff at my parents' place, including that large collection of Watermill Classics. I'm not exactly sure what they did with those books (because they themselves don't remember), but after I graduated there was no trace of them. So sometime around 1999 I invested around $1000 in a new collection of classics that I'd never gotten a chance to read. Almost all Penguin editions this time. Both Ivanhoe and The Prisoner of Zenda were among these.Read Zenda in the autumn of last year and gave it four stars, pretty solid adventure novel. Finally got around to Ivanhoe a couple months ago. Completely overwhelmed. The finest adventure novel I've read hands down, and that includes modern ones. The plotting, characterization, humor, drama, politics, it's all there and perfectly realized. With very few exceptions, I sell off fiction novels after reading them. This is one that stays, just so that over the years I have the opportunity to flip back to random passages and delight in Walter Scott's genius.I have to say that I'm baffled by all the reviews complaining that Scott's prose is cumbersome, stilted, and dense. I found the Penguin edition to be superbly readable. Scott's prose is some of the finest and most lucid that I've ever come across, including novels written recently. In fact, it's the quality of the prose that stood above any other quality in the novel for me.Though based on historical fact, Ivanhoe is full of fictional embellishments and outright fabrications. This is partly because it was written roughly 750 years after the events described, not exactly a firsthand account! But mostly it's because Scott wrote it for popular enjoyment and not as a dry chronicle. Nevertheless, you will learn a great deal about the medieval period in Ivanhoe, such as fashion, popular sentiment, lifestyles, classes, social mores, etc. Though you generally won't know how much is completely true.On top of this the story is thrilling and emotional. An absolute gem of a novel."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe by Walter Scott, is set in England during the reign of King Richard , who is away on the Crusades to the Holy Land , leaving the administration of the country to his scheming brother , John , and his corrupt court cronies like Waldemar Fitzurse , Malvoisin and Front-de-Bouef.Meanwhile a mysterious Disinherited Knight, aided by another anonymous Knight in black amour (Le Noir Fain&eacute;ant) defeats all of King John's favorite knights at the jousting tournament at Ashby.The challenger is revealed as Wilfred of Ivanhoe, the disinherited son of the Saxon nobleman, Cedric, who is the beloved of his father's charge, the comely Rowena.The character who was for me, the most interesting, was the beautiful \`black eyed' Jewish beauty, Rebecca, the daughter of the merchant Isaac of York. Compassionate and yet fiery, humble yet proud, sensual and yet modest, it is not hard to understand the passion for her felt by the Knight Templar, Brian De-Bois Gilbert. She and her father must try to survive in a violently anti-Semitic society, in which they are rendered defenseless, as members of a humbled nation. Rebecca, faced with a horrific fate, refuses to renounce her faith, right until the end. In a sense she represents the Jewish Nation, or the Nation of Israel, right through the exile (Galut), and also today as the international community unjustly pillories the Jewish State, and plots her destruction.Rebecca thus says during her trial by the order of Knights Templars: \\" \` To invoke your pity' said the lovely Jewess, with a voice tremulous with emotion \`would I am be aware, , be as useless as I should hold it mean...Nor will I even vindicate myself at the expense of the oppressor which seem to convert the tyrant into the victim.\\"So you see how timeless words of wisdom can be.Also thrown into the book are Robin Hood and his Merry Men, and the witty Jester Wamba . A quotable quote from Wamba from Wamba is \\" To restrain them by their sense of humanity is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.The book is a pleasure to read. As Herbert Strang wrote in an early 20th century edition of Ivanhoe: \\"In introducing this great story to a new generation of boys and girls, I find myself wishing that I too, where about to read Ivanhoe for the first time\\"After having read Ivanhoe , I can understand exactly why he wrote that."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"When was the last time you heard of a 13 year-old who willingly read a 520 page novel written over 150 years ago? Well, if it has been a long time, you may rest assured that it has happened and I am living proof. This book surprised me, I read it voluntarily but I had half-expected it to be a long, unimaginative knights-in-shining-armor story. But I was wrong. The story grabbed me with its flowery old-english, the brave, young, idealist of a hero, and its many surprising twists. I never expected Robin Hood to be a main character, the struggle of Rebecca and her father against the tides of medieval prejudice stirs the heart, and the surprise ending of the last tournament will tickle you. I and my sister's favorite part would have to be the supposed &quot;funeral&quot; of Athelstane, the in-over-his-head Saxon Lord. We were both in stitches as his &quot;ghost&quot; appears just at the right moment...Hehehe. You have to read the book yourself to fully appreciate it, and I would reccomend it to everyone, but especially to fans of G.A. Henty's medieval novels, Jane Austen and James Fenimore Cooper."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Sir Walter Scott wrote over twenty novels, after switching from poetry, many of considerable length, and this is the one which still grabs the Public attention. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is the story of a young nobleman in the First Crusade, roughly a century after the Norman Conquest. Ivanhoe's bride, the Saxon heiress Rowena, is pursued by several Norman knights, portrayed by Scott as villainous and oppressive. Many choose this to be an implicit reference to the English &quot;occupation&quot; of Scotland. The story of the prodigal son is reworked in all its chivalric glory, and the reader enjoys a comfortable read throughout due to the certainty that Ivanhoe will &quot;get the girl&quot;.As an example of the adventure story, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is unsurpassed in English Literature. Working within a formula, Scott still manages to create several memorable character vignettes, most notably Wamba the jester, the rapacious Prince John, and the noble King Richard, who is almost as romantically wild as Ivanhoe himself. There is also an appearance of Robin Hood and his band, which acts as a useful balance to the world of Norman castles. As a story of occupation and the merging of races into cosmopolitan nations, Ivanhoe is overtly political, but it can also be read on a level of very simple enjoyment.Faults of the book in itself are few and far between. Scott was a mass producer of historical novels, all of which operate within a rigid framework, and using similar characters. Critics have therefore argued that Scott does not pioneer the novel very far, but merely cashes in on an existing style. It is reasonable to say that &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; does not break any new ground, but this is more than compensated for by the superb characterisation, and delicate understanding shown by Scott on such issues as inter-racial relations.I would recommend &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; to anyone wishing to read the medieval romance, or anyone with an interest in Sir Walter Scott. It is not too challenging, but is well-researched, emotionally-charged, and most importantly of all, very enjoyable. Watch out for the Jewish family, downtrodden by both Norman and Saxon alike, but whose simple dignity contrasts with the proud egotism of many of the Christians. The Jewish girl, Rebekah, also provides an alternative love interest for Ivanhoe, which is all the more pathetic because the reader knows it can never be realised."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Normans, Saxons, Robin Hood, and the Black Knight: if you have been on a search for the holy grail of historical fiction, then this might very well be the thing you're looking for. It has everything: splendid characterizations, rich detail, a rollicking plot, and elegant, lyrical prose. It is so rich in everything that it's . . . well, it's a little daunting.The plot has to do with . . . where does one start? See, the Normans have been in control of Merry Olde England for about a hundred years, and are grinding away at the natives; stealing their lands, restricting their rights, making them vassals, etc. The fierce Saxons chafe under their rule: some stubbornly defend their holdings, others have taken to the woods to become outlaws. And things don't promise to get any better. The fair-minded King Richard has been away for many years and is rumored to be locked up in an Austrian dungeon. His brother, the evil John, along with his nefarious minions, is attempting to usurp him. Into the mix comes Ivanhoe, back from years of crusading in Palestine, and anxious to regain both his inheritance and the hand of the fair Lady Rowena, both of which are coveted by the Norman, De Bracy.And this is just the start. There is the jousting tournament, the \\"grand spectacle of the age;\\" there is the siege and sack of the foreboding Norman castle, Torquilstone; there is the witchcraft trial of the proud Jewess Rebecca in which she faces a hideous fate; and finally, there is the maybe-not-so-surprising re-entrance of the noble King Richard. There are kidnappings, subterfuges, disguises, vile insults, grand gestures, cowardice, bravery, knavery, dungeons, castles and forests. No, you can't beat it for plot.The characterizations are detailed and complex. There is the fiercely proud Cedric the Saxon. There is his comrade, Athelstane, who is brave, but slow, and perhaps too fond of food and drink. \\"The Unready,\\" is his moniker. Here is a marvelous description of the general nature of the would-be king, John: \\"a mixture of carelessness and presumption with low artifice and cunning.\\" Rebecca, perhaps, is the most memorable character. Downtrodden as she is--due to circumstances entirely beyond her control--she nevertheless maintains a mixture of pride, humility, honor, and kindness, and is very endearing. My favorite is Wamba, Cedric's jester, whose wit and boyish energy are delightfully charming: \\"[His] brain consisted chiefly in a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him long not to remain in any quiet posture,\\" so that, \\"on horseback, therefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards, now on the horse's ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal; now hanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting with his face to the tail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures . . .\\"Next is the descriptive nature of Scott's narrative, which alone is worthy of the price of admission. Yes, it slows the plot a little, but detailed description is truly the richest meat in historical fiction. Right off the bat, we get the scene: that part of England, \\"watered by the Don,\\" heavily forested, and with hills and valleys and glades. There then follows a brief description of the populace and recent history. Finally, it zeros in on two characters. We see what they are doing, where they are, and what they are wearing: from cap to toe, we get style, cleanliness, condition and color. Everything in the book is described this way, from clothing to dwelling to fashion to food to customs. Here is a marvelous description of Rowena's chamber, a part of Cedric's castle, \\"the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to her by the lord of the mansion.\\" Although richly adorned, \\"let not modern beauty envy the magnificence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill finished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook to the night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect them from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftan.\\" This is where she will sleep.As mentioned earlier, the last great aspect of this novel is the absolutely beautiful language, which, it must be said, can sometimes be a bit difficult. Not only did Scott write 200 years ago, but he also consciously attempted to give one the sense of what the language was like 800 years earlier. To reap the substantial linguistic awards available here, it is best read sitting up, wide awake and alert. Here is a little gem, one of hundreds, this one having to do with the meal of the ravenous Black Knight in Friar Tuck's hermitage: \\"This mighty dish he placed before his guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost no time in making himself acquainted with its contents.\\" A small little comment, sure, but amusingly clever.It's a great book. Great in every respect, and well worth the slightly increased mental energy one must put forth to absorb it. Don't put it off any longer."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This is most definately a book you have to wade through but Scott is such a masterful story teller that the difficult passages are worth the effort. Rebekah (I can't remember which way Scott spelled it so please bear with me) is a brilliant character, an intelligent and independant woman who uses her brain. Most modern books don't have as strong a female character.THe introduction to my copy says that the book is not accurate to medieval history and was not meant to be. The Normans and Saxons were symbols for the English and Scots. (Scott was pro independance) I don't know how true this is but it makes a good deal of sense. My point is, the strength of the book was not it's historical accuracy but Scott's brilliant characters. Rebekah and Brian de Bois Gilbert are my favorites hgandds down for their complexities but everyone has at least one good scene. (Except poor Rowena who really is a damsel in distress.)"},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe is a continuation of the work of Sir Walter Scott as regards his historical novels. Scott was one of the first to create the concept of a historical novel and to this day, his ability to accurately capture and convey the historical time period in which his stories were set is impressive. If you have already read Rob Roy, this will be an easier read for you. It has less of the colloquialisms and true Scottish language and therefore you find yourself translating less and enjoying the story more. This book is perhaps better appreciated when it is read amongst other Scott works, including Rob Roy. It is a classic and it reads like one. The storyline isn't terribly complicated but the characters can be difficult to follow from time to time as they have multiple names and (for some), their true identities are revealed later in the novel. As with Rob Roy, you actually do end up learning a bit about what life was like for many people in that era, which I found perhaps most interesting about the book."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"This book is possibly the definitive medaevil romance. Set in the time of Prince John and his brother Richard(with, yes, an entry by the renowned Robin Hood), this tells the story of a young, gallant knight come to claim his Saxon princess. The story, however does not revolve entirely around young Ivanhoe, in fact it he is only one of several important characters of the tale. Ivanhoe embodies everything that is loved in this type of book. It is definitely a must read, the best of Walter Scott\`s books(far ahead of \\"Waverly\\" and \\"Rob Roy\\") and can only be compared with other leading romances such as \\"The Black Arrow\\"of R.L Stevenson. A truly excellent book."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Written in 1819 by Sir Walter Scott, Ivanhoe is a novel that is, by some critics, credited with the revival of modern interest in the Middle Ages, and the principals of chivalry. But...that's probably not why you'd be interested in reading it. Ivanhoe contains a fascinating portrayal of the very gradual merging of the Saxon and Norman cultures after William the Conqueror prevailed at the Battle of Hastings. But, again, this probably isn't the reason that you might be induced to pick up a book you've often heard of, but never been tempted to read or listen to. Arguably, Ivanhoe's most admirable and intriguing character is a Rebecca, a young and beautiful Jewish woman. Scott leverages Rebecca's travails into a thoughtful and powerful exploration of the oppression of women, and the brutal discrimination against medieval Judaism. And....I'm guessing that's not why you'll make room on your \\"to be read\\" pile for an almost 200 year old novel.But here's why you might want to take an \\"I'll read fifty pages, and if I don't like it, won't read the rest\\" approach to the tale of Ivanhoe: it's an intelligent, rollicking, swash-buckling, humorous tale of beautiful damsels and men with sword arms like tree trunks, couched in semi-medieval language that is so lush that you'll find yourself going around for days afterwards talking like the yeoman of yore that lived with Robin of Locksley in Sherwood Forest. Get those fifty pages under your mental belt, and you won't put it down. Why? Because it has it all: magnificent battles, truly good guys fighting truly bad guys, corrupt priests and abbots, arrogant noblemen, estranged fathers and sons, Robin Hood, Richard the Lionhearted, Knights Templar, the evil King John and his nefarious henchmen. But wait! More: accusations of witchcraft, a Lazarus scene, mortal wounds, near mortal wounds, and hearts that break or burst from love and/or anguish. Ah, for a world when right makes might, instead of the 21st century might makes right. Oh for a century where bromances were based on shared adventure and combat rather than epic bouts of drinking or the mentality that the Jackass movies are based on.Through all of the above, Sir Walter Scott's witty, careful, and exquisitely crafted sequences of dialogue give a glimpse of the beauty of human discourse (or, intercourse, as Scott refers to it) before we began to communicate in tweets, twitters, text messages, instant messages, and Facebook comments.Ivanhoe, one should know, is barely about the character Ivanhoe. Though he is a fine young man of courage and honor, the plot swirls and thickens while Ivanhoe is largely indisposed for one reason or another. Although the book wouldn't have sold had it been named properly (it should have been called \\"Rebecca\\"), the reader will find the struggle between an ultravirile Knight Templar with dishonorable intentions and Rebecca, beautiful in mind, body, and soul more absorbing than Ivanhoe's own contribution to the plot.So. Ivanhoe is an important novel, but beshrew that, kind sirs and ladies: read it and dream of castles that have pennants on the battlements, Dark Knights that save the day, the clash of swords, the shattering of lances, fire-breathing war horses, and excellent archers that can split a wand at a hundred yards. To heck with you, Rhett Butler and your Southern Belles: life for real men doesn't start until the clank of arrows bouncing off one's suit of armor in the full riot of battle reaches a crescendo, and Sheffield forged swords bounce off Spanish made suits of chainmail. Scarlett, step aside for Rebecca, the Jewish physician of legendary beauty, intelligence, and resolve that comes to Ivanhoe's aid. Sir Walter Scott knows how to create characters of heroic proportion, and the reader that takes the time to pick up Ivanhoe will reap the benefits of his ability to tell a tale for the ages."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"I really enjoyed Ivanhoe. We downloaded it onto our iPOD from Audible, a company that sells recorded books online. It was excellent, probably partly because the guy reading it did a good job, and also since Sir Walter Scott has a really good style. His writing is humorous, and I never fail to be amused by the way authors writing in the 1800s use the word'precipitate' in so many interesting ways. Sir Walter Scott's writing style is not at all boring or outdated.the plot of the book is also well laid out. it takes place during King richard the Lionhearted's reighn in england, after the Third Crusade. Richard is an important character, and even Robin Hood is included. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that Wilfred of Ivanhoe, the main character, ended up staying in bed for most of the book becaunse of a wound. His girlfriend, rowena, is not the most active person, either. But the book is still fill of battles and tounaments, and even 'mushy' scenes, occasionally. One thing to remember while reading Sir Walter scott's bookes is that since he is a fiction writer, we shouldn't take everything he says about King richard as fact, but realize that a good portion of what is in his books never happened."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"Ivanhoe a hero?

All the other charecters keep the book going strong."},{"Title":"Ivanhoe: A Historical Romance","review":"For the modern reader, there are many complaints that could lodged against the writing in Ivanhoe (first published in the early 1800&#8242;s). Both the beginning of the book and every new character or location inspire several paragraphs of exposition. At first, I found these very detailed descriptions made it harder for me to picture the whole person or scene being described. The language was a little hard to deal with at first, with an archaic feel that reminded me most of Shakespeare out of anything I've read. The footnotes never explained anything of use and phrases of Latin or French were rarely translated. Finally, the author frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain to readers his choice of historical details and so on.All of that said, this book also reminded me of Shakespeare in that I got used to all of those quirks that bothered me originally. Even at the beginning it was possible to follow the archaic language and appreciate the author's use of word-play in jests (also reminiscent of Shakespeare). In fact, as time passed and I became involved in the story, I liked the atmosphere of the archaic language. It almost felt like a bard could be reciting this story of epic chivalry and adventure. I loved how excessively honorable the good guys were and how excessively unscrupulous the bad guys were. I'm not sure how to describe it better than by referring you to any experience you have with the story of Robin Hood, because Ivanhoe is clearly the inspiration for that light-hearted approach to an adventure story.

Rosa Bolivar is the only child of powerful CEO of Bolivar International, Ernesto Bolivar and she is definitely a daddy's girl. Ernesto divorced her mother, who is an alcoholic, years before and raised Rosa without her. As the story opens, Rosa is graduating from school and has just broken the news to her father that she does not plan to immediately go to work for him at Bolivar International. Later, when she overhears an argument between her parents, Rosa discovers some shocking truths that cause her to question everything she has ever known. As she looks for answers, she suddenly finds herself in the midst of a DEA investigation. As a result of this involvement she meets Samson Quartermine, a lawyer turned DEA agent who is investigating Rosa's family. Samson is any woman's dream -- handsome, thoughtful, intelligent, and protective, and Rosa is immediately drawn to him. Soon they accept their mutual attraction, but how can a romance work between Rosa and the agent who is investigating her and her family? Add to the mix all the drama associated with a drug cartel, a host of secrets that Ernesto has spent a good portion of his life trying to hide, the bitterness and need for revenge that has consumed Rosa's mother for years, and a reality that is never quite the way it seems, and you have the makings of a whirlwind of a story.It is not often I read a book that makes me want to ignore my chores just to sneak in a few more pages but CAUGHT UP definitely did that. It is the perfect blend of romance, drama and suspense. The author's use of flashbacks was superb, it was almost as if she was telling two stories at once. As soon as I would get caught up in the events occurring in the present, she would take me back into the past and before I knew it, she was carrying me into the future again. Along the way, she develops a solid set of characters. I understood how their past pains influenced their behavior, I appreciated their flaws and I felt compassion for all of them. This book is all about balance; balancing past and present events, balancing character development with a fast-moving and unpredictable plot, and balancing romance, suspense and drama, and boy did Deatri King-Bey accomplish this. The result is a page-turner you won't want to put down -- so as a word of warning, cook your dinner before you pick up CAUGHT UP.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Caught Up (Indigo Vibe)","review":"Caught Up is a contemporary novel. A hard and fast fiction/mystery. The characters are well flushed out and fascinating. Rosa is Caught Up but strong and holds her own-- the death-cell scene proves that. The drug cartel depiction is deadly, yet the story has its endearing moments between daughter and fathers as well. Yes I said fathers. Deatri knows how to smooth the hard angles and not lose the power of the scene. If you like intriguing mysteries this is the book to read, not doubt. It really is a page-turner! I'm most interested in knowing her next project."},{"Title":"Caught Up (Indigo Vibe)","review":"I have to admit that it's been a long time since I've read an entire book in one day. But after reading the first chapter of this novel, I knew that I wouldn't be able to rest tonight until the last page was turned. I give this book five stars because it surpassed all genres. It was a 1) mystery, 2) romance, 3)suspense, 4)thriller, and 5) everything else rolled into one. I loved all of the characters in this book (even the bad ones had their redeeming qualities). I appreciate the storytelling skills of Deatri King-Bey. She has a distinctive style of writing that pulls you into the story and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the last page. I'm adding her to my list of \\"new\\" favorite authors, and I look forward to reading her future novels. I understand that she has several books waiting to be released, and I'm waiting to read them. Thanks for the great read!"},{"Title":"Caught Up (Indigo Vibe)","review":"Rosa Bolivar has loved her father, Ernesto, all of her life. In her mind he can do no wrong, despite her mother's claim during drunken rages that he is a monster. Just days after Rosa's thirtieth birthday, hidden truths come to light and secrets long ago buried come back to haunt Ernesto. When Rosa discovers Ernesto may not be who she thinks he is she begins a journey on a path towards the truth--a journey that begins at a Florida prison where a drug king sits on death row. During Rosa's visit she meets Samson, a DEA agent who is out to prove Ernesto is not the high-powered business man that Rosa believes him to be. To Rosa's dismay, she quickly finds herself falling in love with Samson and for Samson, the feeling is mutual. Suddenly, Rosa finds herself torn between remaining loyal to Ernesto and exploring her new found feelings for Samson.I found this to be an excellent read. The characters were well-developed and the plot unfolded at a nice and steady pace. King-Bey's ability to draw her readers into the story and keep them turning pages is outstanding. I anxiously await her second novel, as her talents will only age like fine wine. I definitely recommend that you get caught up with King-Bey.T.

I had to back track to some of her earlier work after reading and enjoying \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". I found this novel to be fresh and captivating. The book started off a little slow for me, and I got worried thinking I wouldn't be able to get through it. However, I was seriously mistaken, after getting to the second chapter, it definitely turned out to be well worth the read. It was a very intriguing romance, drama and suspense. I thought the way Mrs. King-Bey combined the present with flashbacks to the past flowed nicely, as if you were getting two stories for the price of one. She develops a solid set of characters. I found myself empathizing with their situations and how their pasts issues influenced many of the decisions they made, be it a right or wrong decision. This novel had a fast-moving and unpredictable plot, that constantly kept you wonder what would happen next. I loved Samson's character. He is definitely every woman's fantasy man, attractive, thoughtful, intelligent, and ever the protector. I enjoyed the instant attraction between Samson and Rosa and the fact that David (her real father) even thought that it was fate that brought them together and approved of Samson taking care of his daughter when he couldn't.

They were wrong, but I was the one that got fired. I've always done pretty good on the first eight rules, but No. 9 is the reason that I've spent most of my career working for myself. That way I can't fight with the boss, or if I do, I can win because I'm the boss as well as the employee.Rule 16, Read Books, is one with which I completely agree. The best business leaders in the world write books on their lives, philosophies, even business rules. I find that I can't read one of these books without picking up an idea or two that makes the small price of the book.As stated in the title, this book is a little set of 56 rules for a successful business career.

However, for me it is only worth the sacrifices because I love what I do. Working for money and only money is self-destructive in the long run.

Often those who are linked with the left or the communist party are thought of as being aligned with the fascism of Hitler. This is a grave error! Many were involved in the fight against facism. These people were concerned with fair working hours and wages for the working class who were often abused by the steamroller of industrialism. We do not realize that the eight-hour work day we take for granted today was something these people fought for. This book does an excellent job recovering a lost chapter in American history. Nelson writes this history with incredible fluidity and grace. It is filled with many pictures of the poetry documents from his own collection. And despite the political poetry of this period being marginalized and forgotten for decades, it is powerful and moving poetry that serves wider purposes than just its historical context. There is a lot that people of our modern generation could learn and relate with to our current societal struggles. Open your mind and read. You will learn an incredible amount of information about these unsung heroes of our past."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Memory: Recovering the Poetry of the American Left","review":"In part because so many important documents and texts now appear to be lost irretrievably, through careless indifference or malice, Cary Nelson tells us right upfront there that is \\"no one story to tell\\" in the history of American poetry of the Left during the first half of the twentieth century, but he insists that there are many stories that might still be told.Without a single narrative arc, Nelson's book isn't as dramatic a statement as his groundbreaking volume Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politcs of Cultural Memory, 1910-1945. He begins with a sampling of poems, beginning with Markham's once famous \\"The Man with a Hoe,\\" that (he claims), the New Critical establishment wanted to will away, and from the patchwork assortment he moves on to a striking test case, a poet called Edwin Rolfe and the vicissitudes of his career. I had just about heard of Edwin Rolfe and had no idea of the extent of his involvement in various causes and poetics, but Nelson is not really interested in reviving the reputation of any one forgotten poet. He is more keen rather on presenting Left poetry as a whole, and the third part of his book really had me quarreling in my head with some of his decisions. He suggests that a good way to understand the poetry of the left would be to take various lines from various poems and make your own poem out of it. and he does this on several occasions.I found the results singularly unconvincing and, of course, \\"nervy\\" isn't the word for it. A monkey, no, even one of my cats, could have constructed a stronger poem than the \\"poetry chorus\\" Nelson makes out of scraps and lines from a few dozen poets. I think emotionally I believe in what he is saying, but there must be a less self-serving way for him to go about it. (In this light, why, why, why on every page, whenever there's an illustration, must we get the same tag, \\"From the collection of the author\\"? Just put it in the front of the book and have done with it. Otherwise you're just asking for burglars to come to our office and take what must surely be the largest collection of left-poetry-ephemera ever publicized in one book.)Part III dealt with left causes in general and how to make one poem out of them, but Part IV ups the ante by narrowing in on a particular body of work, the poetry of the Spanish Civil War (not all of it by Americans, in this chapter). Nelson is a brilliant scholar and the things he does with language are astounding, and never more so than the way in which, here, like dominoes, one simple flick of his pen causes hundreds of scholarly and popular misconceptions to fall down in sequence... he should be in the Guinness Book of World Records for two reasons."},{"Title":"THE POCKET AQUINAS.","review":"\\"The Pocket Aquinas\\" is a good introduction to the world of Thomistic thought and writing. The book is divided into eight, topically organized sections highlighting the main themes of St. Thomas' work. Within each section there are collections of his work dealing with questions pertinent to the section's subject. Each section concludes with a list of suggested readings.Overall I feel that the reading of this book I was introduced to a condensed version of Aquinas' thought. What is missing is the \\"feel\\" of Aquinas' work which one can only get from a reading of a large, unabridged section of a tome. Although I generally have little interest in abridgments, I feel that I have learned a bit of St. Thomas' wisdom. For this \\"The Pocket Aquinas\\" is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"THE POCKET AQUINAS.","review":"I can't really comment on The Pocket Aquinas' usefulness as an introduction to Thomistic philosophy and theology. I was already well-steeped in Thomistic thought before I discovered it. However, of all the books I own, this is the one I have inevitably gone to first (not exclusively, but first) when attempting to puzzle out some fine point of St. Thomas' thought.It's not that what's here is not also available elsewhere, because for the most part it is. It's that the book's editor has a keen grasp of what is essential for understanding the Thomistic and, through St. Thomas, Aristotelian principles upon which Aquinas' thought is grounded. There are no superfluous texts here. Every one of them has something important to offer. It's regrettable that even more could not have been included, of course, but there is a limit to the size of most men's pockets.This book will not \\"teach you Aquinas,\\" but then again, neither will either of the Summas. Grasping St. Thomas' meaning requires long, dedicated effort that encompasses all of his writings. What this volume will do is provide you with a quick way to get at the nut of important points that otherwise might require you to spend considerable time flipping through the pages of his larger tomes. I give The Pocket Aquinas a very well-deserved five stars."},{"Title":"From the Last Supper Through the Resurrection: The Saviors Final Hours","review":"This is a wonderful compilation of essays about the final hours of Christ's life written by various LDS scholars. This kind of reminds me of an updated version of Talmage's \`Jesus the Christ', except much more focused and written by multiple people.The book consists of 14 essays written by 13 different scholars, all from BYU. It is broken into 3 parts; the historical setting, the story, and current issues. Each essay covers a different subject or time frame and despite the different authors, flows very well together.Under the historical setting part there were two essays. The first was on Jesus' prophecies of his death and resurrection, and the second was on the time frame between Bethany and his entry into Jerusalem.In the second part, each piece of the story is told giving details that scholars have dug up in recent years about life and customs in Jerusalem and the Roman Empire during that time frame. The first essay is about the last supper according to the synoptic gospels. The next essay is about the last supper according to John. The following essay is about what happened at Gethsemane. Another essay talks about the arrest. It is followed by a description of Christ before the Jewish authorities. The next author describes Jesus before the Romans. The seventh essay talks about the crucifixion. The next goes into details about the burial. The last essay in this section talks about the resurrection.In the third part, there are three essays covering various issues. The first talks about other early accounts of the story of the last days of Jesus with emphasis on snippets taken from Paul's epistles since they were written before the gospels were. The second essay talks about the responsibility for Christ's death and brings up several good points. The final essay discusses the conspiracy to deny the literal resurrection of Christ and how the Gnostics and others latched onto the Greek concept of a God without body, parts, or passions. It was a fascinating essay.This book is the third part of a three volume set, and I will definitely read the first two volumes. Not only is it full of scholarly information, but the authors each have a strong love for and testimony of Christ. I learned a lot of new information and highly recommend this book for those interested in learning more about the final hours of Christ."},{"Title":"From the Last Supper Through the Resurrection: The Saviors Final Hours","review":"In this book, 13 Ph.D. instructors from Brigham Young University and one part-time teacher in Religious Education at B.Y.U. with an M.A. in Anthropology, take on the world's New Testament scholars who portray Jesus Christ as anything other than G-d. Phew! I enjoyed the read and think they did a nice job presenting their case. Lots of footnotes - a serious book! The chapters explain when Jesus began his mission and tell among other things the details regarding Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. The resurrection is said to be the one event that actually validated Jesus' claim to be the Messiah and Son of G-d. One chapter was about the problem the former scholars of old had in not accepting the doctrine of Resurrection. The retired professor of Ancient History wrote in the closing pages of the book how the concept of G-d got all gummed-up and the ideas of Greek philosophy were used to create a hellenized deity! Her discourse is worth the price of the book. The entire book helped me overall to make some new discoveries and to pick-up many fascinating details about a life that I, admittedly, know so very little about."},{"Title":"From the Last Supper Through the Resurrection: The Saviors Final Hours","review":"As expected, with the advent of 2011 and the beginning of a year learning, and learning from, The New Testament, there have been a significant number of offerings by LDS writers, on that vulume of scripture. Relying on the reputation of, and my personal respect for, one of the authors, I purchased and began reading this book. A third of the way into it, I stopped.Other readers must make up their own minds about this; because to me this book seems to be more of a display of one of the author's views of the value of his erudition, than a conribution to an unstanding of the Western record of the ministry, teachings, and sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ is preemptively in second place; with the gospel writers, of whom one is given the impression were more a muddled bunch of second-hand mythologists than witnesses of those \\"things that are most surly believed among us\\", are a very distant third.Another volume in which these writes are enumerated as authors, is \\"Jesus Christ and The World of The New Testament\\". Unlike last year's \\"Jehovah And The World Od The Old Testament\\", this book is simply awful. Beginning with a disappointed expectation that a book should bear a consistency with English syntax and grammar, in which it fails on at leat half of it's pages; and going on to further displays of irrelevant erudition (in which Hebrew or Geek approximations are given for English words where nothing is contributed); one encounters a narrative history and doctrine which is not only errs but brushes heresy with it's sleeve.Both of the books are best avoidedRobert B.

I have regularly assigned it to my undergraduate and graduate students at both the University of Central Arkansas (where I taught until 1999) and Temple University, and most have never failed to get a lot out of it (including those who are professional military officers).In many ways, the book is a reflection of America's experience in the Vietnam War, where the side with the larger armies, greater wealth, and technological advantages failed to win. To say that the Confederacy lost the Civil War simply because it was outnumbered and outgunned is only half the story. Why did Confederates choose to quit when their forebears in the American Revolution persevered against even more formidable odds? While some may question this book's insufficient nationalism thesis, it is delineated with such grace and authority that the effort demands respect.The book begins by providing a comprehensive overview of previously offered theories explaining the fall of the Confederacy. That historiographical survey alone makes this book worth the price of admission and makes it an invaluable tool for the serious Civil War student.As some of the other reviews here attest, this is not a book for those who prefer their Civil War history as vapid entertainment. If you are just interested in killing, there are plenty of good battle and campaign histories to read. But if you are the kind who wonders why nations rise and fall and how wars are won and lost, you will find this a rewarding and thought-provoking experience."},{"Title":"Written by Two Women : \\"An Unauthorized Tell All of How to Buy A Car\\"","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ME.

This is a growing field and a very important one today. Our social denial has kept us from looking clearly at the illness and the ways it manifests in our caregivers. There are benefits to both the afflicted and those whose lives they touch when recovery is given the support described in Dr. Coombs's book."},{"Title":"Drug-impaired professionals","review":"The abuse of drugs, legal and illegal, by professionals has been a subject little discussed within the hearing of outsiders.Coombs breaks the silence to quite rightly view addiction as an occupational hazard, detailing the extraordinary stresses, ready access, and high performance expectations among contributing factors, as well as emotional elements and a surprising degree of naivete. He examines the dynamics of addiction; the vulnerabilities and developmental stages, and discusses the recovery tools available to break free.Some may question the author's inclusion of hashish and marijuana in the array of addictive drugs, and the unwary reader who acts on Coombs' assertion that &quot;LSD produces symptoms similar to those of stimulants&quot; (page 296) is in for a bit of a surprise, but taken as a whole the work is a valuable survey of a significant problem which deserves wider discussion, within the professions and without.(The &quot;score&quot; rating is an ineradicable feature of the page.

B. Alan Wallace explains the major parts of Tibetan Dharma practice in very Western, everyday language. Never does he simplify or generalize, he's a talented author with a deep understanding of his subject and an ability to put it into to terms that a beginner from the West can understand.

If one wants more detail check out John Powers', Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism which runs, as an introduction, some 470 pages. For one who is looking for the essence of this practice without too much dedication of time, this is the book. You will come away with a very good idea of what this type of buddhism is and why it is important."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","review":"This was a great introductory book on Buddhism.

Allan Wallace has extremely impressive credentials. He was ordained by the Dali Lama, earned an undergraduate degree in Physics and a Ph.D. from Stanford University. Therefore, he is well qualified from an exposure to the concepts point of view.My experience reading this book, however, was mixed. While the author has impressive credentials, his material is easily accessible and he make it relevant to Western people, he often left me wanting more of an explanation or more detail.In an attempt to make the concept of Tibetan Buddhism accessible, I found that Mr. Wallace often over simplified his explanations. He appeals to common sense, but I found this book lacked the depth I was looking for given an author with such an impressive background."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","review":"This is by far the best explanatory book on Tibetan Buddhism I've read. It should be a Must Read for everyone interested in this fascinating philosophy and life style. Although targeted for beginners mostly, it is a thorough book for us in the western cultures. Easy to read and thought provoking. This books deserves a ten star rating and a special mantra. Buy it! Another recommended book is Open Heart, Clear Mind by Thubten Chodron."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","review":"My teacher suggested this book for anyone new to Tibetan Buddhism. It's well-written and has basic information for some of the most popular questions a new person might have. It's a good \\"starting point\\" as well as a good text for anyone wanting to expand their knowledge of various paths of life."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","review":"This is an edited version of a lecture series in Seattle in 1988, ordered from basic to \\"more subtle & advanced\\" based on the author-monk's 18 years study in all 4 schools + Pali texts. It is intended as a \\"guide to practice\\" esp. for those w/o Buddhist background. I found it simple, straight-forward, & easy to understand. As a short book it cannot bring much breadth to its vast subject, is simplistic at times (e.g. inadequately addressing self), & explanatory/descriptive vs. analytical/critical. Thus, the scientific, skeptical, western perspective is minimal, greatly reducing the potential value of a western Buddhist insider's viewpoint. Further, the author seems nave--e.g. p. 134: \\"We are born with a natural, unlearned sense of intrinsic self.\\" Psychologists have shown that self-consciousness is developmental not inbred--only the potential is inbred (similar to Buddha nature). Similarly, he says p. 134: \\"The workers, acting together, manage themselves.\\" I suggest they'd need management ability, skills & training (e.g. most startup businesses fail)--see Elliott Jaques'Executive Leadership: A Practical Guide to Managing Complexity (Developmental Management)&Human Capability: A Study of Individual Potential and Its Application. But he also makes some fine observations: p. 176: \\"If one were a bee, for instance, one's perception of this page would be very different than it is for a human. Similarly, it would look uniquely different to a bat, an owl, or a snake, p. 180: As the renowned physicist Werner Heisenberg said, \`What we observe is not nature itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning,' & p. 181: We reify an object by removing it from its context, by ignoring the subjective influences of perception & conception.\\" He also provides a good exercise--visualizing bubbles rising & bursting (p. 114) which was new for me. All in all it's a pretty good elementary introduction to Buddhism IMHO, but I much prefer Thubten Chodron (\\"Open Heart, Clear Mind\\" & \\"Buddhism for Beginners\\"), Pema Chodron, & Surya Das. These authors provide more depth, breadth, & practical value than this book IMO."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","review":"This is no doubt the best explanatory book on Tibetan Buddhismaround.

But don't worry about it.This book is just the very best. It makes everything clear about the subject matter. And it basically covers everything that you will need. It does so in a very systematic manner.And Wallace writes in a very clear mathematical manner (he is a physicist). I do believe that you will enjoy reading this book like I did. But better yet, I think that it will make a very complicated subject easy to understand. It's quite an accomplishment. This is my favorite book on explaining Tibetan Buddhism.

Colson gives a sincere first-handaccount of how he learned to humble himself and surrendercontrol of his life to the Holy Spirit for the glory of God.Colson's story presents a dramatic challenge for any believer."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Charles Colson went to prison for something completely unrelated to Watergate! For saying bad things about somebody. It wasn't worded that way, (I think it was called disseminating untrue or scandalous information about someone) but that basically is what it was. I was shocked! Colson could have avoided prison altogether, IF he would admit he knew about the Watergate break-in beforehand. He didn't know about it, and he wouldn't lie and say he did. So he went to prison. Explain that one to me....no, never mind, I know what it was. POLITICS. A form of lynching if you ask me. So Colson went to prison for something that wouldn't normally send a person to prison. Reading &quot;Born Again&quot; was a real eye opener. &quot;They&quot; were determined to send him to prison for something. Anyway, changing gears.....This book involves politics and a great conversion story. I couldn't stop the tears from flowing. I cried me a river while reading &quot;Born Again.&quot; Not since reading &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; when I was a little girl have I cried so much. I came away with a great respect for Charles Colson. He may have been a cut throat politician in many ways, but I also saw a great loyalty to his friends that I found endearing. Even after it was all said and done, Mr. Colson still had affection for President Nixon. I can only admire him for that.This is a great book, a great story. God Bless Charles Colson."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"This book was an excellent read. He did a great job at describing the events of Watergate while giving specific details of his conversion. I could hardly put this book down and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"One of the best books on the history of President Nixon and Watergate and how being humbled will let one realize the need a savoir. ( some one smarter than you are !!! ) :.)"},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"There are a lot of lessons to be learned from Born Again, and Colson shares them as opposed to teaching them, with the fresh, excited style of new convert so that the reader if he is a crusty old saint (like me) is carried back to the days of his first love.The book is part political insight, part Wartergate/Nixon history, but mostly testimony, and the testimony of God dealing with and finally saving someone who wasn't particularly looking or particularly worthy or even, in spite of prison coming on, particularly desperate. The issue and focus of the book is on God dealing with man, and the backdrop is Watergate and prison which makes it interesting to a broad spectrum, but the focus is always on the gift of the cross. Colson is a decent, in fact, pretty good writer, and unlike many Watergate figures apparently did his own writing. It still flows, but flows within a framework of authenticity as opposed to slick ghost-writing. I've read a few other of his books, but this is the cornerstone, and it is probably worth reading even to the secular because it was such a pivotal story. Not many testimonies become movies, even Billy Graham movies, and that sort of underlines the significance. Probably to the late 70s and early 80s what Cross and the Switchblade was to the earlier Jesus Freak era. I really enjoyed this book, it both informs and inspires. Critics looking for some disavowal of everything America and conservatism stands for will be disappointed, but again, that's not what the book is about- the politics are merely a vehicle for the story of redemption, and it is spiritual and not political redemption."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"\\"Born Again\\" is the story of Chuck Colson's life from the Nixon presidency to his release from the Maxwell AFB prison facility with some comments on his early life.The first 250 or so pages deal with his time serving Nixon and of the circumstances that led to his accepting Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and Lord. The book's last 100 pages or so deal with his relationships with other prisoners in the Maxwell facility.Indeed, some skeptics question whether Colson had a true conversion and is using the book to promote himself. If so, then why does Colson mention a positive change in relationships with his political enemies after becoming a Christian? Indeed, one of his strongest supporters (Harold Hughes) was a Democratic senator from Iowa (Colson was a Republican). Oh well!The book flows freely and is intensely interesting. \\"Born Again\\" reflects the popularity and enjoyable reading of other Colson books. Whether you are a Republican or Democrat (sorry political junkies, God is neither!), a Colson supporter or hater, a Nixon supporter or hater, you will enjoy Colson's \\"Born Again\\".Colson's prison experience was not wasted. God used this time to burden Colson with the need to minister to prisoners today through the worldwide Prison Fellowship ministry. Yet again, God can take something good out of something bad.Read and enjoy the book and be challenged to realize that despite your background, God can work great and mighty things through a person who is surrendered to Him!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"This book not only provides readers with a picture of events and personalities within the Nixon Administration (and of dirty politics), but also reveals the story of how Nixon's &quot;Hatchet Man&quot; came to faith in Jesus Christ"},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Wow, this really opened my eyes to the world of politics and what really goes on behind the scenes. (not that I wasn't surprised) For Chuck Colson to stand up to his beliefs amongst the wolves was such an encouragement. Encouragement for me to be able to stand up to the \\"wolves\\" of this world."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Colson wrote this book to tell how he came to Jesus as a result of doing time for his role in Watergate. Colson was described by Nixon as an SOB, thats really saying something. Colson did whatever the Nixon people wanted, and with very little remorse. So, it is not a surprise that he was a willing participant in some of the Watergate activities. He was mean, arrogant, and sneaky. Well, this story relates how his time in the joint lead him to become a Christian who would become known as none of these things. The transformation is a powerful one, and a good tale, but one overly political. Get it, if you like politics."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Great book!

An epic story."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Charles Colson resembles the adulterous minister in the Scarlet Letter. Before his parishioners, Arthur Dimmesdale confesses error freely but gives no specifics. Colson too confesses overweening pride, but gives no, or few, specifics. And where he gives specifics, he confesses no error. He denies involvement in Watergate but acknowledges defaming Daniel Ellsberg, an action that he alleges is no crime. In fact, he says he had to convince the judge to allow him to plead guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with the Ellsberg matter even though technically he broke no law. Colson did nothing, saw nothing, said nothing. He is a great sinner in the abstract but not in the concrete.His conversion seems to be genuine but limited. He went from being the grandest political operative to being the grandest sinner. After he found Christ, rather than going home, falling to his knees, opening his heart, and closing his mouth, he went to White House prayer breakfasts and discussed his conversion on \\"60 Minutes.\\" He surrendered all but the spotlight.An interesting autobiography still. The portion in which he writes about his prison experience sounds authentic."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Chuck Colson's life is one of having done so many wrong things, like most of us. Then he had an encounter with God, and his life changed, things that were important were not anymore, and he put his life into the hands of God. A Must Read! I found more titles by this author available for my Kindle at Amazon. Where else?"},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"It's been 30 years since the events of Watergate started making history. A whole generation has grown up largely unaware, I suspect, of the significance of those events. I've followed Chuck Colson's work and writing almost since the beginning of Prison Fellowship and have developed a tremendous respect for the man. But only recently have I bothered to go back and read this book which tells how it all got started. I should not have waited so long.This is the very inspiring and honest story of Colson's early career as chief counsel, confidant and friend to President Richard Nixon. As an insider, he gives his own account of the Watergate scandal and an honest confession of his own wrongdoings. This is also the story about how God can change the life of a man caught up in the corrupting influence of political power and bring great good out of evil. Since he was not directly involved in the Watergate doings, Colson probably could have easily avoided being convicted and sent to prison. But his encounter with Jesus Christ and conversion to Christianity strengthened his conscience and led him to plead guilty to an unrelated crime that he did commit. He went to prison and saw a different side of the \\"law and order\\" society that the Nixon Administration sought to promote. Even through the fear and despair of those times, the power of God became even more evident to Chuck Colson while in prison.This is an amazing account of how a life submitted to Jesus Christ can reconcile enemies, create strong bonds of friendship, and heal terrible wounds in the hearts of both the rich and powerful and the poor and helpless. It's wonderful to read. If this book has an impact on you, then you will also want to read its sequel, \\"Life Sentence\\"."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"Born Again is a somewhat trite title, but the contents of the book are not so. There are so many biographies out there that are lists of events and facts that surround a person; this is not one of them. Colson explains to you what is happening in his mind and heart. It is not merely a book about his conversion, it is the story of the changing of his heart.Throughout the story, you see the power of God working, not only in Colson, but in the lives of the people around him. I sometimes wonder if Colson painted too bright a picture of the Christians he met like Doug Coe and Tom Phillips, but even if he did, those lights are surely what Colson saw in the midst of his darkness. The changing power of God was evident in them in this work, as was the power in him. Also evident was the power of Christian community that is often lacking in the church. Hughes' offering that the bonds of Christianity overrided their political separation and that he would be willing to give Chuck anything and trust him with it was a powerful statement.I read this book years ago and found it good. Having grown and come back to reread it, I found it better. It is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"If ever a gust of fresh air wafted out of the smog of Watergate, the story of Christ coming into the life of Chuck Colson has to be part of it. I loved this book. It is a simple, quick, and uplifting read. Colson rejected a full scholarship to Harvard on a matter of principle, and his grittiness, perseverance, and humbling transformation shine as examples of God's artistic handiwork. As other readers have mentioned, Colson is extremely forthright and honest, both in recounting his pre-Christian mentality and his post-conversion weaknesses. He does so to the point of making himself vulnerable and willingly so. I so much appreciate that decision, as I am sure do many others. He details the &quot;obvious&quot; at the risk of seeming simplistic, if only because those simple observations stuck with him and impacted him. One clear example can be found upon his entry to the prison at Maxwell Air Base: &quot;Not only were all uniforms the same drab brown; so were the expressions on the faces. Something strange here. Then it struck me--no one was smiling.&quot; This is a fine book and worth reading. One final excerpt to encourage you: &quot;My new friend then handed me a copy of the Phillips version of the New Testament, inscribed: To Charles--It is better to fail in a cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail--God bless you! Doug. Matthew 6:33. How those words were to haunt and lead me in the days to come!&quot;"},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":". . . as readers of my reviews have probably figured out. I have been familiar with this book for many years, but only recently have I taken the time to sit down and read it through.\\"Born Again\\" is an honest and forthright admission of sinfulness and forgiveness, tracing Mr. Colson's path through Watergate and prison to the freedom in Christ he now enjoys.To the best of my recollection, this is the first book to be published by one of the \\"Watergate figures\\". Magruder's book came out shortly afterward, and Haldeman wrote two (contradictory) books on the subject. I wonder if the Charles Colson of 2005 would view the events of 1972-1974 as the Charles Colson of 1976 did. I wonder if he would have made some of the same choices now as he did as a brand-new Christian (with a great deal of guilt on his conscience).Regardless, both as an \\"insider's account\\" of the Nixon White House, and as a testimony of how Christ can change a life, \\"Born Again\\" is definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"BORN AGAIN","review":"This book is timeless.

I say that because most of them involve extended and personalizable interactions with the charcters in the meditation. The writing is poetic, but not flowery. The mediations are written in paragraphs with pauses between them for taking breaths and allowing the participants to interact with their astral enviroment. This has proven very effective for me because I can read it to myself without having to pull out that much. The meditation, for me, takes place during the pauses.The overall quality of the meditations varies a bit but most of them are quite good. The mabon and full moon (artemis) meditations in particular really touched me. They do have a tendency to be long, but not overly so. If I'm reading them for an audience that isn't trained in meditation then I often skip parts to keep it within a 15 minute time frame.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys guided meditations and pathworkings geared for the pagan. Great for personal or coven journeys. One note to the easily offended - the Beltane meditation is quite explict.

The emotions leapt off the pages and into my heart making me feel that she was writing just for me. Her narration can be compared to listening to an old time radio show where the listener uses her imagination to visualize the realistic characters and settings described in the broadcast. Ms. Holmes has set the table for a party and served up the feast that is so delicious that you have to finish every morsel, including the cannolis and espresso for dessert. The descriptions she gives of the Hudson Valley and Italy is so vivid that they make one feel as though they have been there. Furthermore, this novel is so well crafted that it cries out to be turned into a script for a TV movie as suggested by another reviewer. Perhaps the author had this in mind for a future project. I hope so!What makes this novel so good though, is seeing how the heroine, Gianna, works through the conflict between her love for Vincenzo, who is married but loves Gianna, and her conscience. She lives and breathes this man all the time, wanting to be with him every waking moment, but gets pulled back to reality by her strict, moral, upbringing that taught her that an affair with a married man is wrong. Therefore, she must make a decision about continuing her relationship with Vincenzo. Were they both completely open and honest with each other in the beginning? Does she walk away from him without closure, thus leaving him in the dark as to why she doesn't want him, which is fine if she never crosses paths with him again, but if she does, then what? They are still hung up on each other! Does she sit down with him and tell him frankly she can't get involved with a married man, and send him away with closure? Neither party may be happy about this option, but at least she will feel that she did the right thing for herself, and he will know where he stands, and will likely give up pursuit of an affair that he now realizes can never happen. Alternatively, does she go to him regardless of the consequences and take a chance on love, either having her hopes dashed on the rocks of despair or winding up happily with him? Do the twists and turns of fate resolve their relationship favorably or unfavorably, and do things always happen for a reason, as the author believes? Above all, will Gianna act in a mature way and maintain her pride and bearing regardless of whatever hand Fate deals the lovers? With all these possibilities, the reader has to throw up her hands and ask in frustration, \\"Why are all the good ones taken?\\"Mary-Jo Holmes is analogous to a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis in the spring after spending a long winter in hibernation. The romance novel reading public, through this work, will learn about her writing talent. Another reader recommended reading her newsletter on her website. I did! It's wonderful and so inspirational. This lady has a big, warm heart and it's present in \\"Gianna\\". Where has she been hiding these past years? She's a dazzling writer who should be getting more exposure. She will after this effort."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"I wanted to give a West Coast perspective/review of Gianna that is more in line with the first review of 5 stars. I believe the subsequent reviewers missed the underlying themes and elements that make this book such a good read. First of all, though clearly a romance, it's far from the typical bodice-ripper with long, drawn out passages. The author's prose is crisply descriptive, and I found each scene propelling the story forward. Though Gianna and Vincenzo find love, there are specific elements that keep them apart. Gianna's alliance to her family, specifically her mother, show the staunch life of being raised in a traditional Italian home where respect of parental opinions and values result in suppression of feelings and ultimately life-altering choices. These decisions that Gianna made might have been different had her mother not been so judgmental, and Gianna, in hindsight, realizes that she should have given her mother the opportunity to be supportive. Consequently, Gianna's fault lies not in being insecure but in being a respectful Italian-American daughter, which in itself is not a flaw but a strength of character. Gianna's best friend, Trina, was raised in a similar household, and through the author's characterization, we see that Trina is the flipside of Gianna-someone very regimented in opinions who will repeat the cycle of a strict, moral-based Italian-American household.Another immensely important scene deals with Gianna's brother (Michael) wanting to have an affair because his marriage has become wearisome due to difficulties in conceiving a baby. The stress of infertility rocks marriages to the core, and Gianna learns that Michael's temptation to have an affair has nothing to do with him not loving his wife. This is vital to her own affair with Vincenzo, and it ultimately effects her decision when he proposes.I found this novel to be layered with deep meaning. It is not a typical romance and should not be viewed like one. Rather, it's a piece of fiction with serious themes, drizzled with romance. 5 stars"},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"Gianna is a well written, compelling love story about an Italian-American woman &quot;Gianna&quot; and her love affair with Vincenzo. Without giving away too much of the story (and this is a story with several twists and turns), Gianna finds herself battling her conscience and the traditions on which she was raised as her romance with Vincenzo spirals into a deep love. Their scenes together are tender and sensual, and the author draws you into their lives with provocative text that makes you truly care about what happens to these characters and makes you route for a happy ending. I especially loved Gianna's interaction with her family which rang true to heart and reminded me very much of my Italian family. Gianna is a wonderful book which I heartfully recommend to everyone wanting to read a great romance and come away inspired! 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"Mrs. Holmes's first attempt at a writing a romance novel is laudable for several reasons. She has an excellent command of the English language and many of her descriptive paragraphs are wonderful. Her inclusion of Italian poetry is lovely.However, the book demonstrates little awareness of human nature. Situations are contrived, unbelieveable.The story line is poor and at times laughable. The use of the Italian language, although lovely poetic pieces, does little to support the plot."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"A classic romance for the intelligent woman who could use an escape. This story never drags. Instead, it unfolds rhythmically, all the while building suspicion and suspense, and at the same time delighting the reader with beautiful visuals painted in words. It's like strolling through a romance display in an art gallery."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"I cannot understand why the reviews of this book on this site are like a readers' discussion group. \\"Gianna\\", A Love Story&quot;, is nothing more than it sets out to be-a romance novel. This plot would easily lend itself to a script for a movie that could be shown on either the \\"Lifetime\\" or \\"WE\\" channels.It is reasonably well written, but not great, and follows the traditional formula for such a work, e.g. the definition of a romance novel. I found it to be enjoyable in spite of some long-winded and pretentious passages about Carnegie Hall and wine, but other than that, take it for what it is intended to be, a story of two people falling in love, struggling with their morals, but pressing on with their affair in spite of obstacles that keep rising in their path that seem designed by fate to keep them apart. The two lovers are presented with situations that could happen to anyone whether they are Italian or Polish. That's why we identify with them.The narrative at times is amateurish and Ms. Holmes has not hit her stride in this first effort, which can be considered to be a prototype upon which to build better narrative writing. One has to read Ms.Holmes' newsletter on her website to see her writing at it's very best. Although it borders on being an expression of self-help, it is truly excellent. Should her next novel come up to the writing excellence of her newsletter, she would be on her way to a fabulous writing career. Men would fall at her feet if they were lucky enough to read her work and see the passion and enthusiasm in it, which readily reveals her soul and intelligence. We women, who are hopeless romantics anyway and thrive on this genre', eagerly await her next opus.Read \\"Gianna\\" and enjoy it as the author meant it to be, an adventure in true and everlasting love."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"Mrs. Holmes is to be commended for writing a romance which demonstrates her facility at writing descriptive paragraphs. Her inclusion of lovely Italian poetry is a nice touch. However, the characters are totally unbelieveable. That you could mistake your old uncle's voice and that of a handsome young stranger is laughable. Books shows no understanding of human nature and logical progression of events at all. Poetry, though nice, does nothing whatsoever to enhance the storyline.How someone could assign a 5 star review is beyond me."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"At first glance, this book is the standard romance novel of girl meets boy, girl loses boy, and then a happy denouement. Nevertheless, as it turns out, \\"Gianna\\" is more than a story with the usual twists of fate that lead to a romantic conclusion. Upon close examination, we find the heroine is an emotionally insecure woman in spite of possessing a high degree of intelligence and beauty holding down a successful career. Even though she has obviously had relationships with men in the past, none have been successful because of these insecurities that stem from being raised by a nagging Italian mother who is mired in ancient family values that are out of touch with the 21st Century and modern women. Although Gianna tries to be free of her mother's apron strings, she is always pulled back to the old ways and can't live the life she wants until she breaks free of her upbringing. Her best friend has strong values and tries to make Gianna understand that she is heading down a path to unhappiness, but Gianna thinks her friend is being judgmental and allows her emotions to take over which brings about the usual results.\\"Gianna\\" starts out well, but many flaws in this work soon become apparent. Instead of the author relying on gimmicks to resolve thorny issues, it would have been better for her to give the heroine the wherewithal to overcome the obstacles that block her way to happiness. The plot becomes derivative of an old soap opera and descends from there into mediocrity.Ms. Holmes writing lacks the maturity for \\"Gianna\\" to be a winner. At times, there is too much verbiage as though the author is required to fill a prescribed number of pages, and the careless editing caused this reader to be distracted from the flow of the story. For example, the lead in \\"Tosca\\" is \\"Cavaradossi\\", not \\"Davaradossi\\", there is no \\"e\\" in \\"whilst\\", and \\"doable\\" is not generally hyphenated; in her synopsis, she means \\"purest of loves\\", not \\"purist\\". That's plain sloppiness. Furthermore, her writing is missing that certain warmth and sparkle that would bring life to her prose. In short, Ms. Holmes style is sterile. She needs to better understand her inner Self in order to inject soul into her work and possibly rise above the level of the ordinary in her chosen genre'."},{"Title":"Gianna: a love story","review":"For the most part, this book is a fairy tale and should be regarded as such. The only part of this fantasy that rings true is Ms. Holmes' description of the nagging Italian mother who is never satisfied with anything her daughter does.It is also unlikely that Gianna's brother who is married to the infertile wife would go and have an affair for that reason alone. Ms. Holmes paragraphs are overly descriptive, rambling, and corny, and she definitely lacks an understanding of human nature, men in particular.\\"Gianna\\" is laced with spelling errors and an incorrect name of a male opera role. This poor editing and fact checking lends to the reader a feeling of amateurishness.Other than that, reading Gianna is a harmless way to pass two hours."},{"Title":"The Kingdom in History and Prophecy","review":"Chafer demonstrates the keeness of his theological mind in this fantistic work. It is the definitive work on the differences between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven. It provides a fantastic, dispensational look at the Gospel record, and helps to better understand some of the nuances of the Savior's teaching.This is a must-read for every serious minded Bible student."},{"Title":"The Kingdom in History and Prophecy","review":"Chafer presents a traditional dispensational interpretation of the kingdom. He argues that Jesus came at his first advent to offer Israel the kingdom promised in the OT, that the offer was rejected by the nation of Israel and therefore postponed to the second advent of Christ. The teaching of Jesus previous to the cross (e.g. the Sermon on the Mount) was the presentation of a kingdom ethic that is not relevant in today's age of grace.I don't agree with Chafer, but the book is well-written, clear and concise, and helpful to anyone seeking to understand the early 20th century dispensational understanding of the \\"Kingdom of Heaven.\\""},{"Title":"Braddock Road Chronicles, 1755 (From the Diaries and Records of Members of the Braddock Expedition and Others Arranged in a Day by Day Chronology)","review":"Andrew Wahll has compiled an invaluable collection of contemporary documents concerning the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. The coverage which is organised on a day by day basis runs throughout 1755 and covers the preliminary preparations, the difficulties of drawing together sufficient transport, the tortuous advance, the far from inevitable disaster on July 9th and its aftermath.Material from all the important sources is included plus many other minor ones. Each entry is footnoted to give a reference to the original source and there is an extensive bibliography. This book represents a considerable feat of compilation and editing. There are one or two annoying minor typographic errors that do not appear to have been picked up by the proof-readers and the accompanying map which was reproduced from a Washington Bicentennial volume is printed at slightly too small a size to be clear. These are trivial problems; all in all, this book is invaluable to students of the Braddock Expedition.In order to access the breadth of material contained in the Braddock Road Chronicles one would have to spend a vast amount of money on the second-hand book market or be able to visit a major institution such as the Library of Congress. As a paperback this is not a cheap book but the cost is more than outweighed by the content."},{"Title":"Braddock Road Chronicles, 1755 (From the Diaries and Records of Members of the Braddock Expedition and Others Arranged in a Day by Day Chronology)","review":"This is an excellent book of extracts from original journals, reports and letters from Braddock's Road, Battle and the aftermath (covering January to December of 1755). The material comes from 55 different people, so a reader gets to see various points of view. As stated in the title, most of the book concerns Braddock's march, but the battle is not neglected, and plenty of pages are devoted to it.Because this is a source of first hand descriptions of Braddock's March and Battle from people living at that time, and not a novel, one shouldn't expect a rolling narrative. If one is more interested in a good narrative (as opposed to a source of first-hand accounts) about this episode in history, try O'meara's \\"War in the Woods\\".The book is arranged in a day by day chronology, instead of just listing all the accounts seperately in full. It is a interesting approach that works well, given the material covered.While an excellent source book for first-hand accounts of Braddock's march and battle, I only rate it a 2; I would have rated it higher, but it is just too expensive for a paperback book."},{"Title":"Braddock Road Chronicles, 1755 (From the Diaries and Records of Members of the Braddock Expedition and Others Arranged in a Day by Day Chronology)","review":"Organized from various sources chronologically,this is a superb reference on the buildingof Braddock's military road, and its valueas a transportation path to the west."},{"Title":"Principles of Psychotherapy","review":"This book is succinct and simple but full of usefull information.

We see through Rebecca's eyes the cruel blow that nature inflicted upon her and her brave struggle for release from the bondage of a misunderstood disorder of one part of her body, her mind. We find we are not alone when dealing with this problem. There was a time in the not to not too distant past when physical disabilities were scorned upon by society.

Her solution is a small cootage outside a small Gloucester village - where her next door neighbour promptly discovers a dead body in the woods just across the small valley.Aubrey is a complete pain, and one has to wonder how someone with as much going for her as Melissa could ever have got caught up with such a useless lummox. Jack is now at the far end of a phone, and London is soon a distant memory. But there is that murder, and Melissa (creator of ace Scotland Yard detective, Nathan Latimer) soon finds herself helping a young local reporter to carry out an unofficial investigation - which ends in success, though only after it narrowly misses being a complete disaster.This is a terrific first novel in the Melissa Craig series, and it is a complete mystery to me that the earlier books are now, in many cases, so hard to come by. Maybe the publishers should relaunch the entire series so far to give them a fresh start?I'm now on my fifth book in the series, and they have all been of a consistently high standard so far - if you like that sort of thing. My only quibble about this particular book is that after having developed such an ingenious plot, Ms Rowlands delivers the solution somewhat like a thunderbolt out of a clear blue sky.NEVERTHELESS for all those readers who appreciate British country village-type mysteries this gets five stars without any problems at all.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Little Gentle Sleuth","review":"A successful mystery writer moves to the Cotswolds to get out of the bustle of London.

I enjoyed watching Melissa gain her independence from an ex-lover and learning how to do things for herself.

Now I can read all of them in order from start to finish.Kudos go to Rowland's believable, yet occasionally outrageous characters, especially Melissa who writes the Nathan Latimer Scotland Yard detective series and Iris, her quirky next door neighbor. Melissa's recent move from London to the wilds of the Cotswolds offers more grist for her detective's mill than she bargained for--first the dead body of a woman is found by Iris, then a likely drugs ring is thrown into the mix.There are romantic twists and turns, humor, and English village scandals to spice up the beginning of a wonderful cozy series.

Each of the 16 chapters touches on a well-chosen piece of important mathematics. The coverage is broad (in math terms: number theory, algebra, geometry, combinatorics, proof, topology, calculus, differential equations, chaos and catastrophy, and applications as well). The many (black and white) illustrations (including cartoons) make for fast reading, and before you know it, you have finished another chapter. There are numerous connections between chapters.The book has no preface or introduction; you just jump in. (The library copy that I borrowed had lost its dust jacket, and I looked in vain for an explanation of the &quot;purpose&quot; of the book. Why did the author write it? But once I started reading, that question quickly turned out to be irrelevant.) The single page of references for further reading is well chosen. The index spans almost four pages. The typography and layout are beyond reproach. The writing style is concise, informative, precise, inviting, and certainly not dry (reflective and historic tidbits are interspersed).Some minor comments. (1) The (algebraic) explanation of the 1089 number trick does not mention the role of the requirement (which is mentioned) that the first and last digit of the starting number need to differ 2 or more. (2) The reader needs the ability to deal with formulae involving variables, including raising to a power, and ellipses (... to denote infinite series). I don't think this is a limitation for the seriously interested reader. (3) The book is somewhat biased towards &quot;continuous&quot; mathematics, rather than &quot;discrete&quot; mathematics. This is easily explained by the author's background, and again I didn't find it a limitation. My background is more in &quot;discrete&quot; than &quot;continuous&quot; math. I did learn a few new things from the book, such as Malfatti's circles-in-triangle problem, Kakeya's unsolvable needle-turning problem, and the upside-down pendulum theorem. (These may seem strange to you to include in a short math book, but they serve their purpose well.)In such a short book it is very difficult to please everyone. The author has done a wonderful job. Everyone should know at least this much (about) mathematics."},{"Title":"1089 and All That - A Journey into Mathematics","review":"I've never before run across another book which covers such a wide range of mathematics in such a short space while making everything so easy to follow and intuitively crystal clear. Though a book like this can't possibly offer a comprehensive presentation of any aspect of mathematics, David Acheson does a perfect job of pleasantly displaying the nature (theorems), beauty (proofs), and power (applications) of the subject - or maybe the beauty is in the theorems and the nature is in the proofs?In any case, Acheson must have been inspired in writing this book, and I'm so delighted with it that I'm pushing my wife (who hasn't touched mathematics in two decades) to read it also! In fact, this is the first book I'd recommend to anyone who shows a budding interest in mathematics and wants to learn more. And even people well-versed in mathematics will enjoy joining Acheson on this brief but wonderful tour, so I highly recommend this book to them also.As a testament to how much I appreciate Acheson's expository skill and style, I've just ordered one of his other books,From Calculus to Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamics.Note: I believe page 126 contains an error, since it seems that p can't both grow exponentially yet be bounded to unity. If I'm right, that doesn't weaken my enthusiastic recommendation for this book, but I wanted to note it in case other readers wondered about this."},{"Title":"1089 and All That - A Journey into Mathematics","review":"This book is simply a delightful little journey into mathematics, not to light to be boring for the working mathematician nor to hard for someone who is not a math head. Many beautiful results are presented in a simple yet marvelous way, ranging from the 1089 number trick through inverted n-linked pendulums and ending with the stunning connection between pi, e and imaginary numbers.In short a delightful read, from an author who obviously loves math and masterly shares this passions with the rest of us. If you find yourself marveling over this book then I can highly recommend picking upProofs from THE BOOK, which although being quite more math heavy shares many qualities with this book."},{"Title":"1089 and All That - A Journey into Mathematics","review":"It is very tiny and short, yet amazingly it tells a great story by linking algebra to geometry to calculus to infinite series to trigonometry. And, surprise, surprise, Euler's Formula and Identity are demonstrated utilizing all these links. During this short adventure, it also manages to emphasize the nature of mathematics: from theorems to proofs to applications. The last component has a profound implication, which the author has skilfully avoided spelling it out explicitly. All in all, extremely enjoyable. All my high-school math classes reappeared in my mind's eye, accompanied by awe and deep wonder. Five stars."},{"Title":"Smooth Operator","review":"Predictable, do it by the books Callie Hopewell is in the midst of doing something totally out of her character. She has quit her job as a lawyer at a New York firm and is on her way to St. Christopher to surprise her fianc&eacute;. Her family believes she's lost her mind. She only met this man six months ago, but thirty-four-year-old Callie sees Henry as her last chance to have a fulfilling relationship like her parents had. On the plane ride to her new life, she meets the incredibly handsome and flirtatious Garret Langrin. She finds her attraction to him disconcerting, but remains faithful in word and action to the man she has decided to spend the rest of her life with.Garret Langrin, one of the top legal minds on St. Christopher, doesn't know what made him come on so strong with Callie. His attraction for her goes beyond her beauty. When her fianc&eacute; is murdered and she is the main suspect, Garret and Callie team up to find the real murderer. As the two work together they grow closer, but Garret has issues with his father that he must deal with before he can love Callie the way she deserves to be loved.SMOOTH OPERATOR's strength is also its weakness. This was one murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end, which is a good thing. Janette McCarthy Louard spent so much time on the murder mystery plot that the romance took a back seat. Then the revealing and resolution of Garret's issue with his father felt rushed. I enjoyed SMOOTH OPERATOR. It is fast-paced, action-packed, full of funny to psycho characters and has a fabulous setting. It's just light on the romance. Has me wanting to buy a ticket to St. Christopher!Reviewed by Deatri King-Beyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Smooth Operator","review":"Callie Hopewell is a 34-year old attorney who lives in New York, she has always done what was expected of her until she meets and falls in love with Henry Kincaid.

The curse of the rowan tree and the powerful magic that invoked in Maxwell's life and those of his acquaintances. The epilogue is haunting and provides a sad precursor of later events, Teko was also to meet and unfortunate end and the author himself barely survived a year beyond the epilogue. Edal's tribute serves as a fitting message to those of us who ascribe to a paradise that never really exists."},{"Title":"raven seek Thy Brother","review":"God Bless Gavin Maxwell's soul. Always with the best of intentions, this book, continuing after his 'Ring of Brightwater' and 'Rocks Remain' chronicles Maxwell's increasingly depressing, tumultious life. The dream that Camusfearna was, grows tarnished, his otters resentful of any human contact, Mediterranean enemies from the past, come to haunt him, and a series of physically disabling accidents strike him.On the good side, Maxwell's definite good knack for writing help pull the reader into the book. His visuals about the life on rugged but beautiful Scottish Isles, are absolutely appealing, making you want to be there, more than anything.Tom Brokaw wrote about the American experience in his acclaimed 'The Greatest Generation' Gavin Maxwell is no doubt is a giant of the 'Greatest' British Generation. Those young boys who grew to responsibility, and manhood in the days of WWII, and the fading light of the British empire. You will be amazed at what these people went through, and what we would consider high adventure, they consider quite routine.Anyway, read the book."},{"Title":"raven seek Thy Brother","review":"This book is the third book of a series Maxwell wrote. The first, and by far the most well known, is Ring of Bright Water. This book continues the amazing account of a man's life in Scotland shared with otters. Maxwell's writing is engrossing. His descriptions and knowledge of the natural world create the idyll in its entirety in the reader's mind. As in the first, there are portions that are downright heart wrenching. This book does seem to dwell more on Maxwell's outside projects and troubles than the otters. He, himself, is a fascinating individual. He recounts episodes of health and financial problems that removes the cloud of fantasy surrounding his days at Camusfearna. Inserted in a chapter is an actual proposal written by him in an effort of win support of starting an Eider duck colony. This is a bit dry and doesn't lend much to the book. In researching these birds, however, he makes a trip to Iceland. The story of his trip is great. Even better are tales of poltergeists in his cottage. One does learn more of his life--writing for hours, smoking eighty cigarettes each day--and that is fine. As with the first book there are many terrific photographs of otters and deerhounds and some fine drawings, though the drawings in the first book are so spectacular that anything else pales in comparison. I am amazed at his life, impressed by his sincere love and concern of the creatures around him. While not of the same magical quality of the first book, this is a fine work in its own right."},{"Title":"The Country Team","review":"From inside flap:This huge, explosive novel of war, peace, and the ever-changing limbo in between is bound to have widespread repercussions, sure to be one of the most hotly discussed - pro and con - of our day. Robin Moore, whose 'Green Berets' has sold over three and one-half million copies, has fashioned, in 'The Country Team,' a dynamic, sweeping panorama of a strategic country in Asia rapidly falling under communist influence.The country, Mituyan, is mythical but typical. What Robin Moor reveals in the story of this land is essentially true of almost all the small countries of the world that are sorely beset by communist pressures and infiltrations.Like its celebrated predecessor, 'The Country Team' is fiction, and, like 'The Green Berets,' it is solidly rooted infact. Any \\"old Asia hand\\" will acknowledge the accuracy and truth of the conditions and conflicts that Moore presents - the politics, the treachery, the torture, the illicit and exotic love, the drug trade, and, ultimately, the price paid by the people of the country.The central character of the story is Mike Forrester, American soldier-of-fortune plantation owner who is married to a Mituyan woman. He is drawn into the fight to preserve Mituyan's freedom when his plantation is sabotaged by terroist guerrillas; and, as a secret agent for the Americans, he becomes thoroughly involved in the struggle. Because he has major status and is well known throughout the country, he is able to participate in palace intrigues, assassination plots, dangerous missions, delicate diplomacy, and political coups. But chiefly, he uses his intimate knowledge of the nature of the people and the country to further the cause of Mituyan's freedom, and at great personal risk battles the guerrillas in the cities, in the mountains, in the poppylands, and on the rivers to strike telling blows.But though Mike Forrester is the hero, this book is essentially about the operations of the Country Team of Mituyan. The Country Team is a basic U.S. operational unit the world over, designed to keep each trouble-spot nation is Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the side of the free world. It consists, in each country, of fivemen who, too often, work at crosspurposes: the ambassador, the general in charge of military assistance, the U.S.I.A. representative, the head of AID, and the CIA station chief. Each eports independently to Washington whenever disagreements arise- and they often do - and internal wrangling can get white hot.What Robin Moore has done is this huge multifaceted novel is to unfold in revealing dramatic incident and detail the entire picture - mistakes as well as successes - of the way we conduct our foreign policy. Unflinching in its exposure of communist terror techniques, 'The Country Team' is a book unashamed of our heroes and our triumphs. Yet it is a book that is fearlessly honest about the failures of American military and security operations. It is bound to be news -this year and for many years to come."},{"Title":"Distributed .NET Programming in VB .NET","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought &quot;Oh no - 3 chapters of intro and a large appendix&quot;. I naturally skipped over the intro and started reading what I thought was the first Real chapter. I kept finding interesting references back to an intro chapter &quot;Introduction to .Net Remoting&quot;. I finally read this chapter and was pleasantly surprised to find a clear and comprehensive explanation of channels and contexts. The &quot;This is .Net&quot; intro chapter had a great explanation of versioning in .Net. So I'd recommend reading this book from the beginning - or at least start with chapter 2.The rest of the book allowed me to complete a moderately size distributed project in a lot less time that I thought it would. There is also a great chapter on using transactions under Component Services. I was also able the complete my last MCAD certification test (VB XML) based mainly on what I got out of this book.This book has no fluff and is packed with a lot of key concepts and practical code samples. The only downside was the brief coverage and dismissal of Web Services. The Appendix turned out to be coverage of ADO.Net written by Andrew Troelsen. I didn't read this chapter because I was already up to speed on ADO.Net. But having read a couple of Troelsen's other books, my guess is that it's pretty good."},{"Title":"Distributed .NET Programming in VB .NET","review":"I have been working with .Net Remoting for a couple months and this book has more detailed information in it, than I could find anywhere. Not only did it help reinforce the fundamentals of remoting, it explores many advanced topics and gives easy to follow examples. The approach is practical and direct even with difficult topics. This book saved me hours of time by explaining in depth delegates and remote callbacks. I highly suggest this book for anyone working with remoting, web services or other distributed programming topics.Also, the code used in the examples can be downloaded from the book's website in C# or VB.NET."},{"Title":"Distributed .NET Programming in VB .NET","review":"Very detailed and well explained topics.

I recommend The Mark of The Lion series to any and everyone!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"After the happy ending that Marcus and Hadassah got in the previous book, I wondered what this book would be about, and was immensely pleased to see that it would be about Atretes, and his son (the baby that Julia abandoned) and Atretes trying to get his son back. It's humorous how the baby has become so attached to Rizpah that when Atretes reclaims the baby and gets it a new wet nurse (A Germanic one to boot) the baby refuses the milk, and lo and behold, Rizpah is waiting outside, having known this would happen. At first the relationship is rather tenuous, since all Rizpah is (to Atretes) is a wet nurse for the child, but they grow closer, and I liked that.It was interesting when Atretes decides to travel to his family, and Anomia's guile as she tries to win Atretes' heart, even resorting to commanding one of the villagers to kill another man (Sorry hun, but that's not true love) I found the ending a bit cliched - the Christianity message comes on very strong to the point of feeling almost forced, but the book is very well-researched and well-written, so this book is overall a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers is a new favorite of mine! Loved the characters of Atretes and Rizpah and all they endured together. This book was wonderfully written and truly shows how God can save anyone from the pits of hell if you just accept Him. I was literally on my knees at the end of this book praising God that I am his daughter! It renewed and uplifted me and left me emotionally drained....in a good way! An awesome book! I wish there was another to read after this one!!!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This series was a great read and helped rebuild my spiritual strength and faith. It is possible to stand up for what you believe amid all others saying you're wrong."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Many people have said that they dislike this one the most out of the three. It is different, to be sure, but that's because it's supposed to be! Someone already wrote on here that it's like an alternative sequel to the first in the trilogy and that is true.After getting caught up in the romance and the drama in the first two books it was hard to basically start over in As Sure as the Dawn. No more Hadassah or Marcus, just these 2 characters we haven't really gotten to know very well. Had I not liked the other 2 so much I probably would have quit reading it within the first 3 chapters but I kept on going and I'm so glad I did!I finished the series about 6 months ago. At that time my favorite in the series was the first book, but now it is As Sure as the Dawn. The characters are more relevant to our time. Women are taught to be spirited and independent. Men are taught to be loud, out there, tough and proud. So many are reluctant to listen to God if He calls them to missions. These are things that the characters deal with throughout the book. Rizpah has to learn to quiet herself so that the Holy Spirit can speak through her. Atretes has to swallow his pride. Rizpah and Theophilus have to let all of their fear go and trust in the Lord to provide as they go to Germania. I also love the ever present enemy in this book. Satan is left and right attacking the characters journey and attacking the characters weaknesses within. It's once those weaknesses are given to God that Satan no longer has power.Of course the first two have many relevant things that we deal with in our culture, but this book really brings to light what happens when we let ourselves rule and not God. Read this book with as much enthusiasm as you had for the first two, it will be worth it!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This was a riviting book. I will read it again in the future.

Especially about Hadassah!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This book was very good, although I liked the character of Hadassah from the first two books a little better than Rizpah. Atretes is such a hard headed German! And I loved the character of Theophilus. The story of the spread of Christianity to the European countries is very interesting. You won't be able to put this one down."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"In this third volume of the \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series, Francine Rivers chronicles the journey of the ex-gladiator Atretes back to his Germanic homeland, accompanied by the Christian widow Rizpah, nursemaid to his son. For Atretes, it proves to be much more than just a journey to his barbarian Chatti tribe, but also a romantic journey of love, and a spiritual journey of faith.Readers familiar with the \\"Mark of the Lion\\" series will know that the central issue of the first volume in the series - \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" - was how to witness to an unbelieving world, and this is the most powerful and convincing book of the entire series. Like the second volume of the series (\\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" - an exploration of forgiveness), the third volume (\\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" - an exploration of anger) is much more introspective than the first. Since \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" shares with \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" a focus on inner conflict, it unfortunately also shares many of! its weaknesses. Certainly it has to be conceded that Rivers writes on a much higher level than most contemporary Christian fiction. When packed with a deep theological message, such literary fiction has the potential to pack a serious punch. But not when the theology is weak. Sadly, that is the case not only with \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\", but also with \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\".The most serious theological weakness is that Rivers places the events of her story *after* the apostolic era, and yet incorporates signs and wonders that were unique to the apostolic era. These include direct revelation (to Rizpah p.26 and Theophilus p.354), the gift of tongues (when the main characters suddenly speak German, p.314), and miracles (resurrection, p.278-80 and miraculous deliverance by walking on water, p.467). The presence of miracles outside of the apostolic era is particularly unfortunate, because Rivers makes them decisive turning points of the plot - in both instances resulting! in conversions. That the miracle of resurrection causes a conversion appears to be in direct contradiction with the words of Jesus in Luke 16:31 \\"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\\" Not only do these miracles and wonders result in an overly optimistic story-line that fails to reflect the harshness of real life for Christians today, they are dependent on a tenuous theological position. If one agrees with the assertion that apostolic wonders and miracles ceased with the apostolic era, one must also concede the plot of \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" is not credible.There are other minor theological weaknesses that are not as crucial to the plot. The portrayal of first century worship (p.126) is questionable, and certainly the idea of \\"coming forward\\" (p.5) is anachronistic and without basis in the New Testament, and is more indicative of contemporary rather than ancient worship. The exegesis of several !Bible passages is highly disputable, such the use of Matt. 7:1 \\"do not judge\\" (p.53) which fails to take into consideration the immediate context dealing with hypocrisy; the use of 1 John 4 \\"love one another\\" to include unbelievers (p.83,373), despite the clear application of this text in Scripture to fellow believers; the suggestion that each piece of the armor of God in Eph. 6 is another name for Christ (p.87); the understanding of Rom. 6 as requiring baptism by immersion (p.283); and the explanation of Gen. 6:5 as meaning that after the fall there was just a \\"seed of sin\\" which progressed into increasing corruption (p.291). Also questionable are the assertions that Satan was God's most beautiful creation (p.291), that the Israelites are still God's children today (p.301), and that forgiveness is required independent of repentance (p.423 - note that Christ did not forgive his murderers, rather He *prayed* for their forgiveness). As usual, the theology of universal atonement !(p.60,112,314), partial depravity (p.248-9, 290) and the emphasis on Christ as an example rather than as an atoning substitute (p.306) is typically Arminian.Like the first volume of the series, the graphic allusions to Atretes' sexual relations outside of marriage and frank discussion of sexual thoughts makes \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" unsuitable for children. In fact the emphasis that Rivers lays on physical attraction is somewhat disturbing (p.187,189). Romantic love appears to play just as much a role as religion in determining the course of events, as evidenced in the fact that one of the religious climaxes of the novel (baptism) is promptly overshadowed by a romantic climax (marriage). The fact that this baptism was rather premature (one of the characters later observes that the baptized person does not even really understand what it means to be a Christian! p.309) appears to confirm this.The above criticisms may seem harsh but they are honest. At the same time!, there are many positive theological insights that Rivers successfully and effectively shares. The fact that the apostle John quotes numerous Scripture passages verbatim is a real strength. The portrayal of spiritual conflict as the gospel is proclaimed in pagan territory is particularly convincing. Rivers' description of demonic powers at work among the pagans under the guise of their gods is powerful and accurate. Thankfully the third volume of the series is not ALL internal conflict like the second volume, and thus overcomes some of its weaknesses. There are also some exciting action scenes reminiscent of the first volume. A reasonable effort, but unfortunately not enough to equal the first gem produced in this series. Like Atretes, Rivers is back, but not with the same glory as when we first met."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I was eager to read the last book in the Mark of the Lion series, having enjoyed the first two very much (although I liked the first one the best). But, As Sure as the Dawn was a disappointment. The overall story was good...but I did not like the use of so many miracles.

Unlike a previous post, them going to Germania and just start speaking German all of a sudden was ridiculous. That's believable? Yeah right. But what really annoyed me the most was the character of Rizpah. She was the most self-righteous, holier-than-thou character I can remember from any book I've read.

I'd tell you that's something my mom would read.But then I read Francine River's Mark of the Lion series. Wow, did my opinion change drastically. Here was violence, power plays, all kinds of sin, impossible love, God's glory verbally portrayed in ways that gave me goosebumps, and history, of all things! I always thought of a boring historical \\"tourist\\" city when I thought of (for example) Rome. This book really put some imagination to the times and caught my interest!So, besides being a fascinating read, this series has both gospel truth and well-researched history.The first book (A Voice In The Wind) is my favorite.

Big problem is the child has been adopted and the adoptive mother is not giving him up. He either backs off or takes a package deal.He does the smart thing. Gets the pair.Back home is a trip. The tribe has problems of the internal variety. A scheming priestess with political ambitions.Though not as good as the previous two of the series, the authress still does well.

I was expecting a lot more from As Sure As the Dawn considering it was the end of the trilogy. I guess I wanted it to be a BANG ending. The book was written well, had me guessing a bit about the characters and was an excellent read. The disappointment for me personally was the ending. Maybe I should be happy with it, it wasn't bad at all- but it felt rushed. I kinda got upset a lot over the characters in the 3rd book and how they weren't behaving as I thought they should! This shows how well Francine Rivers involves her reader and appeals to both their Spirit and flesh driven sides. All 3 books are a great witness to Christ's unfailing love for us, what more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"We are enjoying the basic premise of the book. The two characters of opposite personalities and background struggling through to relationship makes for interesting reading. The problem with the book is the authors extreme overuse of a few discriptors - esp. 'sardonically' and 'wryly'. The overuse of these two words almost makes me want to throw the book away without finishing it. There are also other words used that normal readers would have no clue what they mean except in context with the sentence because the words were probably used 'back in the day'. Without these reading obstructions, I would have given the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Wonderful book in the Mark Of The Lion series! These books are certainly a blessing!Francine Rivers is an anointed woman of God with a blessed anointing on the books she writes!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I have read all 3 of this series and loved them. She keeps you interested as the story never bogs down as often happens in so many books."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The entire Mark of the Lion series is incredible. \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\" is no exception. This historical fiction will captivate and motivate you. It is brimming with action, romance, suspense and spirituality. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get lost in a book."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The first and second books in this series combined are my new favorite novel of all time. This one is different. At first it was a little frustrating that it is so different with its focus on different characters. But this is the one I will re-read over and over. A powerful story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This book completes the story of Atretes, the slave/gladiator that we are introduced to in Voice in the Wind. I almost decided against reading this book because my favorite character Haddasah is not featured. I'm glad I changed my mind. While this was not quite as good as the first two in the series, it was a great read and a fitting end to the series. I loved the development of Atretes & Rizpah's relationship and the book was full of twists and turns. I cried with the first two books, and while this book did not draw tears, I did find myself wanting to leap for joy at some parts. If you enjoyed the first two books in the series, I recommend that you read this book - you'll likely be sad that it doesn't include Hadassah, but Atretes' story is just as amazing!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I loved this series. The only disappointment I had was that the cover of the book I received was not like the one in the picture and did not \\"go with\\" the covers of the first two I purchased."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers is such a wonderful writer. If you enjoy Christian fiction, you'll enjoy her books. She writes such interesting stories, with well developed characters, her books really take you to that time and place."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This was my favorite book of the series. I really &quot;got to know&quot; the characters, and I could visualize what was going on as if I was actually there. The chemistry between Rizpah and Artretes really drew me in. I also liked the character Theophilus, who was true to character as the auhor of Luke and Acts. A good love story that deals with many issues of relationships and the Christian life."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"An interesting but uneven telling of an improbable, but possible, story. AD 79, starting in Ephesus. The heroine, a widowed Christian given a rescued baby to care for, is one of the leakiest characters I've found. She's either weeping, speaking through a throat \\"tight with tears,\\" exhibiting eyes glistening with tears, or nursing the baby. (She had lost a baby and could be a wet nurse). The ex-gladiator whose baby she was given shows a twitching muscle in his jaw every few pages. Oh, editor, how could you?The Scripture woven into the account is carefully done; the apostle John is shown with deep respect. The struggle of the early church is clear. We do move a little swiftly over the incredible journey to Germania and a little incredulously over the inexhaustible funds of Theophilus, a retired centurion. The baby develops at a peculiar rate as well.The crown of the novel is the conversion of the gladiator, and it is accomplished by a miracle, the raising to life of the young widow, fatally shot by an arrow as the little travelling party is ambushed. For shame - even Jeffrey Dahler's conversion didn't require that. This is a good series, though."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I can't put this book down. It's the my last to read in this story line. I'm both eager to continue reading to the end and dreading coming to the end. This is a book that really makes you think."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"If you have read the other two portions of the Mark of the Lion trilogy, this is a suitable ending piece and to complete all the stories that were introduced in A Voice in the Wind. However, because it only focuses on the story of Atretes, it seems a little disjointed from the other two. Nevertheless, it is a powerful story that continues to possess Rivers' powerful writing style and prose punctuated with Biblical references and longings for the romantic as well as plot troubles. It is still all well-done though, at least in my copy, it appears that the ditor got a little tired by the third book as more grammatical errors exist. Nevertheless, I am still a huge fan! I just preferred the two previous books to this third which most will still want to read."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Excellent read. Nice to see a book written about the christian daily struggle with a message that says what we all already know but need to hear over and over. One day at a time and never take your focus off the Lord.The only thing that I didn't like was that the story line didn't continue in another book however the Epilogue sufficed."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The first two books in this trilogy were simply amazing and I was sad when they ended. I wanted to hear more of Hadassah's story. This third book is a good read and I recommend it, but I felt let down a bit. It's almost like an entirely different story. Although Atretes actions would not make nearly as much sense without reading the first two.The characters are believable, real, loveable, inspirational, and I enjoyed the book. Francine Riveres did a great job telling the rest of Atretes story. I just wasn't ready to leave Hadassah's yet."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This has been an absolutely amazing series!!! I am so upset that I am finished with these books. They are such wonderful stories of God's presence throughout all of the trials of our lives. I am always amazed and pleased by Rivers. She is an AMAZING author!!!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I read all three Mark of the Lion series in order. All three were very enjoyable. The amount of research Francine Rivers has done is incredible and I felt I was back in ancient times. The Christian message was very strong. However, due to the violence and promiscuity - the violence can be graphic but the promiscuity is not - some readers might not find this their cup of tea.I found As Sure As The Dawn to be very enjoyable, although I thought it ended rather abruptly. I would recommend the whole series with the caveat of violence and promiscuity as noted above."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Great Book. I hated to finish it because it is the last of the series. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This series of books has impacted my life in a way few others ever have. The author grips your attention at the very beginning and holds it through each of the three books in the series."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers' writing grabs you and drags you into the story. I couldn't put it down after the first few chapters. The story takes some interesting twists that keep you on edge until the end. She also manages to convey some great messages within the substance of the story in a non-preachy way."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This book dragged for me. It was extremely preachy. It follows Artretes' path from slavery to basically preacher. It follows his path long and drudgingly. If you decide to read this you will need to pace yourself. This isn't the kind of book you read or want to read without putting it down. You will enjoy it, but it is flowery at times and very preachy. At about half the way in the book slows down even more, then it finally picks up about 100 pages from the end.Be prepared for the slump in the book and the preachiness and you will basically enjoy a good story, but not a must read."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Again, I have read many of her books, continue to enjoy them. I love the Biblical applications and how she makes the Bible times come alive."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"read them over and over and over again..never tire of them for they seem to be the best read ever"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Awesome, Francine Rivers word flow from the page leading me closer to the Lord. Beautifully written I recommend it to everyone!!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"A slow start to the book but still as intriguing and thrilling as the last two books. A story of lost hope in life but the redeeming grace of God that can soften the heart of the biggest giants."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This is number 3 in the series. It completes the series and brings the final characters' life to a place where the reader is comfortable."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"You can't read this book or series without it stimulating personal spiritual reflection. That is a real bonus these days."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I love all three books. I got book one from a friend and then bought the final two books. This is the kind of series that makes you want it to keep going. Francine Rivers is a great writer and has some of the best historical Christian fiction I have ever read!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"To me again I give Francine Rivers top marks for a captivating read.She gets to the heart of life back then and takes readers on a great historical journey.Anyone interested in historical stories will enjoy this book.Janice"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I am new to this Historical Christian fiction genre but this book and everyone in this series was a page turner a must read."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This is is 3rd in the series of &#34;The &#34;Mark of the Lion&#34; It is my FAVORITE series of books..ever..LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"You won't be able to put this book down before it's ending. Francine Rivers in the best. She truly has a gift from god. I've read most of her books and loved them all."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"But it is a close favorite. I thoroughly enjoyed all three! I recommend this book and the two before it to everyone!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"FRANCINE RIVERS MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE. ABSOUTLEY LOVED THIS BOOK, A MUST READ. COULDNT'T WAIT TO READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THIS SERIES."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Great book for the price. I will have to buy the other two of this series. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The transaction was great and the book was outstanding. It is the last book in a series of 3 and held my interest all the way through."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I had never read any books by a \\"Christian\\" author. This series was wonderful. (Book number one was my favorite) Wonderfully researched, with excellent writing, I can see why she is a very popular and successful author. I also learned alot of history in these books. I bought a set for my mother-in-law."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I was really surprised by the plot of the third book. And a little troubled. How awful life can be. It's interesting to me that recently a gladiator training 'camp' was identified near the area where the story took place. It helped me to visualize more clearly what life must have been for those sent into the training."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As usual, I was very pleased, from the placing of the order to the speedy delivery. The books (set of three) arrived in perfect condition. Thank you Amazon as you never let us down."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This is an excellent book series to read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and you do not wantto put the book down. Start out reading Mark of the Lion 1 and 2 before reading 3."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This series is well written. It is a story of human emotions and interactions. We see the struggles of early Christians as they grapple with their faith and try to do what they think is best for others. It is a book of self sacrifice and also one of those searching for the meaning of their lives. In the end it is a reflective book as we look at our own lives. For those who want to be endlessly entertained and not think inwardly, the plot and story will entertain them but they will be uneasy as they read the story because of the reflection of the characters struggles that seem to mirror our own. An absolutely excellent story and so very well written. Everyone should read this entire series."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As with most Rivers books, this one if life-changing. This series is what the Lord used to bring me back to Him after 3 years of trying things my own way--what a gentle Lord He is. I highly recommend this series. The characters are believable, you feel for them, and you get a better sense of how God works in life (even though it is fiction). It will challenge your walk with the Lord, in a good way."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"this is a great book . I could not put it down. Was trying to cook and read .iron and read read and do every thing but drive."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers is a wonderful writer and so it is very well written and I enjoyed the story. I love how she weaves scripture into their speaking where it seems like normal conversation. Just like all the books there were moments where I could not put it down and moments where it dragged a little. If you were to keep this book exactly as written, something that I think would have really improved both this book and the 2nd book is for them to have been combined. All during the reading of the 2nd book, I kept wondering about Atretes and expecting him to show up at some point, and I was sort of hoping that Hadassah to be in the third. It could have been edited to put some of book 3 into book 2. Book 2 could have ended with after Marcus's salvation he returns and brings Julia home and the turmoil of Hadassah having to live under the same roof as Marcus again and ended with Atretes being arrested by Theophilus and \\"going\\" to the arena. This would have been a very exciting ended to both stories and carried you into book 3 which could have then told the end of both stories and we would have appreciated the closure given.** Please do not read unless you have read the book*** SPOILERSI felt like Atretes and Rizpah's love story was too similar to Hadassah's and Marcus's and would have preferred Rizpah with Theophilus just for a change. I know it would have completely changed the story but it would have been more original and a challenge. Atretes could still have loved her when she \\"died\\" but they would not have been immediately married which is something that bothered me.I also really did not like the ending. To me she was being called a harlot because she had been previously married and was WIDOWED!! I mean does this tribe not allow people to remarry after the death of their spouse? Technically she could have been sentenced as a harlot had they known of her life before her marriage, BUT that is not what the \\"trial\\" was based on. Remember Jesus did not defend himself when he was on trial, it would have been realistic for God to give Rizpah a peace of saying nothing to her charges. Then I think Atretes should have been able to remember that he had told Anomia ONLY that Rizpah was a widow not a harlot. If she wanted to have a miracle at the end then it should have been a blinding angle and them all run away, etc. instead of her \\"escaping\\" death again. It has turn Rizpah into a cat with 9 lives, lol."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As Sure as the Dawn was an inspiring and wonderful book. It was full of action and good principles. I loved it!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This 3rd and final book of the Mark of the Lion Series was SUCH A BLESSING to me! I am a lot like Rizpah (I tend to be stubborn in situations like hers, and I am sometimes far too outspoken for my own good). This book encouraged me in so many ways... proved how deep God's forgiveness and love reach, and how dramatically they change the lives of those they touch! I was so BLESSED! This book dramatically portrays God's faithfulness, answers to prayer, and real-life examples of where we would all be without God. Even if you haven't read Books 1 and 2, this one stands alone and is a must-read."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"If you read the first two books of this series, and is definitely worth finishing. It really completes the lose ends left by the first two books."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers delivers once again. I have read Voice in the Wind and Echo in the Wind and I was waiting for the suspense to die down but it never did. My eleven(11) year old enjoyed the series as much as I did. To read about love in a good clean but mostly real way was very refreshing. She took me back to Germania in a way that made me feel like I was there. She showed me God on level that I have not reached but aspire to reach. She gave my studies of God's Word life in a way that only Jesus' words and perables have only been able to do.I have read all three books in the series. Don't deprive yourself by reading only one. I have also read Scarlet Thead and The Atonement Child.I give Francine Rivers 5 stars as an author."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers delivers once again.

Of the three books, this one ties for first place in the favorite catagory! The one thing that really blew me away was the absolute show of the power of God in the end! It was my FAVORITE part!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As continuation of the Mark of the Lion series, the author weaves the lives of faithful followers with those whose walk is just beginning. It opens your heart as you see yourself in the lives of the chracters and their struggles."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This is a MUST READ series. I love any book written by Francine Rivers and this series is no different. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I highly recommend all 3 Mark of the Lion books. I was blessed by them."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The third book in The Mark of the Lion series is good, but not nearly as captivating as the first two. Julia, Marcus, and Hadassah aren't in it. Instead, it follows the journey of the enslaved gladiator from the Germanic Tribes. This book illustrates the trials and hardships endured by new Christians. It's a well-written book with excellent themes like not being prideful and trusting in God. There are a few parts in the book that seem a little far-fetched, but the story is still good."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"One reviewer noted that one of the main characters of this story was baptized PRIOR to understanding what being a Christian means. How many of us, upon receiving baptism as older children/young adults or adults, were perfectly capable of explaining WHAT step we had taken in our lives. Oh sure, we may have been able to say &quot;I want a deeper relationship with Christ&quot;, but it is usually AFTER baptism that you pursue Christ.Thus, Francine Rivers was correct or &quot;OK&quot; in her showing this in the (said) character; she shows reality. It would be wonderful to say that I understood WHAT I was getting into when I chose to be baptized in Lake Canadaguia at the age of 12, but all I knew was that I wanted Christ in my life and that this must be a way of showing that to the world and my wanting to pursue Him and His love.In closing, the author is brilliant! I find her use of romance to be very refreshing in a Christian novel. Why is it that Christians are so scared to hear of physical attraction? It may not be one of the higher points of true love, but it is a phenomenon which is OK. After all, why would God not glorify in the beauty of His Creation. He did say &quot;it is good&quot;."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I can identify so much with Rizpah, that I even named my screename for her. I enjoyed this last of the trilogy. My favorite character has to be Theophilis. His quiet and gentle spirit, and his faith and love, comforted me. He seemed like the kind of grandfather I always wished I'd had. I cant wait for the next book to come out so that I can find out what happens to everyone."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The final part of 'The Mark Of The Lion' trilogy. This book follows the events in the life of Atretes, who was first introduced in 'Voice In The Wind'. The gutsy determination of Rizpah, along with the struggles she faces combine to make this a compelling story. The author takes us on a journey into a completely different culture and it is easy to become completely engrossed in the fascinating historical side to the story. You have to admire this lady for the hours of research she must have had to do to produce such a brilliant novel. A wonderful conclusion to a brilliant series."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I'm glad I'm in the minority among reviewers because I like Francine Rivers' writing in general. The reader was excellent (Audible)--no complaints there. However, by the third book of perfect Christianity among wicked idol worshippers (I don't question that), the details of evil versus perfection were too many and too typical and too predictable and too endless. I listened to the entire trilogy during my summer walks. By the end of this third book, I sped up the recording and started skipping chapters. I checked in often enough to know there were incredible miracles at the end. Once again. And that's my point. Too much that was incredible became repetitive, predictable and, yes--boring. The first two books were more enjoyable because I didn't always know what was coming."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Not gonna' lie, I was disappointed when I found this third book of the series to be based on Atretes and not around Hadassah and Marcus. I had grown to really enjoy those characters and wanted to read about their next adventure together with Christ as their center. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case..It was still a good book and was hard to put down, but I found myself wishing it had been different."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I am enjoying this book. I had read the first 2 in the series so am excited to be reading the 3rd and final book."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"the service was great and seller sent book right away i,d give them an a+. book 3 of the series is the least of my favorites. it was ok but not as good as 1 and 2."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I bought this book as a used book, but the binding was never bent! The x-owner missed out on an exciting read! I would recommend amazon.com to anyone and I recommend the Mark of Lion series by Francine Rivers as well. An addicting story!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Really interesting Grabbed my attention from Start to finish.It had mystery love historical facts."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"After reading (and absolutely loving!) Rivers' first two books in the Mark of the Lion series, I was in no hurry to pick up the third installment for the simple fact that the storyline of Marcus, Hadassa, & Julia had pretty much come to a finish. Of course, that did not detur me for long, and I quickly fell in love with \\"As Sure as the Dawn\\", as it was surprisingly action packed and very romantic. My faith was again strengthened, as with the first two, and I am very glad to have finished the series with this great book."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"The return of the German gladiator Atretes from the first part of the trilogy, A Voice in the Wind, is welcome to this conclusion of the trilogy. It is also refreshing that part three is almost completely devoid of Hadassah, the lead character I despised from parts one and two, who only appears at the very beginning in a snippet from A Voice in the Wind. The female character and eventual love interest in this novel is similar to Hadassah, but has a spark and personality that Hadassah was devoid of and which makes me like her all the more. Atretes grows a great deal throughout the novel, going from a complete Neanderthal in his treatment of women (understandably hurting from his rejection by Julia, but still...) to a loving husband and father. He is barely recognizable by the end of the novel, but in a good way. I would recommend this book alone of the trilogy, and I believe it could almost be read as a stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As Sure as the Dawn is really a stand alone book in the series The Mark of the Lion, but there are references to the first book in the series. This book is definitely written as well as the first two were. Francine Rivers speaks right to your heart where you need to hear from God; it is clearly a book that has been heavily influenced by scripture. This is exactly why this book series was so often recommended to me and why I couldn't put this book down after I started it!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Loved it!!! Francine Rivers is my favorite writer. It's so great to be able to read something that isn't trash for my mind but is filled with action, love, and miracles."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers knows how to put you in the story. The vivid descriptions of the time allows you to understand how things were. The Christians being fed to the Lions, the life style of the Romans, the atrocities that occurred in the worship of idols. In the end good prevails, but the war is still going on."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Francine Rivers is my ALL time, favorite author! This book is the 3rd bookof a series that I call the Hadassah series. I bought this copy as a gift. I haveread this series MANY times! Even read it aloud with my husband, who liked it. I have recommended it to thousands! It is my FAVORITE series! I even tried to contact Michael Landon Jr. trying to see if he would turn it into a movie and NOT CHANGE ONE PART OF IT. If you have not read this series, go get book #1, A Voice in the Wind, #2 is Echo in the Darkness. They are my FAVORITES! #3 is about Atretes. I love it b/c of Rizpah,however,I don't care for Atretes. He and I would never get along I'm afraid. BUT, I LOVE how Francine intertwines REAL people from the New Testament with her characters. I love the accuracy of the history/time period. She is such a GREAT author! Her characters become so real to me, and her books are not predictable like many other Christian authors. Any of her books are wonderful, but this series along with her other book, Redeeming Love will always be my favorites. I'd love to see that one done in film as well. Buy them! You will not regret it! You will be up ALL night long entranced by the stories and the characters!"},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"There are three books that make the whole read.

Definitely start with the first book and read through all three! I would highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I loved this book, I just wanted more and more I could not put it down. I just wish I had known that it was part of a trilogy.The author made you feel part of the scenery you almost felt you were there too. Francine Rivers is able to impart a spiritual theme throughout the story which made you sit up and take notice.I have now read the 3 books in the Mark of the Lion series aand have loved all of them.Thank you Francine."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Although this book was different from the 1st two books in the trilogy, I must say that I did enjoy it. The 1st 2 books were dramatic, intense, heart wrenching, & tearful. While this one made me laugh out loud many times, especially in the beginning. This book is definitely not a tear-jerker like the first two.It was hysterical trying to picture some of the scenes described in the early part of the book. For example, Artetes, a total barbarian, arrives to live in a lush villa after living in a cave for 5 months. Some of the descriptions of his behavior and the responses of his slaves are priceless.Another hysterical description is when Artetes wants to confront the apostle Paul on an issue. He finds Paul at a gathering in which he is preaching to a large crowd. In the beginning Artetes sits under the tree waiting for the service to end. He gets tired of waiting and decides to interrupt. He breaks through the crowd, heading for the front to confront Paul at the same time there is a call for anyone to come forward who wants to be baptized. So, as Artetes is breaking through the crowd everyone is cheering him on and encouraging him, thinking that he has just given his life to Christ and wants to be baptized. His reaction to this and other interactions with believers is extremely funny.In contrast to Hadassah (the main character in the 1st two books), who is gentle, soft spoken, and humble, Rizpah is independent, spirited, and strong-willed. This results in amusing interactions between her and Artetes.I did feel pretty sad at how Artetes treated his wife near the end of the book and wish more was written on his remorse. But other than that, I enjoyed the book. It really takes your mind off all of the drama that occurred between Hadassah, Marcus & Julia from the 1st two books. It was a nice way to bring closure to this amazing, well worth reading trilogy."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Alot of the people reviewing this final installment in the 'Mark of the Lion' series are saying how it is disappointing compared to the other two. This book seems to stand in a place by itself. To be fair you can't exactly take it as a continuation of the second book in the series but more as an alternate sequel to the first book.Let me explain: 'A Voice in the Wind' introduces us to all of the characters in the series, primarily revolving around the slave girl Hadassah and the german chieftan Atretes. Both of whom are captured and sold into slavery. The end of the first book leaves much in question and very little resolved. It is here that the story diverges into two directions. In 'An Echo in the Darkness' we continue the story of Hadassah and the Valerian family to which she belongs. We hear almost nothing of Atretes save a few passing references from other characters. We never know what Atretes is up to as the events of this story unfold. By the end of this book, most of the threads have been tied up and the book closes completely the story of Hadassah.'As Sure as the Dawn' picks up around the same time that 'Echo' does. This story picks up the thread of Atretes again and we see the story exclusively from his perspective. Here the other characters we met in the series such as Hadassah and the Valerians are referred to only in passing, like Atretes was in 'Echo'. The story starts in Ephesus and then follows Atretes and a woman named Rizpah (whom we met briefly in the first book) as they journey north the Germania in search of Atretes' family.The romance and grandeur of the Roman Empire that gave the first two novels such a wondrous backdrop is almost non-existant here. Like Rizpah being uprooted from her home and taken to Germania, we are pulled out of what is familiar with this series and taken on a trip with uncertain results.Elements of the story are predictable, but others will leave you guessing.Some have critcized the use of the miraculous in the story. There are several events that occur that are miraculous, but keep in mind that these elements existed as well in the other two novels. Nothing Ms. Rivers describes seems to be out of line with scripture. None of the miraculous events occur casually, and they are treated with a great deal of respect. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where nothing short of a miracle will save us, and Ms. Rivers does a good job of portraying just that.There are some dark elements that show the battle between good and evil. Atretes and Rizpah have to contend with pagan religion and witchcraft in the later half of the story. One character is demon possessed at one point, and the account is a little unsettling, although the spirit is eventually driven out in the name of Jesus. However, the power of God prevails in all things in this story.Ultimately the novel is one that I read through rather quickly and was just as engrossing as the first two.Each novel in the series seems to have a different flavor to it, each unique. Like any series or collection, each individual reader will have their favorite installment."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This is the third and last entry in the Mark of the Lion trilogy. I felt that Atretes had slipped a little from his softening in the previous book, but as the book went on I could see how necessary his hardness was. The character of Anomia is a bit cliched, but to tell the truth, she's a well-written cliche and some people are truly that self-centered. I admired Rizpah's strength throughout the book and how her love for Atretes softened her and allowed the Lord to use her for great works. The level of detail in 1st century AD daily life is astonishing. Rivers fills the book with breath-taking descriptions and detail so that it's easy to fall into that world. I held off on reading this series despite the good feedback I'd heard about it, because I was concerned that it would come off as too stiff or so full of trying to preach that the story would be neglected. I should know better from Rivers. She never makes the story secondary to the message; they are always entwined so carefully and completely that one without the other would fall flat. And I've yet to read a Rivers book that falls flat. This whole trilogy is definitely a must read for Christians. We're blessed in this country that we have freedom of religion. These stories of people who have to hide their faith or die for it is amazing."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Atretes : Mighty German warrior who was arrogant, fierce, hot blooded - until God changed him.Rizpah : A beautiful widow who was has a tongue like fire and a shady past.Theophilus : A Roman Centurion who has a heart and mind for God.Anomia : Younger sister of Atrete's dead wife who is beautiful to behold but like Satan in character.Rolf : Young Chatti warrior, caught by the deception of the Chatti god, Tiwaz.Freyja : Atrete's mother, who is a high priestess of the Chatti god and shudders at the name of Jesus.This novel is about a mighty German warrior named Atretes who was help captive by Rome as a gladiator after his village was raided. When he finally earned his freedom, he found out that his son who was supposed to have died, was alive and in the hands of a widow named Rizpah. Rizpah had lost her own baby and was a woman after God's own heart. Atretes finds the widow and demands to have his son back. Rizpah did not want to let the boy whom she had named Caleb go. After certain circumstances she was allowed to live as a hired hand to take care of Caleb.Atretes found out that the persons who had taken him captive and thrown him in the ludus wanted to have him fight in the arena as a gladiator once again. He did not want to and therefore fled Rome with Rizpah and his son to go back to his homeland, Germania. With the help of a Roman centurion, Theoliphus, who was a Christian, they were able to travel to Germania and back to Atretes' people, the Chatti where deception, evil spirits, murder, and redemption occur.I will leave it at there. I do not wish to reveal too much. This book is filled with adventure, romance, resurrection and spiritual warfare where God prevails. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As Sure as the Dawn is the third and final book of Francine Rivers' series of fictional Christian novels. Rizpah, a young Christian widow living in Ephesus, is given an unwanted baby shortly after the tragic death of her husband and only child. The baby, named Caleb by Rizpah, is the son of a renowned ex-gladiator name Atretes. Caleb's real mother lied to Atretes and said the baby died during childbirth. When Atretes finds out his son is alive, he demands to have him back. Because of Rizpah's love for Caleb, she is hesitant to return him. Although Rizpah gives the baby back, Atretes still needs her to feed Caleb because of the baby's refusal to nurse from anyone else. When Atretes decides to return to his home in Germany with his son Rizpah follows. Theophilus, a Christian and retired Roman centurion, guides them to Germany. The journey they take is not only physical but more importantly spiritual. In Germany the group spreads the gospel to those who will listen and overcome their own personal dilemmas.The main characters were well developed and realistic. By writing with omniscience, the author gave the feelings and emotions of the other characters. The setting in Rome and Germany during A.D. 79 was interesting. It gave insight into the period's culture and the difficulties that they faced. I especially liked the character of Rizpah who is a good role model for Christian women today. The overall theme of the book describes the struggle for Christians to witness to an unbelieving world and overcoming difficulties.Compared to the preceding novels, this one was a disappointment. It was not nearly as exciting or romantic as the other two. One weakness was the use of miracles for every turning point in the novel, making it slightly predictable. Overall the book was inspirational and enjoyable. I look forward to reading another Francine Rivers novel in the future."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Since I read the first two of the Mark of the Lion series, I had to read this. It was a wonderful story and brought closure to the lives of those met in the first two books. It was a gut-wrenching story from beginning to end, even if there were some lighter moments along the way. I thought the book could possibly have had better impact if she had made it into two books. There was too much drama and suspense for one book. On the other hand, her presentation of the gospel was without flaw. No one could ever read As Sure as the Dawn and face God saying, \\"I never knew.\\" I did get bogged down a bit in the section where Theophilus gives his detailed summary of the Bible. People who are familiar with the Bible have the advantage of skipping beyond and picking up on the dialogue and action, but those unfamiliar might respond better with an even briefer summary...not an easy thing for a writer to do. I would certainly recommend As Sure as the Dawn to serious readers, as I would any of Ms. Rivers' books."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"This book was real good. The characters were believeable. It was well written. The characters faced problems, that we face in our every day lives. But I was apprehensive about the miracles that happened in this book. I believe miracles do happen, but I felt that the author used miracles in this book, to show that the characters did have hardships, but to make sure that everything turned out okay in the end. It was good, but 'A Voice in the Wind' is my favorite book out of the entire series."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"As Sure As The Dawn is the final book of the Mark Of The Lion trilogy by Francine Rivers. Book one (A Voice In The Wind) follows the lives of Marcus, a rich Roman, Hadassah, a Jewish girl sold into slavery and Atretes, a German sold into the gladiator arenas. Book two (An Echo In The Darkness) follows just the lives of Marcus and Hadassah and then book three follows just the life of Atretes along with a young widow.One part that really struck me was the struggle that the young widow has in following God's call to the unknown versus following her own desire for comfort. It was challenging to witness was she and the Roman centurion gave up in order to reach an \\"unreached\\" group with the message of Jesus.Another aspect of the book that was really challenging was near the end when one character willingly gave up his life for the sake of spreading the message of Jesus. Not only did this person die, but the person died giving forgiveness to the killer (I am trying to remain vague to not give away a big part of the story). This person's example made me think if I would ever be willing to do the same, and to do the same with such grace and forgiveness.Now I have to mention several aspects of the story that I did not like...First, from the beginning to essentially one page before the end, all of the characters showed very little change. My biggest frustration was the lack of change in Atretes' life to the point that it just did not seem very realistic. Some of the same actions near the end of the book were essentially the same as the ones at the beginning. This \\"one-dimensional\\" aspect of the main characters made it tedious to read.Second, there was WAY too much dialogue and not enough action and adventure. I feel I am justified in saying this since book one and two had a great mix of action, adventure, love, and dialogue. This book was essentially mostly dialogue (usually arguing or getting mad) with a little adventure and even less action.Third, I felt that the main antagonist of the story in the second half of the book came across as very stereotypical and (again) felt one-dimensional. Additionally, the main character Atretes is such a foul person that he feels like he is antagonist for much of the book and it was hard to feel any feelings for him.This is the weakest of the three books and a disappointment considering how great the trilogy started. I think books two and three would have been better if they had intertwined them like book one was. If you read book one then you will want to read this to see how it ends, but it will not be as fun as the first or second. Three-and-a-half out of five stars."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"I enjoyed reading As Sure As the Dawn. It was so exciting that you don&#65533;t want to stop reading it. Although the second book in the series is still my favorite, I think As Sure as the Dawn is definately worth your time."},{"Title":"As Sure As the Dawn","review":"Some of the reviews say that this is not as good a book as the 1st and 2nd in the series, but believe me, it is just as wonderful! I liked this book just as much as the others. Of course, their story only took up one book and not 2 like Hadassah, but that doesn't mean that it is in any way worse! I totally loved it! Wow! It's great, and anything less than 4 stars is a total injustice of a rating!!!"},{"Title":"Foal to Five Years","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn something -- I didn't. There is no useful information in this book if you are going to be involved in caring for a mare and her foal.This is a nice book for absentee owners who want to talk about their mare and foal at cocktail parties. This is a great book for an 8 year old girl who dreams of having a horse and foal of her own (but who never will). This is not an acceptable book for children who will really be around horses -- the pictures show too many examples unsafe practices."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas (Jellybean Books(R))","review":"Beautifully illustrated, a true reading pleasure for my entire family. I am impressed with the value and quality of this book."},{"Title":"Justus von Liebig: The Chemical Gatekeeper (Cambridge Science Biographies)","review":"Baron Justus von Liebig was one of the most important chemists of the nineteenth century. He was, for instance, one of the founders of organic chemistry and largely responsible for the increasingly important study of biochemistry and bacteriology. His early work on agricultural chemistry revolutionized both British and American agriculture. His work on animal chemistry, combined with his agricultural work, to establish an influential theory of disease. William Brock's book is an admirably clear, understandable, and interesting study of von Liebig's life and career. His chapters are arranged topically, &quot;Liebig and the Doctors,&quot; for instance. This makes reading on particular topics much easier than it would otherwise be. His footnotes and bibliography are well presented, thorough, and do not clutter up the text. Those interested in either the history of science or the cross-cultural influences between Germany and Victorian Britain will find this study both informative and very interesting, even if they are not scientists themselves."},{"Title":"Megaskills","review":"Not only does this book advise one to teach children fundamental skills it tells one HOW to teach. It's not an overnight accompolishment, but it is the next best thing. This book gives clear, precise activities to do with you child on a normal persons schedule. I have found it relieves the guilt associated with not spending enough quality time with your children. It tells you what to do with them. It's so simple. I wonder why I didn't think of it."},{"Title":"Megaskills","review":"I am now retired from teaching and have grandchildren. I bought this for them because the skills are so valuable."},{"Title":"Death Rides the Mesa","review":"This is a very good read, it is not a classical western as one might think from the title. It is more of an adventure novel set in the west.Craig Ringland is shot by the mysterious Night Rider and spends the rest of the novel finding out the desperado's identity and righting the wrongs performed by this outlaw. In between, there are lots of archaeology digs, fistfights, and a love triangle. This book reads well and speeds along to the climatic ending. I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism","review":"Segal's study is wide-ranging and stimulating. His suggestions that Gnosticism arose in Judaism as a result of the polarization in the Jewish community over the issue of the status of God's primary angel and that the radicalization of Gnosticism developed out of the battle with the rabbis deserve study. One wonders, however, whether the influence of the rabbis was sufficiently strong as early as the origins of Gnosticism, and whether wider philosophical and religious developments in the period contributed more to the origins of Gnosticism than opposition to the rabbis. Recommended."},{"Title":"Galaxies","review":"I gave this book 5 starss for its good look into galaxies, what they look like the different types. This book is good for childeren who are interested in space and want to learn more about galaxies. This book is definently for kids, or adults who know just about nothing of galaxies. It gives you a good look at all the different kinds of galaxies and the diffent forms they come in. I think that this book is great for all the people out there who have no idea what a galaxy is made of or how hey formed into what they are today. If you are really interested in learning things about space, I recomend the book stars. It tells you just about everything you need to know about stars and what they are made of. There are many other space books out there that will teach you just about everything you need to know. This book is good for just aobut everybody who is just start to learn.Over all this is a good book to have even if youre not interested in space, it still has great pictures to hang on the wall."},{"Title":"Galaxies","review":"This book provides great pictures of galaxies & simple explainations for children.

I especially loved the picture that shows the Milky Way and has a tiny dot to show where our sun & solar system is located. Even after reading the story books to my children, it wasn't until I showed them that photograph, did the kids gasp as theyrealized how tiny were really are in this enormous cosmos."},{"Title":"Galaxies","review":"With allthe great photos available of the universe and it's galaxies, the pictures in this book terrible."},{"Title":"Galaxies","review":"Do not like the book. Took a gamble there would be some reference information I could use as an amateur astronomer...NOT. Its a kids book. Poor quality pictures. I have seen quality galaxy pictures and these were not it. Big type to take up space. Very basic descriptions. I already knew 95% what author wrote. Very disappointed. Will give book to my nephew as birthday present. That way his mom can show him the pictures and read the basic descriptions.At least someone will get enjoyment from it. No real substance to use as a reference book. Good for a 7 or 8 year old only. Even if your a new amateur astronomer you will want more meat and potatoes about Galaxies than this book offers.Save your money on this one. You can find a better book on Galaxies for grownups.

The story revolves around Duncan, a hapless adventurer and Mallory, a machiavellian, vegetarian dragon who is also an outcast. With Mallories 'Guidance' they get into many predicaments that still bring a chuckle today. If you like Asprin's work, his brand of humor abounds here. White's work is remeniscent of Phil Foglio's but retains a zany originality of it's own. If you want to read one of the funniest graphic novels of the early 90's, THIS is the one to get. 10 turnips!"},{"Title":"Duncan & Mallory","review":"I love this book. I found it completely by accident at a used bookstore and immediately fell in love with it. The humor is pure Robert Aspirin (of the Myth Adventures series) and Mel White's illustrations are the perfect complement to the humor. (Trivia note: the two con artists in the book are modeled after Mr. Asprirn and Ms. White) In-jokes abound in both the text and the artwork: keep checking the backgrounds if you don't believe me.And just to clarify an earlier reviewer's comment, Mallory is most definately a dragon. A small blue dragon. He comes from a family of dragons; this is a plot point.I'm afraid to say much more for fear of spoiling it for new readers.

Who's stealing styles from who here? It's generally a good read. Like most full-color graphic novels, it's too flaming short -- about fourty double-sided sheets, if I recall correctly. It makes a great coffee-table book, even though it's paperback (8.5\\" x 11\\") -- people pick it up, start thumbing through (USE THE GLOVES!! USE THE GLOVES!!) and start laughing. If you buy it, buy the sequels the same day. My promise to you... you will read all three within two hours and laugh yourself breathless repeatedly. --Phil"},{"Title":"Healthy Foods and Spiritual Nutritional Handbook","review":"The best little book I own about heathy eating.

You'll learn heathy alternatives that you can easily incorporate into your meal prep. You'll get recipes, an herbal remedy/illness reference guide, and a listing of resources to help you down the road. Good luck. This book is hard to get nowadays. Oh yeah - don't be fooled by the fact that it's a thin book. It's just an efficient use of time and space."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"The story and the writing seem to be both odd and at times difficult to follow. The latter is probably due to the age of the novel. It is however a very good novel and well worth the read.I love the character development in this and all of the Forster novels. It is slow to take shape but eventually it really comes through and is vivid."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Philosophers should enjoy this one. The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions. This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry. Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter. From there, the story lost steam."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"I bought this based on Foresters Passage to India. I liked it for the quality of the prose and a plot that I found interesting. However, Longest Journey was difficult for me to follow, despite 50 years of regular reading and a thorough understanding of British History. Like so many writers between 1850 and 1950,on both sides of the Atlantic, authors found fault with class society, prejudice towards the haves and glorification of the have nots. For all those writers, I wish they could come back for a day, and see the world as it exists. Now we have a large middle class, most of us are required to work for a living, and those who live on investments are subject to calamities as we are now eduring. As a middle class person who managed to save a few dollars, I now find that I have lost half of my savings. The loss of the ability to \\"live on your income\\" could also fall to the characters created in novels such as Longest Journey.For those who anticipated that leisure time, once granted to \\"everyman\\" would mirror the occupation of time that most of the \\"idle\\" classes a century ago. Unfortunately that is not so. Have you ever noticed any magazines of any intellectual quality at your local supermarket? We now have a literate society, but what do they read? We have HD 52\\" TV but what represents the majority of the 500 chanels? Wresting,soap opera's, reality TV, misinformed information chanels, and commercials on top of comercials. Some News programs look like the old three ring circus. If you don't like something, you can watch something else without moving from your seat; or changeing the channel.All this may seem far from a critique for this book, but as I read it, the shallowness of the Victorian Age as depicted by Forester would not sell either commercially or by anyone defining themself as an intellectual.Finding a plot or worse finding a reason to continue reading was difficult for me. I read for information, entertainment or at worse, a way to pass time as time passes me by. I would not recommend buying this book unless you are a masochist at heart."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Like all Forster's novels, the plot of 'The Longest Journey' is secondary to the underlying themes - the new 'mechanical' society that Forster hated, being true to yourself and class structure. It's not the kind of book you pick up in an airport - it's thought provoking and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Edward Morgan Forster expressed his special partiality for this particular book regretting that it was never as popular as \\"The Room with a View\\". It seems, however, that his readers knew better choosing either the lighter Italian novels or later works such as \\"Howards End\\" or \\"A Passage to India\\".Forster's partiality is comprehensible when we try to read the book through his biography. On the one hand he is able to reveal here his long-term infatuation with a fellow student and go back to his university adventures. On the other hand he uses his craft to draw for himself a life he would have had he decided to become straight. The image is far from pleasant - becoming straight means being imprisoned in a hapless marriage for which the hero has to pay with his academic career. It is an unhappy life which ends in an accidental death.This is an important novel in Forster's oeuvre and if you were attracted by others you should by all means proceed to \\"The Longest Journey\\". Still, a modern reader will gasp many a time while reading the novel. It wouldn't be fair to reveal too much but just let me draw your attention to one fact. Forster apparently finds dealing with his cast of characters a bit too much so they disappear one by one... as a result of sudden deaths. When Gerald is \\"broken\\" on a football pitch you gasp, but when you have drowning, heart attack, deathly cold and train accident and so on you can't help smiling."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"The Longest Journey can be difficult to get into, but is worth the effort. Set at the end of the Victorian period in England, it follows the character of Rickie Elliot from his Cambridge days through various attempts to find happiness and fulfillment in life. It helps to know a little about British society to fully understand each character's actions. The fascinating thing about the novel is that there isn't a single character that you can pinpoint as good or bad -- like real people, the characters lie and put on false fronts. It's fun to discover just who Rickie's friends and relatives really are. Characters like Agnes, who Rickie loves, and Mrs. Failing, his relative, make some great points about women in society. Although this book is primarily a &quot;novel of manners&quot; like Jane Austen would write, there are several exciting plot twists, including a surprise ending. If you enjoy books by authors like Jane Austen and Thomas Hardy, try The Longest Journey."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Forster's The Longest Journey is painfully bad: painfully awkward, painfully closeted, painfully dated, painfully class-conscious, painfully defiant of the norms of story-telling, painfully sententious at times and preachy. It's also painfully true.It's a \\"college\\" novel, like many others depicting the lives of its characters fatally determined by the inherently contingent friendships one forms in the nursery of one's college circle. I read it first in 1962, when I was living in painful intimacy with my \\"peers\\" in a painfully cloistered House at a painfully famous university. I suppose I had to write a painfully trivial paper about it. Now I've read it again, and I find that, seen backwards through the telescope of years, it's uproariously funny. I don't remember having that impression the first time. I imagine I found it more serious when I was living in it.I wonder why novels of the early 20th C seem so much more dated and mawkish at times than, for instance, Trollope or Fielding or Smollett? Perhaps it's the embarrassment that teenagers feel about their parents when those parents claim to have been young once and reveal the turmoils that only the current generation can take seriously. Anyway, I suspect that many readers will underrate this novel because of that uneasiness. All I can say is, if you're not reading it for homework, nobody will make you enjoy it. But if you give it a chance, you may find that it's painfully moving and beautiful."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"I find Forster an engaging and compelling writer. His novels often become absorbing despite flat passages and parts that, for me at least, are bordering on the unacceptable - the actions and thoughts of characters sometimes seem contrary to behaviour that seems at all natural to me.I missed the sense of the exotic in this novel that I got from 'A Passage to India' and 'Where Angels Fear to Tread' - and yet the world of the priveleged in the UK and the cloisters of Cambridge University are exotic for me. It's just that they are so gloomy in this novel - gloomy and troubled. Even the countryside is blighted by the freight trains that repeatedly claim lives as they tramp the landscape.This novel also has melodramatic elements that stretched my sense of credibility, however revelations of surprises are wonderfully managed. While my thoughts were heading in the right direction with the major revelation, when it did come it brought a true 'aha!' feeling - it made so much sense and yet I, like the characters in the story, had not seen it coming.But, perhaps for me, the most disappointing aspect of this novel is its attitude towards the 'disadvantaged'. As in the movie 'Edward Scissorhand' the 'distorted' person, while capable of receiving small 'gifts of love' (as Morike put it - see Hugo Wolf's song 'Verborgenheit') it seems from these views of life that the realistic approach to the 'distorted' is that they are incapable of true happiness or fulfilment. This is a view I certainly don't subscribe to."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"There seems a little bit of everything in English fiction in E. M. Forster's \\"The Longest Journey\\": A university coming-of-age story like \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", a pastoral idyll like \\"Far From The Madding Crowd\\", a subterranean human bond between men like \\"The Secret Sharer,\\" a lost-child parable like \\"Silas Marner.\\" At least stylistically, it's pretty impressive.Rickie Elliot is a sensitive young man studying at Cambridge when the novel begins, a kind of dreamer with means. He wishes to be a writer, but longs for a human connection absent from his life since his loving mother died. A sudden death presents him with what he thinks is that connection in a woman named Agnes, but after their marriage he discovers his void is not so easy to fill.Forster's 1907 novel starts out in a rather light and merry vein, poking fun at the philosophies of its various characters right from the start as Rickie and a group of his fellow undergraduates debate the existence of a theoretical cow his best friend Ansell insists is real because \\"I have proved it to myself.\\" When Rickie goes off to marry Agnes, Ansell takes a dim view of the affair, refusing to so much as say hello to the woman and telling Rickie he disapproves because \\"1) She is not serious. 2) She is not truthful.\\" So impractical is Ansell that he even decides to make philosophy a full-time career.The joke was on me, however. Ansell's advice turns out to be correct. The second half of the novel, after a sudden and tragic turn, becomes the passionately serious tale of Rickie extricating himself from a world of mindless conformity and convention to pursue the life of a committed aesthete and regaining Ansell's respect.Like I said, you seem to get several novels at once in this book. Some of it is marvelous. The story moves well, and the narrative is rich in descriptive delights. Early on, in the lighter half, we meet Rickie's wonderfully horrible aunt, a woman who ascribes the selflessness of others to their inherent dullness and is described as a \\"cold-eyed\\" character from Ibsen \\"who did not mind giving other people a chill provided it was not infectious.\\" In the grim later section, Forster writes of \\"the cruelty of Nature, to whom our refinement and piety are but as bubbles, hurrying downwards on the turbid waters. They break, and the stream continues.\\"It's not just the plot that changes, but the characters. Ansell goes from shrill pendant to honorable prophet, while Agnes morphs from gentle if shallow to thoroughly vile. At one point, Forster tells us she suffers most from having a husband who fails to \\"keep her in line.\\" Reading \\"The Longest Journey,\\" I felt myself in the hands of a very talented but confused young writer, not sure what affect he was after as he moved from chapter to chapter. Rickie's dilemma in the novel is carving out something of substance from what is more clearly a transient existence. My own problem was figuring out what point Forster was driving at and why I should care.In the end, I didn't feel any of the characters existed as more than philosophical constructs, whether it was Rickie romancing Agnes with a story of a woman who turned into a tree or his debating Ansell about that cow. This was okay enough in the beginning, when the mood was lighter, but once Forster broke out the violins I felt more of a strain and an effort keeping up. The emotional resonance was not there.I liked the book for the beauty of its prose and for the way it worked off-and-on, even in the second half which contains some fine philosophic ruminations about the nature of life. It doesn't quite gel as a story, but it broods very well and stays lively enough to keep you both reading and thinking. Not a waste, but not something that makes me want to read more Forster."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Edward Morgan Forster expressed his special partiality for this particular book regretting that it was never as popular as \\"The Room with a View\\". It seems, however, that his readers knew better choosing either the lighter Italian novels or later works such as \\"Howards End\\" or \\"A Passage to India\\".Forster's partiality is comprehensible when we try to read the book through his biography. On the one hand he is able to reveal here his long-term infatuation with a fellow student and go back to his university adventures. On the other hand he uses his craft to draw for himself a life he would have had he decided to become straight. The image is far from pleasant - becoming straight means being imprisoned in a hapless marriage for which the hero has to pay with his academic career. It is an unhappy life which ends in an accidental death.This is an important novel in Forster's oeuvre and if you were attracted by others you should by all means proceed to \\"The Longest Journey\\". Still, a modern reader will gasp many a time while reading the novel. It wouldn't be fair to reveal too much but just let me draw your attention to one fact. Forster apparently finds dealing with his cast of characters a bit too much so they disappear one by one... as a result of sudden deaths. When Gerald is \\"broken\\" on a football pitch you gasp, but when you have drowning, heart attack, deathly cold and train accident and so on you can't help smiling."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Orphan Ricky Elliot is a bit of a social outcast while studying at Cambridge. His lame leg doesn't help his status, however Ricky has a few friends, hopes to be a writer, and is pretty optimistic about the world. As time passes, optimism and dreams are given a dose of reality, and how he copes with reality is at the heart of this book.The Longest Journey is E.M. Forster's second novel, and although better than the first, the author intrusion, abrupt transitions and jumpy changes in point of view still made for a jarring read. Most irritating was the over-use of \\"she\\" and \\"he\\" instead of proper names. In one place I couldn't tell which of the two males in one scene had died until I began reading the next chapter. Forster could truly have benefited from a good critique group. I'm going to tackle two of his more famous works to see if his skills developed."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"The Longest Journey's suspicious form and strange conclusions were quite accurately detected by Lionel Trilling who declared this novel in comparison to Forster's others to be his least perfect, least compact, least precisely formed and, simultaneously, his most brilliant, most dramatic, and most passionate. Such a multi-faceted existence is an exact indication of the risky and unfamiliar lines upon which modernists walked. One can assume that Trilling considered A Passage to India to be the wiser and more perfect of Forster's novels in comparison. Where A Passage to India is socio-political, The Longest Journey is personal. The philosophical issues portrayed can be interpreted as being in dialogue with Forster's fellow scholars, pontificating upon the arguments of his academic circles. Scholars who engaged with these same philosophical arguments will no doubt warm to the affable and ironical gestures Forster uses to argue his case.The structure in which Forster composes The Longest Journey sometimes borders on an obsessive control of the novel's plot and particularly the characters. As the events of the story unfold, we see the frame leading us to a central statement about the human condition. The overemphasis of these points crowded with immense symbolism leads us to question the effectiveness of Forster's statements. Particular points in the story, such as Rickie's realisation that Stephen is his half brother and the reintroduction of Ansell teamed with Stephen, leave us in a troublesome position asking whether this highly personal story was sacrificed to the musically fluent style Forster was working. The Longest Journey's most difficult problem is that it introduces itself as a modernist novel whose commitment is to style, yet its story is obviously Forster's personal account of a series of emotions and events in his own life.The narrator's voice and Rickie's are essentially interchangeable. The only difference between the two is that the narrator is consciously aware of what Rickie's subconscious knows, but can't admit. If Rickie were so closely intertwined with the authorial voice, then it would seem that there is no room for intimacy with the reader. Yet, the story redeems itself through Rickie's struggle because it is so personal in its metaphysical complications. It is only later in the story, as it drifts farther away from Rickie's consciousness that the emotional impact lets go and we are left wandering through labyrinths of overt symbolic designs. The design in which Rickie is brought to his end is ultimately unfulfilling because the tragedy of the human condition makes itself so poignantly clear when the story is brought full circle to the ending ominously predicted from the outset. Instead, we are asked to accept that no life is tragic because of the enduring factor a human's spiritual hope. If Stephen were created as a character more complicated than a pastoral hero, then this resolution might be effective. However, in the troublesome structure it exists in, it falls short of an enlightening resolution.Within the complex faults that unfold from an authorial voice inseparable from a central character's consciousness, there is a meaning that resounds through. Apart from stylistic concerns, the modernists were intensely concerned about the human's existential crisis that results from an awareness of the bleak resistance to have faith in either scientific or theological assertions. Rickie is the only vehicle with which we can understand and interpret the complicity of an early twentieth century man's reality. The other characters exist as mere paper figures that serve stilted plot functions. It is through Rickie alone that we understand this particular metaphysical crisis. These sentiments are what make The Longest Journey an important work of modernist fiction in the historical sense. Its theoretical importance lies in the fact of its mismatched structural and sentimental tale's existence.There is an odd coincidence between symbols he and other modernist writers use. For example, Rickie hangs a towel over a painted harp in the room he is sleeping in at Ansell's house just as Woolf wrote about Mrs. Ramsay hanging her shawl over the skull hanging in the children's bedroom. The symbolic meaning of this can be interpreted in various ways. Yet, in Woolf's writing the meaning makes itself abundantly more clear because the style with which she works supersedes the story in To the Lighthouse. This is why To the Lighthouse is a more successful modernist experiment. A writer that does not work within the laws of the form in which they are working will inevitably fail in their efforts. Forster does not seem to be ignorant of these laws, but he is so enthusiastic about the application of them that his obsessive use of the stylistics becomes rather inappropriate.Forster often declaimed himself as \\"not a great novelist\\". The reason he felt this was probably because he was not able to abide by the standards that he himself set as the qualifications for great novels. This is, at least, the primary objection to be made toward The Longest Journey. In Aspects of the Novel Forster writes, \\"The novelist who betrays too much interest in his own method can never be more than interesting; he has given up the creation of character and summoned us to help analyse his own mind, and a heavy drop in the emotional thermometer results\\". The obsessive control of style as an opposition to the driving story he wanted to tell in The Longest Journey proves to be a fatal merging of a novelist who wants to keep with the artistic innovations of his time. Forster is too aware of his use of stylistic method to make the novel a wholly satisfactory piece of literature. Yet, because there is so much of Forster in the novel, it remains a very interesting book to serious and passionate readers."},{"Title":"Longest Journey, The","review":"Forster's The Longest Journey is painfully bad: painfully awkward, painfully closeted, painfully dated, painfully class-conscious, painfully defiant of the norms of story-telling, painfully sententious at times and preachy. It's also painfully true.It's a \\"college\\" novel, like many others depicting the lives of its characters fatally determined by the inherently contingent friendships one forms in the nursery of one's college circle. I read it first in 1962, when I was living in painful intimacy with my \\"peers\\" in a painfully cloistered House at a painfully famous university. I suppose I had to write a painfully trivial paper about it. Now I've read it again, and I find that, seen backwards through the telescope of years, it's uproariously funny. I don't remember having that impression the first time. I imagine I found it more serious when I was living in it.I wonder why novels of the early 20th C seem so much more dated and mawkish at times than, for instance, Trollope or Fielding or Smollett? Perhaps it's the embarrassment that teenagers feel about their parents when those parents claim to have been young once and reveal the turmoils that only the current generation can take seriously. Anyway, I suspect that many readers will underrate this novel because of that uneasiness. All I can say is, if you're not reading it for homework, nobody will make you enjoy it. But if you give it a chance, you may find that it's painfully moving and beautiful."},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Oscar","review":"These engaging tales are well translated and are a good introduction to Japanese folk literature.

His story of how that happened gives a view of the Manhattan project different from the well told histories of the eminent scientists and military leaders. Hull knew who Oppenheimer and Groves were but his role was a niche producing critical chemical explosive components at the more isolated S-site. For that matter he knew Klaus Fuchs with out any idea of the Soviet connection.That Hull was a scientist to the depths of his psyche is apparent when he describes his thoughts while careening down a hill driving a truck with failed breaks: \\"I knew that if even a slight misalignment occurred, the truck would translate its forward momentum into a rotation about an axis across the road.\\"The book is tantalizing in its brevity as when he alludes to Edward Teller during the Oppenheimer hearings: \\"He helped a petty man, Lewis Strauss, to harass a man better than either of them.\\" The memoir is a quick summary by someone who had a view of the birth of atomic weaponry from the nuts and bolts up through a thorough comprehension of the underlying theory. It adds to the understanding of how the great wealth of technical talent was put together in the remote New Mexican country side and managed to achieve the unimaginable.Illustrations by the author's son round out the mid-century feel of the narrative and the bibliography has Hull's comments on nine of the more important accounts of the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs."},{"Title":"Nervous Water: A Brady Coyne Novel (Brady Coyne Novels)","review":"I am not a huge \\"mystery\\" genre lover.

I am never sure if I just really like Tapply's writing or if I just really like the character her created. Regardless, this book is another wonderful Brady Coyne story.What makes these books so great is that Tapply has given his characters \\"real life\\" traits. They fight, make mistakes and work their way through the storylines at such a delightful and real pace that you can almost feel that they are real.Nervous Water explores deep-rooted family issues intermingled with legal and personal issues. At the same time, being entertaining and a page turner.I am not sure about the relationship between our main character and his \\"love\\". I always kind of feel that this does not work for Coyne and he should be single for a while.Also, I do find it difficult to plod through all the fishing references made (and there are alot in this one).

Boston lawyer Brady Coyne needs to find her and reunite her with her ailing adopted father, Brady's Uncle Moze, before the worst happens. His search covers ground from his ancestral home in southern Maine to towns west of Boston and south to Rhode Island. Cassie's new husband and stepchildren are less than helpful and seem to know more than they're telling about her disappearance. The task gets even trickier when Cassie's previous boyfriend is murdered mere minutes before he can talk to Brady. Very few strands of a trail exist, and Brady diligently pursues each one of them. If Cassie's not responsible for the most recent attacks, then who is? At the same time, Brady is serving as a mediator to a couple planning divorce, and that causes him to debate the stability of his own two-year live-in relationship with Evie. His own reunion with Uncle Moze forces him to think about the family matters that he usually ignores.With a storyline that's driven by dialogue, this is a fast read that can be finished in one or two sittings.

This time, while abroad, she is going to Bangkok, Thailand to visit Jennifer, Rob's daughter, who is there with her boyfriend Chat Chaiwong. Rob, a policeman, is Lara's significant other.Clive asks Lara to look into the disappearance of William Beauchamp. He left his wife, Natalie, and disabled daughter some time ago fleeing to Thailand. He opened an antique shop there. Now, he hasn't been heard from or seen for months. Lara finally agrees and meets with Natalie to get any pertinent information. He sent her some amulets which Lara takes with her. They might help with her inquiries.The many characters she encounters in Thailand, and the many escapades she and Jennifer experience, are very believable and add to the intrique. I think Lyn did a great job at creating the Chaiwong family -- showing their wealth and thus various attitudes throughout the book. She always brings some history into the books as well. This history adds to the story.Most of the books in this series have exotic settings. I know that Lyn does a lot of research and it shows in the great descriptions and knowledge of the areas. It makes me feel like I've been there after reading the book.Lara is a great character. She is very well developed and her actions are quite believable.

This book left me a bit disappointed because I expected an archeological mystery and got, instead a suspense tale with a few artifacts sprinkled in. There's nothing wrong with Lyn Hamilton's book but it wasn't what I wanted to read (think Agatha Christie with a large dose of Elizabeth Peters).The story is really a missing person tale with antique dealer Lara McClintoch off to Thailand to meet the parents of her daughter's fianc&eacute;, Chat Chaiwong, and try to find William Beauchamp, another dealer who ran away to Thailand and has since disappeared, leaving a destitute wife and child. What Lara doesn't anticipate is that Beauchamp's tale and the Chaiwong's are inextricably (and often fatally) intertwined. In the background of the main story arc Hamilton narrates the tale of one of the darker periods of Thai history, where betrayal and murder were a constant of the political environment. The plot and the history reflect each other, perhaps a bit too much, in retrospect.I find that Hamilton's writing is a bit too calm for my taste, but that she does weave a complex tale with plenty of twists and turns. The protagonists are all likeable, but this isn't really a 'cosy.' In fact, the underlying story is grim and dark enough that it never gets lost in the witty repartee. I'm going to give this three stars, not out of pique, but out of the suspicion that the writer can do much better and I need to leave room if my opinion improves.

I found the writing to be uncomplicated, and the story told in a fashion that centers on its pleasant investigator. Yet some of the events told were of dastardly deeds and untimely deaths. It seemed almost inconsistent with the tone. No attempt is made at deep character development, although the plot itself has been designed with twists, turns, and surprises, and that ultimately is what makes the book worth reading. There are no fancy turns of phrase either. Just mystery in that exotic setting, a setting I am familiar with and enjoyed re-visiting. Bottom line though is that I prefer those turns of phrase and character development that make a novel art as well as mystery, so one of Lyn's novels will suit me just fine."},{"Title":"Can You Feel Me?

It it a quasi-fictional account of his actual experience living among a group of canibals on a South Seas near- paradise. Melville's central character, Tommo, is Melville, and his experiences are broadened to four months instead of Melville's actual four weeks. Melville uses the work to comment freely on the conflict between civilization's growing encroachment upon an unspoiled paradise and the evils that civilization wrought. He also launches into repetitive descriptions of the island of Nukuheva which Melville feels is typical of the lush verdant beauty of all of the Polynesian islands. I taught this book for two years back in the 70's with a group of American literature students. I decided to revive it this year (1998)with a group of honors juniors (American Literature)at my high school. Oddly enough, the book seemed to be more favorably received this year than a couple of decades ago. Some students complained of its repetitive nature, particularly the descriptions, but most found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The book must be considered in light of the Romantic Era from which it emerged. Accounts of far-off exotic isles and high order adventure were the order of the day. In addition, the blind love of Nature and the admiration of the Rousseau's &quot;noble savage&quot; are hallmarks of the book. One must also think what readers in the 1800's thought of the sensual side of the book. Exotic descriptions of naked island girls, in particular Tommo's lovely Fayaway, left a lot up to the imagination of nineteenth century readers. Whether Tommo's relationship with Fayaway is merely platonic or highly physical is left to the reader to decide though it hints at the latter. Also of interest is Melville's condemnation of missionary work. Though at one point he concedes that the principle of bringing Christianity is good, he admonishes that the islanders should be civilized with benefits not crimes as was then more often the case. I found the book very enjoyable the second time around and would recommend it to teachers as an alternative to Moby Dick or Billy Budd as a representative work of Melville or Amercian Romanticism."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"1841. A young man of 23 is looking for adventure, he signs a contract on a New England whaler and travels to the South Pacific. Life on the ship is not what he expected, the captain is a tyrant, the life is a bore, food is terrible. The ship reaches the Marquesas after 15 months, with no commercial success so far and the prospect of another few years of the same. The islands have just been occupied and claimed by the French. What one knows of the locals is full of horror: cannibals! But also of delight: the women! On arrival in the harbour, a fantastic party with the best orgy since 15 months is happening. But nothing can distract our hero from his plan: jump ship, wait for its departure, then look for another way home. He finds a companion for the desertion and does it. Then follows an account of 4 months among the cannibals -- while in reality it lasted only 1 month. This is a fictionally embellished travel and adventure story. 5 years later, a book is published. It will be Melville's first and most successful book during his lifetime. From here on, it went down for him.The book lets us observe one of the great American writers in his initiation phase. A future ancestor of Conrad and O'Brian, two of my addictions. I wonder why I bypassed him for so long, with the exception of the Whale, which I read 30 years ago. And loved.Typee gives you an adventure account in exotic surroundings, told in often surprisingly fresh language, but totally free of any scientific pretension: few observations on flora, fauna or geology, but a lot of romantic landscaping. Young Melville was no Maturin.There is a lot of ethnology, the description of the people, their village and life takes a lot of space, so does the process of miscommunicating between the two white runaways and the tribe. As a matter of fact, not much verbal communication happened, the hero spent most of his time in a kind of fog: what was his status? was he a guest? a captive? a friend? was he destined for BBQ? Only half way through the story does he meet briefly a man who speaks some English, and it becomes clear that he is indeed a captive, but to what purpose is not clear.He does reflect on the religion of the tribe, as observed by him in the practices of rituals, and concludes that the information spread by missionaries in the US is exaggerating wildly as far as the practices of paganism are concerned. Self-serving, obviously.He takes a strong position against the morality of our civilization as opposed to the noble naked savages that he gets to know: the white civilized man is the most ferocious animal on the face of the earth, he concludes.He was a bit in love with fair Fayaway, no doubt.More Melville to follow here!"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"\\"Typee\\" is based on Melville's experiences when, as a young man of 22, he \\"jumped ship\\" from an American whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific. It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked. While, like \\"Moby Dick\\", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface.For a first novel, written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the Typee. In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at the activities of Western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise. Gradually dread, loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as \\"Tommo\\", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast. He is finally rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the Typees.I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor of English. It was very helpful with Melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context. The chapter on \\"Typee\\" in \\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\" by D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding. Newton Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place \\"Typee\\" in the development of Melville as a writer.Highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century American romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of \\"Moby Dick\\"."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Realizing that at least some people might want to know if the book is a good read or not, I'll write a review that hopefully wont read like the opener to a thesis on early american literature: Here goes...I liked it! I thought this Mellville guy writes and interesting and egageing story. Perhaps he does go into details that the story doesn't need, but even his tangents on trees and fruits, etc. are well written.Worth the money, worth the time, and worth the attention. Plus, there is the added benefit of acting like a literature snob on a review.:)Its a book, people. Relax, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Melville's famed magnus opus, \\"Moby Dick\\" should not be tackled without this adequate introduction to his work and dazzling literary adroitness. Do not have any apprehensions animated by a seemingly simplistic or bromide plot, for once a reader foreign to Melville's work grasps the exquisite prose and sincere romanticism ingrained in all of his novels, you're soon to become a captive of it's pages bound by an aroused imagination. Soon to learn the fame and notoriety surrounding Herman Melville is certainly not without reason and like many noble literary giants that have gone before us, his masterpieces withstand the test of time deservingly of the title, \\"Classic.\\"The quixotic idea of emerging as a castaway on a dissolute tropical island hidden from the world, deep in paradise with only the company of an exotic but mysterious native people should not deter you from believing \\"Typee\\" is of any similarity to other inferior postdating stories of the like. Melville combines a brilliantly adventurous travelogue accompanied by earnest philosophical reflections balancing it all out with anthropological observations of the Island's primitive peoples, as well as recollections of his own home. This famed novel was an ebullient endeavor during it's day which hints the emprise of such modern films as \\"Castaway\\" while engrossing the empathy of multiculturalism found in \\"Dances With Wolves.\\" It is feasibly the first accurate portrait painted of South Pacific life through the eyes of a Westerner, influencing many travelogues to follow focusing on the region in the same fashion of Stevenson and Becke.Numerous editions have been published since the original. The Penguin Classics Edition provides an introduction by author John Bryant who puts the story into context and Melville's conclusion of the supporting character's fate, written two years prior to the first edition in \\"Sequel: The Story of Toby.\\"When first published in 1846, \\"Typee\\" was an immediate hit. Readers of the era in the US and even in Europe already knew to expect stupendous things from the then obscure author. This is exemplified by the book's quantum leap to stardom. The original draft was submitted to be published in New York but was rejected supposedly because it was \\"too fantastic\\" to be true. The apparent fact that after more than a century and a half of being published readers still have an appetite for Melville's original work, must persuade even the most discriminating of literary tastes of the caliber of his writing. Do not be deceived by the age of \\"Typee.\\" You needn't be a diehard classical literature enthusiast nor scholar to appreciate this very readable, gracefully written novel. Which is contrary to the sometimes unfathomable rhetoric of the bygone antebellum era. It remains still just as amusing and captivating to readers today.\\"Typee\\" was the first of a trilogy of autobiographical novels set in the South Pacific dealing with Polynesian life. Readers of the author's lifetime couldn't get enough of his masterpieces still acclaimed today. Although not quite as well known as \\"Moby Dick\\" is to modern day readers, \\"Typee\\" is no less gripping or eloquent."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"What I gather from some of the reviews here is that because Melville wrote some complex novels later in his career, some people will probe and muse upon everything he writes until some deep meaning or intent can be wrung out of it. I'm sure many academics in the world of publish-or-perish have concocted quite extravagant analyses of books such as 'Typee' in order to keep their jobs.From a more sensible vantage point, while Melville certainly evolved into a more complex writer, there's no reason to believe he intended writing a 'deep' or symbolic book with 'Typee'. 'Typee' was his first book, and it became an immediate success because of its colorful handling of Melville's experiences among the inhabitants of Polynesia. End of story.Melville's account is what would today be classified as 'narrative fiction', meaning he took his actual experiences and molded them slightly to communicate a larger idea he had in mind. With 'Typee', Melville's larger idea is the comparison of civilization and savagery. His conclusion is that so-called savages - like Typees - are in many ways superior to their civilized counterparts. Great message, but it doesn't make this book something you can dwell on for days or analyze to death.Most readers will find Melville's writing pretty crisp, especially given the time he was writing and the time we're reading. His theme and his approach make 'Typee' far more readable than a straight travelogue but less exciting than an adventure novel. Bottom line, this is a good read. While the plot is rather thin, Melville's digressions into the culture of the Typee are really the point of the book and he doesn't stick to any subject long enough for you to get bored. On the contrary, his observations are very interesting especially given that he had no way of understanding or explaining much of what he saw.Read 'Typee' for what it is and enjoy it as so many people have before. Take away the message Melville intended, which I promise you will not need to be especially sharp or penetrating to tease out. Please don't make 'Typee' out to be a piece of esoteric literature (like 'Moby Dick') when it clearly is not."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Although Typee is based on his own experiences in the South Pacific, Melville's popular work is wonderful adventure fiction. Disillusioned with months at sea on a whaling boat Tommo/Melville jumps ship with his friend Toby on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas archipelago of what is modern day French Polynesia. They are quickly captured by the Typee tribe who carry a murderous and cannibalistic reputation but are surprised to find that they are treated with respect and hospitality by their captors. However, it is soon apparent that the Typee, for reasons that are not clear, have no intention of letting them go for they are shadowed everywhere and under constant surveillance by groups of villagers. Toby makes an early escape with the intention of summoning help for Tommo who is being nursed for a serious leg wound by the fair-skinned beauty, Fayaway. When his friend fails to return Tommo reluctantly acquiesces to his situation. His subsequent anthropological observations are not dry text but a humorous and fascinating glimpse into an inscrutable world where the jollity, sensuality and general indolence of the villagers are lights year away from the puritanical and Protestant New England of Tommo's/Melville's own background. Some of the customs and practices have survived to this day and the words are still in use (recognisable despite Melville's esoteric spelling) as Marquesan is spoken in preference to French throughout the islands. (Some years later the people of Nuku Hiva were to be converted to Catholicism and it must have come as a shock to them to discover that they had been praying to the wrong idols for the previous two millennia.) Although the attitudes of the day were apparent in places - \`Kory-Kory, though the most devoted and best-natured serving-man in the world, was alas! a hideous object to look upon' - Melville compares the natural beauty of the many of the Typee, both men and women, most favourably with the over-preened, coiffured dilettantes of the \`civilised' world. With the sumptuous Fayaway and devoted Kory-Kory, he passes the days in sloth, lying around, eating, and swimming. He is effectively in a \`golden jail'. As months pass, though, he becomes gloomy at his isolation and inability to meaningfully converse with the villagers and, when he makes a gruesome discovery, he develops a dreadful foreboding as to the possible outcome for his captivity. The novel closes with tension and drama.Today, the village of Taipivai (River Taipi) is as tranquil a place as one could imagine, with the villagers enjoying a pace of life barely changed since Melville's time 170 years ago. Highly recommended to all who enjoy old-fashioned adventure and those who are interested in the history and culture of Pacific island communities. A second book, the less well-known Omoo, continues the author's South Seas escapades."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"(This review is based on the Library of America edition)Melville's first book - and you can call it a novel, because it is - is quite an impressive work. I have to admit that during my reading of it, I didn't know how much was non-fiction and how much was fiction. In the case of a non-fiction book, I would have been rather astonished by Melville's work. But the fact is that this isn't a non-fiction book, and that as a reader you should think more of a literary work. But do not be sad!For what Melville does remains awesome. The book begins like a novel; the narrator seeks to escape his whaler and remain some time on one of the Marquesan Islands. After numerous adventures, he's eventually caught by the Typees, and from that point on, the book becomes close to an anthropological study of the exotic habits of the tribe. Melville is very insightful and witty, and more often than not, funny. His prose is rich and wonderful. A pure pleasure to read.\\"Typee\\" is a peek at some kind of long lost Eden, where no one has to work for a living - fruits can be plucked any time - and where there seems to be no evil. The Typees all have perfect beautiful skin, due to countless bathings during the day, and they're seldom seen to either cause or receive any harm. However, things aren't so dream-like, and the narrator is constantly haunted by the ghost of cannibalism, especially as he has no clear idea of why his captors detain him and yet treat him kindly.The author manages to produce some very interesting comparisons between the exotic \\"savages\\" and the Western Man, and this reminds me of many a sociologic book. Society, culture, humanity, all of these - and more - are considered from a very unique perspective in \\"Typee\\". Life among the cannibals, in an Eden of sorts, that is, in short, what the novel is about. Excellent read from a master of literature."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"All things considered, Typee is an excellent book considering it was Melville's first. The themes hidden inside a simple voyage onto the Nukuheva island are utterly breath-taking. Although Meliville states that \\"He has stated such matters just as they occurred, and leaves every one to form his own opinion concerning them,\\"(xx), we all know that the truth was stretched out such as the fact that, in reality, he was only on the Islands for four weeks, not four months. But his imagery, symbolism, and entire demise of the meaning of \\"civilization,\\" is what makes this novel, a remarkable one.The magnificent scenery and what it stands for is the readers first see as Melville's first main themes in Typee. Melville's imagery is what catches the attention of his readers. They delve deep within the picture he displays with the words he selects. The entire island that is described constantly through the story gives a sort of reference to the garden of Eden, but of course has a hidden meaning. Some critics interpret the reference to the garden of Eden as a symbol for innocence. But when Tommo first hears of the dreaded Typees, he only believes in their cannibalism. After living with them for four months, he always has that first reaction of the Typees in the back of his mind. Other critics would argue that the injured leg that Tommo is mysteriously diagnosed of only comes and goes according to his true feeling of the Typees at that moment. The Garden of Eden is known for it's beauty, it's tranquility, and it's innocence. All these things are attributes of the island but yet they also show that there cannot be innoncence without violence. The Typees are figured out in the end and the sayings are true but not how the rumors are spread. Tommo figures out that the \\"savages\\" are more civilized than the white men are back at home. Those French that landed to come take over are not helping the savages; they are destroying their villages and culture, like \\"savages.\\" Ever since the beginning, Tommo notices that the savages are probably the truly more humane of the two. \\"'Yet, after all,' I quoth to myself, 'insensible as he is to a thousand wants, and removed from harassing cares, may not the savage be the happier man of the two?'\\" (29) This quote demonstrates two things. The undoubtable influence Shakespeare had on Melville and the remarkable foreshadowing that was to display the complete way of life, even of those most \\"savage,\\" the Typees.Another main part of Typee is the theme of forbidden romance. Tommo falls in love with the beautiful Fayaway and in the end, he could not even console her as she sobbed while he escaped in a row boat home. Melville proves in his writing that even though Tommo was entirely happy at times, there was always a moment of doubt. Here he demonstrates that even though this is \\"paradise\\" or \\"utopia,\\" man will always miss his own culture no matter how violent they can be. Even though Tommo degraded the white man at every sign of native compassion to each other, he still wanted to go back. Don't forget that he was a prisoner in this peaceful place, and he escapes the island through the one thing that he feared, violence. Was it that he had learned the way of the Typees or had it always been there?"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Much of this first novel of Melville's reads more like a documentary than an adventure novel. This story of Tommo's time as a prisoner to the Typee savages (mirrored after Meliville's own experiences with a Tahitian tribe) isn't the most exciting book you'll read. Most of it is actually taken up by detailed descriptions of the (imaginary?) Typee tribes-people, their customs, habits, ect. Because it is based on real experiences, it is somewhat difficult to determine what is fiction and what is really true of Pacific-Islander life. In-depth descriptions of how food is processed, how clothing is made, and how island life is organized ring true, while a few parts of the book, like the beauty of the people and their habitually lazy lifestyles, seem exaggerated.Melville's writing style reminds me of Jules Verne. The mundane tone used to describe (in great detail) people, objects, and occasions is very similar to what you get in Verne's novels (thinkFive Weeks in a Balloon). Also similar is the constant but dry and never-distracting humor always just beneath the surface, helping to make this otherwise lengthy-feeling descriptive work entertaining to read. Admittedly, there aren't the same sort of intense life-and-death situations here, but the tone and descriptive writing certainly have similarities to Jules Verne's style.This book is most well-known for its poignant social commentary. The unfavorable comparisons of Western society to the stress-free life of the islands, and the condemnation of the corrupting influences of military and religious 'civilizing' influences on tribal people might have been offensive or enlightening to some in the 1850's, but seem like nothing original today. The unrefined, unashamed, and unladylike behaviour of the Polynesian women may have shocked readers at the time of publishing, but today, while lovely, it doesn't cause consternation.I wouldn't recommend this book for the thrill seeker, or adventure lover. Only for those interested in the early work of Herman Meliville or a documentary-like story from the 1850's about life in an uncivilized tropical paradise."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Herman Melville's style of detailed descriptions certainly comes though in this slim 210-page volume written in 1846. He describes life aboard ship, the geography of the island and the technical aspects of making clothing, tattooing and preparing food as well as many native ritual customs. This is all seen through the eyes of his lead character, Tom, called Tommo by the natives. The book put me right there with him, when, exhausted and starved, he and Toby, the other seaman he jumped ship with, find their way into the world of the Typees. The two sailors are treated well, but are kept virtual prisoners and there is apprehension throughout about the Typees' cannibal tendencies. In spite of that, there is also joy as Tommo views the simple and carefree life of the people he considers savages and contrasts it to life in the so-called &quot;civilized world&quot;.The Typees seem perennially happy and content. They spend a lot of time amusing themselves as food is plentiful and there is not much work to do. Their lives are idealized so much that I found myself raising a quizzical eyebrow at times. But the story was so good and so well written that I didn't let it get in my way of enjoying the book, which must have been received with similar delight when it was published as it not only painted a picture of a better world, it appealed to everyone's sense of adventure.I loved the book, especially the social commentary. I found myself reading it quickly and at odd times during to day just to see what would happen on the next page. It sure was a good story and seems as fresh and meaningful today it when was published more than a century and a half ago."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"I just finished Typee and enjoyed the book a great deal (I'm 38, male, and love reading for general education and enjoyment). A few months ago, I made a noble attempt to wade through Moby Dick (I jumped to the last chapter after about a quarter of the book) and I was curious to see if &quot;early Melville&quot; was any easier.Typee is billed as both an adventure novel and as shocking anthropology. I found Typee well written, but a bit dense with long, detailed, descriptions about trees, landscapes, etc. that don't apply to characters, nor plot (and did put me to sleep). These long passages make it hard for me to call this an adventure novel, but this style seems to be standard fair when reading early American adventure novels (like &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; by J. F. Cooper).Reading Typee in 1997 doesn't produce the same moral outrage as it did when it was first published in 1846. But, looking for Melville's cultural observations and comparisons was a great part of what made Typee so very enjoyable. So, for me, it is isn't the adventure that makes the book worth reading, but the author's, and my own, observations and comparisons of different lifestyles.While reading Melville's observations on a primitive culture, I began to marvel at the his ability to transcend his culture and to describe the vastly different culture he had experienced. In Typee he writes about everything from eating raw fish, primitive idol worship, polyandry (multiple husband) marriages, and cannibalism, all without the negative judgment or superiority one might expect from an American in 1847. I must admire the observer when, discussing cannibalism, he writes: &quot;But here, Truth, who loves to be centrally located, is again found between two extremes;...&quot; When reading Melville's cultural observations he inspired me to keep an open mind.I also enjoyed Melville's comparisons between the island culture and his home culture. It is great fun to read Melville's comparison of the stress free, non-capitalistic islanders and the debtors prisons of America. It is unique to see that Melville was able to say maybe his culture isn't the best and that western influence might not be the best influence. He writes early in the book: &quot;Thrice happy are they who, inhabiting some yet undiscovered island in the midst of the ocean, have never been brought into contaminating contact with the white man.&quot;But my greatest pleasure, when reading Typee, was in making comparisons between the changes in American culture since the books publication and today. To a buttoned-up, victorian society the descriptions of island women dressed only in tropical flowers must have been a mind bender indeed. However, to our post-flower child generation these descriptions seem tame. When Melville states: &quot;The varied dances of the Marquesan girls are beautiful in the extreme, but there is an abandoned voluptuousness in their character which I dare not describe.&quot; it is hard to believe that he could describe something that our current generation hasn't seen in the movies (and with a PG-13 rating!).In conclusion, I encourage you to read Typee. I think it is an enjoyable book and today's readers can find the value of the book without having to get someone else to explain it to you. In addition, I believe that everyone can finish it and thereby allow you to proudly claim that you have indeed read Melville. And, once you have finished a &quot;classic&quot; and been able to see its value, you can begin to understand the common thread that caused your American Literature professor to label Melville, together with F. Scott Fiztgerald and Jack Kerouac, as one of the observers of American society. I am now off to read &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;On the Road.&quot;- Anthony J. Godwinp.s. Did you know that Herman Melville wrote Moby Dick, but that Moby Dick never wrote him back!"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"I read this book to get a better sense of Melville's abilities and his style. Having read Moby Dick, I was prepared for a complicated and somewhat dissolute read with great symbolism. Typee is none of that, though it has elements of the style that would, through Moby Dick make Melville post-humously famous. Written today, this book would not be a hit, though one can see why it was when it was published in the 1800s. The symbolism in Typee is not as substantive or immediately obvious as in MD, but it is present and gives this work more depth than is at first apparent. I don't know that I have an accurate sense of what Melville is all about after reading this and MD, and I would probably recommend one read Billy Budd or at least another novel in order to really get a feel for Melville."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Two young American sailors jump ship in the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, to escape the harsh regime of a tyrannical whaling captain. They head for the hills, planning to hole up there till their ship departs. But, there's nothing to eat up there and they have not had the foresight to take any food with them. They must venture into the Polynesian \`backlands' and throw themselves on the mercy of the locals. They know that there are two valleys, one inhabited by the peaceful, friendly Happars (Hapa'a ?) and the other by the fierce Typees, a group of notorious cannibals. After considerable hardship and feats of physical endurance they descend from the steep, volcanic ridges into a valley. But which one is it ? Uh-oh, you guessed it, it's the one where the Typees live. But lo and behold, the Typees turn out to be a most friendly, hospitable group providing food, shelter, clothing, and sex, not to mention a lazy lotus-eater's existence. Melville (for he did live with such a group in 1842) acknowledges that the Marquesans were far from savages, that their violent reputation probably stemmed from the treatment they'd received on the few occasions that Westerners contacted them. He criticizes the baneful influences of so-called \\"civilization\\" on Pacific islanders in general and is especially disparaging towards missionaries.TYPEE is a novel, not a straightforward account of Melville's own stay. Tom, the protagonist, comes to realize that though the treatment he receives is benign, he is a prisoner. His friend disappears, but Tom, with a leg swollen by disease, cannot escape so easily. Having cannibalism always in his mind, Tom worries that he is being 'fattened up' for some horrible end. While Melville gives details of Pacific island life---daily routine, how to make tapa, breadfruit and its uses, houses, some details of war, funerals, and even cannibalism---his (Melville's) inability to speak much of the local Polynesian dialect hinders him from much understanding. Hence, his take on social class, on religion and ritual is from a totally uninformed point of view. Though he repeatedly claims that the people did almost no work, that is highly unlikely, even if their life must have been easier than the life of average people in the USA or England at the time. Readers of the 1840s, unlike those of today with access to television, the Internet, numerous films, and a myriad books, must have thrilled to read details of such a remote place and different culture, presented in such romantic, adventurous form. Despite the 19th century literary style, which might put off casual readers, TYPEE still holds your attention. Will Tom escape ? How ? If you are looking for a theological/philosophical treatise, forget it. This was a best seller in its day and made Melville's reputation. As for the Marquesans, well, there were perhaps 100,000 people there when Western ships first arrived. By 1900, only two thousand were left. Today there are still less than ten thousand; disease, violence, and alcohol did their dirty work. Melville wasn't just whistling Dixie. I enjoyed this book as much, if not more, than when I read it first at the age of twelve many moons ago."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Heritage's 1963 edition of Melville's Typee -- a sand-colored slipcase contains the hardcover book, bound in textured cloth with a three-color design. 24 Covarrubias color illustrations.

When I drive long distances it is a favorite to listen to. Melville paints great visions of the south tropical Pacific Islands and touches so sweetly into the simple lives of simple living. It is full of suspense, intrigue, beauty, and laughter. I love this book so much I had to buy an original 1800's hardcopy on ebay and it now graces my collection."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Typee was Melville's first book. The great symbolic prose of Moby Dick is not to be seen here, but it is interesting to get a sense of the development of Melville's writing. This book is a semi-fictional account of Melville's experiences in the South Seas. While his own visit was a brief one, the hero of this book ends up in the Typee Valley for four months. Melville used numerous current accounts in order to flesh out this story. A strong point of this Riverside edition is that it also includes several of these sources, so that the reader can get a sense of what else was available on South Island life at the time. Most of these contemporary sources are imperialistic or surprisingly inaccurate. This is a good read for those who are interested in the development of cross-cultural relations between Westerners and the natives of the South Seas. Not surprisingly, Westerners come out in a bad light. It will make you question what the word 'civilization' means."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Herman Melville's &quot;Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life&quot; tells the story of a white sailor who lives for a time among the Typees, a native people of a Pacific island. According to a &quot;Note on the Text&quot; in the Penguin Classics edition, this book first appeared in 1846 in no less than four different editions.&quot;Typee&quot; is a marvelous story of cross-cultural contact. It is also a fascinating glimpse at a pre-industrial culture; Tom (known as &quot;Tommo&quot; to the Typees) describes in detail the food, dress, tattooing, physiology, musical instruments, architecture, warfare, religious practices, and social customs of the Typees. The book is full of vividly portrayed characters: the gentle beauty Fayaway, the &quot;eccentric old warrior&quot; Marheyo, the talkative &quot;serving-man&quot; Kory-Kory, and more.Melville's prose style in &quot;Typee&quot; is irresistible: the writing is fresh, lively, and richly descriptive. There is a satirical thrust to much of the book. And there is a lot of humor; at many points I literally laughed out loud. Such scenes as the description of a wild pig's frustrated efforts to break open a coconut really showcase Melville's comic flair.A major theme of &quot;Typee&quot; is that of the &quot;noble savage&quot; (Melville actually uses the term). The narrator often wonders whether Typee life is in some ways better than Western life, and is quite critical of the work of Christian missionaries among Pacific Island peoples. The book is richly ironic, as Melville's narrator reflects on the problematic nature of cross-cultural observation: &quot;I saw everything, but could comprehend nothing&quot; (from Chapter 24).&quot;Typee&quot; is more than just a colorful travelogue or a philosophical reflection; it is also a genuinely exciting and suspenseful adventure story. Melville's story of a visitor to a strange alien world curiously anticipates a major theme of 20th century science fiction; thus a novel like Ursula K. LeGuin's &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; would make a fascinating companion text. Also recommended as a companion text: &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; another 19th century American classic which casts a critical light on Eurocentric Christianity."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"This is not a review of the book \\"Typee\\" but only the Kindle edition. The Penguin edition is based upon modern scholarship, choosing among four texts to create one version that may be close to Melleville's original intent. But the Kindle version is full of typos, word substitutions, and other artifacts of optical character recognition. There is about one typo per pageShame on Penguin for offering such a corrupted version of what was a well-edited edition. Buy the paperback if you care about this."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"There are plenty of free electronic versions available of Typee. But I decided to buy this one anyway assuming that the time spent by the editors on the footnotes and on combining several editions of the work, would be worth the money. But to my disappointment, this Kindle edition is just a scanned version of the printed book with OCR software applied to it. The book is not divided into chapters, there is no link between the footnotes and their location in the text (I didn't manage to figure out what the numbers of the footnotes actually refer to) and there are frequent OCR errors. If you want to read Typee on your Kindle, there are probably better versions available than this one."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"If you're going to read an early 19th century novel, you better be prepared for a stilted writing style. Melville is certainly no exception. Particularly absurd is the dialogue. Did people really talk that way in the 1840s? I doubt it. Early Hollywood must have gotten its images of cannibals and South Sea island life from this book. Based in reality, the tome is Melville's first novel, and it was a great success upon publication. Most readers would never visit the South Seas, so they got their images from this. It did make me wonder what life is like there today. There's some tittilation in the descriptions of Melville's affair with the native savage Fayaway, a teen girl he takes up with while held captive by the Typee tribe. I wondered if they did it. Melville makes a pretty good crank when he rails against the damage done by Christian missionaries. I'd had this book sitting around since 1968 and finally decided to read it. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Typee was a difficult book to read but worth the effort. There isn't much plot beyond \\"Tommo's\\" rehabilitation at the hands of the Typee and his fears that they might be cannibals. Is he being nursed back to health or fattened for a future supper? As with Moby Dick, the bulk of the text is in the form of essay and commentary. There are lengthy discussions on the language, the architecture, the music (or lack thereof), taboos and tatoos, and diet of the Typee. These extra chapters though don't have the humor that is present in Moby Dick. They are still an interesting observation on one subset of Polynesian culture."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Under the influence of Defoe's journalistic style, Herman Melville wrote \\"Typee,\\" a combination of travelogue and novel about some weeks he had spent as a guest-turned-prisoner of a tribe of savages on a South Pacific island. How much of the account is fact rather than fiction is difficult to deduce from the tone of Melville's presentation, but the question of veracity doesn't diminish the entertainment value, because \\"Typee\\" is a colorfully detailed adventure yarn that reads like National Geographic crossed with Boys' Life.Melville is serving as a sailor on a whaling ship called the Dolly which is cruising the South Pacific and lands on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas, among the easternmost of the archipelagoes in the vast group known collectively as Polynesia. Deserting the ship because of the captain's tyranny, he and another like-minded crew member, named Toby, plunge into the mountainous wilderness of Nukuheva with the plan of later obtaining passage on another ship leaving the island, which has heavy French marine traffic. They enter an isolated valley inhabited by a tribe called the Typees, who invite them to live in their community. Melville and Toby accept the invitation because they have nowhere else to go for the time being, and the Typees seem friendly despite their reputation as cannibals.The Typees treat Melville (who has told them his name is Tom) extremely well, but they refuse to release him from captivity; Toby meanwhile has gone off to the harbors for medical relief but never returns, leaving Melville to describe the customs and activities of the Typees. Their religion is festive, but they have a strange relationship with their gods, whom they berate by abusing their idols. Their language, which has a tendency to double words, is quite comical to English-trained ears, as for example in their designation of the French merchants as \\"wee-wees.\\" The girls and the scenery are fantastically beautiful, but there are also dangers, such as the Happars, the rival tribe who occasionally wage war against the relatively placid Typees. Of special note is a young warrior named Kory-Kory whose brotherly affection for Melville could very well have inspired the character of Queequeg in \\"Moby-Dick.\\"The implications of the story are fairly simple, if overromanticized: Civilized man confronts the noble savage, discovers they are skilled artisans and healers and primarily peaceful fruit-eaters who eat human flesh only when it is that of their vanquished enemies; and, upon astonished reflection, realizes the corruption and the hypocritical facades of his own technologically advanced society. What would now be called political correctness was in the 1840s merely a perspective by an observant world traveler with no ideological agenda to push. But, although the valley of the Typees may be a paradise, it's not Melville's paradise, which is why he endeavors to escape his gracious hosts. It's a good thing he eventually did, because he had better books waiting to be written."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"The earlier reviewers said much of what I wanted to say, and for the most part, said it better. I'll try not to repeat them. One of the fascinating things about this book is how Melville could go back and forth from describing the Typee people as the world's happiest, living the best lives, to his own perspective that to become one of them would nevertheless be a most horrible fate. Near the end of his sojourn with them, their tatoo artist-priest becomes increasingly insistent upon tatooing the lids of Melville's eyes, but it is not the imagined physical pain of this that terrifies Melville: it is the fear that he will lose all ties to Western Civilization, which, almost in the same breath, he so effectively criticises. As an American school teacher in rural East Africa, I often noticed this love-hate relationship to our own culture among my fellow volunteers. Like Melville, we almost all &quot;went native&quot; and tended to see the best in the Africans' lifestyle. Like him, we constantly contrasted it with Western Civilization, and found the primitive life the clear winner. And yet, like Melville, we nearly all came home. In my case, when I did, I found that, after two years, American faces looked ugly, overstressed and mean compared to the African faces I had been looking at. Yet I stayed home, and they gradually started to look better. I was initially depressed by the filth, the environmental degradation, the aimlessness of so many lives back here in the developed world. I suspect this might have been Melville's experience too, and part of what drove him back out to sea time and again. And yet, in the end, home is home, and we all come back. You should read this book. Much of it, at least, is fast paced, exciting, educational, and profoundly thought provoking. Despite its rough edges, it may have been Melville's most imortant work. I'll let you know after I finish his sequel: Omoo."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Yes, it was a fun read, and my rating reflects not whether Melville succeeded in what he was trying to do - rather, my rating is a reflection on my enjoyment level.The imagery is beautiful in this intensely pictorial novel. The scene where the narrator's Polynesian &quot;girlfriend&quot; acts as a sail during his canoeing jaunt in the lagoon is one of my favorite mental snapshots, not only from this novel, but from American Romantic literature as a whole.But, just when one is relaxing into the somnolent atmosphere, Melville gives us pages upon pages of breadfruit recipies as well as detailed descriptions on the manufacture of tappa. All very informative, and in keeping with Melville's intentions in writing this travel novel, but these passages turned me off a bit.His next novel, Omoo, is laugh aloud funny, and a superior adventure novel to Typee."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Melville was 22 in 1842 when he deserted a whaling ship inthe South Pacific and was captured by a tribe of Tahitianheadhunters. His first novel, &quot;Typee,&quot; was borne from theseexperiences. Although his tale of life among thesavages proved hugely popular as an adventurous yarn,the book is memorable for its anthrological observationsof primitive tribal life: the young girls preparingbreadfruit and frolicking in the crsytal blue seas,the lazy weathered warriors wearing their tattoo masks andlolling in huts. Some people banned the bookfrom libraries. Certainly they objected to naked islandgirls engaging in free love, but what really angeredgood churchgoing souls was the author's antagonisticattitude towards missionaries. The book is America's firstindictment of colonialism and its withering effecton native cultures. Observes Melville, &quot;The sympathy whichChristendom feels for them has, alas!, in too manyinstances proved their bane.&quot; The exuberance that runsthrough these pages will wane for Melville in his lateryears. None of his other great works will be as widelyread. He will be considered a failure, fall into debt,suffer ill health. His son will committ suicide beforehis eyes. No one will buy &quot;Moby Dick&quot;; the crisp,unopened copies of the first edition will lie in awarehouse until they are consumed by fire. Theauthor will lapse into depression, madness. He will,finally, stop writing altogether and live in obscurityand poverty until his death. No one expected his nameto be remembered."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"I just want to express my appreciation of a book that is joy incarnated. I join the ranks of the multitudes who will forever wonder how much of its account is true. It would be so nice to believe that it is wholly true. But however true or false, the book leaves one (or me, anyway) with, at the very least, the most pleasant of dreams. The young Melville is the captive guest of the natives of a tropical isle, where life is forever lazy and paradisic. There are so many scenes that are memorable for both the attractiveness of their content and the author's tolerant and amused way of narrating them. In addition, beneath the charm and the humor runs a thread of menace. What a delightful mix for the reader! This book is either for light reading or for profound reveries about human social possibilities. Above all: Enjoy it.Note: I found Melville's follow-up book, Omoo, to be a total bore and terribly written. Hard to believe it was the same author."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"This is a true classic and should be required reading at some point in one's life.Melville lived with alleged cannibals, but they harmed him not. The Marquesas shouldbe on the adventurer's modern bucket list."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Typee, Herman Melville's first novel published in 1846, rocketed him into the public eye. He in fact did spend four months with the Typee people prior to the corruption of their culture by European contact. Written like a memoir, it is hard to discern what is true and what is fiction. The protagonist jumps the whaling ship that brought him to the Marquesas with his young mate Toby. They find themselves captured by a tribe living in Eden like splendor in a valley hidden from time. They are treated as royals with handmaidens and servants and every need taken care of. But, they suspect they are being fattened like a calf for slaughter as these people are known to be cannibals. This account is considered to be the most accurate description of the exotic customs of the early Marquesans. I was drawn to the story because in my talks about early Hawaiians from the same root stock there have been questions about whether or not they were indeed cannibals. The Hawaiians accused of eating the great navigator Captain James Cook deny that cannibalism was a part of their culture even though human sacrifice was commonplace. In Melville's account, the people were cannibals, but only the chiefs and high priests ate human flesh and it was done in a secret ceremony hidden from the eyes of outsiders. He describes the common people as loving kind, playful, and never cross with one another. There was so money so no acquisition or hoarding. Working together in communal harmony they shared in the bounty of their water-rich valley. There were feuds with neighboring tribes, but internal harmony prevailed. Melville who went on to write Moby Dick and numerous other South Seas tales died in obscurity."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"There is little evidence while reading Typee that its author would in only five years produce a major work of world literature such as Moby-Dick. There is the common fact that both of them are seagoing narratives that present much factual information delivered primarily to assure the reader of their authenticity as well as the proof that their author really does know something of the subject matter of which he is writing. Beyond that, however, they bear completely different intentions.Accepted largely as a factual account, Typee does, in fact, rely heavily on fictional invention woven quite skillfully into an account that stems from Melville's own experience among the Typee, a race of cannibals he encounters after deserting a whaling ship ruled by a tyrannical captain ported at the Marquesan island of Nukuheva in the South Pacific. Among other inventions, Melville expanded the three weeks he spent with the tribe into four months, although the perspective and attitudes of the narrator are most certainly shared with Melville.And so this is really a novel/travelogue hybrid, or novel masquerading as a travelogue. It can be seen as an example of a particular type of story that has appeared in many guises in the more than 150 years since its original publication--the adventure of a Western white man who, through an extraordinary chain of events, becomes the captive of an alien and/or exotic race of people with strange and unique customs. Other examples range from numerous fantasies of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Dances With Wolves and Planet of the Apes.Due to an infection in his leg, Melville (or Tommo, as he is called in the book) is kept by the Typees while his fellow escapee Toby is allowed to leave to seek medical help. Melville maintains a thread of tension throughout much of the remainder of the narrative. Tommo had learned to fear and dread this horrible tribe of cannibals but, surprisingly, they are very kind and solicitous of him. He wonders if they are merely being kind to lull him into a sense of complacency before they convert him into a special feast. They are benevolent captors that grant him extreme liberty within the parameters of his captivity, including the waiver of one of their taboos in tolerating his activities with the beautiful maiden Fayaway. Young women are not allowed in boats but upon Tommo's insistence they allow her to join him in short rides. The paradisiacal aspects of this serene, largely quiet and slow-paced life become nightmarish whenever he contemplates the very real possibility that he may never be able to leave this idyllic culture and will live and die their captive. Although he acknowledges many virtues of their culture and comes to admire and respect many of them, he resists succumbing to their customs completely. One can certainly feel his horror as he evades a tattoo artist insistent upon marking up his face and his dread that the king may order that he become \`one of them.'Other reviewers have criticized Melville's excessive descriptive passages. Yes, he goes on ad infinitum and tells me more than I would probably care to know about how to make tappas or how wonderful the taste of bread-fruit is but that is a characteristic not only of the true life adventures that were popular when Melville started publishing but of nineteenth century fiction in general, virtually all of which was produced before the emergence of the new narrative medium of film. It is also a practice that evolved with Melville into the extensive passages on whaling in Moby-Dick.I am not sure I would have sought out this book if I did not know that this author would soon evolve into one of the great American novelists. However, I do have that knowledge and I know that this young writer already possesses a great narrative skill and a mastery of language, both of which will flourish even more fully in the next few years. This book is especially impressive coming from a young man who has not yet emerged from his twenties. Taken as an apprentice book from the author of Moby-Dick it is a noble accomplishment. Taken as a novel fairly successfully passed off as a true-life adventure I can admire its skill and artistry. It made such a large impression upon its contemporary audience that for many years afterward Herman Melville was referred to as \`the man who lived among cannibals.'"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is more of what Herman Melville does best. He offers an intellectually arresting argument about the nature of civilization while going into great detail about the every day life of a group of Polynesian natives in the Marquesas Islands.Typee was Herman Melville's most popular work during his lifetime. It is a partially autobiographical account of a man's time among a secluded tribe of Polynesian natives. \\"Tommo\\" escapes from a cruelly run whale ship and finds himself living among the Polynesian Typee tribe. The narrative is absolutely full of concrete detail about virtually every aspect of daily life among the Typees. Typee has everything from sensual descriptions of bare-chested exotic girls to treatises on island vegetation and edible fruit. The detail is stunning.Surrounded by all of this plentiful detail is an argument about the nature of \\"European\\" (and presumably American) civilization vs the untainted existence of the \\"noble savages\\" living in the Typee valley. Melville discusses these differences particularly in chapters 17, 26 and 27. Melville's discussion is earnest in its philosophical questioning and worth reading.Also of interest is Melville's criticism of Christian missionaries in the South Pacific. Although Melville writes in support of the aim of Christenizing Polynesia, he strongly criticizes the cruel methods of the missionaries.The Good: Part Castaway-style adventure story, part philosophical questioning of the nature of civilization and part anthropological text on the life of Polynesians, Typee has a lot to offer.The Bad: Many modern readers will dislike the amount of detail Melville goes into when describing things.The Bottom Line: Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is an easier book to get into than Moby Dick. It has a lot of concrete detail, but its themes are simpler. Though lesser known Typee is a must for any Melville fan."},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"This book describes the story of Tommo, who finds himself in a valley with the dangerous (rumored cannibal) tribe of the Typee. Through a series of animatedly depicted scenes, Tommo's interaction with the natives is recorded first hand. Melville spent 4 years traveling through several Polynesian Islands and this undoubtedly influenced this book.Expect to see the typical Melvillian depiction of Christianity as oppressive, the culture of the innocent natives praised, all wrapped in the most creative/inventive/genius of language that Melville so strongly commands. My onyl critique is that the middle section of the book is quite slow, and his repeated explanations of the goings on in the natives lives becomes rather cumbersome to read. The volatile and exciting ending is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","review":"Herman Melville tells a somewhat autobiographical tale in this story about time spent among cannibals in the South Seas. Somewhat autobiographical because there is a lot of fictional elements to this story.After ditching a ship run by a mad captain, our main character finds himself on an island with only one other person as they go through the jungle trying to survive on what little food they grabbed. When at last they find a tribe of the island, they are both wary and overjoyed. Because he has an injury, he is unable to leave with the friend and instead is left to the friendly hands of the natives, who really don't want him to leave anyway. So much so that they hold him as a very comfortable hostage. While recuperating from his injury he observes their life and how carefree it is and admires them as a people.While some elements of this book are autobiographical, I do have to say that Melville really isn't as interesting as the natives think he is. He is injured for the vast majority of the time so I'm surprised he held such a fascination to them. The natives were mostly fairly described and in fact compared favorably to his English brethren, which is a surprise considering the time it was written. I think the most derogatory thing that he wrote was that they seemed to like to be lazy, but would work when needed to. Compared to how he made fun of the English, its actually pretty interesting what he thinks of them.While Melville has a lyrical way of writing, I found this book to be very tedious. Yes there were beautiful descriptions of the island and its people that made it seem a very desirable place, but these were repeated over and over and over. I stopped caring about breadfruit around the fifth time it was described and some of the other repetitions grew old after the second go around. I just wish he had branched out a bit in his descriptions. I did find some of his adventures interesting but he describes these incidents far and few between.Definitely not one of the better books I've read in awhile. I know its a classic, but so much more could have been done with it.TypeeCopyright 1846260 pagesReview by M.

For those looking for a teaching volume that includes drama and fiction sections, consider Kennedy and Goia's \\"Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry and Drama.\\""},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry","review":"The second edition of this text was very good; the third edition is exceptional. the introductory essay on modernism in the first volume is worth the purchase of the book and the essays accompanying each poet are extremely valuable. the third edition has, in addition to the poetry, some seminal critical essays (such as t.s. eliot's \\"tradition and the individual talent\\"). i love this anthology and greedily devoured the whole 1000 page first volume this past month (july 2005) while on vacation. I am a third of the way through the second volume.a notable difference between the second and third editions is that the basic introduction to verse forms (meter etc.) has been ommitted from the third edition. i always liked this essay and wish that the editors had retained it as an appendix.lastly, robinson jeffers' poem \\"shiva\\" was dropped from the third edition, which i took as a bit of a loss."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry","review":"I have acquired many Norton Anthologies and poetry anthologies in my time as a student, and this is by far one of the best. Great information about each poet, good selection of poems, and some wonderful critical essays and other texts by poets are also included. A must have for anyone studying or interested in poetry."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry","review":"In the past I've read less expensive anthologies, but the quality of the selections and the excellent introductions (especially the poetics section at the back) make it well worth the extra money. To double your pleasure, read the first volume in conjunction with an excellent free on-line course at Yale.edu."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry","review":"I am a poet and I bought this for research and inspirational value. Its primary authors are also represented in the regular Norton Anthology of Poetry, but this is, as the name implies, a much more exhaustive representation of the past 150 years or so. It starts with Dickinson, Hardy, Whitman and Yeats, and moves on from there.Selections are ample for deciding whether I'd like to read more, and it's pretty much a who's who of poetic style. Since I am by no means an expert on literature, I can't question individual selection much, but to tell you the truth, I have the regular Norton 4th Ed., and it has within its covers a good representation of the so-called \\"Modern\\" and \\"Contemporary\\" poets by itself. Overall, you should have more than just a passing fancy of poetry to warrant the expense of this book. Poetry takes a long time to read and digest, I've found, and this one could easily last you a lifetime."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-59786e08"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/64.md","filePath":"library/64.md"}'),G={name:"library/64.md"},D=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{F as __pageData,D as default};
