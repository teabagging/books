I agree with most of them, that this was a fine book. Out of the five Kenzie/Gennaro books in the series, this is perhaps my favorite. It leans a little more into the thriller/suspense genre than it does the PI genre, but that is OK, because I know it is a series and not a stand-alone book.Some reviewers (a few) have panned this book as derivative and in one particular spot too much like 'Silence of the Lambs'. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I would just say that almost everything is derivative in some way, and Harris does not have a patent on prison visitations as a plotline.Dennis Lehane crafts some of the best sentences I have read in this genre, so you should read the entire Kenzie/Gennaro series starting with 'A Drink Before the War', and if you have already read it, then read 'Darkness, Take My Hand' NOW."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I found myself reading well after midnight, long after I should have turned the light out, but I found it difficult to leave Patrick and Angie and their incredibly dangerous situation. I tend to prefer cozies, stories which are lighter and not nearly as violent as this, but Lehane hooked me and I couldn't turn away. I've now read the first three in the series, and I will continue."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"When a book like Mystic River comes along and so thoroughly blows me away, I run to the author's backlist, hoping to find another masterpiece. While Darkness, Take My Hand is suspenseful, well plotted, and very entertaining, it's the work of a developing author, not the master that Lehane has since become. By all means, read it. Just know that it's an early work and Lehane not yet at the top of his game."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I just finished this book and let me tell you, if you are lover of thrilling books then this is the one for you. The story is well written and Lehane writes just as good as any other of his books. I just read Shutter Island so I decided to try this next and in my opinion this is much better. My only issue is that the Kindle does not have the first book to the series so i don't know how Kenzie and Angie became who they are. Now its time to read the next one in the series, Sacred."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In this the second book in his Kenzie-Gennaro detective series, Dennis Lehane begins to show his skills in earnest (surpassingA Drink Before the War). The complex plot is well-constructed and expertly revealed. The book opens with Kenzie reflecting on the events to follow and foreshadowing an ominous tale.Kenzie is called in by a young man's mother to investigate a threat against him by the Irish mob. Kenzie and Gennaro get a sit down meet with the mobsters through their own psycho friend Bubba that leads pretty much nowhere.Kenzie continues to poke around in Boston's underbelly and what he finds is anything but pretty. Dead bodies start to stack up that suggest a serial killer is on the loose - but another killer reaches out to Kenzie from prison. His interview with this inmate called to mind the Silence of the Lambs. Lehane creates a truly disturbed person who causes primal fear even though he's shackled and behind bars.Are the events separated by some two decades somehow related? And who's calling the tune? The writing is very good, the story is taut and a page-turner. If you are like me, you will soon develop a whodunit theory or two that turn out to be way off course, a sign of a good mystery. Lehane explores the psychology of the extremely violent and how they got that way, but be forewarned, the violence is extreme and not infrequent. Even the survivors are damaged perhaps irretrievably.With the caveat about the violence, this book is highly recommended. But really folks, Lehane is not kidding about the darkness. A conditional five stars."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is an incredibly engrossing story. Be warned though--the violence is horrific. The murder descriptions are VERY disturbing but I never felt they were gratuitous. This is a fascinating story of friendship and family but it also shows the violence that both the most-twisted among us and ordinary citizens are capable of. Sometimes they are one and the same."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I read this book for a book club not knowing anything about the author before. Then upon finishing realized he was the author of Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone. I absolutely love his writing style when I'm in the mood for an excellent murder mystery to lose myself in. Much better than James Patterson and I have been reading him for years..."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This book was so much better than his first book. Don't get me wrong, I really liked A Drink Before the War, but this one is so much better. THis is where Lehane really hits his stride as a writer. I guarantee that after you get 50 pages in, your nights of going to bed early (or doing anything during the day) will be over until you finish."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane's A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR was the book that pulled me into mystery fiction as a reader. I loved Kenzie and Gennaro's blue-collar personas, the snappy dialogue, the vivid imagery, the deep secondary characters, and the deft balance of humor. It amazed me that mystery fiction could be so deep and touching, and I immediately bought the next book in the series, DARKNESS, TAKE MY HAND.DRINK convinced me to read more mystery fiction, but DARKNESS convinced me that I wanted to write it for a living.This book has everything DRINK has and then some: Memorable and sympathetic characters, crisp dialogue, excellent visuals, humor, the mafia, a serial killer, and best of all, a story that reached back all the way into Kenzie's and Gennaro's childhoods and rounded out the proceedings with an epic feel. Not to mention the climactic final&eacute; that reverberated through each one of the remaining books in the series. The suspense is thick, the action is whiplash, and the emotion is real and poignant. It has literally become the template upon which I've crafted many of my story ideas.My only complaint is that, with the ending in view, I guessed who the killer was. That took a bit of punch out of it, but the story quickly jumped past that and launched into the phenomenal climax.Lehane would revisit some of the same themes from DARKNESS in his breakout novel, MYSTIC RIVER, themes which actually began in much more diluted form in DRINK. In my opinion, however, the success of MYSTIC started here with DARKNESS, showing that Lehane had the stuff to move his audiences and keep them in tension at the same time. He's since started moving away from the mystery format, which is a shame, because the world needs more quality epics like this one. Before you pick up MYSTIC RIVER, buy DARKNESS and see for yourself where it all began."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"The second book in the Patrick Kenzie series opens with Patrick taking inventory of the violence and destruction that has just re-shaped his life after the case in \\"Darkness\\" is closed. Lehane uses this foreshadow technique with confidence because he knows the story will live up to the emotional and physical devastation Patrick is feeling in the very first chapter.After the first chapter, the book takes you on a tense journey through a nightmare of undesirable characters immune to personal suffering. The mood is dark and the violence intense. As usual, Lehane keeps the tension tight by combining multiple plot lines; keeping the reader constantly on edge and wary of every corner turned and every character encountered.In \\"A Drink Before The War\\" Lehane introduced us to Patrick, Angie and Bubba, but in \\"Darkness\\" he breaths life into them. Amidst all of the human destruction that occurs during a case to stop a serial killer who brings his viciousness right into Patrick and Angie's life, Lehane fills out his main charters and makes them much more complex than in the first novel. Even Patrick's father becomes more dimensional and may even have had some redeemable traits (maybe).Some themes emerge in \\"Darkness\\" that Lehane explores deeper in \\"Mystic River\\", but most of the book is an in your face mystery that concentrates on the rage and violence that can be summoned in all of us, and the effects it has if unleashed."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness, Take My Hand by Dennis Lehane is one of the great unsung mystery novels of the late 20th century and should be on everyone's Best OF lists. The characters of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are great --in love, at war with one another, passionate and angry and real. The story of the shrink running from the Irish Mob BEGS to be a movie, and yet no one has ever taken a run at it. That is just a waste. I recently re-read this book and found that it reads just as great the second time around."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Fortunately, the gruesomeness is not overdone, but comes close. Lehane, however, is a master craftsman and keeps you guessing till the end. The plot unfolds in a timely fashion, the characters are highly credible and the reader only marvels at the creativity of the author. This is a gritty novel with a little leavening morality thrown in that helps put everything in perspective. One of the best thrillers I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Oooh yeah! The second masterpiece from Dennis Lehane is one of the best thriller I've read. It's REALLY dark, and it'll give you REAL chills... You'll follow Patrick and Angie inside the depths of human depravation... Lehane's style is sharp-perfect for this. I loved this book! Can't say more than: &quot;Read it!'"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is the third of Dennis Lehane's private eye books that I've read, and I continue to be blown away by the razor-sharp, uncompromising quality of his writing. I usually prefer the &quot;cozy&quot;, non-violent whodunits over the &quot;hard boiled&quot; genre that Lehane has chosen, but when a writer can describe scenes and characters as well as Lehane does, that overrides any personal preferences of that sort.The plot has been well-described by other reviews here on Amazon: Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro get involved with a case that begins with what seem to be only vague threats against a woman and her son, but which steadily escalates into a terrifying picture of violence, hatred, and revenge extending back in time for decades.Among many other things that Lehane does better than other writers is that he sets up a truly plausible relationship between his private eye hero Kenzie and the police. In most other private eye novels, the reader is always left wondering, &quot;Why doesn't the client go to the police? Why is Joe Shmoe having to solve this mystery on his own?&quot; But not with Lehane.The only thing NOT plausible about the plot of this novel is the extreme degree of hate and violence. And eventually I found the unrelieved viciousness a little bit hard to stomach. Regular readers of hard-boiled crime novels may not bat an eyelash at all this violence and gratuitous cruelty, but be forewarned: this book could keep you awake at night."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"one of the characters is so terrible. I don't understand the allure of Angie Gennaro. She is so perfect, apparently, that whenever she leaves the room - which seems to happen so often it might be a plot device - other characters simply have to gush to Kenzie about how great she is. She seems a little rude, self-centered, and co-dependent but who wouldn't be if one was so lucky to be absolutely perfect.Other than that the book is great. I think the types of mysteries that Lehane writes - dark, brooding, complex, and psychological - are my favorites. He doesn't explain to much - except about Angie's perfectness - and it feels like you're getting a glimpse into the criminal world that's far more fascinating than having everything neatly explained and packaged."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was my first DL. It was a good suspense story and the scene with the enforcer describing how he &quot;jumed on a man's back in order to break his spine&quot; still bothers me."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is the 2nd book in the Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro series and I'm happy to say I think it's better then the first one. This time a the client is a Boston psychiatrist running scared from the mob. During the investigation they find out a serial killer is involved and the case is specially focussed on Kenzie. It's a good book, they redirect scenes from: A drink before the war, so you really get into the series. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"While I thought the book was very well written, and I enjoyed it, it really was almost too dark for me."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane's first book, &quot;A Drink Before the War,&quot; astonished me. &quot;Darkness,&quot; the second in the series, was a letdown, and I would give it just 3.5 stars if that option were available.Don't get me wrong - I like violence, as long as I don't have to participate in it or watch it. But in this book, there was just too much. Towards the end I found myself wondering how Lehane could possibly surpass, in quantity and quality, all the gore that piled up throughout the book, and, when I finally got there, I felt the finale was more contrived than horrifying.Having said this, I did like the treatment of the father-son theme, which evolved from &quot;A Drink&quot; into something far more sinister in &quot;Darkness.&quot; And I think I know why I was disappointed by this book, not because it isn't as good as the first, but because an earlier reviewer of &quot;Darkness&quot; mentioned that in it Kenzie came to terms with his father, and thus himself. I did not see this. How anyone could come to terms with someone like the father who is revealed in this book is beyond me.I will certainly read on, and I am sure this series will continue to surprise and horrify me and give me pleasure. I have never tired of Spenser, but I did stop reading Stephanie Plum because after four books I just didn't care about her any more, and I got tired of the supporting cast. Lehane, please do not do this to us, because you are far too good a writer to let this happen."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Those are 3 perfect words to describe this novel. You're about to enter the world of Patrick Kenzie, Angie Genarro, and Bubba Rogowski, the trio created by Dennis Lehane. For me, this is far most, the best from all 5 books in this series. The story was absolutely intense. You can't put it down, you want to know what will happen, and when you get to the last pages, you'll be charmed, and the story stays with you. I recommend this book for all of you who hasn't known Dennis Lehane's works. Read it and be enchanted..."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If there were any justice in the world, Dennis Lehane's books would be monster sellers. Beautifully written sentences, a dead-on ear for dialogue, the shadings of emotions so wrenching a dead man could feel them . . . &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; is no exception. Patrick and Angie have already become beloved friends to me, and Lehane's eye for detail can genuinely creep me out. Lehane is also one of the very few mystery writers who doesn't telegraph who the ultimate culprit is. Definitely not for the light mystery reader, but Lehane ranks up there with Parker and Paretsky. Great, great stuff!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Loved this book !! I had read Lehane's first book and enjoyed it, but everyone told me this one was even better. And they were right. Patrick Kenzie an Angie Gennaro are great characters, and Lehane does a good job of developing them above and beyond where they were in &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot;. The villains in this book are great too, with a terrific &quot;scare&quot; factor. At one point Patrick meets with the serial killer, and it seemed like a meeting of two of my favorite mystery/thriller characters: John Corey (Plum Island, Nelson DeMille) and Hannibal Lector. Not that they're copies, just similar people. The gore factor in the book is pretty high, too. Not enough to turn you off, but raw enough to really set a scene for a terrifying conclusion."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I wanted to like this series, but I almost stopped after the first. I'm definitely stopping after the second. Lehane can write, no doubt about it, but DARKNESS seemed more about gratuitous gore than suspense and mystery.Moreover, I find the \\"banter\\" between Patrick and Angie to be incredibly juvenile, trite, and unrealistic, ditto their \\"relationship.\\" It's absurd that so many other characters seem to care so deeply about whether the two of them are sleeping together or in love with each other or not. This is obviously contrived so that readers will keep reading the series and wondering whether they'll ever really become a couple. I couldn't care less if they become a couple, frankly. Angie is the stereotypical tough-yet-vulnerable dame, and Patrick's \\"issues\\" with his father (and the fact that everyone seems so bent on getting him to talk about these issues) are getting tiresome. It's hard to keep reading a series when the characters are so flat and unlikeable, and unfortunately Lehane's plot twists and strong sense of place don't make up for this."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Guess I'm a wimp, but I couldn't get past the sadism and gore to really appreciate what a well-done book this probably is. When I was little, I used to cover my eyes or ears in a really scary movie; reading parts of this, I just quickly skimmed to get through the horror and back to the story. So, I won't complain about that; it's just not my thing.I've been reading this series out of order, which I sometimes do with other series. It doesn't really work with Lehane, though. I wish he would leave out or obscure some of the specifics about the cases from prior books; the first time the perp appeared in Darkness, I immediately remembered who he was since he was discussed in the next one several times by name. Probably Lehane could have made his later points without spoiling another book. Sherlock Holmes and Watson were forever referring to past cases, which you never seem to have heard of. Lehane could take a lesson here?Plenty of other reviews discuss everything I thought about this book. Just wanted to add my warning that, as said by others, it's not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching Mystic River, the film based on another LeHane novel. Darkness, Take My Hand did not disappoint. Different characters, same setting, and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil. LeHane's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing, a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre. LeHane's descriptions jump right off the page at you. His characters are so human, so intense, their dialogue so sharp, that it's almost like watching a movie in your mind. There isn't a wasted word in this book. The suspense starts to build on page 1, and never lets up, becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter. This is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you're NOT alone in the night.LeHane's other works top my summer reading list. I'd love to see what he could do in a different genre."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane is unmatched as a writer of local color, and he is a master mimic of mannerisms and speech patterns.I'm a Boston boy myself (Center Street in Roxbury)--lived there for a few years when I was a kid. From my side of the tracks, the black side, I did not see too much of Dorchester growing up. The people who lived there were the &quot;other.&quot; Once upon a time, my mother, who did house work back then, became employed by a family in Dorchester. They were nice people, owned a big German shepherd, had a backyard with a swing set in it, gave nice gifts to me and my little brother at Christmas. For years, I used to wish we lived in Dorchester. Little did I know. One thing that Lehane is good at in the Kenzie/Gennaro series is exposing the other side of the &quot;other.&quot; They are normal working stiffs just like the rest of us. Sometimes they are less than normal.I like this second book better than the first one (A DRINK . . .) for number of reasons. First, Angie is free of her abusive hubby. I wasn't sure where that was going in the first place. Second, the Irish mob is very scary. Third, Bubba. And finally, the serial killer (whose identity I shall not reveal to you who haven't read the book)--the killer is, for want of a better word, &quot;likable.&quot; If my own child had died tragically, I am sure I would not go around killing people, but I do see where he's coming from. The loss scarred him, transformed him, but left his basic personality intact. So he goes about his day, doing his job, being everybody's friend, and his dark tendencies go unnoticed.Now I have to run out and get a copy of Mystic River.Good job, Dennis. Your work is both entertainment and inspiration to all of us from the program. You are the master. Lead on."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"&quot;Darkness...&quot; is one of those books that drags you in and doesnt let go. Without giving the plot away theres a scene where Patrick is driving to his girlfrends in a hurry that had my knuckles white and my teeth gritted. All of Lehanes books are good but this is a masterpiece - if you havent already read it buy it now and let darkness take you by the hand."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Man this guy can write! I have read 3 of Lehane's novels and they are all brillant. I have to agree with other people's comments..the conbination of Kenzie/Gennaro is wonderful. Lehane really brings to characters to life and you really feel like you are in the story with them. I don't think I have read anything by an author that can actually bring me into the action, like he does. The book is filled with great one-liners and has a great storyline to boot!I didn't think that this book (or any of the rest) are too violent, but if you are a fan of crime fiction, then what do you expect?A truly sensational book, I highly recommend it if you are looking for a freal page-turner, filled with suspense, comedy and old-fashioned who-done-it?The only problem with Lehane, he doesn't publish books quick enough!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane is easily one of the best things to happen to mystery and detective fiction in the past couple of years. After his amazing first novel, _A Drink Before the War_, _Darkness, Take My Hand_ only serves to solidify his ascendancy to the upper ranks of active detective novelists.This is a great book, a convincing exploration of how &quot;the sins of the fathers&quot; are visited upon the sons (and daughters). Throw in a serial killer or two (or three), a dangerous neighborhood watch group, and some of the most atmospheric descriptions of setting I've read, and this novel is a must-read, even if you're a bit squeamish (and heaven knows, there's much to be squeamish about in this book). Lehane does a marvelous job of showing the lingering effects of violence and how they affect (and infect) succeeding generations. Right now, he's near the top of my &quot;must-read&quot; list, with such writers as Les Roberts and James Lee Burke."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"The primary purpose of my review is to echo the review provided by C-C-Peterson. I, too, started with the first novel in this series, and found the violence in that novel to be excessive, but appropriate to the overall plot. However, the gore, sadism, and the time spent being dragged through the muck of human evil in this second novel left me repulsed and gloomy. The killers in this novel are evil personified, and if the author is to be credited with anything, it is that he accurately portrays what might happen to those who survive such an encounter. I felt a little like that myself when I finished the book. I read noir for entertainment, but I think I stumbled into something darker than noir. I finished the book to be sure they got the bad guys and that they would all die; I think I stayed engaged for much the same reason people stare at an accident on the highway."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Couldn't wait for this dreck to be over. One of the most contrived, implausible plots ever devised with dull dialogue, unbelievable characters and a story that defies logic. I figured I would give Lehane a second try after the mediocre Gone Baby Gone, having read all the five-star ratings for Darkness. Let me the first to rate this one star. What book were you reading? Don Winslow and James Ellroy can write rings around this guy. The Gennaro-Kenzie combo make for a laughable pair of bumbling detectives that somehow always manage to outwit any villain by having impeccable timing when it comes to getting guns drawn or otherwise outsmarting the bad guys. They're so smart that Angie can't even find a pen and pad in her apartment to take down notes. It takes her two minutes and two pages before she's able to find the implements, a simple matter or organization that any PI would have. They get drunk on the job, toss bon mots around in the middle of every crises and try to out-cool each other at every turn. In between there's lots of sexual innuendo and graphic descriptions of gory murders and tortures, all gratutitously served up to titillate.In what passes for a story, a serial killer or two -- or is it three? -- who knows? By the end of the novel there are about a dozen suspects and finally the ultimate bad guys turn out to have killed 34 people while nobody had a clue after 20 years despite obvious signs of his derangement dropped throughout the book. But Lehane tries lamely to send the reader off-track by creating a number of red herrings, back stories, mac guffins and other worn out plot devices when we all know what's coming: The Inevitable Showdown between Our Heroes and the Ultimate Villain. Oh, happy ending. Hollywood awaits. What dross!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This book was ruined a little bit for me because I figured out who did it very early on. I thought, \\"How on earth could I possibly know already!?\\" Then I realized... Patrick himself told me when I'd read Gone Baby Gone weeks earlier. I still read it and I enjoyed it very much, but it would have been nice to not know. I really wish Lehane would continue this series. It doesn't look likely, does it? But buy all 5, and read them in order. Excellent series with great character development."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I don't really know where Lehane got his reputation as a great author. I thought the characters were two dimensional, the mystery not very mysterious, and the scary parts not very scary."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane delivers again another book filled with thrills, chills, great characters, great dialogue and non-stop action. To really appreciate Lehane's books, read them in sequence. You'll love the main characters--Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. And wait to you get to know Bubba! You'll never want to even think about looking at him the wrong way. It would likely be your last thought!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is not Lehane writing in the intellectual, psychological vein of \\"Mystic River,\\" which I found brilliant. This is one of his Kenzie/Gennaro mysteries. They're darker (if you can believe it), pulpier, extremely violent, but highly readable page-turners. I have to admit that, for me, all the killing (psychotic torture, in this one) became more than a bit wearing, and ultimately produced an \\"oh,come on -- enough already\\" attitude on my part. I guess serial killers really do exist, but the plot of \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" ended up being just a bit too ridiculously unbelievable. And I'm beginning to sour on Pat and Angela, whose ethics are, at best, questionable. (Are all cops and PIs in Boston truly this cavalier about justice and the worth of human life -- even the bad guys' lives? And if their good pal and psycho bodyguard Bubba is comic relief, I guess I have no sense of humor.) Lastly, the main villain's identity was pretty clear from mid-book. All-in-all, in \\"Darkness\\" Lehane seems to be trying to muscle in on Hannibal Lecter territory, with limited success. It's a good disposable read, but one that's highly flawed."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Well it seems like my last review was not published for whatever reason so I'll try again.I found this book a BIG disappointment after Shutter Island and Mystic River. It seems like DL set out to write a Thomas Harris style thriller without realising that one of the strengths of say SOTL is the contrast between the cool dedicated professionalism of the crime fighters contrasted to the erratic violence of the psychopath. When you make your 'good guys' just as violent and uncontrolled as the bad guys you are kind of missing the point. DL should have also bourne in mind that it's a mistake to make your hero and heroine wise-cracking detectives ifa) you can't write any wise-cracking dialogue for them;b) they are so slow that the reader is usually several pages ahead of them - so why are they detectives at all?Characters like Bubba and the various gangsters introduced belong in a comic rather than a serious novel and by overloading us with evil killers the few truly menacing moments lose the impact they should have had. Also surely I'm not the only one sick to death of the man/woman detective team with the 'will they won't they' relationship (Mulder and Scully were bad enough).However the book DOES show talent and certainly remains engrossing right to the end (though if I had known what the ending was like I probably wouldn't have bothered). I really hope he has left this sort of immature parody in the past and goes on to write more books like Shutter Island."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Once again,in Darkness, Take My Hand, PI's Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro agree to take up a case. This time they really earn there money, in what is a very dark, chilling and page-turning second novel. After first agreeing to try and protect the son of a promient psychiatrist, they soon find themselves immersed in a web of horrific executions. The dialague, especially between Patrick Kenzie and the FBI agents assigned to the case, is taught, lean and adds to the suspense which for me, made this book hard to put down."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This book was awesome. It's the first one that I read in the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro series and of course I have to read them all! Dennis Lehane makes the characters interesting and he really knows how to write a story that keeps your attention. With all the twists and turns as it unravels you have keep reading and find out who is behind all of the killings and why. He'll surely be getting added to my list of favorite authors. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great mystery/suspense read."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Summarizing the plot premise makes it sound like just another private eye serial killer thriller. A string of gruesome murders by a killer who taunts his victims with threats. The murders are somehow linked to events of twenty years previously and to the family of Patrick Kenzie, the detective. Very strong subplots about Kenzie's affair with Angie ( his partner, ex-wife's sister and ex-wife of his ex-best friend) and about his relationships with Boston policemen and firemen. In spite of the cliche elements and echoes of Thomas Harris (mutilation, a cunning sociopathic prisoner) it is set apart by the high literary quality of the writing.As in &quot;A Drink Before Dying&quot; the downside is the dark and gloomy atmosphere. There is some bitter humor and sharp satirical social observation but the overall effect is depressing (I suppose you could say the same about Hamlet).On the credibility/ plausibility side, I keep wondering why Kenzie stays in Dorchester if he finds it such a terrible place. Phil half explains why Angie never leaves but Kenzie is a single 35 year old making $48000 a year and never seems to enjoy much of Boston."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;A Drink Before The War&quot; and I had heard that Lehane gets better with each book. Wow, was that ever right. This book is so good it gives you chills. Sure that's an overused cliche, but it couldn't be more true. Ever once in a while you see a great movie like &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, or &quot;Memento&quot; and it draws you in and keeps you thinking about it way after. This book has that same characteristic. When I tried to put the book down, I found myself thinking about it so much that I had to pick it right back up and ignore the chores I should be doing. Lehane has an incredible knack for drawing you in and creating great characters. An integral part of the story are the gruesome serial killings that surround the neighborhood that Kenzie and Gennaro grew up in, but there is much more than that. The characters, the dialogue, and unpredictable twists keep you asking for more. Prior to this book I had tired of serial killer stories and the formula storytelling surrounding them. Don't be deterred by that here. This book is not the same old, same old. I can't recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"The second book in the Kenzie/Gennero (don'tcha just love those last names?) appears to be, in my opinion, one of the best in the series.It explores more of Patrick's past, and as well as his neighborhood's. It also explores, in great (and almost disturbing) depth, the phyche of a madman and his motives.Great book. I pretty much now try to base all my thriller writings on the workings of this book. Good job, Dennis.-Jack"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Throw on your trenchcoat, suspend your disbelief and go along for a thrilling ride through a world of untold evil and unexpected redemption, courtesy of Dennis Lehane and his terminally romantically thwarted duo of private eyes, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. Boston is plagued by yet another series of brutal serial killings, but the modus operendi this time is crucifixion, not strangulation, and the victims seem random. But are they? When Angie and Patrick find themselves investigating a threat against the son of an old client, they find that there may be more commonality lurking among the fiend's victims than meets the private eye.The tale unfolds through a series of horrific events, the ruminations and reminiscences of scores of unforgettable characters, and a jailhouse interview with the face of evil itself. The book is peppered with hard boiled detective speak straight out of Elmore Leonard, updated with references to &quot;N'Sync&quot; and Bill Clinton. The language is one of the many fun parts of the read, but it's the characters, and the age-old unfolding struggle between good and evil within each of them, that really give it merit.A couple of drawbacks: the book is like a maze. It takes the concentration of Bobby Fischer, or at least a very elaborate flow chart, to keep all the characters and their histories and interrelationships straight. A lot of the violence and grotesquerie is gratuitous and a little insulting to the intelligence of the reader, as if he needs every salacious detail of disembowlment and dismemberment to keep him awake enough to wade through the plot's complexity. Nonetheless, don't take it too seriously, don't struggle overmuch with the minutiae, and the unique honesty of Lehane's prose, even while shamelessly derivative, will get under your skin."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"&quot;Darkness Take My Hand&quot; is the second of the Kenzie/Gennaro series. The first novel (A Drink before the War) rated 5 stars from me, and this novel receives the same. In it, you'll find the same descriptive writing style, the complex characters, the suspense and drama, and all of this held together with ongoing moral examination and situational ethics which are disturbing and challenging. The emerging pattern in Lehane's novel is an examination of psychotic, obsessive evil and perversion set in a microcosm called 'Boston'.This is emerging as a wonderful series, one that deserves the attention of serious mystery/thriller fiction readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane shows that you can have more than 1 hit in a series. Theis book was amazing it put togather old friends and new enemys unlike moast thriller novels it was not predictable and the outcome will suprise you. You'll find out things about the characters you didn't know in the previous one. Once you start you can't put it down."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Well this is certainly Lehane's most violent and gorey book with much to much detail in torture. That said, i found this book really well written and scary and funny at the same time, Patrick Kenzies One Liners, be it said aloud or only in his head keep a certain level of humor to the book. I Recomend that anyone who is willing to read this book, read it first because if you read the other Lehane books before this one, you will already know the outcome to this book and it will be slightly less fun or less of a mystery."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I first became introduced to Dennis Lehane in his novel titled Gone Baby Gone. After that, as they say, it was history.I love this man's writing, and I cannot get enough, I highly recommend reading all of his books. This was a dark, wonderful, realistic read. Run, don't walk, to get this book!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"\\"Darkness take my hand\\" by Dennis Lehane is a very violent, dark, graphic novel and is definitely not for those who have weak stomachs. If you love well written, violent novels that also stay with you years after you have finished reading the book (like this one has for me) this is a no brainer. One thing I loved about this book is how it shows that even the heroes can be scared, harmed, and scarred psychologically. I don't want to give anything away for those of you who are debating whether to read/purchase this book.TRUST ME, this book will not disappoint anyone who likes movies or books alongs the lines of \\"Se7en\\" with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. I would love for this to be turned into a movie but ONLY if can remain faithful to the book. Don't read it alone at night, it may give you the shivers!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is another great early Lehane book. His ability to build characters, create tension, and propel an interesting story make this a good novel that foreshadows the great novels (\\"Gone Baby, Gone\\" and \\"Shutter Island\\") to come."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is edge-of-your-seat stuff, folks; Darkness, Take My Hand left me feeling as drained and weary as the main characters must have felt at the end of their ordeal. There is no slow part to this book. It's all action, and just when you think that Patrick or Angie is safe, just when you think that they've maybe bought themselves a moment's respite, BAM! Everything's gone further to hell.Lehane's writing style is crisp, snappy, and well-paced, which serves to make an already good plot even richer and more exciting to the reader. I think that one of the reasons I truly appreciate Lehane's style of prose is because he writes how someone (such as myself) might think: not too profound, not too simple. This is especially useful as the main POV is in first person present, and so it provides a very realistic narrative that draws the reader in and keeps them focused on the task at hand. Lehane isn't heavy-handed with his descriptions, either, and yet manages to come up with on-the-nose and almost poetic ways to portray scenes without coming across as verbose or pretentious.The main characters aren't the bad guys, of course. But they tread that very fine line in their quest to find the true villains. Once or twice they teeter dangerously close to the edge, close enough to peek over and see the darkness that lies on the other side of that line, and maybe even allow it to seep into their hearts for a time. Lehane expertly crafts two protagonists both complex and imperfect, so grittily real that the book feels less like a work of fiction and more of a docudrama, drawing parallels to such television series as The Wire, and equally as harrowing in its scope.If the protagonists are compelling, then the antagonists are absolutely bone-chilling. Cold-blooded, no conscience, born to reave and rape, to raze the Boston suburbs to the ground in the bloodiest way possible. I've never been a fan of violence in books, probably because I see enough of it on the news every day, but I understand that in this case, the violence Lehane describes his villains commit is an important contrast against the doings of his protagonists. And what turns this book into a pseudo-horror book, at least for me, is how very human all these killings and acts of violence are. It makes you take a good, hard look at society today and at all the sickos that are out there, preying on the innocent every minute of every day.It's disturbing, and to capture that so well in text signifies excellent writing.Exciting from the first, Darkness, Take My Hand keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing until the close of the book. You're taken on the same nerve-racking journey as the main characters, and by the conclusion there's no doubt that Lehane is one of the definitive writers of the neo-noir genre."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I love the Gennaro/Kenzie novels. And this one is the best IMO. No mistake: the others are not far behind, but this one has it all. It has clowns!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I give this book three stars because the writing style is above average, although the plot is a little faulty. In the end, a well-written book will always matter more than the strength of its plot, in my opinion. Lehane does a good job with a modern hard-boiled, detective noir story, although not quite as good as Philip Kerr."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is the first Dennis Lehane book I finished and it's not going to be the last. He is my new favorite author. His style keeps you captivated and he makes it very very hard to put it down. I was excited to get to the end then wanted more once I did. I have read two more of his books since reading this one. His character development is real and natural, and you get to know them as if they were friends and someone you have known for years. This book is dark, but dark is wonderful when done by Dennis Lehane. He takes the mystery thriller and refreshes it; he has reinvented the detective story and I am so glad I have discovered his books.-Dean Kitching, author, What He'll is This Place."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"After giving such high praise to my first Lehane - A Drink Before the War - it was going to be tough to not be disappointed by the sequel. And, sadly, I did find this disappointing. Sometimes this doesn't necessarily mean the book is any less than the predecessor, but is more about higher expectations, and that some of the techniques are no longer going to be novel. However in this case I'm sure that if I had have read the two books in the opposite order I still wouldn't have liked \`Darkness' nearly as much. I still would have liked much of the mood, the writing and the characters - but all would have been undermined by the framework Lehane chose.It doesn't have to be a bad thing to choose a genre fiction staple (in this case the crime classic of the serial killer hunting the detective), and one of the real pleasures of \`A Drink Before the War' was the obvious familiarity and affection Lehane had for several conventions, deftly building to the high noon climax. However there was just too much stupidity to let me relax into this self-conscious version. I mean, hey, Lehane is very good, and much of the background was robust, along with the characters along the way. But give me a break (spoilers) with smart guy Kenzie doing some typically stupid things to undermine the climax. And Lehane in some ways is doubly at fault, because he deliberately highlights how he's not going to fall into the silly tropes of, say, a Starsky and Hutch episode, where a perfect girl simply appears as the love of Starsky (or Hutch's - doesn't matter) life, gets (of course) killed, sets up the revenge plot, has a couple of poignant seconds graveside at the end of the episode ... then is never thought of again in future episodes. Lehane does satisfyingly redress some of this stuff he obviously finds annoying by having *his* lead characters (a little too constantly foregrounded) bearing the scars of past trauma. But for all this, Grace (and her handbag daughter) are, in the end, as uncomfortably perfect (job, nature, bedroom, everything) and temporary as any TV stereotype. Was he consciously playing with this? If so, I didn't really get it.Another part of the problem is the serial killer frame. It's hard to give sinew when your main plot device is like the Joker in Batman (I hate that in the Heath Ledger incarnation he just nothing short of magically can teleport bombs entirely throughout ships and hospitals). It's just too easy for a couple of individuals to fool all the resources of the FBI (\\"Oh, we didn't think to check the phone line\\"; \\"What! They were using a modem!?\\"). And just what is the deal when on a hunch (at very least) dozens of officers can be mobilised to lock down an entire island (reminds me of that Goon show line, \\"Quick! Surround Africa!\\"), but a SINGLE ROOKIE cop is detailed to sit in a patrol car in uniform outside the house containing the two targets that the focus of a massive decades long manhunt has declared he will be attacking immanently. And this is even meant to be seen as a deliberate trap. \\"Damn, the baddie was HIDING IN THE GARDEN. Sheesh, we NEVER thought to check there!\\" That one had me groaning and rolling my eyes. Oh, and of course the rookie is the promising, perfect, nephew of one of the major characters - he had \`Dead Meat' scrawled in huge neon letters across his forehead - and I can get that anywhere: I don't want it in Lehane.Also I'm not up for it when the revelation of the master criminal as someone we've already met DOESN'T make us go, \\"Ah, yeah, that makes a few other things all come together. That makes sense.\\" Ideally you reassess previous information in light of this and it all falls together. But that's not how it works in 'Darkness' - the villain still could have been anybody else - we don't reassess anything. And even though Lehane had a go at justifying it, it really didn't wash with me that Kenzie and Phil would be alone with the serial killer at the end. Makes for a nice tense scene, but the moment Kenzie had tagged the killer the only reason he wouldn't even reveal his suspicions to the FBI is more to do with the way \`pesky kids' don't get help from a grown up. Someone as street smart as Kenzie aware of how dangerous \`G' is has nothing to gain by keeping this information to himself. This is even more the case when, bizarrely, five seconds later the cops go, \\"Oh, hey, we found a fingerprint. THIS is our guy.\\" Seriously, that single line is thrown away, but plotwise it's *the* most crucial thing in the entire FBI investigation. And it makes all the torture shenanigans and angst of the previous few chapters meaningless (maybe Lehane was deliberately using this as irony, but even so it didn't work for me given the nature of this book). It doesn't fit with anything that's gone before: if near god-like uber-baddie was clumsy enough to leave a print there, he would have left one somewhere earlier. It's just too excruciatingly coincidental that if they had have found it even 15 minutes earlier the entire climax would have been diverted. Or if Kenzie had have had a fraction of a brain and stayed away while calling in the cavalry.Lehane is still better than a lot of others. There were some effective scenes, dialogue and characters, and his lead is not the automaton of many a novel. But for me this book had much stronger weaknesses than strengths."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"So far I finished reading two books from Dennis, a drink before war and this one. They both are fantastic read. The ending is sad, but makes it real. Very powerful book, it made me curious at the beginning, and got me scare at the second half of the book, and I cried a little at the end of the book. I also felt a little bit depressed after finished reading this book, because of the sad ending.I have to take a break before I am reading the next one, scared. Not because I got scared, it's because I got depressed after reading this book, I shall say reading the ending. So I decided to read something different, I am reading the David Copperfield now. I need something to get my mind of this book, poor Phil, sorry for Angie and Pat. Crazy book, it's that good.I gave Dennis Five Stars for this book."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I've just finished reading this thrilling and amazing book by Lehane and for do that I kept reading until 4 am because I simply couldn't stop.I had read the first of the Kenzie/Gennaro serie (A Drink Before the War) but is a level higher. The plot is so well written that you never get a meaningless detail, not you read a needless dialogue. On the contrary everything is set up to be told in the precise moment you need to be told of that. Besides, since the story draws a connection between the present days Dorchester and the one of Kenzie/Gennaro childhood, in this novel we come to know them far better than in the first novel giving a more intimate, yet not less misty contest.It is really worth reading!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"The unknown murderers creeped me out. Plus, I loved the way Kenzie and Genaro's relationship evolved throughout the story. Although it would be best to read the previous novel, \\"A Drink Before the War\\", to understand some of the backstories."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I like gritty, murder mysteries and this is a good one. Lehane whips-up a real, grim bunch of dudes for this one. I really liked the author's attention to detail. If I have any criticism is that his psychotic-serial killer was a tad to Hannibal Lector-esque and the story was a bit over-plotted."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This book was certainly entertaining and a real page-turner, yet I was disappointed in many ways. It had the fine characterizations, compelling plot, and moral focus as Lehane's other books, yet I thought that it too often became a standard serial killer thriller. One of the things I love about Lehane, is that I usually cannot predict what will happen, but here too many plot points seemed straight out of 100 different serial killer movies. Nonetheless, predictability and all, this was a highly entertaining book which I found difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I was very impressed with Lehane's first book, A Drink Before the War, and was very excited to try his next book, Darkness Take My Hand. His stories just keep getting better and more enthralling. I love the two main characters and the way they interact- they're a great team. And boy is this plot enthralling. The serial killer story is really scary though- I found this book really hard to put down! I reccommend it to any mystery and suspense lovers!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Set in Boston, this story begins with an investigation by our twin heroes, private criminal investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, into a seemingly innocuous case. A client's son is being observed and photographed as he goes about his day to day life at college. Unknown to his mother, the son senses that he is being stalked. A photograph of him arrives anonymously in his mother's mail one day and she brings in Patrick and Angie to investigate. They make initial inquiries with their underworld contacts who also happen to be their prime suspects. It soon becomes clear that they are not involved. Time passes, nothing happens and it appears that there is really no threat to the young man and the investigation is suspended. As the saying goes...\\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...\\" he is found gruesomely murdered.The trail is cold at first but as new murders occur, a pattern evolves, and a possible link is established to other murders committed over twenty years previously. Struggling to convince themselves that they are making any real headway with their investigations, Patrick and Angie find themselves targeted by evil forces and their lives are clearly in great danger. The tension builds as they fight fear of the unknown by the unknown and the very real threat to their wellbeing.A little bit of relief is provided for the reader with the side stories of Patrick's relationship with his lover, Grace, and Angie's with her ex-husband. This is a well written, horrific and suspense filled thriller, even though some of the horrors do just stretch the imagination. The writing style, in which the main characters go off into trains of thought in between actual dialogue, takes some getting used to. When reading the spoken words of the various shady and criminal characters in the book it helps to imagine them talking in the guttural hoarse style of the Godfather. If you don't like gruesome murder and violence this book is not for you. If however you enjoy a scary, tension filled ride, jump aboard and enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I have to agree with Berkeleyroad from Boston on this but after having Lehane recommended to me and looking forward to the book I found the plot and the writing style ludicrously weak. How can other reviewers regard it as &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot;, how can anyone &quot;love&quot; the character of Bubba which represents all that is meaningless and parasitic in society. Kenzie and Gennaro are totally unbelieveable - they wouldn't last a minute on the mean streets and isn't it just too convenient that they are bosom pals with the police, the neighbourhood thugs and rival mafia gangs, plus they can get insider knowledge from the authorities and other experts. And what fantastic memories they have of details from their remote childhood. The book avoids any serious moral questions - even the bed hopping antics of Kenzie from his beloved Grace to childhood sweetheart Angie is not considered - they are shallow, one dimensional people. The prison scenes are stolen from Silence of the Lambs and there is a lot of pseudo psychological mumbo jumbo throughout. Isn't it amazing how ruthlessly cold blooded and efficient crazed psycho murderers still haven't learned not to try and explain themselves for half an hour while they have their chosen victims at gunpoint ? What made the story even weaker was that Lehane doesn't describe any of the murders being perpetrated or get inside the head of the killers, and we lose much of the menace and horror of seeing victims as real people - in fact he seems more sympathetic in dealing with the murderers. Lehane should learn how to write realistic dialogue - less wise cracking (especially at the most innapropriate moments) and how about some real &quot;detection&quot;. I would urge those who found this &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;challenging&quot; to head back to the shop to get some Chandler or Ellroy, or if you just want better detective pulp fiction try Michael Connelly or Robert Crais. This stuff is candy floss - written for a low attention span audience and presumably with film rights in mind."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caear\\", Antony utters, \\"The evil men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones\\". Nowhere is this more applicable than to Dennis Lehane's \\"Darkness, Take My Hand.\\" In this second 'Patrick and Angie' novel, the evils visited upon the population of Boston in the 1990s had their seeds planted two decades earlier. Those seeds were planted with good intentions, withered, and became evil.For some mystery writers, characters are haunted by their pasts. In Lehane's world, they are hunted by their pasts. That explains a lot about the characters who recur in this series. In \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" it explains Patrick's relationship with his father and Angie's stormy marriage, among other things. These explanations are explored deeply, more deeply than most mystery writers care to examine. Some other issues in the book didn't need so much investigating, and I think that was where the book occasionally bogged down. I wouldn't normally complain about this, but the novel was moving at such a smooth clip, I was jarred a little when Lehane tapped the brakes. Maybe it was intentional, but this was my reaction.Dennis Lehane has a fascination with the dark corners of our lives, and he knows how to write about them. After reading \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" you want to grab Lehane by the shoulders and say, \\"Lighten up!\\" Then again, no. If he did lighten up, we wouldn't get the great writing he offers us."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness, Take My Hand has a few poetic descriptions early in the book that are reminiscent of Fitzgerald (i.e. the school children), and a few passages of dialogue that suggest the author's intelligence--the bit on Iago for example. But in the end all this book is trash with a touch of class. Many of the worst cliches of the thriller genre are presented here without apology: the over-the-top violence, the criminial mastermind massmurderer who kills for fun (no less than 34 victims!), the now-you-see-me-now-you-don't love interests, the impossibly convoluted plot, the descriptions of violent actions that make no realistic sense, especially in the final one-hundred pages, the thuggish sidekick (Bubba) who mangles people at the detective's behest, the ultra hip references to postmodern ennui, the melodramatic villains of pure evil, the loading of the dice for interludes of Sentimentality and sympathy (so guys who are reading it for the sensationalism can feel good about themselves), and so forth. In sum, this is a fantasy violence trip for jaded yuppies, giving them a tingle in their armchairs, any relationship between the grisly happenings in this book and the real mayhem on our mean streets is merely accidental."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane is one of my top picks as a writer and this book does not disappoint. I gave it four stars because it doesn't quite rise to the stellar level of &#34;Mystic River&#34; but, to be fair, few books do."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"My husband's just read number four in Dennis LeHane's Kenzie and Gennaro series; he insisted it was time I caught up with him. I'd only read the first book so far--A Drink before Dying--so I picked up Darkness take my hand, number two, and admired the author's choice of titles before starting to read. After starting to read I admired his wordcraft too; evocative descriptions of streets and scenes; convincing depictions of deep characters--no cardboard cutouts here; cleverly revealed backstories with picture-perfect timing; internal dialog that pulls the reader in to search each scene for answers as desperately as the character himself; and convincing conversations you can almost hear.Is Boston really such a dangerous place? I don't know; I've never been there. But the streets Dennis LeHane creates seem as real as any I've know; the characters walk off the page to gaze from streetcorners; and the whole tale haunts me. Darkness take my hand is a very dark tale, definitely not for the squeamish, but it's wonderfully told and wholly un-put-down-able. A twisted mystery, a psychological thriller, a gritty tale of real people and real streets... In the end, it's simply a really good read, and I'm looking forward to starting number three as soon as my read-and-review pile shrinks a little lower.Disclosure: I read this because my husband told me to. My husband has good taste in books."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If you aren't a Dennis Lehane fan yet, I don't know what you're waiting for. \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" is another winner. In this novel featuring detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, the emphasis is on darkness. A sadistic murderer with a string of gruesomely killed victims, escalates the stakes. In this book, Kenzie has a girlfriend, Grace, with a young daughter, Mae. The case puts them at risk, too. As other reviewers have noted, this book may be too dark and gruesome for some readers. It is, however, always suspenseful and entertaining. I marvel at how well Lehane writes every time I read one of his books."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"There are soooo many mystery writers out there these days, but there is only a handful who truly produce first-rate work on a consistent basis. Dennis Lehane is definitely a member of this elite, and *Darkness, Take My Hand* demonstrates why.Like Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and some others in the P.I./lone wolf cop genre, Lehane has written his books in such a way that they are best read &quot;in order,&quot; as each book builds on the previous one(s) in terms of the development of his main characters. Consequently, readers should read Lehane's first book, *A Drink Before the War*, before picking up *Darkness, Take My Hand*, which is the second in the series.In most respects, however, *Darkness* is a richer, deeper, and better-crafted mystery than was Lehane's debut novel. He has utilized a well-worn but still effective plot theme here, that of the long-term serial killer. This provides the basis for the mystery element of the book, and also, perhaps unfortunately, the blood-and-guts angle, as well. Yes, there is a lot of gore in this book, and lots of discussion in graphic detail of the depravities of which human beings are capable. Lehane's work is NOT for the faint of heart.What separates Lehane from many other mystery writers, even good ones like Robert Parker, is his sheer literary talent. His writing is gloriously rich, descriptive (particularly in terms of his depictions of the Boston area setting for his stories), and insightful, and he goes to great pains to develop in some psychological depth his main characters, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. Consequently, this enables Lehane to take his work well beyond the cliches that are so typical of shamus novels.If you like the work of Parker, Connelly, Crais, Barre, Burke, etc., you should definitely start reading Lehane--in order, of course."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"After devouring this novel I was drained. This is the second in Lehane's series featuring private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro and it really packs a whallup. The first novel, A Drink Before the War, did a fine job of introducing these characters, along with an adequate story. This novel digs deep into the relationships of these people, and all the while we're being pulled through a harrowing serial killer mystery. Lehane has pulled out all the stops here. Sure, there are many authors who will try to shock you with gruesome details, but in this novel it's the sense of the helplessness of the victims that stays with you long after you leave the story. If you're like me, and have already read dozens of rave reviews about this, you'll be about 100 pages into it and will be wondering what the big deal is. Trust me on this: the novel is so well structured and timed that it very slowly begins to build up, as if you're treading water just at the edge of a whirlpool. Slowly and gently the current begins to tug at you, and before you know it you're caught in its grip and being pulled to its depths......God, I'm beginning to sound like a Kirkus Review. Sorry. But the novel is that good and the characters are incredibly well drawn and complex. Here's a quote from the story that will stick with me forever: &quot;We're human, so we're messy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This, the second of Lehane&#65533;s Kenzie/Gennaro novels, was gripping and suspenseful from prologue to epilogue. We know from reading the prologue that Kenzie and Gennaro are about to go through a harrowing experience. Still, I was not prepared for the chilling and gruesome events that unfold. There are many twists and turns as Lehane sustains a high level of suspense throughout. The writing is very good, although not flawless, and the mystery is well plotted. There are little details here and there that seem implausible, but they are easily overlooked under the sheer weight of the narrative.I was mildly disappointed in the first Lehane novel (A Drink Before the War) mostly because it seemed like Kenzie was too much of a cheap imitation of Spenser, and the writing seemed a bit amateurish at times (but I still thought it was very entertaining and a good introduction into a new series.) In this one, though, Lehane seems more confident as a writer and Kenzie has become a much more realistic and convincing character. Angie Gennaro is a wonderful character that you can&#65533;t help but fall in love with. With this novel, Lehane has definitely become one of my &#65533;must read&#65533; authors. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane's second thriller is on par with some of James Patterson's best work. Probably only 5-10% of the books I read are ones where I make extra time to read because I can't put it down. This is one of those books. The plot revolves around a serial killer and P.I.s Patrick and Angie.The cool think about this book is that the serial killer element isn't introduced for 100 pages or so. Most novels introduce all their characters early in a story, but it shows Lehane's strength as a writer when he introduces new characters about 1/3 through the novel and the story continues to flow.Then Lehane leads us along a thrilling ride full of twists and turns that end up involving characters that all knew each other in some fashion. This book is a lot like James Patterson in that there is a killer who has a personal vendetta against the main characters. Lehane keeps his mystery focused on a group of people who somehow knew each other, and the story doesn't seem far fetched.There is a lot of violence and a lot of twists. Some authors reveal twists slowly and you wonder the police or FBI hadn't figured it out sooner. This happens all the time in James Patterson stories. Lehane lets the characters discover the truth in a natural progression. The twists don't seem forced.Lehane actually takes the time to support the twists in the story.Darkness, Take my Hand is full of gritty violence and a lot of bad things happen to a lot of people. Somehow Patrick and Angie survive it all and even come out on top in the end, although not without some sacrifice on their parts."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Oh man this is one good read! I can't believe that I didn't know about Patrick and Angie earlier. I am an avid reader and only heard of Dennis Lehane's series last month. I have read &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; and now &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; in the past week. I was late to work on Sunday because I couldn't put &quot;Darkness&quot; down. Oh I love the characters. How wonderfully human they are. So full of fault and virtue. The story is dark, moody and riveting. It moves at a fast pace. Almost too fast since I was sad that it was over."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane kept me up late last night. I had begun reading 'Darkness, Take My Hand,' and I couldn't put it down. The prologue sets up what promises to be a very tragic story, and Lehane delivers. The prologue leaves a few questions unanswered, and you have to read through the novel to find out what the answers really are.The second novel in the Kenzie/Gennaro series finds Patrick Kenzie accepting employment from a woman who has recently received a threatening phone call and a picture of her college son in the mail. Quite simply, she wants Kenzie and his partner Angie Gennaro to find out who is stalking her.Kenzie and Gennaro suspect that the ghoulish Kevin Hurlihy of the Irish mafia in Massachussetts in involved. A quick meeting with the Irish mafia casts a cloud over this suspicion and subsequent work on the case raises new suspects. An old acquaintance of Kenzie's is murdered in grizzly fashion, and Kenzie is left wondering if this has anything to do with the case he is working on.From this point on, the novel becomes somewhat complicated. The investigation into the threatening calls and photographs grows to include a serial killer or maybe two. The police force, FBI, and Kenzie's walking terror of a friend named Bubba all get involved.Other crime fiction writers would do well to study Lehane's work. He has mastered the ability to create suspense and tension in a way that so many other authors in the genre have not realized yet. Kenzie and Gennaro, plus the law enforcement officers that work around them, actually do detective work and do not wait for all the clues to conveniently fall in their lap. Lehane finds ways to include twists that aren't quite as shocking as surprising as say James Patterson's, but highly effective. The novel is very dark and comments on the social depravity of Kenzie's surroundings. Gritty is probably an appropriate adjective for this novel.I would recommend this novel to anyone that likes crime fiction or a good suspenseful story. It is a page turner. A word of caution though, it is very graphic in many descriptions of violence. This novel is not for the ultra-squeemish. It also has some sexually explicit scenes and would not be appropriate for some younger readers. The writing in this novel is simply superior and I give it my highest rating."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Any reader who enjoys a well written story with great characters will enjoy Dennis LeHane. The three books should be read in sequence to appreciate the character development of Patrick and Angie (and Bubba too). &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; deserved to win the Shamus as a the best first novel. &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; is quite simply the best book I have read in several years. It can be read as a serial killer thriller, but it is much more. The story reminds me of Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, or the film &quot;Apocalyse Now&quot;. Patrick's journey in this book should strike a chord with any reader who has come to terms with their own faults, as well as those of their parents. Simply a great book. The most recent book &quot;Sacred&quot;, take Patrick and Angie on a road trip to Florida. It is a terrific follow-up to &quot;Darkness&quot;, if for no other reason than it answers the questions still unanswered at the end of &quot;Darkness&quot;. Buy these books and read then during the cold weather that is certainly ahead -- you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If you like to read mysteries, you would be hard-pressed not to love Lehane's Patrick and Angie combination. These two characters are so alive on the pages that you feel like you're with them every step of the way. This book is Lehane's usual page turner filled with the lowlifes of the world. As Angie says in the book, &quot;I'm tired of dealing with psychotics and deadbeats and scumbags and liars on a continual basis. I'm starting to think that's all there is in the world.&quot; This is the crux of Lehane's writing. He writes about people who embrace evil and enjoy the pain of others (this also taken from the book). Patrick actually falls in love in this episode. My feeling is that Dennis Lehane is an absolute standout in this genre."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I read the first four Dennis Lehane books this summer (in about 3 weeks!) and have really enjoyed them. I've read all the great private-eye series--Hammet, Chandler, Ross MacDonald, Robert B. Parker--and I think Lehane is really a fresh talent. His characters are occasionally reminiscent of Spenser and company, but not so much that it's distracting. What really distinguishes Lehane, in my view, is his outstanding plots. All the books I've read are very solid mysteries and his detectives, Patrick and Angie, get very involved in solving the mystery, rather than just following an investigation. I chose this one to review because it's an excellent jumping-on point for new readers. It is a truly nerve-tingling, gripping read that manages to make the whole serial-killer milieu fresh. This is the work of a very talented writer who is undoubtedly going to rank with the giants of the PI field."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane is a good writer but there was too much violence (hopefully somewhat unrealistic)and he gave some unecessary info on the settings, plots and characters. What I loved most about his book though is... you know how you always want to know more about a character when reading a book, and you feel the writer did not focus enough attention on that character? Well, he did an excellent job on each one of them. I could picture each character and understood their role. It was suspenseful yet predictable for us detective type novels obsessed readers. Try James hadley Chase and you will be able to predict writers like Lehane. Overall he is good and very funny. I had to catch myself a few times on the train from laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"i dont ever remember ordering this or actually receiving it, but who knows. if it says i did, then i did. and its a book, so there couldnt be that much wrong with it"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is the second of the Kenzie / Gennaro series, and the action picks up markedly. Kenzie's relationship with Gennaro becomes solidified and stands a serious test. The environs almost become a character here also. Plot is a bit more predictable, but the writing kept me focused."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane is a great author. This is one of my favorite books in his Kenzie and Gennaro series. Loved it"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"seems to me that all the characters were psycho killers who had no social values. The cell of serial killers came out of an unlikely event thirty years ago."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Can't wait to get the next one! This is a thrilling novel that keeps you guessing right to the end!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In Darkness, Take My Hand, Boston PIs Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are pitted against a cunning serial killer who's had 20 years to hone his craft.Despite the horrible title, Darkness, Take My Hand is an excellent, intricately-plotted mystery/thriller that kept me turning the pages deep into the night. The plot twists do not rely on shock value and are not done at the expense of realistic character development (I'm looking at you Gone Girl!); and the author did not shy away from difficult subjects. Most impressive of all is the way the author uses these plots twists to shape Patrick and Angie into well-drawn, three dimensional characters. The event in this book may not define them, but will certainly be a factor in how they mature as individuals and private investigators, and will have repercussions for at least a couple of more books in the series. There are also a couple of well-written, heartbreaking scenes that effectively conveyed the impact Patrick and Angie's chosen profession has on their personal lives.When I read A Drink Before the War, the first book in the Patrick Kenzie and Angie Genarro series, I wasn't exactly impressed but the potential I glimpsed made me decide to give Darkness, Take My Hand a shot. I am really glad I did because it is in this book that the author really hit his stride. I will definitely be checking out more books in this excellent series."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I guess I have been reading too much lately but I am getting tired of plots involving serial killers and hard bitten heroes who fall for a hot lady and her little girl only to be rejected when the hot lady is confronted with the heroe's violent life, etc. etc. and his heart is broken. And psychopathic serial killers are becoming a big yawn. But I couldn't put the book down even though I knew what was coming so I have to give this one 5 stars and take my hat off to Lehane for making a silk purse thriller out of a tired sow's ear plot. Truly a remarkable writer."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane is a great writer, but in this one he let his writing capability get in the way of telling the story. Terrific descriptive passages, but the reader is lost looking for the story line. I finally gave up reading it and put it aside unfinished."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In the past couple weeks, I've read all the Kenzie/Gennaro series. All of them (except Moonlight Mile) are of very high quality, but this one, Darkness Take My Hand, is really about as good as the modern detective thriller gets.Lehane is probably NOT the best at coming up with the perfect convoluted plot arc. But he's more than tolerably skilled at that.Nor are his characters the most endearing, or the most complex. Guys like Crais and Connelly have him beat there.But at the level of constructing sentences and paragraphs, Lehane can simply write circles around the competition. He just knows what sounds good, and he delivers it, page after page. If you're going to plunk yourself down and read a few hundred pages' worth of detective novel, that's nice to have. Style matters.If you're going to read this one, you ought to start with A Drink Before the War, and if you do read this one, you probably won't stop there. You'll probably end up like me -- wishing that Lehane hadn't moved on from the Kenzie series, and instead pounded out a thousand of these gems, like all the other guys out there writing thriller series."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I started reading this book with a different expectation from the actual plot that I finally discovered. I thought the storyline was more focused on investigative stuff (psychological nature) rather than brutality (physical abuse and graphic descriptions of violence). The book is wonderful if you take into consideration how intelligent a writer has to be to write a so well-woven story, still the brutal description of thoughts and crimes made me feel a repulsion for the book, I mean, it was not a book I got eager to read every day , on the contrary, I got reluctant to go on reading and felt very happy when the book ended. But, I did not think of giving up the book and, were not for the brutality I'd have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I've read all the Dennis Lehane books now, including the new one (Gone, Baby, Gone), and they all range from good to great. But this is the one I keep coming back to. It's gripping, it's frightening, it's amazingly realistic, esp. the dialogue. OK, the Bubba Rogowski character is a little over the top, but certainly no more than some of the characters in Robert B. Parkers &quot;Spenser&quot; novels. The main and supporting cxast are terrific, and the plot is dark and wonderfully convoluted. The killer(s) are edgy, brilliant maniacs who really deliver a punch. If you're looking for a good, solid thriller that'll make you squirm a little, this is the place to start. And once you start, you won't stop until you've read the entire Lehane collection. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was my first Lehane novel - - I'm hooked! Not only was I scared to read this at home alone (noises always seemed louder while reading this book), I was kept in suspense to the very end."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"A clerk in a local bookstore recommended this book. He said that the action was in Dorchester, and that I'd be familiar with the area where events take place which usually makes things more interesting. If I liked action mysteries, I'd like this book. I live in a suburb of Boston, as is Dorchester, love action mysteries, so I bought the book. Thus began my addiction to this author. I was with his characters every step of the way because, as promised, I could picture some of the neighborhoods where he went. I knew people who were like some of his characters (the good guys!). I was tantalized to stay with the book even when I found myself overwhelmed by the violence. When I had to put the book down, I found that even walking by it made me pick it up to see what would happen next. I viewed the action Patrick lived so vividly and the tension was so intense that I sometimes found myself holding my breath, or gasping with relief as some action or suspense ended. I am so! ! mewhat reminded of the way James Patterson describes similar events in his books with a small sampling of Stephen King. Lehane writes fluidly. There are no peaks and valleys. There is always something happening or something being set up to happen and you feel it. He entices you to stay through the book's chilling conclusion and if you've got the guts to stay, you're in for an incredible ride!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers who were disappointed. This is the last of DL's books for me. By that I mean I have read them all now. I left this one for last because I knew it was going to be dark and involve serial killers. Dark is one thing. This book is gruesome and horrible. Yet pretty ridiculous in many parts. We know there are at least two killers coming for our heroes yet we put one lone cop to guard them out in the street. We all know the electricity is off but we don't wonder if the killers are going to get through the electrically locked door? The two detectives are slow witted as are the police and the FBI. I think I could do a better job protecting them. And that endind scene - so far from reality- the bad guy swinging an infant around. Just to much. Compared to his other books I consider this one to be a loser. Pass it up for Sacred or one of his better books."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"For a detective thriller, this isn't exactly light reading. Like the title warns you, it is indeed dark, and peers into a darkness within the souls of the characters.The prologue sets us up to be prepared for some rather serious and unhappy occurances in the book...maybe not what we expect, but still we're warned that this book won't be all fun and games.The woman who hires Kenzie fears that she and her son are being targeted and this leads him eventually into the tracking of a serial killer who may have been involved with murders that occured 20 years ago. Eventually, he finds connections even with his own family and neighborhood.There's an undercurrent in the novel touching on how violence poisons the inner being of all involved, a theme that apparantly is recurrent in Lehane's books.There's genuine literary quality in Lehane's writings. There's also a tragic and fatalistic aura about his stories. Kenzie is faced not only with the challenge of doing the jobs he's hired for but also with the challenge of retaining his own soul, his own feeling of rightness.This works both as a well plotted mystery and also as a walk on the very dark side of human nature."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Incredible intelligent and witty hard-boiled detective novel that you will enjoy from the first to the last page. I'm now looking forward to receive all the the other books by Dennis Lehane that I immediately ordered after reading this one. Let me also recommend Richard Barre and Michael Connelly."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Although this book had interesting characters, I was troubled by the section that was almost too reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs. That scene was a huge distraction. It certainly did not represent fresh, innovative writing."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"One of Lehane's shorter stories but with the same attributes as his longer titles. Same batch of characters (Boston people)"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I think Lehane is very good at letting the reader inside the characters. I haven't read a book of his I didn't love"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This is a worthy follow up to the first book, with a gripping stand alone story complemented by additional back story on the principals. Patrick Kenzie is portrayed as an 'Everyman with skills' and has a very distinctive and interesting voice."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In the second novel of the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Genaro series, the PI pair are drawn into a vicious web of violence, murder and vengeance. As in the best noir tradition, nothing is what it seems to be except the predictable sociopaths.Kenzie and Genaro are drawn into a conspiracy which leads them to delve into Boston mob circles. We find that Genaro is in fact the scion of one of the big mob families, which she uses to her advantage in solving the mystery and intimidating the bad guys.This is a hard-boiled detective novel in the noir convention. Lehane creates a passionate connection between the main characters that despite being unfulfilled transcends their relationships with others. This connection creates a magnetic pull on the reader. Lehane uses lovely poetic language, as presaged by the title, which convincingly depicts this world of shadows in the Boston crime scene. A little less violent than the first novel plus the series is maturing in both writing and story."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"In the right circumstances, do we all have a capacity for violence? Lehane's second outing in the Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro series is a truly dark and intense tale. First, the two are hired by a woman, who believes that the mafia is threatening her son's life. But things aren't as they seem, and suddenly a series of crucifixion murders grip the Boston neighborhood. One of the victims is the woman's son. The police and FBI question Kenzie and Gennaro but are left dumbfounded. Kenzie only hope is to confront a deranged serial killer who is imprisoned for similar killings. The incarcerated psychopath will only talk to Kenzie, and it's clear that he has intimate knowledge about Patrick and the people he loves.By the end, I really liked the book, particularly the clever unveiling of murderer. This was one mystery that had some substance. Patrick Kenzie struggles with his own capacity for violence and also realizes how quickly he can lose those whom he loves. The pace was a bit slow at the start, but the rousing finish easily made up for it. Another criticism is the sheer number of people that the reader is introduced to at the start of the book. This was especially true of the laundry list of murder victims. Overall, the mystery is well plotted and the writing is taut, but my main problem with this book is that I didn't really like the main protagonists. Patrick is extremely loyal to his numerous friends, but I can't see why he has so many. Angie also seemed quite flat and unimpressive. In the end, the story was so compelling that it really didn't matter."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I've said this before and I'll say this again: Lehane doesn't write mysteries, Lehane writes Literature. I see no difference between Michael Chabon, Jonathan Lethem, Richard Russo, Michael Cunningham, and Dennis Lehane. When I finished Mystic River, I remember thinking \\"if this book does win the Pulitzer for best fiction, then a crime has happened.\\" I felt the same when I read Darkness, Take My Hand.Somewhere between writing A Drink Before the War and Darkness, Lehane got really good! I've seen him a few times at signings and I've never asked him what he did or wrote between those two books that made his skills leap into a whole new categories. A Drink Before the War is good, don't get me wrong. I don't agree that it's just an action book even though there's a lot of it in there! There's substance in Drink but Darkness is so much more! Every character is wholly fleshed out and pushed to the limit. The villains are so damn evil it hurts! The violence is gut-wrenching! And the writing is so taut it's like a piano wire. This book starts off like a bullet and doesn't slow down. And I'm not just talking about the action! I'm talking about the narrative (Patrick's narrative of the story can make you laugh at times then make you cry a second later), the subject matter, the dialogue, the setting, everything!This is why I read! Not just why I read mysteries but why I read fiction! To read something this good and profound just makes me happy to be alive."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I like referring to the customer reviews here on Amazon, I find them to be a good reference if I am thinking of starting a new book. What I don't like is how easily the five star rating is thrown around. To me, five star should be reserved for classics which will stand the test of time or those books with strong moral to teach.This book struck me like no other, though. It is a book that after I finished it at 11:30 PM (well past my normal bed time) I found that I couldn't sleep, filled with excitement of what I had just read. I am not one to reach for detective novels often, I find them to be too \\"cookie cutter,\\" i.e., someone dies, someone else looks for who-done-it, they find who-done-it. This book was much more than that. It left me feeling that picking up any other book would be a waste of time, a huge disappointment. I feel that reading (my favorite pastime) will not meet up to the bar set here by Dennis Lehane for the next little while, and that is really too bad. It is also, though, a fantastic gift."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I sort of feel that the first book in this series was just one long excuse to present one action scene after another. This second volume digs a little deeper and we as readers are presented with a complicated story. Lehane has over time become one of my very favorite genre writers and I think that Mystic River is right up there with any genre book ever put onto paper. The Kenzi/Gennaro series is much more mundane than Lehanes masterpiece, but it is still fun. Here in 'Darkness...' Lehane does not let things go too far over the top. It still remains in the realm of somewhat believable. The great plot is powered along by a series of sophisticated (sophisticated for genre writing) character studies.You really should pick this book up if you want a pretty nice series to delve into. I don't think that this book will disappoint you."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Kenzie and Gennaro are back, and so is lehane with this masterblaster of a book. Brutally realistic action, the wriest of wry humor, and next-door characters makes this book a surefire hit."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"First, I thought the book was excellent. Great writing, very visually descriptive and nicely put together. Excellent characters that are complex and believable and interesting. I can see why Mr. Lehane uses them again and again in his future novels (a male and female pair of Private Detectives). The book is written in the first person primarily, which I normally don't care for but works well here because it's not overdone (thus giving the reader many perspectives). The villains and situations are very dark (as the title suggests) and I would compare Mr. Lehane's &quot;monsters&quot; to the likes of Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lector although the descriptions of the acts done on others are not quite as graphic (which can be a plus, if you're reading while eating lunch for example). The plot is a clever mystery and realistic on all levels especially regarding the main character's (Patrick) relationships with the other characters in the novel. If you enjoy authors like Patricia Cornwell or Thomas Harris or Phillip Margolin, then I recommend you try this novel. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane's first book, A Drink Before the War was good and this one is too. I think this one is more stomach churning. It was very hard to put down and do something else. Places in it are vey terrifying. Kenzie and Gennaro are caught in the middle of a serial killers rage. Are there one or two. Only time will tell. Several people Kenzie cares about are killed and most in a bad, bad manner. The end was good as the killer was caught but will Kenzie and Gennaro ever be the same again??? Wonder how the next book can pick up the peices and go on? If you like a book that will hold your attention and make you scared to go to bed, this is the book for you. You knows you lurks out there?? Will Patrick Kenzie be affected for ever? As it says on page 213 in paperback, \\" You can't clean sewers for a living and come home smelling like soap. It\\"ll eat at you, as long as you do this work. It'll hollow you out.\\""},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane's second novel in the series is, like his first, impossible to put down once you start. The identity of the villain may be a tad disappointing because this character seemed somewhat underdrawn, but that's a minor quibble. There are ample complexities and surprises in this fast-paced, well-plotted story."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Outstanding. A nice spin on a long-term serial killer. I could hear the gunshots, feel the pain from victims and even felt the cold steel and oozing blood from a stiletto. WOW! I read this right aftwer &quot;Mystic River&quot; but I will take the advice of another reviewer and now read the rest of his work in order. My only dilemma will be either read them slowly or quickly. I don't want his work to end."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"If you love noir and crime fiction with great dialog that rivals Elmore Leonards, then pick up this book. This book is the sequel to A Drink before the war and picks up after that one ends. I recommend reading the entire Kenzie/Gennaro series in order to help enhance the experience but this one is my favorite of the first three that I have read. Great stuff here and sure to please."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I love the Kenzie/Gennaro series, and this is the best in the bunch. Great plotting, wonderful primary and secondary characters, and ruminations on the nature of evil that don't distract from the suspense."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I do not hand out many 5 star ratings. They should be reserved for books of unusual stature like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or FIFTH BUSINESS. But Lehane has written a dark and horrific masterpiece. He is indeed a deep and thoughtful author. Every mood and emotion is pitch perfect. Lehane has created not just memorable characters that give short term excitement, but rich compelling characters that speak to universal experiences. Lehane makes us think as we read, which is no easy task in popular fiction. Themes of honor, betrayal,fear, and vengeance are explored in an uncomfortable way. (and thats a good thing) To see how far a 'hero' will go for the greater good is indeed interesting and our hero does questionable things before he sees what the darkness will require of him. This a must read."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I am totally caught up in the series. These books have a lot of great suspense, action and mystery. The only negative is, these books have a lot of violence and sensitive subjects like ones dealing with child abuse. I really like the way Lehane has developed the characters of Angie and Patrick. This book had a lot of developments in their relationship. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I cannot believe how much I was into this book! The characters were as good and vivid as &quot;A Drink Before the War,&quot; and I cannot wait to read &quot;Sacred.&quot; Lehane does things to his characters that make them come alive, and the story needless to say is so unique. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"'Darkness, Take My Hand' is certainly a book not for the squeamish, as are Lehane's other books. In it we have our Boston private eyes (a man/woman pairing who, naturally, form something beyond a professional relationship) embroiled in a mystery where psychopaths mutilate residents of an inner Boston neighborhood. As the story unravels we understand these criminal monsters actually have their origins many years earlier, with a direct relationship to one of the private eye's own childhood. This book is filled with Lehane's characteristic plot twists, and the story matures nicely to a fine conclusion.But this book is not great. I felt the prose was somewhat weaker than in other Lehane novels; this man is capable of writing *literature*. But 'Darkness...' seems to be relatively devoid of witty dialogue or sparkling prose, unlike for example 'Prayers for Rain'. However Lehane is still in fine form with wonderful characterizations.Bottom line: a nasty and disturbing story of depravity and corruption. Not amongst Lehane's best but still a very worthy read."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Dennis Lehane is an acclaimed mystery writer whose recent novel, Mystic River, has been made into a current hit movie. Before Mystic River, however, Lehane was exploring Boston's dark and gritty underside in a series featuring PI's Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. Darkness, Take My Hand, is the second of the series and the first Lehane I've read.The novel starts simply enough with a request from psychiatrist, Diandra Warren, who has received a threat against her son and who wants the PI duo to discover the nature of the threat. At first, Patrick and Angie seem to be normal human beings simply doing a job, though sexual tension between the two is suggested, but as the novel progresses both are revealed to have had troubled lives touched by, yes, darkness. But violence soon erupts in a series of murders, dismemberments, and other grotesque events. With them emerges a passel of pathological misfits, all of whom seem to have some connections with one another in their dark corner of Boston. The FBI enters the picture; so do the local police. The book is not the type to read hit and miss inasmuch as the complexities of plot and the large cast of nasties are difficult to keep track of. Sex is also present in graphic terms and scenes.Lehane seems to be saying that we can never escape the past, the hurts, the disappointments, the brutalities of life. This is not a book for the squeamish or those whose idea of mysteries is the British-style cozies of gentility and manners. So be forwarned. But if you like dipping into the darkness (there, I've used that word again!) of the soul and the depraved thoughts, words, and deeds of some members of the human race, then read this novel. If not, leave it on the library shelf."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness, Take My Hand is the second book in Dennis Lehane's series about Patrick Kenzie. The first book, A Drink Before the War, was also Lehane's first novel and it won the Shamus award. Patrick Kenzie is a cynical, often funny, sometimes poignant Boston PI who works out of an old church belfry with his partner Angie Gennaro, and who now has a girlfriend, Grace, who has a daughter, Mae.In the beginning, Patrick is contacted by a woman who has, among other things, anonymously received a photograph of her son in the mail and is concerned about his safety. Patrick and Angie tail her son for several weeks, and it isn't long before they're worried about their safety as well. Throw in the Mafia, the FBI, and a few serial killers, and you have Darkness, Take My Hand.As with the first in the series, this book is a startling portrait of Boston, beautifully drawn by a man who grew up in the areas he writes about. But Darkness falls just short of War in most other respects. The plot is messy, tangled in places, and my credulity was strained by how far reaching the web is which has ensnared Patrick. There are many killers in this book. However, the lead characters are real and sympathetic. We care about them. We don't want the darkness to take them away, even as it takes their hands...Regrettably, I have found most seconds in a series fall somewhat short of the first. Darkness, Take My Hand is no exception. But it is also funny, sad, and very, very dark. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I read this book in a matter of two days. It was my first Dennis Lehane book and it certainly is not my last!!!! I actually happened to find this hardcover treasure at a book store on clearance, and I am so glad I did! The characters of Angie and Patrick are so real and their commraderie (spelling?)is what makes the story flow. I love the whole \\"serial killer\\" stories to begin with, and this one had my hair standing on end!! A must read for all mystery lovers. This is the new master of suspense!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This was probably the most intense of the Kenzie/Gennaro series. I lived in Dorchester for four years. I know all the places mentioned.It is hard boiled and certainly not for the squemish.A twenty year killing spree. The idea of the Waterfront Condo shrink coming from the old neighborhood never occured to me.This one kept me guessing and kept me from putting it down."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"This taut thriller is a great read. The characters are vividly drawn and the plot hums. This is the first book I have read in the Kenzie/ Gennaro series. It definitely won't be the last. Set in Boston, there is a psycho killer on the loose and bodies are falling all around Kenzie and Gennaro. Great read!!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I have read two of his books. Both books follow the same main characters. I liked reading both, but on the second story, I felt like I had already read it. It had the same feeling of the first book. But, it still is a good read; the killings are a bit gory, but can be glossed over.."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I love Dennis Lehane's books, and this one is no exception. Mysterious, fast-paced, and wisecracking, the story pulls you in from the first page and doesn't stop until the last. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Once again Dennis Lehane hits a home run. Great book, amzing series. Kinzie and Gennaro are some of my favorite characters in any series. Would recommend these books to anyone."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Lehane is able place the reader in the neighborhood I grew up in.

Does a great job of building the characters, unsavory as many of them may be. This is my second Lehane book, the first, A Drink Before The War, was even better than this one. Can't wait to read another."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"O novo mestre do thriller noir, Dennis Lehane evoca de forma digna e magn&iacute;fica, a selvageria da classe trabalhadora de Boston, nesta est&oacute;ria de redeno.Patrick Kenzie e ngela Gennaro, a dupla de detetives particulares que nos foi apresentada atrav&eacute;s do livro Um drink antes da guerra, tem como cliente, uma famosa psiquiatra de Boston, Diandra Warren, que est&aacute; fugindo apavorado, de uma vingana da m&aacute;fia irlandesa.Uma de suas pacientes, Moira Kenzie, disse que tinha sido estuprada por Kevin Hurlihy, um membro sociopata da m&aacute;fia irlandesa, que cresceu nas vizinhanas de Patrick e ngela.Nascidos e criados nas ruas de Dorchester, a dupla j&aacute; viram tudo de escurido na vida, mas o mal que os espera no os pega prevenidos, libertando segredos h&aacute; muitos anos escondidos e criando uma cadeia de assassinatos violentos.Hurlihy ameaa a m&eacute;dica e seu filho Jason.Enquanto os detetives tentam proteger Jason, uma outra vizinha, Kara Rider, &eacute; encontrada crucificada.Patrick procura crimes anteriores e similares a esse e encontra um que aconteceu na regio, h&aacute; 20 anos atr&aacute;s.

I was caught up in the story and totally invested in the lives of the well-drawn characters. I really liked this book, it's another that I could do with a 4.5* rating for!"},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Whenever I read another author who's written much in this genre and am disappointed, I remember Dennis Lehane and how indeed it IS possible to be consistently fantastic in giving his readers yet another unique plot and utterly outstanding writing to bring it to fruition. \\"Darkness...\\" is another gem."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Liked Gone, Baby, Gone very much, even his first in this series, A Drink Before the War, was not bad, but I have to agree with those who gave this book 1 or 2 stars that too much of it bordered on the just plain silly. The night of the denounement, after saying how traumatized and scared they were by what they had scene and found out, we morph into a giggling makeout session between two 16 year teenagers. Then, even though their cop friends had said they would call if they had important information, they seem irritated when the phone rings and it takes Angie 3-4 rings before she can answer!!? One(1!) rookie cop protecting them? Electricity goes out but that doesn't bother them!? And, yes, the final showdown, as others have mentioned, was too ridiculous for serious comment.I also have 2 other sloppy loose ends that Lehane never tied up. (1) Jack Rouse tells Kenzie that the EEPA, the neighborhood vigilante group, had to do whatever Gerry Glynn said because he had caught them at the Rugglestone murder site and could turn them in at any time if they didn't; but once he let them go, they presumably could have also blackmailed him for NOT arresting them for murder at the time. Mexican stand-off. So that didn't make much sense.(2) Kenzie makes a big thing out of trying to figure out what the connection is between what happened in 1974-75 and how then most of the members of the EEPA suddenly went on accelerated career paths: Rouse becomes head of the Irish mob; Stanley Timpson becomes county's top prosecutor, etc, etc.. That never gets explained, but obviously something must have happened, if previous sad sacks suddenly shoot to the top. So why bring it up in the first place if you can't resolve it. Just smacks of sloppy plot development and poor editing.Still think he's a good writer but he needs to tighten up his stories."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Hannibal Lecter meets Stephen King's \\"IT\\"Another dynamic detective novel from Dennis Lehane starring Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. A tight, well written page turner that continues the Boston saga of the mean streets of blue-collar Dorchester. Old secrets explode as evil envelops everyone.Kenzie and Gennaro face their toughest case yet as a trio of sadists murder at will notifying their intended victims with their surreptitiously taken photographs through the mails. As the story draws to a dramatic close, Angela is shot while Kenzie deals with the evil leader of the sadistic killers.Character development was superb. Mr. Lehane does a very good job of fleshing out all the characters. The reader is kept in suspense as to who the leader of the killers is until the final chapters. All in all a terrific read.Some very graphic violence and rough language but all germane to the plot. No gratuitous sex.Outstanding, must read if you are into the detective genre. Good for the beach or that long plane ride. Dennis Lehane is a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Darkness Take My Hand was a wonderfully well written work. The first Lehane book I read was Drink Before the War. I enjoyed the style and the characters were fun. Therefore, I looked forward to a continuation of Kenzie &amp; Gennaro which I found in Darkness Take My Hand. This book is honestly one of the best I have had the pleasure of reading. It beat out my all time favorite, The Stand. The suspense was chilling, the storyline flowed and the characters, compelling. I have passed it on many friends who are now huge Lehane fans. Some can't find the book and have requested that I locate the one I gave away, sure. I am looking forward to Sacred which I plan to purchase tomorrow in hard cover."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I was put off by the gratuitous and sadistic violence, the sloppy plotting, and the completely absurd omnipotence with which the villian is endowed toward the end. This is the hot new writer ? Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"We're not usually contrarians, especially when a book is very highly rated by both the public and by close reading friends, but Lehane's second in the Patrick Kenzie & Angela Gennaro set is so extremely violent, so twisted and dark that we were more anxious to finish just to get it over with rather than discover all the resolutions to the vicious action and closely concealed bad guy identities. A very complicated plot features the hunt for a duo or trio of serial killers, who remain active throughout the story to the point of nearly adding our protagonists to their long list of horribly grisly murders. And while there was some excellent probing of the issue of the violence Kenzie brought into the life of serious girlfriend Grace (and daughter Mae), as well as developments in the ongoing sexual tension between our two principals, we must forego the remainder of this set as just too over the top gory to suit us. Sorry \`bout that."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I seem to be in the minority on this book. I started reading it with great hopes of discovering a new crime writer. But I found it too wordy, too graphically sexy, too psychopathic and too derivative. Based on my feelings about this novel, I don't think I'll try any of his other works."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"The best thing about this book is its description of settings around Boston. It's always nice to see my city featured in literature.Although the story is at times very engaging, it is quite derivative and sometimes predictable. The jail scene is (too?) reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs and there are many other scenes that remind the experienced mystery reader of other, far superior crime novels.I also found the main character often too rough around the edges and sometimes outright repulsive. When he rationalizes the torture and death of the book's most vile criminals, he dissolves most of the sympathy he cultivated with the reader throughout the book. As someone whose job it is to uphold the law, one would have hoped he would have had a more refined sense of justice. Also disturbing are the subtle racial stereotypes that recur throughout the book (see Bubba).The personal relationships between the PI and his girlfriend, as well as the one between he and his partner, are peppered with cheesy dialogue that is sometimes so corny, they border on being embarassing.If you're looking for a semi-suspenseful and quick read with all the typical brashness of the stereotypical PI, (perhaps on a long flight), this is an adequate read. It's about what you'd expect, but nothing particularly gripping or memorable."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I just finished this today, and, I have to say, I wasn't thrilled. I read Mystic River when it first came out, and it was simply fantastic. Not knowing much more about Lehane, I picked this up hoping to hit the jackpot again.Don't get me wrong... it's a good book, but certainly not of the Mystic River caliber. It seems a far less professional effort. While Mystic River concerns itself with realistic people - people who struggle with right and wrong and their own moral compass - these characters are not so complex. The bad guys are REALLY bad, and the good guys.... well they're a little better.My main beef is that I didn't realize this was the second in a series, and I felt there were some things I didn't \\"get\\" - having missed the first book. In particular, the central character, Patrick, keeps referencing someone he killed, but it's never explained. I can only assume that was in the first book?That said, it was a decent, if dark and gritty, read. I'll probably pick up the others in the series to see what happens to Patrick and Angie. But, I won't expect \\"Mystic River\\" when I do."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"Yes, this is an interesting neighborhood for a PI tale, but good grief, the violence and gore are somewhat overdone. Futher, there are some big holes in the plot, and too many convenient wrap-ups, to make this a plausible story. I was hoping for more..."},{"Title":"Darkness, Take My Hand (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro)","review":"I've read two earlier novels by Lehane (and enjoyed them both), but I won't be reading Lehane again.In \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\", the plot on several occasions was surprisingly, even frustratingly predictable, and the scenes/descriptions of violence / torture / mutilation were so graphic I think Hannibal Lector would have nightmares. Cutting of vocal cords so torture can be conducted in quiet. Crucifixion. Mutilation. Burning people alive. A man's back is broken so he has no way to fight back but must watch his wife get raped. Many readers will find this is just too disturbing.In a series of bizarre commentary, Lehane goes off topic time and again -Page 15 Patrick compares \`ethnic cleansing' to \\"the man who shop up an abortion clinic not far from here or another serial killer who's killed ten in Utah . . .\\"Page 125 Patrick receives a bumper sticker \\"if you're against abortion don't have one\\".Page 156 Patrick claims of the issues of the day \\"people were shooting up abortion clinics and subway cars and embassies.\\"Page 452 Patrick muses before he himself in a display of twisted logic tortures and murders two people, \\"I was furious at every person who practiced violence willingly. People who blew up abortion clinics and bombed airliners and butchered families and gassed subway tunnels and executed hostages and killed women who looked like women who'd spurned them in the past.\\"Page 506 Angela writes in reference to the Vatican - \\"What do you think the guys in this building are deciding about my life and my body these days?\\"There may have been more, but you get the idea.Roughly of the population is pro-choice for abortion, and another are pro-choice for life. The remainder are somewhere in between. That's a lot of readers to offend by the silly and unnecessary left wing commentary into a novel where the story line had nothing to do with abortion."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"With 15 years of nutrition and cooking experience behind her, Cathe Olson brings the public another one of her much needed cookbooks for infants and toddlers. After publishing &quot;Beyond Rice Cereal: Healthy Food Your Infant and Toddler Will Love to Eat,&quot; she now brings us, &quot;Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love.&quot; This authentic cookbook is not just for the baby and toddler of the family. There are recipes that everyone will enjoy. My mouth watered while reading the Toddler Foods section of &quot;Simply Natural Baby Foods.&quot;Cathe begins with secitons titled How to Use This Book, Equipment, Ingredients, and Vegetarian Babies. Throughout the book are tips and fun wasy to feed nutritious foods to little ones. And children will beg for more. What I like best about Cathe's book is how simple she makes it for parents to feed their children healthy foods every day. I wish this book had been available thirty years ago when I was raising my children. At the time, there were some books on nutrition, but nothing like Cathe's cookbook to make feeding time fast and healthy.Cathe Olson shatters a long time myth that feeding babies and toddlers a meal from a jar bought from the store is much easier. It's not. And it's not cheaper. You'll believe it once you've read and tried the simple inexpensive recipes. This book will start babies on healthy foods that will shape the way they eat for life."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This book is a godsend to parents who want to make their own baby food and aren't sure how to do it or what to make.The book is broken down by age range so you can concentrate on making foods that are appropriate for the range your child is in.

The recipes are healthy, quick to prepare, and wholesome."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I really wanted to post some good feedback here so I've used the book for 1.5 years before writing this. I knew that it would be important to me to feed my son as many unprocessed foods as possible, but I was really nervous about how few ideas I could come up with on my own that didn't involve a gourmet recipe. THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! Not only are the recipes really basic, but after a while I was able to start coming up with my own by just changing out a fruit or vegetable that she called for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Of all the baby food cookbooks in my collection (English, Chinese and Japanese), I have to say \\"Simply Natural Baby Food\\" is by far my favorite. I like it because it's concise and informative, and it incorporates some old ingredients that I grew up with, e.g. dried seaweed and tofu, and some new ingredients that I'd happily tried such as Tahini and Hummus. More importantly it caters to the needs of babies with food allergies and always offers alternatives. The simple and healthy finger food and snack ideas have been lifesavers for us as we tried to stay away from some common allergens. As for those recipes that call for nuts, skipping this particular ingredient does not affect the flavor IMHO. Last but not least, like other reviewers have commented, these recipes yield creative and delicious dishes for the whole family to enjoy."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Simply Natural Baby Foods by Cathe Olson is a Must Have for any parent wanting to provide nutritious snacks and meals for children of all ages not just infants and toddlers.When my children were diagnosed with food allergies, I took a look at what I thought was healthy eating and saw that there was room for improvement. I was afraid to order yet another cookbook, not sure if we could utilize the recipies. After emailing the author, she was more than willing to assist me in making exchanges for ingredients we can not eat, so that we could fully enjoy her cookbook. I wish I had this book 4 years ago.If you don't want your children eating processed, chemical laden foods, but don't know what to feed them, THIS BOOK HAS THE ANSWERS. The recipies are just as the title says \\"simply & natural\\" basically real food. My family has loved everything I have made from it. I can't say enough good things about this book, someday your children will thank you for caring enough to buy and use this book."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"When I had my children, I wanted to feed them nutritious foods but had a limited knowledge of the organic products available. Cathe's book was a life saver. Aside from the delicious recipes (that even my picky 5 year old enjoys), her section on healthy ingredients, and how and when to use them, was very informative. My oldest child even enjoys preparing some of the simpler recipes with me! Though we are not a vegetarian family, most of the recipes in this book are geared for vegetarians. I have found that these recipes are a great way to get more veggies into my meat loving kids and I have shared many of the recipes with my vegetarian friends. The wide variety of recipe choices offers something for everyone in the family. I particularly love the dessert section...finally I can indulge without feeling guilty!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I have not read this book, but I plan to purchase it based on the many positive reviews. The main negative review I've read is difficulty finding some of the obscure ingredients. The ingredients problem can be easily solved no matter where you live. The reason why I am writing a review is to add a comment to that discussion.Thanks to the internet, it is no longer necessary to live in Northern California to have easy access to obscure ingredients. If you like the idea of the book but are worried about finding ingredients, buy them online!!One reviewer had a hard time finding brown rice flour. Try www.barryfarm.com. You will find a 1 lb. bag for $1.29.Another reviewer mentioned Quinoa. Try www.mannaharvest.net. You will find a 12 oz box of Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa for $3.25.These are only two examples of thousands of resources online. A great way to find any of these ingredients is www.froogle.com (Google's shopping search site).Yes, you will have to pay for shipping, but...1. If you can buy a lot of ingredients from one store, the shiping is a small percentage of the total price.2. You often don't pay sales tax online, which can offset the shipping cost. (In fact, if you have to pay sales tax, that means you're in the same state as the store which means you probably have easy local access to these ingredients anyway).3. The shipping cost can be worth the added convenience of having these items delivered to your door.4. Some online stores offer free shipping if your order is over a minimum dollar amount."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I bought this after reading reviews that stated it was a concise book filled with easy recipes for baby and toddler.

I realize that these types of ingredients are not always easy to find, but in the case of some, you may be looking too hard.

Always do what your pediatrician recommends, but Olson provided good guidelines for our baby and lifestyle in recipes within each age range. I cook and live in a big city, so the ingredients were very simple to find and I was already familiar with most of them.

Half of the recipes call for nuts of some type for babies from ten months on. Everything I have heard from the Dr's or read says to wait at least one year and until two or three years if you have a family history of nut allergies.

My problem is now solved. This is a great book for parents that would like to avoid all the \\"processed\\" foods that are on the market. Gerber is great, but nothing compares to all natural baby food made in your own home. This book has it all, it even has a recipe for homemade teething bisquits! One of the main reasons we have gone this route is because of the amount of SUGAR that is in EVERYTHING (seriously..... look at the amount of sugar in juice.... wow). Since my husband can't have sugar and my father can't have salt... we needed something that would work for everyone and this book does. I am extremely happy with my purchase.I am in disagreement For those that say \\"it is too involved\\". The most difficult recipes are no different than making a meal for yourself; and those recipes are also good for adults so its not like you would be making one meal for baby and one for yourself....you would be making ONE for EVERYONE. It is a great way for the whole family to eat healthier."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I found this book to be wonderful! If you are the kind of person who is willing to put in a little bit of work and don't want your child to start solids with foods full of preservatives, this is the book for you.

I found that both books have nutritious & tasty recipes that aren't too time consuming.

I would recommend buying it in addition to The Petit Appetit by Lisa Barnes."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This is a great book for moms who feed their children whole and organic foods. The recipes range from first cereals to desserts to toddler meals. The whole family can enjoy these! There are recipes for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and found it to be a very simple guide to really get going with baby food. I ordered Super Baby Food and Blender Baby Food at the same time, and was able to get started with baby food after reading the first few pages of this one. It's that easy to get into. Yes, order one of the bigger books if you want lots and lots of info, but if you just want a quick manual on how-to, this is a good book to get. The recipes are very very easy.My favorite recipes in here are the brown rice cereal (I make it all the time for my daughter) and the pear-applesauce, which is SO awesome, I steal my daughter's all the time out of the freezer when I need a sweet treat and finish off hers after she's done eating if she doesn't want any more!The only downside to this book is that some of the ingredients are a little weird, like sea vegetables, but if you're into health food, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This book has so many great recipes and I am learning a lot more about cooking whole foods and even sea vegetables. I never cooked with some of these ingredients before but I'm so glad I found out about them and how nutritious they are. This book has really expanded our horizons when it comes to eating. And I haven't had any problem finding the ingredients - the are all available at my local natural foods store.My husband likes the dishes I've cooked - and my kids do too. All the recipes for sweets don't have any sugar but taste really good. I am happy that my kids are eating healthy foods and not all that processed, sugary stuff.I also like that this book is not full of a bunch of fillers that most of the other baby food books. Many were 1/3 to 1/2 of information before they even got to the recipes and who has time to read all that stuff.I love the simplicity of the recipes and the great suggestions like making toddler popsicles in ice cube trays - I always found that regular popsicle molds made way to much and it would just melt all over. These are the perfect size. This book also has lots of great cracker recipes which are so quick and easy to make and I don't have to worry about my baby eating hydrogenated oils and sugar. The smoothie recipes are awesome - who knew you could sneak veggies into a smoothie and it would taste so good.This book gives more than recipes. Some of the ideas are very simple but you don't always think of them on your own. I'm very happy I choose this book."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"What an attractive and well-done book. I read Simply Natural Baby Food from cover to cover. Great education and inspiration! I feel newly motivated to make healthful, new and fun recipes for my family.I would like to emphasize that this book is great for the whole family, not just the baby.We love the recipes for soups, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast foods...and most of all, we love the recipes for healthful snacks. Everybody loves a treat but isn't it hard to find snacks which we can really feel good about? This book will help. Some of our favorites are animal crackers, graham crackers, pretzels, muffins, cookies, bars, ice cream, pudding, smoothies and more!Simply Natural Baby Food would make a wonderful gift.

And my husband and I are even enjoying the fruits of Cathe's labor!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I bought this book based largely on the great reviews, and while it does have a few recipes my son has enjoyed, it is a very slim book. I'm not kidding when I say it has a recipe for cinammon toast! Other \\"recipes\\" literally have three ingredients and the direction \\"mash.\\" Now, I'm no gourmet chef, but I was looking for a little more-mainly sneaky ways to get my son to eat vegetables. I was hoping for recipes a little like those at the back of the \\"What to Expect\\" books. It does have some good ones,(great first birthday cake),just don't expect a thick volume."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"As a 2nd time mom, I already had some idea of what to introduce when and how to make basic vegetable mixes. I bought this book mainly based on the reviews, because the ideas of adding flaxseeds gfor fiber and using kelp and so on made it sound like an \\"edgier\\" healthy baby cookbook.I still gave it 3 stars because even though it's pretty basic, it still has some great tips and it really encourages to feed the baby whole foods: it explains how to make baby cereal from whole grains, good veggies and fruits to start with and some interesting mixes; it's also divided by age so 1st time moms will probably find it useful as it gives guidance while keeping things simple."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I found this book very helpful when deciding to make my own baby food. She gives great tips on how to prepare and freeze the food. The book is very basic, but for a first time mother, I did not want to get fancy when feeding my little one. I simply wanted to do it right. The recipes are no brainers, and she gives you great ideas to combine foods you wouldn't normally think to put together. The Banana Oatmeal cookies are great, so is the Purple Mash! My son loves it."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Many books claim to have \\"healthy\\" recipes for babies, toddlers, and children, however, I have discovered most are little healthier than Betty Crocker. This book is one exception. The recipes are health centered with the author explaining the nutritional benefits of many of the main ingredients for her recipes. The recipes I've tried have been easy to prepare although you may need to make a trip to your local health-food store to get some ingredients or order products on-line like another reviewer suggested because some of the ingredients are not mainstream. Please note - I am not a vegan, or vegetarian, just someone who was raised by a health conscious parent and wants the same in turn for my child. I credit my mother who took the time to learn about nutrition, shop at a health-food store, and create her own healthy recipes similar to the ones in this book for my good health today. I have never had any health or weight issues in my life."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Wow, I couldn't disagree with the last reviewer more. Sure, this book has some recipes with some harder to find items so just skip those recipes! I never would have introduced my daughter to some of the grains if they hadn't been recommended in this book. I always taste what I make for her....better than jarred! She LOVES the raisin bars but my husband loves them more. I now have to double the recipe so he won't eat them all first. Some recipes are more involved than others but the majority are easy! The bottom line is my daughter has enjoyed every recipe!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I will be buying this book for all of my pregnant friends! Unlike a few others who have reviewed this book, I did not feel like I was being preached to by the author. I found her informative and concise, which is exactly what I need as a first time mother of a 5 month old. Also, as has already been stated by other reviewers, if you want to use the suggested 'exotic' ingredients to obtain the full health benefits of these recipes, use the internet! Anything you could ever need is at your fingertips.I am very excited by this book, having already read it from cover to cover, and cannot wait to try the numerous, simple recipes at my disposal."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I purchased several cookbooks when my daughter was beginning to try solids and this little cookbook has become my staple for finding recipes. Olivia is 1 year old now and even though she is eating mostly what we eat, I still go to this cookbook for lunch, breakfast, and snack recipes. I just made the Oatmeal Banana cookies and they are wonderful. The apple oat pancakes were a hit and so easy to freeze for quick future breakfasts. The Lentil Stew is also amazing - I made enough for my husband and I to eat too! I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone interested in feeding their baby/toddler whole foods."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Great, quick and easy to prepare recipes with wholesome and nutritious ingredients (surprised at some of the bad reviews, I wonder why people that don't even know what millet or quinoa is would consider buying a book with this title in the first place?!?), ranging from first solid foods to nutritious meals and desserts for toddlers. The banana oatmeal cookies are delicious and contain zero sugar (except from the fruit sugar that comes with the bananas, naturally), my son (9 months) loves them. It's great to have a little \\"healthy\\" (as far as you can speak of healthy when it comes to processed - that is baked, in this case) treat at hand when there's not yet really much you can give.We are vegans, and most of the recipes in this book are either vegan or vegetarian and can be easily veganised.The book gives some basic information on nutrients and possible allergens, though you better check back with your pediatrician before introducing foods that are highly allergenic when your family has a history of food allergies.This book is for you when you are vegetarian, vegan or just health conscious and feel comfortable preparing your own food in contrast to buying highly processed foods for your family. It's not for you if you don't know what brown rice, millet or quinoa is, or couldn't be bothered to find out, or if for some reason you oppose shopping at health food stores to get the occasional non-supermarket ingredient (tahini, nutritional yeast etc). I found the instructions to be helpful and just right - everything I tried out so far turned out great, and baby loved it.Some of the recipes included: \\"make your own instant baby cereal\\", quick quinoa and avocado, cauliflower and broccoli, quick millet and applesauce, brown rice and lentils, sweet potato and green beans, veggie-rice-pilaf, scrambled tofu, creamy carrot soup, bean spread, teething crackers, apple-bran muffins, apple-oat pancakes, banana oatmeal cookies, instant banana pudding (made with silken tofu), plus beverages and smoothies... and many more. Love them all - we highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I really like this cookbook and appreciate the recipes and ideas for feeding a baby that don't involve just opening a box or jar of pre-made food from a factory. Some of the recipes are a little too complicated or time-consuming for me (i.e. if it takes 45 min to make rice cereal, you might rather just stick to oatmeal), but it is a good source of ideas. I have mostly just steamed and mashed veggies and fruits when I have had an infant to feed. This has good recipes of that kind, but also more ambitious kinds of healthy foods that kids will like."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"simple book easy to read, and gives you different options, to make food from scratch, not only the mashed food ,but also the cookies , also remind you of tips to create food experience for your baby not just eating, such as independent eating food habits ( give child spoon, or plate etc.)I recommend it as a gift for new mothers"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I just love this little recipe book!!

I missed one towards the end that said don't buy this, several of the recipes call for ingredients such as sea kelp, sea vegetables (I didn't know there was any such thing), or things like tahini, millet and quinoa. I don't even know what those are. I should be able to buy the ingredients in a regular grocery store. It also goes to the other extreme (also noted in a previous review)and actually gives recipes for juice pops (pour juice into an ice cube tray). I mean really. There are very few actually usable recipes in this book, and it is a very thin and small book to begin with. For the most part this book will be under the Mommy Made book. Buy that one, its much thicker, has much more recipes and uses regular every day ingredients. This one was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I was disappointed with this book due to a) the lack of suggestions for first foods (and I have enough to do without making rice cereal myself), and b) some of the ingredients I also wouldnt know where to buy or what else to do with them. There are many more foods infants can eat when they're starting out than was suggested in this book.If you or your family are not solely whole foods eaters this might not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I will be trading this book asap. Several of the recipes contain ingredients I don't use, such as low sodium soy sauce, miso, and Sea Veg Mix. I am not particularly trusting of additives such as Sea Veg Mix or salty additives such as soy sauce or miso (even in the low sodium form), so that doesn't leave many recipes left in the book for me to use. I recommend instead Better than Peanut Butter and Jelly by Mattare and Muldawer."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I love this little book. I know a past reviewer criticised the book for being too thin but that's one of the things I like about it. I have always enjoyed cooking and bought quite a few baby cook books when my daughter was very young thinking I would potter around making her perfect gourmet meals but soon realised that there are many days when the thought of even leafing through the pages of those cookbooks is too much effort. I just find them too overwhelming and invariably reach for this book because the recipes are simple but still tasty. You don't need to be a great cook to be able to make these recipes, the instructions are very easy to follow.Despite being a slender volume, the book packs a lot of information into its pages, and still has a great collection of recipes.I never found it to be a problem finding any of the ingredients. I have to admit that even though I consider my cooking to be quite wholesome I had never used some of the items like dried seaweed (you only use a pinch) and ground seeds myself, but after reading in the book just why these things are included, I found myself adding them to my own food as well. They are incredibly nutritious and such an easy way to bolster your child's immune system which I found so reassuring during the winter. I'm sure you can order these ingredients online if you can't find them in a store nearby. You use such a small amount that they will last for ages. And you can always leave those items out if you prefer.The book is written in a very friendly manner and is a nice balance between educating and guiding you as to what your baby's and toddler's developmental needs are with easy to follow recipes. A reviewer below wrote that the last thing they needed was to be making their own baby cereal. Well I guess if that's your mindset then this book isn't for you because honestly it takes all of two seconds to make the cereal, and the jar lasts a very long time when you are using a couple of tablespoons at a time! Not that you can't find good organic packaged baby cereal, (I did try that myself but my baby would never eat it). And there's nothing stopping you from using the recipes as guides and substituting purchased products for some ingredients if it makes life easier.The book takes you right through to when your child is a toddler with tips that help you sneak vegetables into their diet and great snack ideas too. There are some lovely recipes for cookies and cakes as well, which is nice, it's very realistic in that although you want to feel that you are presenting your child with yummy healthy food, there's always a place for sweet treats in life. I'm not personally a fan of soy products which some of the recipes call for, but I just substitute the tofu or whatever with chicken,lamb or fish.I went online to check out the authors website and was happy to see that the adorable little girls on the website who I assume are the author's daughters look like very happy and healthy children. They are a great advertisement for the book."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This book certainly has some mixed reviews. It seems people either love it or hate. While I am one of the ones who LOVE this book, I can see why this book would not be for everybody. Here are my thoughts:\\"Simply Natural Baby Food\\" does not try to make you vegetarian, vegan, macrobiotic, a raw fooder, or a carnivore - however, it pulls aspects from many different diets. There are many vegetarian recipes, there are vegan recipes, there are some smoothies and treats made from raw foods, there are recipes that use alternative grains like brown rice flour for those with wheat or gluten allergies, there are recipes that use whole grains and sea vegetables that are common in a macrobiotic diet, there are recipes that incorporate dairy products, eggs, fish or poultry.While this may sound like it encompasses everybody, it does not. This book is for people who want to eat (and want their children to eat) whole foods. That means whole grains like brown rice, millet and quinoa; beans and legumes; fruit and vegetables; cultured dairy products like yogurt and cottage cheese; more plant foods than animal foods; no white flour or refined grains; and no refined sugar.For many feeding your child fresh, organic, whole foods without sugar, articial colors and trans-fats may be too far removed from what they are accustomed to eating. If you expect to be able to find the ingredients for the recipes in this book at your local 7-11, you definitely have the wrong book - but if you prefer to shop at a natural foods store - or at least are open to checking one out (or even an online store), you will enjoy this book.I for one found it a refreshing change from the other books that offer recipes using jello, bisquick, and colored cereals. And that's not to say that the foods are bland-tasting health foods either. My husband, children, and I love the White Bean and Corn Chowder,Apple Oat Pancakes, Apple Bran Muffins, Quick Cheesy Rice, Banana Oatmeal Cookies, Pineapple Carrot Cake, Instant Banana Pudding, Smoothies, and the \\"Better Than Ice Cream\\" made in the food processor is incredible.I want a different way of eating for my children than I was brought up with. Look at the obesity rate of children in this country. Children are now suffering from previously adult only diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and more. In fact, this generation of children is expected to be the first generation ever to live a shorter life span than their parents. Processed food laden with trans fats, chemicals, pesticides, artificial colors and flavors, sugar, and sodium found in our local supermarkets are not producing healthy, fit children. This book gives an alternative - and I see my children thriving on these recipes - and the rest of my family as well."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Simply Natural Baby Food by Cathe Olson is a simply wonderful book.This little gem is a must-have for anyone wanting to give their baby or toddlerthe very best in whole, nutritious foods.

Many of these recipes make large quanties, but it all freezes well. I found myself cooking a lot for several days, but since I can store the food in my freezer and use small quantities at a time, I then have a week or so off from cooking. If you already practice eating whole foods and buying in bulk, chances are that you will have most of the ingredients laying around anyway. I did have to pick up a few specialty items at the local food co-op, but I shop there all the time anyway! The food is good, and my husband and I eat it as well. I have seen an improvemnet in my son's sleeping habits since we began practicing the recipes in this book. This is not only a book of recipes, but also a book about lifestyle change. I have learned so much. I wish I had this book a year ago! It is now a must buy for anyone I know who is having a baby."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I love this book. It was just what I needed to find out about making baby food. The recipes are easy and the author explains how to make the first purees and then move on to more texture and ingredients.The best thing is that the ingredients for all the recipes are whole foods - no refined flours, grains, or sweeteners. Our family meals have never been better now that we have nutritions soups, entrees, snacks and desserts. We have all benefited from these healthy and nutritious recipes.But yes - you will need to go to a health food store for some ingredients (thought that's where I prefer to shop anyway).If you are looking for a wholesome, non-processed way of eating, you will LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Cathe Olson has created a fantastic cookbook that offers you simple-to-make recipes with extremely healthy ingredients that you can feel really good about feeding to your baby or toddler. I think it is very important to feed your baby the best, most natural foods when they are young; not only to start them off with the most healthy \\"building blocks\\" for their growing bodies, but also so that the child comes to appreciate the various tastes and textures of \\"real\\", natural food, instead of the highly processed, prepackaged children's meals that are out there.Cathe has wonderful pureed recipes for very young infants (purple puree with made with red cabbage and other great ingredients was my daughter's favorite!), and then she introduces more chunky recipes for older babies and toddlers. There is a fun section full of easy and unique sandwich ideas, and some delicious dessert recipes for toddlers (and adults!) that don't even contain sugar.I also really appreciate all of the helpful cooking, storing, and feeding hints that are scattered throughout the book. Extremely helpful are her instructions on how to cook brown rice and various grains and legumes for infants; it's great to know how much water to use and the cooking times when making these staple foods for babies.Cathe offers both vegetarian and meat options for the older baby/toddler recipes, so you can take your pick there. She has introduced me to some really interesting (and natural, of course) salt and sugar alternatives, and her use of using sea vegetables to increase the nutrition of foods was also quite enlightening for me. All in all, a great book for anyone wanting some creative and healthful recipes for your infant and toddler!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I loved this book!! So many great ideas for feeding my year old. She just started eating solids a couple weeks ago! I especially love the Oatmeal Banana Cookies (No sugar! No dairy!

I have always known I wanted to make my own baby food, but just didn't know how. I have been searching for months for the perfect book and asking every mom I know for advice. I finally found this book in my library and it has been the answer to all my questions. It is due back now, so I am running out to a bookstore first thing tomorrow to purchase it. I had taken out other books that were complicated, and used ingredients I did not agree with. Cathe Olson knows how to make a user friendly book. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I suppose if you have time to spend surfing the internet you may be able to find all the info in the book like the previous reviewer suggests but as a mom of an infant and a toddler - where would I get the time. I'd much rather have someone do all the research and recipe testing for me and put it all together in one place - and with the relatively low price of this book - it is well worth purchasing.Simply Natural Baby Food has all the info I need to start my baby on solids while lots of fun, healthy recipes for my toddler - and great meal ideas for the rest of the family as well.I like that it is a small, well organized book - unlike some of the other baby food books that are huge and overwhelming. This book is so easy to use - I can find what I need quickly and easily.I especially like the soups, the cookies and crackers, and the Better Than Ice Cream has to be one of the most delicious desserts I have ever tried. I love that the recipes are so easy and that they are made from whole foods. I enjoyed Olson's other book, The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook as well."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This book has great recipes for babies, toddlers, and the whole family. I especially like this book because a) the recipes are very easy to make (great for a busy mom), b) the recipes are super healthy (no refined sugar or grains), and c) everybody in my family likes the dishes I prepare. So far, our favorites are: apple-oat pancakes, split pea soup, creamy carrot soup, white bean and corn chowder, squashed macaroni, carrot corn muffins, apple-bran muffins, pineapple-carrot cake, banana oatmeal cookies, and instant banana pudding - plus the smoothies and \\"better than ice cream\\" recipes. And that's not even counting the baby food.If you want to raise your children to eat whole, natural foods, this is the book for you. I also have Olson's other book, The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook, and I love that as well.Edited to add:I came to order another copy of this book for a friend who just had a baby and saw the above review. I am really surprised by it. Nowhere in the book does the author tell you to feed your baby vegan or vegetarian. She does offer many vegetarian recipes but she also has some recipes for fish or poultry. The only thing I think she says is that red meat is hard to digest for infants. What's great about this book is that it offers recipes for everyone - vegetarian, vegan, and those eating animal foods. However, they are all whole foods so you do have to be willing to venture into a health food store to get some ingredients."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I personally love this book. I don't follow it to key, like buying organic veggies, I buy just the regular ones, for example, but it is a good book. The recipes I have been able to do are great, and easy to do, plus tasty.My only problem is finding some of the ingredients. I live in the fraser valley/lowermainland of British Columbia, Canada. The area is very mulit-cultural, with foods from vertually every where in the world RIGHT here! It's great for shopping. And usually you can find pretty much everything you're looking for. But not in the case of the ingredients from this book.One thing, for example, was the brown rice flour. I found RICE flour, but not BROWN rice flour, and the bags are SMALL, and expensive.Other things, like kelp, I ... actually figured I would find, but I haven't yet. She, the author, uses a lot of sea vegitables actually for the older baby foods. Which is great, if you can get a hold of them, cause their nutritional value is amazing, sometimes way better then &quot;land&quot; veggies. I live ... not to far from the ocean, and I figured, reading this book, and getting these veggies should be a breeze. But it looks like if I want kelp, I'm going to have to get it right from the ocean itself. *laughing*But personally I don't like having to go to speciality shops to find ingredients for a recipe, especially recipes I find in a book that's supposed to make making your baby food an easy task. I found myself in a Chinese store, an East Indian store, etc. in hopes of finding SOME of these ingredients, cause honestly, the recipes sound great, and I DO want to try them. But I'm stumped ... where does one look?Now, there are recipes in here that you do not need special things, but it is a warning, that at least 1/3 of the older baby recipes have an ingredient you won't beable to find, unless you're making these ingrendients yourself, or ... have an AMAZING local grocery store. *laughing*So, lastly, I recommend the book, but with the warning that although the recipes are simple to make, they are not simple to get the contents of."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Simply Natural Baby Food is a well-written, easy to use cookbook for any parent who wants to make sure that his/her child is starting off with good eating habits.

This book is certainly not going to teach you things you can't find elsewhere. Save your money."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"As a working mom with a baby, I knew I wanted to make my own baby food but I wasn't sure where to start. I picked up a copy of this book at a local store, and found it to be just what I needed.It's a small book, so it's not as overwhelming as many others I've seen, but it has great information and basically follows the advice of my pediatrician as far as when to introduce certain foods, how long to wait before introducing something new, etc.In the beginning, the foods are really basic. Mashing an avocado or a banana is quite easy, but I hadn't thought about using avacado as a first food. It turned out to be a great first food that my baby really enjoyed--he started with avacado and banana at about 7 months old.From there it gives you some simple but good combinations, such as apple pear sauce and squash with peas. She goes into the equipment you need, and how to make baby food. I just make up a batch and use silicone ice cube trays to freeze it.Unlike many other books, this book is not geared toward raising your baby as a vegetarian, but she does say to wait until 10 months or so before giving meat (my pediatrician recommends 11-12 months). There are, however, many vegetarian and vegan meals in the book for children who are either not eating animal products yet, or who are raised vegetarian or vegan. For these children, she recommends additions such as nutritional yeast and sea vegetables to make sure they get enough vitamins and minerals.I really love the toddler food section, where she has many meals that sound great for the entire family. She also has a number of desserts that don't contain sugar or artificial sweetners (most of them contain fruit or other natural sources of sugar). There is absolutely no reason to ever give a baby or toddler any food that contains sugar, although a few other baby cookbooks I have contain sugar laden recipes.To answer some of the other critics about this being for \\"crunchy\\" people or containing a ton of weird ingredients, I'd like to say that I'm a normal person who lives in Alaska and is a full-time Realtor and a full-time mom. I like to hunt and fish, and we are not vegetarian or vegan. I do try to eat healthy, and buy organic produce when I can, but living in Alaska I'm limited in what is available.We don't have a lot of health food stores or restaurants here, but I can find the ingredients in her sea vegetables in our local store in the Japenese food section. I was unable to find one ingredient (hiziki I think), so I just used the other ones. I've added them to many foods I cook for myself and my husband as well, since they are a good source of iodine, iron and calcium.My pediatrician even recommends kelp as a good source of iron for infants at 6 months of age (granulated kelp is found as a salt substitute in the seasoning aisle of my local store). The author always says you can substitute kelp for the sea vegetable mix.I think this is a great book to introduce people to a few new healthy foods that are easy to incorporate into your baby's diet. I've purchased 5 books on baby food, and this is by far the best. My only complaint is that all cook books should have a spiral binding to make them easier to use while cooking!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"The book is petite, as it should be; yet the writing is large and easily legible. Cathe's format emphasizes the simplicity of the recipes (that moms can literally whip up in minutes and freeze in batches for later use). Nonetheless, while the recipes contain just a few ingredients, Cathe emphasizes the importance of nutrition, and ensures that her recipes are well rounded from a nutrient perspective for each stage of an infant's development. In fact, there are numerous healthy tips and the chapters are broken down by age.Actually, I found several of the older baby recipes (apple oat pancakes and pineapple carrot cake) and toddler recipes (whole grain waffles and minestrone soup) enticing myself! Really, the recipes cover breakfast to dinner tastes, and everything in between. This book even offers recipes for homemade animal cookies and graham crackers!Worth noting, no diets are excluded from this handy guide. While there are a few omnivorous recipes (with meat), most of the recipes are vegan/vegetarian or offer easy alternatives. Along those lines, there is a plethora of dairy-free, wheat/gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, and nut-free recipes for any child born with allergies or other diet-related autoimmune condition. Cathe does use some unique ingredients that are popular within the health food movement, yet they are becoming easier to find, and could easily be omitted if you don't feel like seeking them out. The only thing that I think would help this book is a food allergy index.It was hard for me to believe that over 150 recipes were packaged into this easily manageable cookbook, but after perusing the contents I was sold. Each of my expecting friends will be getting a copy!"},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"This book is GREAT!!!

As I watch out what I eat myself, it was natural for me to wonder what would be suitable for fast growing babies.Although we can get a big picture from common sense and major parenting book, this book provides more detail in what nutiritious alternatives are possible in place of store bought baby food.I consult this book often before going to shop for food and continue to learn about diverse options in baby food.By the way, I didn't have any problem with finding ingredients in this book at local Coop."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I received this book to review, and I sure wish something like this had been available when my sons were vegetarian babies (now they are vegan teens).

A lot of the recipes include an ingredient called the \\"Sea Veg Mix\\" which seems like a seasoning concoction that the author has made up and includes in a lot of the recipes. The Sea Veg Mix includes kelp, hiziki, arame, wakame and kombu. What? Exactly, I have no idea what ingredients these are and where to buy them. And I'm not a novice in the kitchen. Even if you know what you are looking for, these aren't ingredients that you buy at your local grocery store. Also, a lot of the baby food recipes are pretty logical, just pureed or mashed vegetables or fruits. You can figure those out without this cookbook. I would have preferred a book that had recipes with ingredients that one already has in the kitchen or can easily obtain at the neighborhood grocery store. Unless, you live in a big city where all this stuff is readily available, then you won't have much use for this book. My main gripe is definitely the ingredients that these recipes require. Its tough enough to have to cook healthy meals for a family but to add the extra job of trekking all over the place to find the right ingredients for the recipes in this book just doesn't make sense."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"Informative book, but.....I do not believe it is right to be teaching \\"vegan\\" or \\"vegetarian\\" dietary habits for people to practice on their infant children. Children are in need of so many things in their beginning years, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. I bought this cookbook to learn how to make more natural and more healthy babyfood for our children. Not to learn how to avoid meat products and get a philosphy lesson on the principals of vegan and vegetarian diets.I am sure the author is very well educated, I am not questioning that, I just don't think we are on the same page. I also think that alot of the food ingredients are not available at the \\"corner grocery store\\" thus limiting the application of many of the recipes in our household."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I was very excited to start feeding my son solids.

The author preaches about the neccessity for organic and whole foods. While I think that we need to feed our children the best possible foods, I don't think that I need to be lectured to. I was looking for something easy, and I found something that made making my son a healthy meal more difficult. It almost makes me want to go and stock up on jarred foods.

My son in now 12 months and wants much more than breastmilk these days and this book has come to the rescue! So far the recipes are great, such as the veggie-brown rice pilaf, the hummus-avocado whole grain bread sandwich, the baby fish dinner, and the strawberry-banana UN-ice cream. My DS has loved each of these so far. It is so important to eat wholesome foods, especially while shaping young tastebuds. I was recently reminded of this as a collegue of mine told me that her four year old will only eat *gasp* hotdogs wrapped in bologna! He will eat at least four a day, and that's about it!

There are a lot of ideas and recipes for non-dairy sources of calcium.There were several recipes that my daughter liked when she was a year old but soon outgrew. Now at 2.5, when she is refusing to eat almost everything, there are still 3 recipes in here that she absolutely loves, and for those alone I'm very glad I bought this book. (The recipes she likes are vegetables with bread crumb topping, Almond Butter Noodles and nut butter chews. Even when she won't eat other vegetables, she'll gobble down broccoli with bread crumb topping and ask for seconds.)There are also some good recipes for healthy desserts (i.e. low sugar and even some nutritional content), which have been popular at family gatherings."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"I bought this book along with several others, including super baby food. I found this the easiest to get started. I think anyone making their own babyfood will research the process from several different sources and ultimately figure out their own system for how they want to feed their baby. One of the nice things about this book is that it has a wide variety of recipes for different age groups and doesn't subscribe to a rigid menu. Although some of the denser books are good resources, this is a book you can thumb through for ideas. It's the one i turn to most consistently."},{"Title":"Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love","review":"My family loves food, we are the farmers market type of shoppers, picking up heirloom carrots, tomoatoes, and raw garbanzo beans. With this in mind, we LOVE this little book. We learned a lot about different sources of quality nutrition for our son (who is now 13 months). Although, we don't use the book a lot anymore, it was a good starting point for finding high quality, nutritious ingredients for little meals. There are some recipes that call for nuts, so we just skipped those until my son was one. No big deal.If you want simple recipes like smashed carrots and puree peas... this is probably not for you.

I thought the simple recipes referred to being able to cook with what you have at home, and still make your toddler eat other things besides chicken nuggets. Well, this book is full of recipes that have things that are not in my home and not at my local grocery store - I guess I am just not a healthy eater, because I don't have seaweed, brown rice flour and etc. sitting in my pantry.I have a 4 month old and a 2 year old, so I thought I can use this book for some creative meal ideas, especially since I have been having major issues with getting my toddler to eat anything but bananas, chicken nuggets, and rice lately - hardly healthy eating. Well, the only recipe she likes as of now is the oatmeal nut pancakes - but even that she eats drenched in syrup, which I think defeats the whole purpose of serving the healthy meal. The other meals are wonderful but they are stock full of vegetables which my toddler is having problems eating. I put so much effort into gathering the ingredients (which are not always available at your local grocery store) only to watch my toddler spit out the food after taking one bite. So if your toddler likes to eat his/her veggies, does not mind tofu, or having rice flour, then this is a great book for you. It just was not what I hoped it would be - but then again, maybe there is no single book out there that can make your toddler to start liking everything at once :)"},{"Title":"Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the Americas","review":"trexler's study of preconquest sexuality is thorough and thought-provoking. he investigates countless indigenous and spanish sources to come up with a compelling argument that berdaches--indigenous males who cross-dressed and perfomed female sex and social roles--were part of the majority of indigenous cultures. he also demonstrates how those individuals were viewed by their peers and by the spanish, and how the spanish/european fear of homosexuality, specifically &quot;passive&quot; homosexuality, is responsible for the disappearance of the berdache. this book was highly readable for the more novice reader, but incredibly well documented (one hundred pages of notes) for the more academic reader. this book will likely go down as the definitive study on pre-conquest indigenous (homo)sexuality."},{"Title":"Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the Americas","review":"This is a book for you if, only if, you have a fundamental belief in sex as power and very little else. For me it's a dark interpretation of human culture and unwarranted. His theory - incidence of homosexuality has to do with power (and subjection, humiliation) or is primarily to be studied in those terms - is way too blanket across cultures for my trust; he seems to me to treat vastly different cultures as almost equivalent. The evidence he hangs on is often loose, and the fact naively given away in his sentence structure: that is, you can easily read through to: 'although there's not a lot of data on this point, my theory holds'.Sorry, my skin crawled; I have less negative beliefs. For your guidance, he follows Foucault, he scorns Walter Williams' The Spirit and the Flesh (too happy, too gay. I love this book).

Tarzan is much more the focal character in this book, rather than a sideline character, so that helps.Running around with his simian sidekick provides some comic relief, as he comes up against a couple of tinpot Caesars, manhandles one, overcomes in the arena, survives a siege, and topples some government.Definitely entertaining.\\"He rose from the throne and raised his hand for silence. The hum of voices ceased. \\"Caesar is dead, but upon someone of you must fall themantle of Caesar.\\"\\"Long live Tarzan! Long live the new Caesar!\\" cried one of the gladiators, and instantly every Sanguinarian in the room took up the cry.\\"Tarzan doesn't really fancy the job, so makes a suggestion that one of his martial Roman friends would fill the void nicely."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Lost Empire","review":"&quot;Tarzan and the Lost Empire&quot; is a typical Edgar Rice Burroughs story about the Lord of the Jungle where somebody disappears and Tarzan goes off into some uncharted part of Africa to rescue them from a lost city. This basic plot describes most Tarzan novels starting with the lost Atlantis colony of Opar in &quot;The Return of Tarzan.&quot; What makes &quot;Tarzan and the Lost Empire&quot; rather different from the rest is that the lost city this time around happens to be a couple of outposts from the Roman Empire, still up and running almost two thousand years later.The person who needs to be rescued in this 12th Tarzan novel is Erich von Harben, the son of a German medical missionary who is one of the Ape Man's old friends. Tarzan tracks Erich to a lost valley where he discovers the Roman outposts. Castra Sanguinarius is ruled by Sublatus, the cruel Emperor of the West, while Castrum Mare is ruled by the tyrant Validus Augustus, the Emperor of the East. Of course Tarzan ends up in the arena of Castra Sanguinarius fighting for his life, while young Erich faces a similar fate in the arena of Castrum Mare. the ape-man was seeking to rescue him. This is standard ERB fare but the idea that all Roman outposts set up despotic emperors is laying it on a bit thick. Still, there are a few noble Romans running around for Tarzan to bond with during this adventure.Burroughs did write a few historical adventures along with those set on exotic worlds or lost lands, so it would have been interesting to see him do a tale set in Ancient Rome, but this was as close as he got. As always with these pot-boilers, the principle is that the less of them you have read the more likely you are to be impressed by this one (and visa versa)."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Lost Empire","review":"This volume in the Tarzan series appealed to me because I've got a soft spot for lost civilization tales.The jungle lord is approached by one of his civilized (European) friends, and asked to search a vast canyon where the guy's son, Erich Von Harben, is believed to have disappeared in search of a \\"lost tribe of Israel.\\" What Von Harben found instead were two rival Roman city-states, perfectly preserved since the canyon was colonized in the 1st Century. Not a bad find, actually, and Von Harben also discovers love at first sight with a noble Roman girl, as can only happen in a classic pulp. But alas, not everything is sunshine and puppies in this anachronistic canyon, and Von Harben finds himself in prison due to corrupt politicians and their paranoia.Tarzan, who entered the other end of the canyon, has also suffered a mishap that landed him in prison in the rival city-state (one is Castra Sanguinarious and one is Castrum Mare). Both Tarzan and Von Harben find allies among the political prisoners in their respective cities, but time is running out for the Ape Man to rescue Von Harben before the tyrannical Caesar has the suspicious outsider killed for sport in the arena.Burroughs was fairly enlightened for the time in which he wrote (the first edition of Lost Empire was printed in the 1920s), but I still cringed a bit at the underlying attitude toward black Africans. You've got to take those factors into account when you read something this old. Something else I struggled with were the names. So many characters had authentic-sounding Roman names my head was swimming trying to keep track of them. Another annoyance was due, I think, to the fact that this book was originally written as serialized pulp--each episode a given length according to the requirements of the periodical it was written for, with a cliffhanger ending to be continued next issue: Tarzan came off almost skitzophrenic due to his changing opinions about whether he could escape and when he should attempt escape, etc. And one final criticism I'll offer is that for a pulp tale about a feral savage raised by gorillas, in an adversarial position vis-a-vis hordes of sword-wielding legionaires, there wasn't nearly as much action as you might expect. And what action there was disappointed me a bit--particularly in the arena.I must give credit where it's due, though: when Tarzan is paired against a gladiator, his goose is cooked until the fortuitous intervention of a newfound Roman friend. Tarzan is a bad dude, but not invincible. He can't match up against a master of single combat who lives or dies by the sword just because he is the hero of the story, knife or no knife; ape-like agility or no ape-like agility. Weapons and all other factors being equal, the only individual who could have stood a chance against an experienced gladiator was another experienced gladiator, and Burroughs knew this. Thank-you, Edgar. No eye-rolling from me on this aspect.This concept had heaps of potential, but fell a bit short in my opinion. I still hope to read Tarzan and the Ant Men some day.Henry Brown is the author of the heroic fantasies Tales of the Honor Triad, as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"It's been 20 years since I read up much on the paleoanthropology, so I thought I'd get up to date and read some of the recent books on the subject. One thing I noticed right away, compared to when I was last studying the subject in college, was how our evolutionary tree was now much \\"bushier,\\" compared to what we knew back then. Now it's thought that there were at least 3 or 4 different species of Australopithecines, and the same goes for Homo habilis, and H. erectus.Besides this book, so far I've read Paul Jordan's Neanderthal, Richard Leakey's The Origins of Humankind, and Richard Klein's The Dawn of Human Culture. They're all excellent books, but Klein's and Tattersall's were both published in the last year, so they're the most recent, and include important information on the most recent finds, such as Ardipithecus ramidus, although the Sahelanthropus tchadensis discovery by the M. Brunet expedition was so recent it unfortunately doesn't appear in either book.This book is the most beauifully illustrated of the four books I've read so far. The full-color plates of the different skulls really allow you to connect the comparative anatomy as discussed in the text with the actual features. The book has very nice, glossy paper, so the photos look great, but that also means its the most expensive book of the four. Tattersall's writing is excellent and never gets dry or technical, and the Klein book is also extremely well written. Klein's book also has very clear explanations of high-tech dating methods such as radioisotope dating, thermoluminscence, ESR or electron spin resonance dating, and so on, and he also discusses their strengths and weaknesses, and the technical problems and limitations involved in using them, which I liked.The book also has an excellent introductory chapter in which the author discusses the early history of comparative fossil anatomy, including the important work of Blumenbach, who founded the science and revised and expanded on many of Linnaeus's notions about taxonomy, especially the definition of the genus Homo, and our species, Homo sapiens.The Leakey book is now almost 10 years old, and although somewhat dated, it's still worth reading, as its focus is different from these two books. It's not primarily about the comparative anatomy of the different fossil finds so much as what the changes in anatomy from the pre-homonids to the homonids meant for our physiology and ultimately our life-style. Leakey uses the fossil record to show that such human characteristics as a prolonged, helpless infancy, a more active and athletic way of life, delayed sexual maturity, the development of finer tool-making, and the advent of complex social relationships and sophisticated language, all arose during the transition from the Australopithecines to the more advanced Homo habilis and Homo erectus.Neanderthal, by Paul Jordan, is the most technical and in some ways the most difficult to read, but it's the most detailed and in-depth discussion I've seen on this important homonid and its relatives. Jordan does have some chapters on the other pre-homonid and homonid evlutionary lines, but you don't get to these until you're halfway into the book, so the main emphasis is definitely on Neanderthal and the major discoveries there. Therefore, I would recommend you read either Klein's or Tattersall's book before this one to get a better idea of all the earlier and later species before tackling this book, since it's so heavily Neanderthal-weighted.Overall, however, all of these are excellent books, and each has its own pros and cons. My preference, and the ones I enjoyed the most, were the present volume and Klein's, partly because their recent publication allows them to discuss the most recent finds, but also I found them to be the most readable and well-written.Hope my little comparison review of recent paleoanthropology books helps, and happy book buying and reading!"},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"&quot;Extinct Humans&quot; is a fascinating account of human evolution, extraordinarily illustrated with crisp, powerful photographs of fossils which drive home the point that these are the remains of actual beings who have inhabited this world before us, whether they were our direct ancestors or instead &quot;cousins&quot; to our own line of descent.Tattersall and Schwartz have studied not just the literature on the subject, but virtually all the fossils themselves, giving them a perhaps unmatched command of the variations in the homanid fossil record. They argue persuasively in a clear, well-organized text that modern Homo sapiens is the sole survivor of the many distinct homanid species which have existed over the past two million years, that most of the fossils which have been found represent not ancestors of our own specific line, but relatives which split off in different directions before ultimately coming to a literal dead end. Their discussion of the interaction between Neaderthals and modern humans in Europe (and possibly between Homo erectus and modern humans in southeast Asia) is especially absorbing, delving into questions of technological change, the emergence of symbolic thought, and the creation of language.The study of human evolution has, well, evolved enormously in the 35 years I have been interested in the topic. &quot;Extinct Humans&quot; is, to my way of thinking, today's best summary and analysis of current knowledge."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"Tracing the course of human evolution is fraught with pitfalls. Each newly discovered fossil is scrupulously assessed for its place on the human family tree. Locating it properly is fundamental in understanding how evolution achieved Homo sapiens. Tattersall and Schwarz conduct us on a tour of the history of evolutionary thinking and detail the analysis procedures. The expedition is thoughtfully conceived, offering superb vistas and rewarding discoveries.Over half a century ago, E. Mayr and T. Dobzhansky developed a \\"grand synthesis\\" of human evolution. According to the authors, the earlier workers postulated a \\"linear\\" path of hominid evolution. This analysis forged much of evolutionary thinking for decades. Dissenters, however, were always present. Nearly every book on human evolution spends some time describing the conflict between the \\"lumpers\\" and the \\"splitters\\". Viewing the many of the hominid fossils as but individual variations of general types, the lumpers find abhorrent the complexity resulting from too many species. To them, the family tree is a linear trunk with but a few branches. In contrast, the splitters see fossil variations reflecting a host of unearthed new hominid species. They feel that turning the human family tree into a frizzy bush gives the emergence of Homo sapiens an even more unique place in Nature than it already enjoys.Tattersall and Schwarz produce a remarkable case for additional splitting. Morphology, the classifying of characteristics of anatomical features, is their operating system. In this book we are offered one of the most complete morphological analyses of human fossils in print. Dismissing the idea of the human family tree portraying a linear sequence of events, they examine in minute detail the bones unearthed to date. Eyebrow ridges, chin sutures and cheek form are critically reassessed in building their case. Homo erectus, once considered a world girdling precursor to modern humanity, demands reconsideration, according to the authors.The text of this book might prove a bit daunting to newcomers to anthropology or anatomy. Rest assured, however, that this book will reward any reader with but minimal perseverance. You may need to engage in a bit of page flipping in understanding some points. The lavish illustrations on those pages will reward the curious; photographs and drawings clarifying what might seem obscure or unfamiliar. Indeed, this is one of the first popular books illustrating areas often remanded to text in other general books on this topic. The authors deserve the fullest accolades for their efforts in providing intelligible text and graphics. Their concluding presentation of a new family tree for human ancestors is an excellent summation of their assertions.The authors spend an unexpected amount of ink dwelling on the idea that Neanderthal is not a member of Homo sapiens. It's difficult to understand why they feel the need to flog this so severely, since this concept has been out of mainstream paleoanthropology for some time. Since they fail to identify the target of their sniping, when so many others holding contrary views are disposed of elsewhere, we're at a loss to comprehend their vehemence. The assumption follows that since this is an area of Tattersall's expertise, he's simply taken this opportunity to caper a little. Since the explanation is so clear and accompanied by such magnificent illustrative material, we may forgive them a bit of prancing and enjoy the performance.While the authors build a convincing case, it abides on a shaky foundation. In seeking support for new hominid species, the omit a definition of speciation. Species are organisms that reproduce successfully. Yet within any complex species, wide variations exist to trap the morphologist. A glance at any kennel with display a wide variation in bones, hair covering and colour, but the inmates remain dogs. While they argue that geographic distribution contributes to speciation [which it does], there's simply no evidence that the human diaspora generated new species. Quite the reverse in modern humans. From this, it seems theirassault on Mayr and Dobzhansky's thesis seems misplaced. No matter how many variations on the theme occur in the fossil record, the lineage of humanity does follow a path into the distant past. As Darwin grieved, the fossil record remains too sparse to trace that path in detail at this time.Their omission of defining speciation detracts but little from the value of this book. The detailed information and the quality illustrative material makes it a rich addition to the library of anyone delving into the mysteries of human evolution. It's a costly addition, but well worth the investment to those concerned with learning their place in Nature. Their case may be flawed, but their evidence and how they present it is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"According to Reuters of December 5, 2000, French and Kenyan scientists unearthed fossilized remains of mankind's earliest known ancestor that is at least 6 million years old, and the find is not only much older than any else previously known but is also in a more advanced stage of evolution. More news from Reuters on March 21, 2001, and we find out that Meave and Louise Leakey are ready to shake the world with their discovery of not only a new species of early human but a new genus as well.These new findings, as well as many others, support the emerging theory that rather than being linear, the human family tree had many branches, and that present-day humans shared ancestors with other human beings who eventually became extinct.Long-existed dogmas of paleoanthropology supporting the linear model of evolution are about to fall down, and considering this, the importance of the book by Tattersall and Schwartz can hardly be overestimated.First of all, of course, the authors provide a surprisingly thorough insight into the existing knowledge of known fossils, and the job done by them is very impressive: Tattersall and Schwartz have obviously studied not only the literature and photos, they have got into a much deeper investigation, discussing a very little detail of an original fossil, and at the same time, with a help of perfect pictures and drawings, giving readers a nice chance to look at the reason of the reconsideration of the existing fossil evidence. The details of morphology brought by the authors into the light are striking and strongly supportive to their point of view. What, however, may seem to be a little disappointment is that Tattersall and Schwartz do not lead us to no less interesting field of studies, namely, the stratigraphic evidence, so we unluckily have less chance to find out more about the geological aspects of all those numerous finds, and, of course, the analysis of the sites' stratigraphy (as a part of the complicated fossils dating process) is somehow left aside.What's, however, much more important is the book objectively means a clear turn-point in the history of the official anthropology, and paleoanthropology as well. What previously could only be found in the books by Cremo and Thomson, particularly, the possibility of coexistence of different human species at a time in some extended periods of the past, now is clearly stated by officially recognized scientists. No more simplistic approaches to viewing the human evolution, no more frozen-in-time doctrines and narrow-minded announcements. We are moving forward, no matter how deep we were buried under the anthropological dogmas of the last century, and, who knows, maybe soon we will find out that human evolution looks perhaps not even as a bushy tree, but rather as a wood of trees, and it is hardly believable that at the moment we are left with only one branch of a tree."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"The cover blurb mentions that the authors have \\"personally inspected every available fossil\\". This is the great strength of the book - the only strength, really. The discussions of morphology are very detailed - excessively detailed, IMHO - while the contributions from other disciplines are mentioned briefly or omitted altogether.When I bought this book, I was looking for a general overview of modern views on the human evolution, including the recent genetic data, recent climatological data from ice core drilling, paleoecology etc. Paleoclimatology gets about one page's worth (albeit a very interesting one); molecular genetic analysis gets the briefest of mentions in the last chapter, while authors fill page upon page with tedious descriptions of who presented what fossil at which conference and how the authorities of the time reacted to the discovery. In discussion of the age of the Nariokotome fossil (pg 134), instead of telling how the analysis was done, authors merely say \\"after crunching the data in various ways, Smith concluded...\\". Sometimes it feels like the authors neither know nor care for anything outside their field of expertise (morphology!).Some of the authors' obsessions become obstacles to understanding the text. For instance, the authors insist that morphology is more important than fossil dating - OK, point well taken. However, as a visual learner, I would have found it extremely helpful to see a chart or timeline with approximate dates of species' existance - but nooooo, they won't do it. They'd rather spend another ten pages discussing morphology or bashing Mayr-Dobzhansky.Finally, it felt like the manuscript never saw an editor. There are run-on sentences, subordinate clauses that do not agree etc. etc.After talking so long about what this book is not, maybe I should say what it is: it's a well-printed, beautifully illustrated atlas of fossils. It's a good addition to your library if you are already an anthropologist. Otherwise, it could be used as a complement to a more thorough text."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"This is the most beautifully illustrated of the four books on paleontology I've read recently. The full-color plates really allow you to connect the comparative anatomy discussed in the text with the visible features. Tattersall and Schwartz write well and the text never gets dry or technical. Richard Klein's The Dawn of Human Culture is excellent also and has very clear explanations of high-tech dating methods such as radioisotope dating, thermoluminesence, ESR or electron spin resonance dating, and magnetic-field dating, and he's careful to discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and the technical difficulties and limitations involved in using them.A major strength of the book is discussing the changes in paleontologists' approach to the taxonomy. An example of a major change is Homo habilis, thought to be the first true tool-using homonid. Consider what happened with one of the so-called \\"type fossils.\\" Type fossils are the ones that the original definition of the species came from. The problem concerned the type fossils of Homo rudolphensis, known as ER 1470, which were quite famous. H. rudolphensis was an important hominid find with a larger cranial capacity than homo habilis, and was considered a more evolved, later species. It's mostly known from an upper jaw and palate and portion of skull. However, it was discovered that the upper jaw mates almost exactly with OH 64, an Australopithecine lower jaw from Olduvai Gorge (OH means Olduvai Homonid). If this is true, Homo rudolphensis disappears as a species and OH 64 no longer belongs in Australopithecus. As the authors point out, that was especially ironic since ER 1470, although it's still currently assigned to H. rudolphensis, was originally put in H. habilis and was the find which finally convinced scientists that there was something to define the species after all, despite the chaos that had reigned up to that time.Their difficulties didn't stop there. Because of the enormous influence of evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr and the population geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, whose ideas caused paleoanthropologists to think in terms of a single, evolving homonid line from Australopithecus to Homo erectus to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens, paleontologists were for many years reluctant to create new species for their finds, despite the obvious difficulty of fitting so many anatomically distinct fossils into a single species of Homo habilis. As a result, H. habilis became a virtual dumping group for various fossil finds, and only in the last decade were all the different finds reconsidered.The authors include superb discussions of the fossil and cultural (tool-making) evidence for Homo heidelbergensis and Homo antecessor, considered to be the last common ancestor of the homonid line which led to H. sapiens and Neanderthal. H. heidelbergensis, they point out, also has become a convenient dumping ground for a number of fossils 300,000 to 600,000 years old which have a cranial capacity of around 1200 cc, very close to modern norms. It had robust limbs but more or less modern bodily proportions.H. antecessor is associated with fossils as old as 789,000 years. It's associated with not so much stone tool-making, which remained relatively primitive, but with evidence at two different sites in Europe of advances for home construction. One site shows a large home constructed of planted saplings drawn together at the top, and the other shows clear evidence of a dwelling with a permanent hearth. Hence, H. antecessor is thought to have domesticated fire.Finally, there's an introductory chapter discussing the early history of comparative fossil anatomy, including the important work of Blumenbach, who founded the science and improved on many of Linnaeus's ideas, especially the definition of the genus Homo, and our own species, Homo sapiens."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"We were all taught in school that human evolution was linear -- Australopithicus evolved into Homo erectus who evolved into a form of Homo sapiens, or us. But all other animals have numerous speciations and dead ends. Why are humans different?The authors answer: We aren't. They discuss, in detail, the history of thought in human evolution. They go through the fossils, showing many of them in glossy color photos. They conclude that we having only one hominid species around is not the way it has always been -- we are just the ones who won out, and probably eliminated our rivals through competition or other means.Overall, a great book for anybody interested in human evolution."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"I think after the Scientific American review, I was expecting a sort of magisterial overview of the state of the art. Instead, this is a lucid and even entertaining argument for what appears from the text to be a rather extreme (minority) position along the lumper vs splitter spectrum.Tattersall and Schwartz's basic premise seems to be that hominid evolution should be just as bushy as the evolution of all other animals. Their hobbyhorse is the way that notions of the Ascent Of Man (the Great Chain Of Being) have hobbled paleoanthropology and caused it to lump far too many of our extinct cousins under the more emotionally resonant Ancestor rubric. So far so unexceptional to any reader of Gould et al, and they certainly make a good case for assigning various specimens to their own species, but all too often they present not even a strawman version of the opposition's reasoning.This is a shame, because the book is well written, beautifully produced, and accompanied by fine photographs and drawings.

This is NOT a book about &quot;extinct humans&quot;, it's a book about all the people who look for and find bones of extinct humans.The book gives (in excruciating detail) an account of all the expeditions that found human remains throughout the world. For example, you learn more about Ramond Dart's life and his expeditions than you ever cared to know. You also hear about all the disagreements and personal animosities various scientists have had with each other over the past few hundred years.What you don't learn about is the subjects themselves, the so-called &quot;extinct humans.&quot; You lean nothing new about homo erectus, nothing new about homo habilis, nothing new about neandertals, etc. You go away not knowing any more about human evolution than you did before and you feel like you've just wasted your time and money.This book should be retitled: &quot;All The Details About The People Who Look For Extinct Humans.&quot;"},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"Paleoanthropologists are a little sensitive about their field of study and how it is overshadowed by genetics and evolutionary biology. As such we can forgive Ian Tatersall for the parts of the book where advocacy for his position becomes a bit strident.The basic argument of EXTINCT HUMANS is that throughout the evolutionary history of hominids there have been at least 15 species of humans, some of which coexisted. All but Homo sapiens are extinct. Naturally there is no argument about the extinction of other hominids, but other aspects of this position are not universally accepted. There are many other scientists that argue for a linear descent of man from Ardipithecus ramidus through Australiopithicus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus to us. These opposing camps are called &quot;splitters&quot; and &quot;lumpers&quot;. Splitters see a great number of less variable species wheras lumpers see few species with greater variation. Ian Tattersall is one of the better known spokepersons for the splitters. As Jerry Seinfeld would say 'not that there's anything wrong with that', and we should applaud the use of these names by scientists as a good sign of their not taking themselves too seriously. That's on the surface though because beneath the cute names are some very strongly argued positions.What seems to bother Mr Tattersall and what comes through in his book is that the linear descent lumper theory owes a lot to two scientists who were not even paleontologists. He frequently refers to Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky as the source of this misguided theory and in explaining why the splitters have historically been rejected he says: &quot;how could anyone, much less a bunch of paleoanthropologists who were not equipped with the supposedly more biologically informed backgrounds of Mayr and Dobzhansky, disagree with them?&quot; He says that &quot;No one could. Or, at least, no one would who didn't want to be accused of being anti-evolutionary.&quot;There is too much of this washing of paleontological dirty laundry here and it is in fact rather unnecessary as recent fossil finds are much more supportive of Tattersall's views. The recent discovery of Kenyanthropus platyops by Meave Leakey - the 3rd generation of that family of Kenyan hominid hunters has shown that there are in fact not only previously unknown human species but this one might also be a new genus.Where this book excells is in it's portraying and explaining the fossil record of humans. There are numerous figures, charts, maps and photos. The chapters are thorough with their explanations of the different stages of our evolutionary history. Chapter 6 subtitled the &quot;Great Diaspora&quot; looks at theories of how and when Europe was colonized. Such discussions naturally look at the &quot;African Eve&quot; theory of hominid origins and this book spends sufficient time on it. In summary you could say Mr Tattersall takes an extreme taxonomic view of human evolution; somewhat like a compulsive compiler of lists or an obsession with putting each thing in it's proper place. This is best illustrated with his species classification of Homo fossils as follows: erectus (Asians), antecessor (Europeans) and ergaster (Africans).Critics point out that humans are more variable morphologically than any other primate species but this variation is within group. Geneticists argue also that genetic variation is much less than morphological variation. Together this seems to say, Kenyanthropus platyops notwithstanding, lumpers with their arguments in favor of fewer and more variable species still have a point.The irony with science writing is that for every interpretation offered and truth discovered there is always another opinion. It certainly applies here and it means we cant be satisfied with the single view that EXTINCT HUMANS offers. It makes for some further interesting reading."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"The book by Tattersall and Schwartz is NOT the ultimate book on human evolution you might expect. The book lingers indecidedly between two essentially incompatible options: one would be to give a comprehensive historical account of the scientific exploration of human origins, starting from the discovery of the first Neanderthal in Feldhofer cave up to the most recent findings in Africa and Europe. The other option would be to give a chronological overview of human development as seen by scientists today. However, Tattersall and Schwartz attempt to combine both approaches in a unified way. This way, the tale of human evolution gets quite obscured by the history of its exploration. Nevertheless, the book provides a lot of interesting information, and provided you are ready to invest the money plus a considerable amount of time, the book can be read with a lot of profit. However, the book is definitely flawed by the absence of timetables, by VERY poor references to the scientific literature, and also by its somewhat careless style. Also, the book is noteworthy for its many original illustrations (yes, this IS a beautiful book), but there are not enough of these pictures, and the quality of the pictures is often not quite sufficient: Some important fossil specimens discussed in the text are not shown (such as the Heidelberg specimen), some pictures are simply reproduced in a format too small to discern features discussed in the text (consider, e.g., the picture showing the famous Lucy), and many pictures are taken at an angle that makes comparison with other, related (or, for that matter, unrelated) specimens impossible. Consider, for example, the discussion of the mysterious Homo habilis and the associated pictures. However, the presentation of the Neanderthals in word and picture is excellent and quite comprehensive. The theory that is pushed forward by the book is that human evolution has lead to as many dead ends as the evolution of any other &quot;animal&quot;. This theory is quite plausible and well demonstrated in the text. To sum up, a nice book, interesting, a bit muddled, but nevertheless informative, but NOT the definite account you might have been waiting for."},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"Tattersall and co-author Jeffrey Schwartz argue that more of the fossil record should recognize more hominid genera as human.

He doesn't slight those in his and related professions who hold different views, but presents those arguments with his rebuttals.On the whole, I've read four Tattersall books and they have all been excellent. I recommend him highly to anyone who wants a better understanding of where we came from.Jerry"},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"Of the several books that I have read recently on paleoanthropology and human evolution, I find this one the most helpful. This is partially because the authors are anatomists, systematists and pragmatists, largely untouched by 'political-correctness' and partially because I agree with them.Human evolution has been characterized by the development of multiple hominid species over the past several million years. These species can be loosely grouped into gracile and robust australopithecines; Homo habilis; H. erectus; H. ergaster; H. heidelbergensis; H. neanderthalensis; H. sapiens and probably a number of others. The authors are open-minded about the Iberian 'Los Huesos' site, but believe these numerous fossils may represent even another separate human species.Part of the problem with a systematic segregation of the various human species has to do with morphologic differences based on sex, age, individual variation and subspecies [racial] variation. The same species also tend to vary with time, which is a form of subspecific variation. The problem is multiplied by the fact that, with the exception of H. neanderthalensis in which DNA has been recovered, species separation is based almost entirely on bony features i.e. soft tissues are long gone. It's a little like separating lions and tigers based strictly on bony features. It would be tough.The authors are tentative about the exact sequence of species that led to H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis but are convinced that these groups are separate species and cousins rather than descendants one from the other. They believe that early hominid species may have faced sequential extinctions via the usual natural processes but that the extinctions of later human species may have been, directly or indirectly, the consequence of the later and culturally evolved 'varieties' of H. sapiens, which interestingly and quite probably significantly, arose in Europe.H. sapiens and H. neanderthals overlapped timewise and geographically in Europe and Western Asia. It also seems true that H. sapiens overlapped in a similar way with H. erectus in southeast Asia. In both cases the outcome was the same with only H. sapiens remaining.I was fascinated by the authors' descriptions of possible early H. sapiens and H. neanderthal interactions in Israel. They seemed to overlap for tens of thousands of years, a time when both groups used similar stone technologies. When sapiens developed more sophisticated technologies, Neanderthals mysteriously disappeared. Something similar may have happened in Europe. At virtually the same time that sapiens was producing magnificent art, Neanderthals disappeared from the surface of the Earth. This doesn't mean that Sapiens and Neanderthals lived in peaceful coexistence at any time but it is entirely conceivable that there was an ancient 'balance of power' as long as both groups had similar technologies. Once Sapiens graduated to superior technologies and techniques, Neanderthals seem to have--perhaps very gradually--disappeared.The authors postulate that something happened rather suddenly to sapiens' populations that caused them to produce superior weapons and art. They don't know what this may have been but it may have been complex language, something the Neanderthals may have lacked.Because of the date of this book, the authors don't include recent information about the fascinating H. florensis find although I would be interested in their take. For the same reason they don't include the very recent information about the supposed presence of Neanderthal genetic material in our, Sapiens, genome. I would comment, though, that because of recent common ancestor, we will share more--probably far more--than 99% of our DNA with Neanderthal. Interpretation of data of interbreeding following the full development of Sapiens and Neanderthals must be cautious. It also must be confirmed by multiple laboratories. It is not impossible, at least, even if the two species were terrified of one another. It is not inconceivable that, either by predation or combat, a Neanderthal infant may have been 'captured' by Sapiens hunters and given to a woman who had recently lost a child. If such a Neanderthal were raised up in such a tribe, it might very well have been accepted and interbreeding would then be a real possibility.One thing I want to mention, in hopes that the authors will read this. Much has been made about early--and later--hominid meat scavenging. It may very well have occurred but there is an important proviso. I'll give a personal experience. I was raising quail and pheasants and began to have an unusual die off. I autopsied a bird and found the crop full of maggots. I knew instantly what happened--the birds had died of botulism. Birds and many mammals have Clostrium botulinum [bacteria] in their guts. Under anaerobic conditions, such as following death, these bacteria produce a potent toxin. A bird or two had died of other causes and I hadn't noticed them. Clostridia in their guts produced deadly poison. Flies laid eggs on the dead birds and the developing fly larvae [maggots] became contaminated with the same botulism poison. Healthy birds came by, pecked at the maggots and poisoned themselves--much like taking poison pills. More birds died and the process continued....Human beings [H. sapiens] are exquisitely sensitive to botulism poisoning. Most scavengers, rather understandably, aren't. A turkey vulture, for example, was 10,000 times the tolerance for botulism toxin as does a human. It is even conceivable that the foul odor we detect on rotting meat is nature's way of telling us to 'stay away.' Natural selection.Most of the carnivora are very much meat scavengers. A wolf, African lion or leopard will eat things that smell so bad as to turn your stomach. Predictably they will have a high tolerance for botulism toxin. So what are the possibilities:1. some species of early hominids were highly botulism tolerant [unlikely in my opinion].2. hominids, both early and late, would scavenge only from fresh carcasses [this, no doubt, did occur but is attended by the considerable danger from the carnivores that had brought the dead animal down].3. hominids, both early and late, didn't depend much on scavenging. They killed most of their own meat.Comments?"},{"Title":"Extinct Humans","review":"No matter how much you know, or how little, this is the book you have to read.

The format and illustrations are excellent, and the book proceeds on the issues with dispatch. One need not agree entirely to find the book espousing a clear point of view otherwise in diminuendo. The review of Dawkins, and the authors' reply can be found at the book's website, extincthumans.com. The authors viewpoint challenges the view of linear descent by pointing to the branching of the genus Homo into many species. The implication is of processes of extinction in the relations of these species. The book also brings in Schwarz's theory as expounded in his Sudden Origins. The result seems to challenge the Synthesis itself as seen in the views of such as Dobzhansky.The viewpoint expressed is important enough to deserve direct recommendation, while at the same time one feels complelled to register a personal reaction that finds such books as category unable to produce a real theory of evolution, with this inability highlighted all the more in such a clear account. For one thing, the record suggests that while competition between the branches of man results in extinction of some of those branches this is a process that occurs after the basic evolutionary differentiation, as with modern man and the Neanderthal. In general one simply has to ask, where did we get man from at all. At the end there are some speculative suggestions about the source of an unknown major innovation, perhaps connected with language. Yet how is this possible in the time frame indicated? In any case it should be clear we do not have a theory of man's descent, the more so as Darwin's view is bypassed here. One of the last pictures in the book is of wooden flutes from ca. 30 kyr, and we must wonder indeed at the sudden great flowering of homo sapiens at the beginning of the last stage of his emergence. One has to wonder if the major core of the theory is not entirely lacking, for these cultural indications of art at the highest level are seen in history to be associated with something quite different from selectionist evolution. Finally, even if linear descent fails, it does not follow there is no directionality to evolution. These branching processes do not exclude some unknown process of discontinuous evolution leading beyond this differentiation.

This book addresses a common sense approach to life not only for the addict, but for friends and family of addicts as well. Anyone who reads this book will be moved by the stories contained within, if they have been affected by prescriptions drugs or not. I have used the advice in this book in dealing with the addicts I have encountered. Many have shown interest in reading Ms. Mogil's book and attending RxA meetings.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Swallowing a Bitter Pill","review":"If you suspect(or know) that you or someone you love has a problem with prescription and/or over the counter medication then this is a must read for the addict as well as those who love them. In reading what I feel is 99% of substance abuse literature available, including medical and clinical sourcebooks this is the only one that truly focuses on RX abuse. Not to say that NA and AA are not wonderful and very much needed programs,but to many,myself included feel they cant relate to the people and stories shared in the meetings. This is the first book of its kind to foucs not only on RX abuse but on the person as a whole. There is a definite need for attention to Prescription Drug abuse and more importantly the Prescription drug abuser, and this book is the perfect start for those who wish to lead a life free from addiction.

As an addict you dont feel there is anyone else like \\"you\\", but after reading this book you feel a support, because you know that others have and are feeling the same.

I think everyone should read it that has a problem or knows someone with one, but also just to familiarize themselves with the dangers of prescription and over the counter drugs, because the most normal of people can get caught up and out of control before you know it.

Unlike the usual humourless depictions, this book goes for depth instead of decibel level, mind over melodrama. It also includes some oft-ignored perspectives such as that of a birthfather, birth-grandparents, adoptive grandparents and adoptees whose reunion stories are not the spangly stuff of the 6 o'clock news.

This novel delves most principally on a delicate and obscure relationship between Fowler and Alden Pyle, a Harvard educated young and modest Bostonian who is entering this land as a greenhorn who soberly encounters his \\"first job\\" with open eyes in regard to business, social circles as well as women. Fowler is almost the opposite, a has-been journalist whose basic aspiration is to write as little as possible to keep his meal ticket alive, and use as many wakening hours to smoking opium pipes filled and served by indigenous beauties who are half his age.Fowler, full of vices and bad moral character, at least can perceive his own imperfections well - something that his counterpart cannot. And, this is where the book drifts to places which we do not think it will go.The inexact temporal procession of this book takes us back in time and forward in time, sometimes by chapter (other times by clumps of chapters), between the defining moments of the novel: Before and after Pyle's death. Fowler is caught up in the investigation of the untimely death (murder) as the two very different men had one love - beautiful and abiding Phuong.Not until one occasion arises does the ordinarily stupored Fowler awaken. People are dying all around him. But, that is not a problem. He awakens when one day he witnesses innocent women and children sacrificed. Bombs are being left in public places to kill others so as to infuriate the masses about Communists - only the delivery of the bombs is not by Communist plot. Instead, it is the foe of Communism, a wicked general, who sacrifices his own people so as to increase his personal value, make his cause more celebrated, and make him a personal leader in the otherwise fully doomed society which all involved people know will succumb to Communism.This book is great in contrasting a young well-educated American idealist with a middle-aged street-smart cynical Brit. The dialogue is superb. And, the mystery-like following of Pyle's death is alluring."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Given the history of Southeast Asia (the former \\"French Indochina\\"), it's interesting that Greene has chosen a Brit to square off against an idealistic American.Is that because the British world view is Graham's professional voice? Is it because of the \\"Special Relationship\\" between the United Kingdom and the United States to which politicians on \\"both sides of the pond\\" constantly refer, making Fowler's reactions to Pyle and his ultimate decision all the more riveting? Is it due to the fact that, at the time Greene wrote this powerful novel, the sun was starting to set on the British Empire and Greene wanted to draw a contrast between his own country's slowly waning influence and America's post-war ascendancy?Casting a Frenchman in place of Fowler's character certainly would have been more historically on-point and could have led to even more friction with Pyle, although readers in both Britain and America might have found that character less sympathetic, and might therefore have been less troubled by some of the final developments in the story.But, regardless of the citizenship of Greene's colonialist, \\"The Quiet American\\" very artfully explores the important issue of the point at which an individual feels he is compelled to act on his core convictions, even in the face of strong indebtedness to another human being."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Set during the French War in Vietnam, \\"The Quiet American\\" is a multifaceted story told in the words of Thomas Fowler, a cynical British correspondent and one of the novel's two main characters. The story involves a struggle between Fowler and Pyle, an American undercover operative and Fowler's romantic rival. Pyle and Fowler hold opposing views of the war, love, God, and democracy. Whatever matters to man, they disagree about. Fowler, whose vision of reality stifles his belief in ideals, emerges as a romantic and ideological rival of Pyle, whose ideals blind him to reality. America's Cold War policy in Southeast Asia is critically presented in the person of Pyle. Masterfully written, Graham Greene confronts us with two flawed, stereotypical characters and leaves us to determine the hero and the villain. I still have not made up my mind. A work which can leave the reader in such a quandary is a great work of art. Read and form your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"No doubt Mr. Greene is among the very best politcial writers ever, and this is probably his best political novel, eerily predicting events of many years later. His locale descriptions, and psychic feel for his characters make all his books worthwhile. The &quot;Quiet&quot; American, a young and naive Ivy Leaguer, is convinced his modern ideas can save Vietnam from inevitable chaos. Needless to say, he comes to a very rude awakening. Another great classic in the world of Graham Greene!"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"It is interesting to read books by an author in the reverse order, last to first. We can see any profound transformations especially when it comes to religion. In \\"The Quiet American\\" our protagonist is an atheist,unlike others who follow in Graham Greene's later great works, like, The Heart of the Matter, The End of an Affair and The Honorary Counsel.Fowler, a middle age journalist for a British newspaper, is in love with a girl, set in 1955 Vietnam. The French were fighting to keep control of this far east colony and Americans were arriving to strike a balance between the colonial power and the communists. Enter Pyle, the quiet American, a kind hearted Harvard graduate, with good intentions, working as a liaison for American Economic Council, a cover. Fowler is taken in by Pyle's innocence, his youth, enthusiasm, at the same time totally disappointed and upset that he is in love with his girl. When a bomb goes off, with Pyle's complicity, and kills innocent people, he tells Fowler they died for a good cause, democracy, a precursor to those famous words spoken by an American commander in 60's \\" We had to destroy the village in order to save It.\\". Fowler is outraged at this atrocity. When the conspirators approach Fowler, who had been a neutral observer all along, now is torn between friendship and the courage to take sides for a cause. His French colleague had once told him \\"You are here and you have to take sides sooner or later.\\"A great read. Greene exposes the hypocrisy of West's mind set."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greenefs gThe Quiet Americanh is a scathing critique of American imperialism in the Cold War Era.

Don't get hung up on Greene's \\"prescience\\" about the course of the Vietnam war. Greene flirted with Communism his whole life, and in his later life started a full fledged affair with it. For some unfathomable reason, he saw the US as more of a threat than international Communism, and that is the angle he wrote from. To be fair, this angle is very slight in comparison to the norm among the self-appointed intellectual elite.2. That being said, even if you are pro-American and conservative (as I am) it is still a fantastic book. Greene's anti-Americanism doesn't obsess him, and his criticisms are more or less true and can be taken constructively. Greene's strength lies in his incredible insight into human passions both sexual and political, NOT in his analysis of Cold War policy.3.When you read this book, look for God as a hidden character, or rather as the unstated main subject of the book. This is probably the last of Greene's books as a real Catholic."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This was summer reading for a ninth grade gr'son. I read the book, annotated it, and sent it to him to read. Then we discussed it. I was worried about his getting it, but he did. I remember Dien Bien Phu. My husband served in Viet Nam. When will we ever learn."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I was in Vietnam for Vacation, and I came across this novel in a market store in Saigon. I remember there was a movie, but I had never seen it. I will have to say for a small little simplistic novel there was much to be enjoyed. The novel is narrated by Fowler, the British \\"OLDER\\" reporter who loves the space and madness occurring in 1950' Vietnam. Fowler is met by Pyle, an American on humanitarian mission to feed the war ravaged citizens of Vietnam. Pyle admits that he is in love with Fowler's Asian Girl friend and would like to steal her away. From this point on Greene continues the playful bantering back and forth between these two characters, but the novel soon becomes dark and more sinister as we learn these characters' deep dark secrets, they are not what they seem. Graham Greene has created an enjoyable novel that amounted to a love story, adventure story and Mystery all in this nicely written novel. I liked The Quiet American."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Having been written before the involvement of the US in Vietnam, the book is worth a read. The characters are well built, through fall in line with the popular notions of Americans. This is handled well. Throughout there is a real sense of innocence in the main character, which ironically, leads to the opposite effect. I am giving this book three stars because there are moments that lag. The conversation seems to head in a direction void of the reader's presence. In any case, its still a good read."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Some people hate this book, but what they really detest is the antihero protaganist, Fowler, a jaded and decaying British journalist observing a naive American, Pyle, slowly immersing himself in Vietnam. Written in the fifties, it can be seen as a prophetic symbol of the futility of our Southeast Asia policies, as well as an indictment of latent American messianic romanticism. The two characters are apt symbols of his nation, although peripheral characters should also be thought of as relevant when considering the novel's characterization of national characters. The toothless collapse of the European imperialistic mission, and the beginning of the end of ours."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"&quot;..I wished there was someone to whom I could say that I was sorry.&quot; -- writes Fowler, our 'hero'. Like many of Greene's characters, he is tormented by sin and the need to repent. Unlike many of Greene's characters, though, Fowler can't believe there is a God (see the opening quote) and is all the more interesting because of it. Based on Greene's own experiences as a 50s-Vietnam War correspondent, this one is my personal favorite of his many great books."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I have recently re-read this classic book, and it is both a marvelous exploration of the human condition and an incisive look at how dangerous the ignorant idealistic zealot can be--the sort of person who can excuse the deaths of innnocent people in a country he has decided to bring democracy to by saying that they were \\"just war casualties\\" (regretable but inevitable) and also that they \\"died for democracy\\"--whether they wanted to or not. This is as timely now as when it was written."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The excerpt comes from a quote from the poet Arthur Hugh Clough that serves as one of THE QUIET AMERICAN's two epigraphs. Graham Greene thrusts us into one of his moral quagmires in which the crabwise scuttling of his narrator comes up against the straightforward thrusts of the dangerously naive.Thomas Fowler is a British journal in Saigon during the 1950s, when the French were fighting Vietnamese Communist insurgents before the United States inherited that mess after the battle of Dien Bien Phu. He comes upon Arden Pyle, the Quiet American of the title, a man almost too innocent to live. (At one point, Greene writes that \\"innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.\\") While purporting to be an economic consultant, he is actually an American agent attempting to apply simplistic principles to a tangled situation that is beyond his understanding.In the process, he snags Fowler's Vietnamese mistress while pretending to remain the journalist's friend. Although he seems to be invulnerable in his innocence for a while, the quagmire finally claims him as a victim. He is very like one of Conrad's \\"pilgrims\\" in THE HEART OF DARKNESS, cool and elegant in their pursuit of nefarious colonial pursuits to the very end.The \\"illegitimate process\\" may be a good description of Pyle's work, but Graham Greene's ever-present \\"malpractice of heart\\" is seen in Fowler, the French police inspector Vigot, the mistress Phuong's sister, Fowler's fellow journalist Bill Granger, and the suspicious Mr Heng.At one point, Fowler wonders, \\"Wouldn't we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife a husband, a lover a mistress, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that's why men have invented God -- a being capable of understanding.\\" And, I might add, of forgiving.This is one of Graham Greene's most outstanding works, on a par with THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and A BURN-OUT CASE. Curiously, it seems almost as current as if it were written yesterday instead of half a century ago."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"There are lot of striking aspects of QuietAmerican. First, it is a good gripping story which grabs the attention of even the lay reader who is not intrested or aware of the politics underlying the plot. Second, for a story of this far reaching magnitude, it is hardly 100 pages which shows the mastery of Greene's craft. It needs skill and mastery of language, a knack of fleshing out characters who standout in the story and a clear vision of what is being propagated to come up with such clarity as Green's Quiet American does. Third, the story itself - it flows at two levels , the personal romantic triangle between Fowler, Pyle and Phuong is a microcosm of the politicial tension and clash of the ideologies surrounding the war in Vietnam. Not the American-imposed vietnam war, but the one presaging it in the early 50's. Fowler's weary cynical character stands out in the story. Pitted against/with him is Pyle, the idealistic, naive American who believes in half-baked ideas of freedom and democracy and the ways to achieve it on the hapless populace of Vietnam. Phoung is the silent mute witness, the metaphor of Vietnam, the object of passion and attention in two contrasting ways from an old Colonial who has learnt the hopelessness of ism's and 'acies and a new imperial who is full of vigor and verve to bulldoze his way through.The most amazing aspect of Quiet American is - it is *still* prophetic. Vietnam war proved Greene's stringent opinion about the dubiousness of American policy. Now, the invasion of Iraq proves yet again, the naivette of those immature American public who believe in the hoax of \\"liberation and democracy\\" led by the corrupt cabal in Power who have their own selfish intrests.Don't miss this book. It's entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is an eerily prophetic and, therefore, deeply disturbing book. Ostensibly the story of a love triangle involving a naive American spook, a jaded English journalist and a young Vietnamese girl, lurking just beneath the surface is an allegory for the whole experience of America in Vietnam.Alden Pyle, the Quiet American of the title, was based on Col. Edward Lansdale, the renowned, or infamous depending on your politics, CIA operative who was sent to Viet Nam in the 50's to subvert the Vietminh after a string of successes in the Phillipines (he was also the model for William Lederer's and Eugene Burdicks &quot;The Ugly American&quot;). Pyle is an innocent who believes that others must surely share his ideals and pureness of motive. He is convinced, based on his adherence to the writings of York Harding, that there is a Third Way for Vietnam, somewhere between Communism and the corrupt colonial government. He has come to Vietnam to foster a group that will adhere to this Third Way. The journalist, Fowler, a cynical world-weary man of much wider experience, realizes that Pyle is a dangerous man because he is imposing his idealized vision on a group that is merely power hungry. Meanwhile, Pyle has fallen in love with Phuong, Fowler's Vietnamese girlfriend. And while Fowler can offer her little because his wife refuses to grant him a divorce, Pyle offers marriage and respectability and a life in America. As Fowler loses Phuong to Pyle and Pyle's group begins a terror campaign, Fowler finally abandons his neutrality and chooses sides, a choice made all the more ambiguous because of his romantic rivalry with Pyle.The prescient pessimism that pervades this book is it's most interesting feature. Greene, writing well before we really got involved, seemed to sense that Vietnam was a tar baby that we idealistic Americans would not be able to resist embracing. Pyle's bloody blundering seems to presage the well-intended but disastrous mess that we would make of the entire country in the decades to come. One wishes that men like Robert McNamara and the Kennedys had paid attention to this literate warning.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"One of the most amazing things that jumped out at me about Graham Greene's novel, \\"The Quiet American,\\" was the copyright date. 1955. How many years BEFORE America found itself mired in the nightmare of the Vietnam War?Why didn't anyone in power or policy see the warning in this novel?I'm still reading through all the extra material but I feel confident enough about the book itself and what I have read that I can definitely give this book five stars (the novel is over a third of this book).Alden Pyle, Greene's \\"quiet American,\\" clearly represents America in this cruel world. He's young, strong, sure of his beliefs and willing to act on his own convictions--but in this world of deceit and corruption, he doesn't have a chance. And quite a few people have said the same thing about America in Vietnam.Beyond the deeper meaning of the setting and story (more powerful since it was written BEFORE the USA got stuck in Nam), the characters really make for some fiction. Pyle, the clear-eyed Yank looking to do good in Indo-China, runs into the narrator Fowler, an opium-smoking old Brit journalist who's seen too much and forgot how to care about anything--except the Vietnamese woman who comes between them.At the end of the 1970s, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" got a lot of kudos for its dark humor (\\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\\") but Greene had written along those lines in the 1950s: Fowler rides along on a bomb run and, after a village is blown to bits, the pilot points out the beautiful sunset on a nearby river.Up to this point, my favorite Greene novel had been \\"The End of the Affair,\\" but now it's \\"The Quiet American.\\" I also want to see the Michael Caine movie they made a couple years back."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is THE story about the beginnings of America's involvement in the mess that became the Vietnam War. Graham Greene had future vision and even in 1955 knew what would happen. He both explains and predicts the future in The Quiet American, a beautiful book set in Vietnam in the 50s. The book is told from the point of view of Fowler, an aging British journalist. Fowler's beautiful but opportunistic Vietnamese mistress, Phuong (who is herself a metaphor for the country itself), is coveted and for a while, claimed by a seemingly innocuous American named Pyle. Slowly, Pyle's real purpose in the country is discovered, and Fowler's servant upsets his determinedly neutral, uninvolved stance by saying, \\"There comes a time when you must choose sides.\\"Absolutely wonderful, profoundly thought-provoking, multi-layered book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene's novel The Quiet American is an expressive illustration of the interconnection of personal agendas and politics into an action. This action would later be transformed into none other than history itself. Focusing on the events of the earlier part of what would become the Vietnam War, Greene delves into what not many other of his colleagues at the time would dare. He informs the public in such a brilliant way of what exactly is going on, raising the more general question- \`Is it possible to be completely unbiased and detached from a situation whose images are repeatedly shown to you on a daily basis?'The reader is immediately introduced to three characters Fowler, Phuong, and Pyle. Greene does an especially brilliant job in creating these three characters to be paralleled to their respective countries. Fowler plays the part of the neutral observer, and embodies the British attitudes towards the Vietnam. He is especially firm to stand by his feelings of being absolutely unbiased towards the situation. Phuong is presented as a submissive, nave, and delicate woman of Vietnam, the general attitude America held towards the country itself. Pyle epitomizes America through his aggressiveness and the air that can only be defined as a WASP. He is very well educated though it is made extremely clear not at all knowledgeable of consequence. Greene, using these parallels, is able to sculpt a story of the personal conflict of love, the greater conflict of war, and the ethics involved in a choice which will ultimately lead into an action affecting more than oneself.Greene unravels his story in such a fashion to give the reader information concerning each life involved. He does not give a one sided account covering up the destruction of a nation, speaking about a peaceful involvement to end Communism as the greater American government would have liked him to. He asks the reader to take a step back in his or her own life and truly reconsider his action, or lack of action.Through the course of the novel the reader views Fowlers transformation from innocent bystander to active involvement in something greater than himself. Fowler's step to action is admirable, but we're also questionable of his intention. Greene uses Fowler as a prime example that our larger decisions which will affect a world are not always as pure as we would like to believe. He shows that regardless of how genuine and selfless we wish to be at any point in time, we all are still guilty of that droplet of our personal agenda underneath it all. History is not made from reaction to raw facts, rather the physical social interactions between people.The Quiet American is a necessary read, especially during this period of history. As America continues conflict in Iraq, the ideas provoked by Greene's words are crucial in the understanding of what the American government might again be failing to thoroughly express to the greater public. More importantly, The Quiet American shows the significance of understanding the full story, rather than one nation's view of that story. Rather than simply watching the news every once in awhile, or picking up the paper every Sunday to exclusively read the front page stories, Greene begs for the interaction of the individual and his own history.Simply stated, The Quiet American is a must read for anyone who wishes to take the challenge of stepping back, listening, understanding that everything you've been fed may not be the entire story, and that the full story may only be attainable through personal inquiry and action."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"In this thoughtful and complex story, author Graham Greene presents us with three main characters; narrator Thomas Fowler, Alden Pyle, and Phuong. These three characters are connected to the Vietnam War in different ways. Pyle is from Boston, Fowler, from England, and Phuong is a native to Vietnam.Each character in a way represents the country from which they come. Pyle, like America, is just getting involved with the War, thinking that he is bringing new, helpful ideas with him to benefit the Vietnamese. Phuong, like Vietnam, is simply trying to live life the best that she can. Fowler is from the only neutral country of the three. He does not agree with the war and he thinks that the Vietnamese just want to be able to &quot;grow rice&quot; and interact with each other pleasantly without the interference of countries that don't know them. However, he wants to remain disengaged from the war as much as he can, while still reporting/keeping an eye on it.Alden Pyle, the \\"quiet American\\", is an interesting character. He is portrayed as an incredibly nave, young patriot who has somehow gotten himself involved in something that he knows very little about. He seems to have absolutely no idea of how to function intelligently in the extremely unpredictable and potentially dangerous Vietnam.Fowler is the passive, cynical journalist in Vietnam to submit war stories and experiences that will then be printed in England. He is clearly wise when it comes to knowing how to live and what to do during such shaky, uncertain days in Vietnam. Seemingly the exact opposite from Pyle, yet they become friends the first time they meet. Fowler finds a lighthearted amusement in Pyle's intense ignorance, but he also sees the danger he faces because of this.Phuong, (pronounced Fong) though a comparably minor character, has one of the most important parts. She is the cause of Pyle's fate.Though she could easily be Fowler's daughter, she and Fowler connect in an extremely meaningful way. She is what makes Fowler human; she is what brings out his passion and feeling. Generally narrating in an unemotional, apathetic way, Fowler sneaks in lines such as; \\"...we [Fowler and Phuong] sat in silence, content to be together\\" (33) and \\"It didn't seem much for the end of the working day, but, after all, he [Pyle] had had Phuong\\" (29) which reveal his strong feelings for Phuong.The Quiet American is an eloquent story that depicts the ways in which three people make lives for themselves and survive (or don't) in the war-absorbed country of Vietnam. The three characters experience a war of their own when Pyle admits his love of Phuong to Fowler, who then gives him the go-ahead to confess these feelings to Phuong. This would not have been an issue if Fowler had been able to marry Phuong. Though he desperately desires to marry her, Fowler is married to a die-hard Catholic back in England. All Fowler needs is his wife to agree to divorce him. Though it starts out as innocently as it possibly could, this fight over Phuong develops during the course of the story into an intense battle and ultimately one character's downfall.I greatly enjoyed reading this book. The characters were perfectly constructed and it was extremely well-written. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys anything good."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is about the Vietnam that nobody knows about. It is set as Vietnam is in the last vestiges of Colonial French occupation, as a war-torn fractured country is split into so many competing groups that none can effectively stand up to the French.Our Narrator, Fowler is a British Correspondent who is jaded and somewhat cynical, not only with the hypocrisy of the events which he observes but also about his own life and a bitter split with his wife who remained in england. The only vestiges of happiness he gets are from a young Vietnamese girl, Phuong whom he is involved with and the opium he periodically smokes. In a way, both are similar in that they merely provide an illusion of happiness - opium in its fragmentory swiftly fading dreams and Phuong whose love is founded on pretence.Despite the fact that his happiness is founded on illusion, fowler is a rather dispassionate observer of events very unlike a rather quiet young American he meets one day called Pyle. Pyle is a naive young man straight out of college convinced that his actions can change things for the better. He begins to meddle in an already complicated political situation by channeling aid to a \\"Third Force\\" hoping that it will resolve the situation. Pyle however despite his good intentions is like an errant knight who unleashes forces which he cannot control and leads to his downfall.Fowler, despite his insistance on merely fulfilling a role as a reporter which comes with a refusal to get involved finds himself inextricably tangled in the situation. We eventually begin to wonder at Fowler's neutrality and indifference, especially when Phuong leaves him for Pyle.Graham Greene is a writer whose use of language is sparse, spare but always graceful. Not a word is wasted as the writing is beautiful in its simplicity. Greene was a journalist besides being a writer and the hallmarks of his chosen profession are there - the stark observations of human behaviour as well as a firm grounding of events in reality. it is a testament to his ability that the book seems as relevant today as it was when it was first published. A must read for anyone interested in vietnam and definitely one of Greene's best."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"On second reading 42 years after original publication, Graham Greene's short and masterful novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; seems profound and prophetic. (To many of us it seemed arrogant, stereotyped and anti-American in 1956). Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be in part a takeoff of U.S. CIA officer Colonel Edward Lansdale, the model for Colonel Hillandale in William Lederer's &quot;The Ugly American,&quot; a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel. Today Alden Pyle could be seen as a character based on the Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, Henry Cabot Lodge or Robert Komer of the 1960s. Greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"&quot;The Quiet American&quot; is a skillfully written book, by one of the most underrated authors of our century.

The French have just begun to realize the futility of trying to help the mass illiterate embrace democracy, all the while fighting an increasingly costly jungle styled war against insurgents.This is the story of Fowler and Pyle (the quiet American ). Fowler is an English reporter and has been covering the war for some time, while Pyle is newly arrived and attached to the American diplomatic branch; a presence which is just starting to become involved in this area of south east Asia. Their paths cross, initially over a girl, and then later through a series of events, causing their destinies to become entwined in ways neither could foresee. Fowler is the main focus of the book, with Pyle dropping in and out just enough to add new twists and developments to the situations that arise.It is a tale of love, lust, intrigue, espionage, and some misguided (misguided, depending on which side your on) ideological thinking. Throw in an occasional skirmish or two and you've got a tense, psychological thriller.Conclusion:I really enjoyed this book. It was in all honesty, a little slow to get into, but somehow, great stories are often like that. Hard to put down...very well done.5 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This was my second experience with Greene, but I read The Human Factor so long ago, I hardly remember it. Greene's life fascinates me and The Quiet American presents the sort of paradoxical feelings and relationships with which I imagine Greene himself would've struggled. Here we encounter Pyle, the American willing to sacrifice Vietnamese lives for what he considers the greater good, that American ideal centered around rational self-interest, and Fowler, the purportedly wise, old world British journalist with his manipulative, self-serving ways, his typical contempt for the American Pyle, and his own eventual willingness to allow an end to justify underhanded means of his own.Two bits of narration from Fowler that struck me were:\\"I cannot be at ease (and to be at ease is my chief wish) if someone else is in pain, visibly or audibly or tactually. Sometimes this is mistaken by the innocent for unselfishness, when all I am doing is sacrificing a small good - in this case postponement in attending to my hurt - for the sake of a far greater good, a peace of mind when I need think only of myself.\\" (105)\\"Suffering is not increased by numbers: one body can contain all the suffering the world can feel.\\" (175)In consideration of the above quotes, it follows that Fowler's comfort derives at least partially from that of his friends, and that the plight of one person could equal, in his estimation, the plight of many. And yet Fowler eventually compromises his ideals, conflicted as he is over the decision, and the personal benefit he derives from his own deceitful, hurtful action, along with his justification in furthering what he believes to be a greater good, leave him happy but for a slight tinge of regret which for Fowler, seems to me about as peaceful of a result as he could've attained.So it seems to me that whatever statement Greene attempted to make in this novel about America's global political goals, he didn't necessarily offer any alternative, in fact showing his individual British anti-hero to fall victim to the same sort of logic behind all that he seems to despise about his nemesis.Greene's smooth prose, which I thoroughly enjoyed on every page, may have put me over the edge to give this book five stars, but I think he could've dug deeper in developing Pyle and Phuong (the novel's paper thin heroine). A very enjoyable read, though."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is one of the best spy novels I have ever read. It makes you take a hard look at the ethics of what governments do even when they are fully convinced they are doing it for the greater good. This is a great story."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I read Travels With My Aunt over the summer, and I really loved it. The basic plot-line of The Quiet American: \\"'I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused,' Graham Greene's narrator Fowler remarks of Alden Pyle, the eponymous \\"Quiet American\\" of what is perhaps the most controversial novel of his career. Pyle is the brash young idealist sent out by Washington on a mysterious mission to Saigon, where the French Army struggles against the Vietminh guerrillas. As young Pyle's well-intentioned policies blunder into bloodshed, Fowler, a seasoned and cynical British reporter, finds it impossible to stand safely aside as an observer. But Fowler's motives for intervening are suspect, both to the police and himself, for Pyle has stolen Fowler's beautiful Vietnamese mistress.\\"The plot doesn't sound that interesting perhaps, but it really is gripping. It combines the confusion of that period in history in Vietnam with Fowler's own problems and struggles. The story begins when Pyle doesn't show up to meet Fowler, for he is discovered dead. Then, Greene recounts the two men's history together: their meeting, Pyle falling in love with Phuong, and subsequent adventures.The two men are quite different. Fowler is \\"seasoned and cynical\\", very smart, but getting old and rather fed up with the world. Pyle is young and idealistic, full of big ideas and hopes for Democracy with a capital D. But he really has no idea what he's doing, and is constantly making mistakes. The tension and somehow the friendship between these two very different people is portrayed amazingly. This is another extremely well-crafted novel by Graham Greene. I look forward to reading more of his highly varied work in the future (I know I'll be reviewing Our Man in Havana soon).My book review blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"There is already a fair amount of material about Greene's political views and his Catholic heritage. Despite the fact that Greene minimized the importance of religion and his conversion to Catholicism in his life, he very much defended a society with social justice inspired by the essence of Jesus preachings. Catholic left-wingers (even the self-proclaimed agnostics or secular) have considerable intellectual influence in Europe and Latin America and are in part responsible for the shape of these continents.\\"The Quiet American\\" was built according to this ideology. The bad guy is the ignorant ivy-league educated American. The good guy, the British reporter, is more subtle. Fowler is the British version of Rick in Casablanca. As Rick, he started just as an observer (\\"My fellow journalists called themselves correspondents; I preferred the title of reporter. I wrote what I saw. I took no action--even an opinion is a kind of action.\\") but eventually the superhero put his mask on to bring justice to the world.For someone to the right side of Greene's political spectrum, he might have been perceived as naive or romantic, but it is undeniable that Greene was right on target with Pyle. This book was written on the earlier 50s and at that time Greene already sensed the future of Vietnam. I am very careful with visionaries. In this case, hats off to Greene. It is impressive indeed. The truth is that since then, there are no shortage of Pyles around.I cannot recommend the introduction written by Robert Stone for the Penguin edition more vehemently. Although I suggest reading it after the book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I've read this book an seen the movie (both versions) numerous times. Graham Greene does a wonderful job with created nuanced characters, and a nuanced argument. His main character, an agnostic European cynic is juxtaposed with an idealistic American CIA agent who wants to save Vietnam with a &#34;third force.&#34; Both these men (just like their respective countries) fight over a lovely Vietnamese woman named Phuong. The extended geopolitical metaphor is wonderful, as well as the dialogue between Fowler and Pyle."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene pulled off another masterpiece of dark, moody and melancholy reflection on the nature of power and individual accountability in this account of strife torn Indochina post WW II. Saigon is a city on edge as the Viet Cong forces from the communist held north move ever closer to overwhelming the French colonial authority. Ordinary people become the playthings of others' agendas be they political, emotional or criminal. Everyone is out to secure their own future before the final collapse comes. In the middle of this a cynical British journalist and a naive (or is he actually brutally manipulative?) US agent are thrown together collaborating / contesting for their own selfish / philanthropic ends. Greene conveys the menace and the despair so powerfully he could be writing about today's dirty geopolitical struggles. A memorable story that gives you frequent pause to think."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is a deeply perceptive novel based on Greene's several stays in Vietnam between 1952 and 1954. He stayed chiefly in Saigon, but also - like his chief proponent in the novel, Fowler - travelled to Hanoi and Phat Diem in the north. It's almost uncanny how Greene predicts the coming nightmare of American involvement in Vietnam after the French withdrawal in 1954. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, which I re-read several times, and I consider it the best of Greene's many fine novels."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This product arrived in great condition unfortunately the narrator lacks expression when reading. I was disappointed in this and turned it off. How do you describe the character Phuong as a clink of a tea cup or as a phoenix without changing the tone and expressiveness of your voice.I doubt if I will listen to any more of it."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Call it what you want -- &quot;prophetic&quot; even -- The Quiet American is still terrible. If we were to judge novels by how well they relate to the facts, we might as well read newspapers. Which makes me wonder why Greene didn't just simply write this as non-fiction -- instead of the disingenuous route he chose -- a trite story involving such simple, stick-like characters who are obvious stand-ins for their respective nations. Rather insulting. Besides, Greene's voice is dusty and worn out; I can't imagine what anyone sees in his style."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is my first ever book by Greene. I did not care for his writing style -- very dry, and he did not make the characters come alive for me.It is hard to read literature without having current events impact on what you're reading. For me, this has been especially true post-9/11. This book was filled with anti-American sentiment, which really bothered me.I only read this book because I wanted to see the movie with Brendan Fraser. Of the actors working today, Fraser is my second-favorite actor after Tom Hanks (way, way second, because Mr. Hanks is of course far superior), but second-favorite nonetheless. The movie was actually in some ways better than the book, except Caine was too old for the role, and Fraser was also miscast, IMO.But back to Greene. Despite my very lukewarm response to this book, I will still read one other novel by him. I never give up on anybody who is considered a major novelist without at least reading two books by him or her."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"It appears to me that Mr. Greene repeats his Theme of The Use And Abuse Of Power in every one of his books. One could easily go so far as to say that he has been writing the same book for the past 30 years. The main protagonist in his book is an Opium Addicted Serial Monogamist named Fowler who has become jaded by his involvement in the Vietnam War and seeks solace in the Arms Of Morpheus or his Vietnamese girlfriend Phuong. Then he meets an idealistic young man named Pyle who decides he can make a difference to what is happening in their world. The rest of the book explores their relationship with each other and it comes as no surprise to the reader that Pyle falls in love with Phuong with the promise that he can give her a better life.I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I am totally bewildered by the fact that it is considered to be a so called \\"Modern Classic Of Literature.The jaded antics of an opium junkie holds no atraction for me to read ."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This novel written between 1953 and 1955 has been made into a new film, which has been recently released by Miramax. This is the story about the early stages of the American involvement in Vietnam. Although simplistic, it captures the essence of the political turmoil of Vietnam in the fifties: the French trying to hang on to their colony, the Americans trying their hands in a new country, the \\"third force\\", the communists, the peasants, and so on.It deals with an American idealist, Pyle, who without knowing its true colors tried to help the \\"third force\\" fight the communists in Vietnam. Fowler, a seasoned English reporter questioned Pyle's real motives. He suspected, like the British had done in Burma years earlier, the Americans would soon get tired of the involvement, leave the natives fight for themselves, and let them be slaughtered by their enemies. This was a fascinating prediction, which came to be true 30 years later. How Graham Greene could predict that event back then still puzzles me? The plot, however, thickened as Pyle tried to lure away Fowler's Vietnamese mistress.I have to concede the novelist had more insight than many of our politicians. Since the novel raises important issues, it should be a \\"must read\\" book for many Americans."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene spent four springs of his life as a journalist in Indochina and this fine, intelligent novel is an account of his experiences there. It's also a disturbing prophecy of the awful mess that was to be American involvement in Vietnam. It's also a study of friendship and betrayal, of youthful American idealism and mature British jadedness,of indifference and commitment. It is written in spare, elegant prose and the gaunt style has a journalistic immediacy that perfectly fits the subject and the characters without diminishing the emotional complexity.It is a major novel by one of the century's major writers and it hasn't dated; on the contrary,it has a disturbing contemporary feel."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"While Graham Greene's writing is noticeably without flashiness, it is also without flaws. Always subtle and graceful, with each novel he wrote he quietly established himself as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. The Quiet American is no exception. It is a perfectly balanced novel. Greene expertly juxtaposes the character of Fowler, the British journalist, with Pyle, the American aid worker. Fowler is older, more reserved, more experienced. Pyle is young, more ambitious, and seemingly more naive. Fowler lives his life by the journalist's number one rule - stay impartial, don't take sides, just report what you see. Pyle, by contrast, is passionate about making a difference in the struggle against communism in Vietnam. They serve as beautiful foils for one another, and together they guide the reader through a profound exploration of the importance of being committed to a cause. As Greene writes, one must eventually take sides in order to truly live. This book is also an elegant comparison of two different cultures. One learns lots about Vietnam within minutes of arriving, Greene points out. And it is also a tender love story, though not a traditional one. Greene masterfully blends this love story with a powerful and morally complex political scenario in a way that few modern writers could pull off. As with all of Greene's work, this is excellent fiction."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Or perhaps it's that the 1950s lasted 30 years in England. It was plainly still 1955 in England when i spent some months there in 1979, and indeed I suspect that it was 1955 for Graham Greene from the end of World War 2 until the catastrophe of Margaret Thatcher. Greene wrote six books in the '50s or thereabouts: The Third Man (1949), The End of the Affair, Loser Takes All, The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana, and A Burnt-Out Case (1960). In none of them was the awkward Quietist Catholicism of his earlier novels sustained; instead both his 'novels' and his 'entertainments' became increasingly anti-colonial in content and critical of both Catholic and Anglo-American values. Throughout his long career, nonetheless, Greene was the most ineffably British of novelists, at least as we readers perceive him through his literary personae, in whom diffidence and arrogance are two faces of the same shilling.The 'narrator' of The Quiet American, the aging British journalist Thomas Fowler, on assignment in French Vietnam, is the epitome of that blend of diffidence and arrogance, the latter politely sheathed by the former. Fowler has a cosy live-in lover, Phuong, a moderate opium dependency, and no desire to return to the UK, to his bitter Anglican wife who refuses him a divorce. At a club with Phuong, he meets Alden Pyle, the \\"quiet American\\" of the title, a young, handsome Harvard-grad supposedly in Vietnam on a non-military mission. In fact, Pyle is an OSS agent provocateur, a liaison to the rogue general Trinh Minh The, whom Pyle's superiors perceive as an effective \\"Third Force\\" in the war between the French colonialists and the 'communist' Viet Minh. Fowler and Pyle become rivals for 'possession' of Phuong. And that's all I mean to reveal of the plot!This 'triangle of passion' is the skeleton of the novel, but it's Greene's depiction of Alden Pyle that sustains the exceptional interest of the book. Pyle is seemingly a naive idealist, innocent, brash, firmly convinced of the good intentions of his country, committed to the political philosophy of York Harding (an imaginary scholar). There are rumors that Pyle's persona was based on the real-life American Edward Lansdale, a CIA 'counter-insurgency expert' whose interventions in Vietnam, Cuba, and elsewhere qualify him as one of the colorful scoundrels of the 20th C. In any case, Pyle's idealism is of the sort that accommodates slaughter of innocents. To put it bluntly, he's a terrorist, but \\"our\\" terrorist. The gauze that separates \\"idealism\\" from ideological fanaticism is very thin in Pyle. But Graham Greene is not merely depicting one plausible malefactor -- one who can smile and smile and yet be a villain. Pyle is not only a 'quiet' American; he's an archetypal American, a synecdoche of America as Greene perceived it. \\"I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused,\\" Fowler says about Pyle; Greene is saying the same about America: \\"I never knew a People who had better motives for all the catastrophes they caused.\\"Remember that Greene wrote this book before 1955, when it was published, and therefore before the French debacle at Dien Bin Phu. But it reveals what everybody except the American public knew: that America was waiting in the wings to take over the anti-communist crusade in 'Indochina'. Pyle describes explicitly to Fowler what later would be called the \\"Domino Theory\\". Pyle's utter inability to grasp the mentality of the Vietnamese would become exactly what led to the inability of Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon to comprehend why America could only 'win' a war in Vietnam by \\"turning it into a parking lot\\". In effect, Graham Greene was a prophet who scored 100%! This little novel is such an accurate augury of the American calamity in Vietnam a decade later that, had it been read carefully in Washington, it might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"So slim yet such a nugget of gold. Manages to analyze Vietnam and show the stupidity of America's involvement with it, while ostensibly telling a love-triangle crime &amp; punishment story complete with a French Raskolnikov. After one reading, you can read it again, taking Pyle for America's government itself, Phuong for the Vietnamese people (they make dangerous bedfellows :), and Fowler for Greene himself. The magnificent use of a few words to characterize people and places is world class. This book is maybe the best novel of the 20th century, certainly of the '50s. Must-read for any literate American. Too bad it didn't mention that Vietnam had been fighting China for 1000 years and could never become its puppet in a 'domino theory'; all the Viets wanted was to get the colonialists out, and mistook America for such. A neutral unified VN would have been accepted by Ho Chi Minh, as McNamara now admits, but nobody knew to propose it, because the VN assumed everybody knew their history and never talked about it :) Even today, America is VN's natural ally against Chinese imperialism."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Greene's &quot;The Quiet American&quot; describes the brief, but astoundingly full relationship between Thomas Fowler, a British war correspondent-slash-expatriate, and Arden Pyle, an innocent and naive American desk soldier in 1950's Vietnam. The novel tells of how Pyle tries to usurp the affections of Phuong, a local woman from a tired, but comfortable relationship with Fowler.Simultaneously, Pyle is engaged in secretive dealings with a local thug in an attempt to drive French and Vietminh forces out of power - in an effort to establish a puppet government friendly to American interests.Graham Greene shows why he is one of the single greatest authors of the 20th century. His understanding of cultures and grasp of the current of his contemporary geopolitics is astounding from one novel to the next. In this light, &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is an interesting fictional look at Vietnam in the years preceding the Vietnam Conflict.The book is yet another of Greene's profound first-person confessionals in the manner of &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; and is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene wrote the definitive tale of the myopic and moralistic American interloping in the years leading up to its full-blown involvement in Vietnam. The narrator of this book reminds the reader of many of Graham's other characters: An upper-crust Englishman abroad -- Fowler, the Saigon-based journalist, whose friendship with Pyle, the American embassy's 'Economic Attach' becomes the tool that moves the narrative along. Parts of Graham's book, especially the sections describing the fighting between the Viet Mihn and the French, read like journalism. But most of its greatness (this is a great novel) can be attributed to Greene's masterful hand in describing the narrator's mixed feelings for Pyle, an ostensibly wholesome Harvard-brow, whose intentions are good but whose methods and assumptions are based on pure American naivety. These feelings grow more complex when the narrator's Vietnamese girlfriend warms to Pyle -- the obvious metaphor for the relative decline of British colonial power to American dynamism. Writing about these metaphors may seem cheesy, since most writers come off as cheesy when they attempt them. But Graham Greene is so skilled, and so subtle, that the little human personifications of his big ideas come off flawlessly."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors since I recently read The Power and the Glory, The End of the Affair, and now this masterpiece. The narrative is wonderfully entertaining, the characterization of Fowler is deep and insightful, and Greene's grasp of America's political outlook seems prophetic (particularly considering the recent Iraqi \\"war\\").The story is of Fowler, a middle-aged English journalist, who is covering the civil war in Vietnam (pre-US war), and he is involved with a young Vietnamese beauty Phuong. Enter Pyle, a naive American who sets out to take Phuong and sets out to pursue naive American political interests.The novel works on a lot of levels. For one, it is very entertaining; I can see how they wanted to make a movie out of it. It also develops an interesting moral commentary as Fowler is forced to handle a moral quandary. The reporter is forced to \\"take a side,\\" is forced to grasp some type of belief structure. The political commentary Greene gives to this post-colonial world is also highly intriguing. This should be required reading for politicians (particularly in these times). The Quiet American is one of Greene's best novels and will certainly go down as one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century fiction."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The narrator of The Quiet American, Fowler, is a disengaged man whose credo is to remain neutral and take no side. Fowler confronts Alden Pyle, a young idealistic American blinded by his good intentions, who is involved in a murky scheme to save French-occupied Indochina from communism. With his child-like faith in the teachings of a scholar who spent but one week in Indochina, Pyle becomes immersed in a seemy plot to build a &quot;Third Force,&quot; something akin to Hemingway's Fifth Column, that will fight for democracy in Indochina. Fowler watches as Pyle's ignorance and idealism wreak damage and destroy the lives of innocents- all in the name of democracy- and very soon Fowler is forced to engage and to take a side in order to stop Pyle from blindly wreaking more damage. Here, Fowler is a typical, stock Greene hero, cynical and jaundiced, who discovers that cynicism will only go so far and that at one point or another, he must take a larger step towards faith in an ideal or take some type of moral stand. Fowler may be a stock Greene hero, a little formulaic, but Greene uses the formula so well by fleshing out Fowler that we overlook the cliche. Pyle is a bit of oversimplification of what Greene sees as American idealism mixed with dangerous self-confidence, but Greene was trying to create a symbol of American arrogance, and the symbol works well enough to put aside a little irritation at the oversimplification. In addition, the story is infused with a detective motif as Fowler sniffs out the plot Pyle is wrapped up in and keeps us turning pages, eager to discover exactly what the innocent Pyle is scheming. This is a good read with excellent character development and plot twists."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene's \\"The Quiet American\\" was published in 1955, but it has an almost eerie prophetic quality about what was to happen in Viet Nam. This novel will soon be a film featuring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser.While the French are trying to stave off the Chinese and Viet Minh communist threat and hold on to their colony in Indochina, a young American idealist enters the scene. Pyle, with his prep school values in hand, begins to fund a \\"Third Force\\" based on writings by his intellectual idol, York Harding.We see the action through the eyes of Fowler, an aging, cynical British reporter, determined not to become engaged or emotionally involved in the conflict. Fowler has plenty of issues. He's trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman back home, smokes too much opium, and has a convenient relationship with a young Vietnamese woman named Phuong.Phuong becomes the object of contention between Pyle and Fowler, and the conversations the two men have regarding the woman and her country provide amazing insights into the attitudes about Indochina.Greene's novel is very character driven, yet there is also plenty of action, as well as discourse on the nature of the conflict. Fowler is a vivid personality, undergoing some intense changes throughout the story, leading to key events that cause him to become involved.The book is less than two hundred pages, but it leaves the reader with plenty to think about upon completion. A very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"THE QUIET AMERICAN is the tragically banal yet moving story of two white men living in Vietnam during the colonial war in French Indochina. Thomas Fowler, a British journalist covering the war, is world-weary and jaded, street smart, politically savvy and intelligently low key in the sense that he has learned to keep his head down to avoid attracting undue attention to himself and his activities, acclimated to the oriental culture, happy with a mediocre day to day existence, separated from his erstwhile wife in England and living with a local woman, Phuong, who is reputed to be one of the most beautiful women in Saigon.Alden Pyle, newly posted to Saigon in some obscure bureaucratic capacity, is Fowler's very antithesis - brash and cocky with the arrogance and idealism of youth, nave and uninformed, an intellectual theorist, egocentric, parochial and uninformed as to the Asian way of life, and brimful of a typical American attitude that looks down with unabashed disdain at cultures other than their own. He also happens to be hopelessly in love with Phuong whom he met when they were attending a soir&eacute;e at the local Continental Hotel.THE QUIET AMERICAN tells the story of the evolution of the love-like-hate-admire-ignore relationships that evolve in the Fowler-Pyle-Phuong triangle as Pyle hamhandedly courts Phuong and attempts to force her into a choice between himself and Fowler. When Pyle is murdered, Vigot, a French inspector at the Sret&eacute;, investigates the death and makes it quite clear that he suspects Fowler is the killer.Like a Shakespearean tragedy, THE QUIET AMERICAN is a rather blood-soaked tale that focuses its primary attention on ideas, characters and relationships. The wartime events in southeast Asia drive the story, to be sure, but ultimately, the tragedy ends on an unresolved \\"life goes on\\" note with Fowler learning that his wife has offered him a divorce and that he and Phuong can resume their lives without the clutter of Pyle's further attentions.It is interesting to observe that, unlikely Pyle's and Fowler's exquisitely detailed personalities, Phuong remains ambiguous, fuzzy and ultimately unrevealed. Undoubtedly, this is Greene's nod in the direction of the western world's perception of the inscrutability of the Eastern mind.On one level, THE QUIET AMERICAN is a workmanlike and enjoyable tale of wartime adventure, colonialism, murder and romance. But, on a deeper level, it is also obvious that THE QUIET AMERICAN is a heartfelt critique of American imperialism and their penchant for violently imposing their vision of democracy and an assumed superior western way of life on cultures other than their own. Indeed, in 1956 when it was first published, THE QUIET AMERICAN was loudly condemned as being anti-American. It has been suggested that American readers were particularly galled to listen to the criticisms largely being voiced through the mouth of a snobbish and opinionated middle class Englishman like Thomas Fowler.In this era of continuing difficulties in the Middle East, Americans would be well-advised to consider reading this slow moving yet oddly compelling tragedy that had so much to say about American politics.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"What makes Greene not a good writer but a great one is his ability to universalize his characters, representing expressions of general political and national views of a particular historical time. When this novel was first published in 1955, the Vietnam situation was no more than a tiny blip on the international radar. A French colony for many years, after the enforced removal of the Japanese at the end of the war, the French intended all to return to what the country was before, a French dominion. In fact, before WW2, South East Asia was predominantly a Dutch and French colony, and these European imperialists requested of the then newly formed United Nations to ratify their intentions for the region to remain under their colonial rule. But the Cold War was now in full swing, and the evil red menace began spreading her claws. They had to be stopped or so we were told. After Korea, Vietnam was the focus point for the U.S. to stop the spread of Communism. The \`Domino Theory' was given as a reason for U.S. involvement - if one country fell to the Reds, other countries would naturally follow suit. In hindsight, we now know this theory not to be entirely true. The political situation in Vietnam was much more complicated than the communists verses the free world, and this short though elegantly written novel explores some of these complications through its main characters.It would be redundant to launch into a detailed sketch of the main characters and the plot for that matter, however, what this story essentially examines, is that at some time or another, as human beings, we have to make a stand for what we believe in. Eventually we have to choose sides, take responsibility for our decision and cop the inevitable consequences. In this case, the narrator, a cynical, urbane, English atheist, Thomas Fowler, cannot remain in the middle of a major conflict, having created emotional attachments, and sit on the fence. It takes an event of tragedy to push him over the edge, but once moved, he acts. And as his subsequent actions are dire, there is no turning back.The real beauty of this novel is it straightforward, even style, giving the reader the option simply to enjoy the surface tale, or delve deeper into its important issues. ~The Quiet American~ is one of the great twentieth century novels."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene lambasts both the old colonialism of the French and the British and the naive paternalism of the Americans.....The narrator is a caustic British cynic observing the crumbling of the French regime with indifference. The eponymous American is an energetic idealist convinced that Indochina is a less civilised Nebraska in need of a dose of American redemption. He sets about changing the world with disastrous effect. This book is an absolute classic. An ascerbic and prophetic analysis of Vietnam, strong engaging characters, a sarcastic wit and a scintillating story to boot."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"There are not many novels similar to Graham Greene's &quot;The Quiet American.&quot; Maybe authors are not as truthful and observant as he, or maybe the period in time that we live in affects the free will of perception and thought that a writer possesses. However, there are a few people who find no fear in speaking against the actions of a nation, and telling the truth about situations such as the Vietnam War. &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is Graham Greene's way of doing exactly this.The novel focuses on three characters in particular: Thomas Fowler (the narrator), Alden Pyle (The American), and Phoung (Fowler's Vietnamese lover). Fowler is a British reporter in Vietnam in 1952. At this time period in Vietnam the Vietnamese are at war with the French. The French are loosing the war and America is slowly taking interest in Vietnam. Fowler has been in Vietnam for some time now and keeps finding excuses to stay longer because he has fallen in love with a much younger woman named Phoung. This is how the novel is laid out in the beginning.One day, an American man named Pyle shows up at the hotel where Fowler always hangs around. Fowler and Pyle talk about things such as literature and Vietnam, eventually becoming friends. Fowler takes Pyle under his wing, teaching him about Vietnam and how exactly it works. Pyle sees Phoung and is amazed by her beauty. It is fairly obvious that Pyle wants her for himself. Eventually he convinces Phoung that he can protect her and take her away from the war and danger in Vietnam and she leaves Fowler.Fowler is torn apart by this and begins suspecting Pyle of lying to him as to what he was doing in Vietnam. He starts figuring this out when he goes to Interview General Te (the rising leader of the Vietnamese who are fighting against the north) and finds Pyle along with other Americans at his base. One day Fowler is sitting at the same hotel that he always sat at and a huge car bomb explodes a couple hundred feet from him, killing many women and children. Fowler is upset by this and finally realizes the magnitude of devastation this war is and will cost the people of Vietnam. He begins investigating the bombing and finds our that Pyle is behind it. Fowler realizes that Pyle is working for the American government and that America is funding General Te. He realizes that more Americans are going to come and take over what has come to be his home. He also realizes that he must take action instead of observing everything like he always had done before, and he does. Fowler is approached by people who want to kill Pyle and agrees to help. He sets up Pyle and Pyle is killed.The genius behind this novel is not what is written, its how it is written. If you look at each character you can see that they represent the country they are from and the actions they do are similar to the way the country acted in the situation. The British were in Vietnam during this time, reaping the benefits of the country and watching everything go on with out taking action, which is exactly what Fowler does. The Vietnamese were weak in terms of political standings in the world. They did not have much power and let other countries use them. But most of all Vietnam was a beautiful country; this is exactly how Phoung is portrayed. And at this time, America realized that the war was out of the control of the French and they decided to get involved. America basically went to Vietnam not knowing what the people wanted or how they lived and took over. And this is what Pyle does in the story. Graham Greene observed all of this when he was in Vietnam in the early 1950's and took a stand by writing this book.The reason why I enjoyed this book so much is because it is true. I can look at this book and see the outline for how the Vietnam War started and I can see it through the eyes of a non-American for once. I wish Graham Greene were alive today. I wish a mind like his would create a book about the United States current situation with Iraq. Perhaps it would be called The Quite American. Fowler would be a peace worker in Iraq, Phoung would be the frightened Iraqi woman who was somewhat oppressed but was able to live happily with Fowler's help, and Pyle would be the American who came out of no where and promised to take care of Phoung. In this novel Pyle would destroy her town and overthrow the people in charge of her town. He would take control and than realize that the corrupt person whose place he took had allot of oil. Pyle and many other people like himself would take the oil and leave. They would lie to the people and promises to help them but in the end, Phoung and the people would be left in the aftermath that Pyle had left. The book would end with Fowler protesting this, and instead of him killing Pyle, Pyle would kill him.In conclusion, I recommend everyone should read this book at one point in his or her life. Hopefully it would open some eyes and turn some heads as it did to mine."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Or perhaps it's that the 1950s lasted 30 years in England. It was plainly still 1955 in England when i spent some months there in 1979, and indeed I suspect that it was 1955 for Graham Greene from the end of World War 2 until the catastrophe of Margaret Thatcher. Greene wrote six books in the '50s or thereabouts: The Third Man (1949), The End of the Affair, Loser Takes All, The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana, and A Burnt-Out Case (1960). In none of them was the awkward Quietist Catholicism of his earlier novels sustained; instead both his 'novels' and his 'entertainments' became increasingly anti-colonial in content and critical of both Catholic and Anglo-American values. Throughout his long career, nonetheless, Greene was the most ineffably British of novelists, at least as we readers perceive him through his literary personae, in whom diffidence and arrogance are two faces of the same shilling.The 'narrator' of The Quiet American, the aging British journalist Thomas Fowler, on assignment in French Vietnam, is the epitome of that blend of diffidence and arrogance, the latter politely sheathed by the former. Fowler has a cosy live-in lover, Phuong, a moderate opium dependency, and no desire to return to the UK, to his bitter Anglican wife who refuses him a divorce. At a club with Phuong, he meets Alden Pyle, the \\"quiet American\\" of the title, a young, handsome Harvard-grad supposedly in Vietnam on a non-military mission. In fact, Pyle is an OSS agent provocateur, a liaison to the rogue general Trinh Minh The, whom Pyle's superiors perceive as an effective \\"Third Force\\" in the war between the French colonialists and the 'communist' Viet Minh. Fowler and Pyle become rivals for 'possession' of Phuong. And that's all I mean to reveal of the plot!This 'triangle of passion' is the skeleton of the novel, but it's Greene's depiction of Alden Pyle that sustains the exceptional interest of the book. Pyle is seemingly a naive idealist, innocent, brash, firmly convinced of the good intentions of his country, committed to the political philosophy of York Harding (an imaginary scholar). There are rumors that Pyle's persona was based on the real-life American Edward Lansdale, a CIA 'counter-insurgency expert' whose interventions in Vietnam, Cuba, and elsewhere qualify him as one of the colorful scoundrels of the 20th C. In any case, Pyle's idealism is of the sort that accommodates slaughter of innocents. To put it bluntly, he's a terrorist, but \\"our\\" terrorist. The gauze that separates \\"idealism\\" from ideological fanaticism is very thin in Pyle. But Graham Greene is not merely depicting one plausible malefactor -- one who can smile and smile and yet be a villain. Pyle is not only a 'quiet' American; he's an archetypal American, a synecdoche of America as Greene perceived it. \\"I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused,\\" Fowler says about Pyle; Greene is saying the same about America: \\"I never knew a People who had better motives for all the catastrophes they caused.\\"Remember that Greene wrote this book before 1955, when it was published, and therefore before the French debacle at Dien Bin Phu. But it reveals what everybody except the American public knew: that America was waiting in the wings to take over the anti-communist crusade in 'Indochina'. Pyle describes explicitly to Fowler what later would be called the \\"Domino Theory\\". Pyle's utter inability to grasp the mentality of the Vietnamese would become exactly what led to the inability of Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon to comprehend why America could only 'win' a war in Vietnam by \\"turning it into a parking lot\\". In effect, Graham Greene was the most prescient writer since Nostradamus! This little novel is such an accurate prophecy of the American calamity in Vietnam a decade later that, if it had been read carefully in Washington, it might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I've become a Graham Greene fan. Never disappointing, always engaging and thought-provoking. Like The Power and the Glory and Our Man in Havana, and others, The Quiet American places a very personal story within a momentous historical setting, finding the questions and the personal struggles the historical setting poses for the lives of ordinary people.The Quiet American raises questions about the inevitability of taking a stand. There is no such thing as an observer. Sooner or later, merely observing is taking a stand, through knowledge and inaction.It also recalls all the questions about western involvement in the cultures and politics of other countries. Fowler and Pyle, the British and American figures in the book, take different approaches. Fowler is the observer, Pyle the committer. They fall in love with the same woman, with Fowler seeking comfort and pleasure to pass the days while Pyle promises to marry the woman. Fowler professes disinterest in taking sides in the complicated politics of French-occupied Viet Nam. Pyle takes sides. Pyle's actions ultimately compel Fowler to make a choice.There is certainly an eerie feeling to the book. Although written in 1955 about the French involvement in Viet Nam, it mirrors American involvement in the 60s and 70s. What we learned so much later was apparent to Greene in 1955. Fowler and others move among the native population with the air of being in charge of something, while the divided population carries on their struggles and their resistance invisibly to the westerners, until it's too late for them to do anything about it. The war is recognizably unwinnable for the French, as Fowler remarks and as everyone seems to know, except Pyle and his Harvard-inspired fantasy of a \\"third force\\" beyond colonialism and Communism. But the war continues on its own momentum. Viet Nam is itself the \\"third force\\" -- it reasserts itself inevitably, no matter what the French do to subdue it, just as it did no matter what we did later."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Re-reading this book, it actually seems better than when I first read it a few years ago. Graham Greene was probably the best-ever writer of certain kinds of book about disaffected characters in actual historical and geographical situations. Many have written about the fact that the lead character, Thomas Fowler, embodied many characteristics of Greene himself, and the amazing thing about this is that Greene makes the character so unpleasant.The writing is magnificent. Greene was a supremely economical writer who could create a mood or an impression in fewer words than anyone else I know. He was also a master of irony, and makes much of the fact that Pyle, the quiet American of the title, was actually more dangerous because of his innocence and basic goodness.The Quiet American also fills a prophetic role, as we can look back on the many noisy Americans who arrived in Vietnam after the time of this fictional quiet one and amply justified Greene's feeling that they would make a great mess of things.The other thing that struck me was the faithfulness of Philip Noyce's movie to the text. Many things that I thought the movie had created or changed completely were simply changes of emphasis or dramatisations of things that were too vague or abstract for the screen. Even the changes in Pyle's character were simply attempted clarifications of aspects that were ambiguous in the book - which ironically had the effect of making his character even more ambiguous."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"If you plan to buy this book by all means get this edition. The novel is very readable and Greene is a real wordsmith. The thing is this edition has news articles by the author about Indochina,critical reviews (the good and the bad), interviews with Ho Chi Minh and American generals, a plot summary of the film and documents about the war. It also has topics for discussion or school papers. The text is less than 200 pages and readable so there is time to read the additional material. This book has the last chapter first such that you know the final result and the rest is leading up to the events in the first chapter. It is a gimmick but it works. I had to re-read the first chapter when I finished; couldn't help it. Find this edition, Viking Critical Library."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene captures the essence of an America long removed from its present being. His metaphor examines the fall of classical imperialism, the disillusionment of post-World War II nations, and the dying innocence of the United States as it embarked on a dim odyssey to Indo-China. Graham's characters epitomize the grander feelings of the globe in tight, recognizable boxes. The hard-bitten journalist, Fowler, represents old imperialism, and the downfall of powers. Pyle, \\"the quiet American\\" can symbolize innocence, and his own transition from innocent to guilty-party signifies the change overcoming the United States following World War II. The quiet Phuong is the desire not only of Pyle and Fowler, but the desire of the West. She represents something that the West lustily desires to possess, but remains an enigma and subsequently a painful addiction.Greene, per usual, weaves such a wonderful tapestry story and description, that the reader is taken back to colonial Indo-China but in addition, his molding of characters conveys the sadness of the country. Indeed, Greene has once again created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This book is one of the best examples of Graham Greene's gift of weaving a personal story, usually centered around a rather ordinary and unattractive character, into the events of a country in conflict. Resist the temptation to read too much about the U.S. effort in Vietnam (or, if you prefer, the current Iraq situation) into Greene's description of the French-Vietminh conflict; it's a great novel, not a prophetic political analysis. What does apply is Greene's scorching characterization of Alden Pyle, the title character, a young Foreign Service officer (or more likely an intelligence operative under diplomatic cover) who too enthusastically applies his classroom-only theories to a nation and culture he does not understand, with terrible consequences. As the protagonist/narrator, Fowler, remarks, in one of Greene's perfectly turned phrases, \\"I never knew a man with such good motives for all the harm he did.\\" Working in Washington, I've met Alden Pyle's near-clones all too many times. So, apparently, did Robert McNamara, who said in his book, _In Retrospect_, that one of the biggest causes for the U.S. debacle in Vietnam was that the analysts who really knew Southeast Asia had too much trouble making their views heard at the decision level. Doctrine, often inapplicable, prevailed over knowledge. This book should be required reading for prospective diplomats, intelligence analysts and military officers about to be posted overseas. Ignorance and arrogance make a dangerous mixture, anywhere, any time. What makes this novel more than a political polemic or an ordinary love triangle story is Greene's deftly leading us into looking over Fowler's shoulder as he wrestles with a difficult moral judgment, confounded by his own admittedly selfish motives. In Greene's portayals of the world, nobody is perfect, but moral choices still get made, with real consequences. Those who think there are nice neat theories that explain everything should read Greene and learn. And, by the way, the story is entertaining, as well, and the descriptions of places most of us have never seen are riveting."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Maybe the innocent (quiet, American) Pyle is as dangerous to the country of Vietnam as a leper without a bell but Graham Greene must have smoked too much opium doing research for this novella. This must be one of the silliest, most self-important books about war that I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American, though written in 1955, highlighted the struggle America would face in Vietnam once the French had been ousted. Amazing foresight and clarity from Greene.An overview of the plot finds a tired, older British journalist (Thomas Fowler)who's been in Vietnam longer than he cares to remember. Addicted to opium and cared for by a young Vietnamese girl (Phuong) who is also his lover, Fowler's character gives off that intellectually tired air. Alden Pyle, fresh from the United States befriends Fowler and soon, Pyle, falls in love with Phuong and tells her he wants to marry her. The two men vie for Phuong.That's the plot in a nutshell. Greene's prose is dripping with color. He can set a scene so rich, so detailed, you are truly there sitting in on the conversations. Fowler and Pyle converse in such a way that the whole situation in Vietnam is argued from the freshly washed, bright eyed stance of idealistic America and the tired, done with colonialism Europe. Greene's work, in some case, serves as a blue-print for America's eventual departure from Vietnam which, for all intents, was deemed a loss.I had to re-read a a few paragraphs here and there due to the wonderful way Greene uses words and spatters random thoughts throughout the text. You have to focus you have to read consciously or you'll miss all the nuances that make Greene the gifted author he is.Fantastic stuff."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I probably do not need to waste many words praising the genius of Graham Greene. Writing in a sparse, economical style reminiscent of America's own Ernest Hemingway, Greene magnificently captures the feel of Vietnam in the days of the Indo-China war, describing the scene from the viewpoint of one Thomas Fowler, an English war correspondent as much in love with a young Vietnamese woman as he is with living in limbo in a foreign, war torn country.\\"The Quiet American\\", however, resonates not only because Greene so expertly creates the sense of fatigue and isolation that Fowler feels, but because as a slice of history, it foretells what a horrific mistake the United States would make a decade later when it would fully invest itself in the war. The quiet American of the title is Mr. Pyle, a government agent whose intentions in Vietnam are anything but clear. Pyle and Fowler become friends, sort-of, and in one of the scariest and most haunting war scenes in literature, find themselves stranded in a remote lookout tower with two Vietnamese youth as enemy soldiers patrol the area killing and destroying everything in their path. What happens creates a bond between the two Europeans that eventually leads Fowler to know more than he wants to know about his American friend.The unsettling aspect of the book is that Greene clearly understands the nature of Vietnam and its history, and even as early as 1955, when the book was finished, makes it clear that European (and by extension, American) involvement in Vietnam is a grave mistake. The book could be rewritten with all American characters and set in the late 1960's and all the mistakes and tragedies and lessons that Greene urges the reader to learn would still be relevant. Art predicts reality and yet no one was wise enough to pay attention.If you are a history buff, read this book. If you are a fan of literature, read this book. \\"The Quiet American\\" is an undeniable masterpiece- a first rate author at the top of his game."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I broke my rule when it came to The Quiet American, having seen the film from 2002, before reading the book. This isn't a rule I break often but having enjoyed the film when I saw it a few years back I was naturally delighted to read Greene's novel from 1955, which was lambasted as anti-American on its release but is regarded more favourably today.The story focuses on a complex love triangle amidst the First Indochina War. Thomas Fowler is a British journalist who has been stationed in Vietnam for two years to report on the struggle between the French army and the Vietnamese guerrillas. Fowler is married but, while in Vietnam, he has taken a young lover, Phuong, who he plans to marry but requires permission from his wife for a divorce, which she is unwilling to grant. One day Fowler meets Alden Pyle, the quiet American of the title, who is a young idealist with an unknown agenda in Vietnam. Complications arise when Pyle falls in love with Phuong and in the background the war continues to escalate with Fowler and Pyle having very different involvements in it.Fowler is middle aged in the book with Phuong being at least thirty years younger, but he has no concerns of losing her until he meets Pyle. The young and quiet American falls for Phuong immediately and though he makes his feelings known to Fowler, he does it in a polite and friendly manner, the perfect gentlemen really. Phuong's sister despises Fowler so when Pyle appears she does everything she can to facilitate a marriage between her sister and the American. Fowler is in danger of losing Phuong, especially when he hides the fact he is due for a transfer back to Britain and that his wife is refusing to grant a divorce. Pyle is initially gracious in defeat to Fowler when he gives Phuong the ultimatum of choosing between the two men, but when he learns the truth about Fowler's lies he is quick to play his hand and steal Phuong for himself. Phuong has no powerful voice in the narrative. She is very much subject to Fowler and Pyle, comparable to Vietnam under colonial rule.As the war continues, Fowler reports on the atrocities and meets with Pyle whose ideals are in stark contrast to French colonialism that is struggling to keep hold of Vietnam and the rising Communism that is threatening to oust the existing masters. Pyle tells Fowler of a Third Force, which he believes is the answer to Vietnam's future. Fowler is sceptical. He is the teacher to Pyle's young and opinionated student, the veteran of Indochina while Pyle is a virgin in the country. Though Pyle wins Phuong from Fowler he isn't finished there. He has another reason for being in Vietnam and the Third Force he speaks of is ready to lash out.I really enjoyed The Quiet American. Considering Greene wrote this before America's known involvement in Vietnam, following the exit of the French in 1954, is impressive. It was controversial at the time, being heavily criticised for the depiction of the American, Pyle, but its themes would resonate for the next two decades with the Vietnam War, which would prove so costly and so controversial. Many readers have argued Fowler and Pyle are metaphors for Britain and America. Fowler represents the old and battered British Empire now on the wane, while Pyle's naivety mirrors that of the US that committed years to Vietnam and got its fingers burnt. Greene's novel can be read on the surface and be enjoyed, or you can delve much deeper and find equal pleasure in this book.The Quiet American is a short but compelling read. A love triangle set amidst the French struggle for supremacy in the First Indochina War. That we learn the fate of Pyle from the opening pages doesn't hinder the book, but makes it all the more intriguing. I've not read many novels by Graham Greene but I'd be surprised if many are better than this one."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Greene's prescience about America and Vietnam, years before we actually invested our blood and treasure there, is astounding. Its applicability to Iraq and Afghanistan is equally amazing - and disheartening. Either we never learn, which is one widely held interpretation, or the same merchants of death who profited from the earlier war (and the still earlier Korean war) are still profiting from the later wars and have the influence to keep the wars going. By the way, all of these wars were and are essentially illegal, as they have never been declared by Congress as required by the Constitution. (The last declared war was World War II, declared a few days after the Japanese bombed our fleet at Pearl Harbor in December 1941.)But of course this is a novel, not reportage (though the protagonist is a reporter), and must be judged on readability. Well, I couldn't put it down, though none of the characters except the protagonist was fully fleshed out - and I couldn't entirely relate to him, as I have never smoked an opium pipe. But everything that happens seems to matter - to the people directly involved, to many other people, finally to entire nations (Vietnam, of course, but also Britain, France, and ultimately the United States). In the midst of this book, one's daily concerns seem to fade into triviality - this is real life, one feels, real problems, real horrors, real yearnings of the human soul. Greene strikes a chord which I haven't heard much since the days long ago when I read the great 19th century Russian novelists Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Turgenev et al. and the Germans Mann, Brecht, and Erich Maria Remarque.Is this a great novel? Compared with War and Peace, the Brothers Karamazov, Fathers and Sons, The Magic Mountain, Arch of Triumph . . . no, not really. But what I think it is, is a readable novel by a great writer completely immersed in the great themes of life: love, idealism (even of the dangerous kind), war, casual suffering and death. Do I think everyone should read it? Oh, yes; though I think one needs some years of life to appreciate it and would hesitate to assign it in high school (I note some young reviewers expressing perplexity at what it's all about; give them time and they'll understand)."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Our Man in Havana is a classic. Extremely well written. The best fiction book I have read, full of twists and turns and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"When reading Graham Greene's novel, he states without saying, \\"A good American is a dead American.\\" This novel was assigned for 20th Century American history class in college. I have never read a Graham Greene novel. But I was pleasantly surprised by it, it's about an American idealist, Alden Pyle, who goes to Vietnam in the 1950s on a government mission from the United States more like a spy to learn what the French Armies have on the Communist guerrillas. In hindsight, the story occurs during the Communism and McCarthyism era. This book is written by a well-known British Catholic author.He writes about Alden Pyle's murder and his life there in Vietnam. He meets a cynical British journalist Fowler and has an affair with Phuong, the Vietnamese mistress caught between them. The love triangle is never really explained like what the two men see in Phuong. I analyze this book as the American; the Briton; and a Vietnamese caught in a power struggle. The American and Briton males in this novel come across as arrogant and misogynistic towards Phuong. In many ways, Phuong represents Vietnam and is the prize in the battle between the old regime of the British Empire and the new superpower of the United States.When I first read this book, I had no inclination about it. I never thought to take this book seriously but I do. I see the love triangle as a way to represent the countries and who has the power over Vietnam. Sadly, Phuong is not as simple minded or innocent. She is rather mysterious, manipulative, and intelligent. If Phuong represents Vietnam, the country is a lot smarter than their colonial powers like the United States and England. Phuong represents Vietnam as a woman who doesn't necessarily need to be saved like a damsel in distress. I'm sure people will disagree but to each his own."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is very much a Graham Greene novel. It is a focused and tight narrative; Greene is completely in control of his materials, his organization, his tone and characters. There is fluidity to the novel that makes it seem easy, quickly won, which is hard thing to accomplish. We see all this in The Quiet American, and also get a wide glimpse of French Indochina just before the American's took over the war from France. So in this sense, the novel is a great marker of the changes American would endure in Vietnam in the years after its publication.Greene does advance the end a bit quickly, as if he wanted to finish this novel and needed a device that doesn't quite work. For the reader, that speedy conclusion takes some of the edge of the work, making it a bit casual. Greene wanted a happy ending but he did nothing to lay the ground work for this outcome. So the end is a letdown."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This novel easily ranks as one of the best I have ever read. The setting is Vietnam during the French campaign of the 1950's and the novel uses the war as the backdrop for the classic lovers' triangle plot. Greene weaves an engaging narrative with searing truths about love, war, and the loss of innocence that accompany them. His protagonist, through which we witness the events in the novel, is exceptionally well-developed, and his cynical view of life and love are prophetic in their analysis of the situation in Vietnam.The book is concise and perhaps more memorable for it. Greene's easy style reminds one of Hemingway, and his protagonist is also a journalist. The novel wastes few words with every paragraph advancing the plot or the development of the small cast of characters. The key message of the book is that one must eventually take sides, in love and in war. It is impossible to remain a neutral player as the protagonist learns to his chagrin."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Greene's novel portrays the beginning on America's entry to the Vietnam war from the point of view of an English Journalist, Fowler. It is full of flowery speech, lyrical and smooth and portrays a novel of sexual intrigue, espionage and the horror of war in a superb fashion."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This book was written in the 50s. The author obviously was very smart to understand the American people, a country where people never grow up. The adjectives Greene uses to describe his American colleagues: big, noisy, boyish. The third force was repeated again in 1990s with Americans helping Al-Quida against Russians in Afghanistan. Obviously nothing was learnt from the Vietnam disaster. By supplying weapons to Islamic fanatics in Pakistan in 1990s, Americans permanently destabilized the region, created generations of terrorists, had to deal with events like 9-11. But you can bet nothing will be learnt. The problem of right wingers in the U.S. comes from the fact that when you try to live by hypocrisy - two conflicting ideals of pure and naked capitalism and religious orthodoxy - you end up creating a monster of yourself. But never discuss this with a redneck: \\"We are the greatest country in the world, and we can do no wrong\\". May be it should be changed to \\"We are full of schit\\"."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This book is a 1983 reprint, not a first edition, as the ad led me to believe.

This was a great book set during the Vietnam war. I am not much for war stories, but when you add in the love story, it captures the reader. A love triangle between the three main characters is a reflection of the political triangle between the three main countries.I do not think that President Bush quite captured the essence of what Greene was trying to say when he mentioned the book in his speech last year.I was not impressed with the movie at all, after reading the book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American by Graham Greene is a typically great Greene novel. The more I read by Greene, the more I admire and respect and LOVE to read his work. This novel is set in Vietnam during the Vietnamese fight against French rule (before heavy American involvement). The main character, and narrator, Fowler, is a British reporter, going through the motions of filing his reports, living with his Vietnamese girlfriend, Phuong, and, basically, living. He has a wife in Britain with whom his relationship is irretrievably broken down, but his wife refuses on religious grounds to grant him a divorce. Alden Pyle, the \\"quiet American\\" is a young man he meets from the American Legation, an idealistic and sort of willfully nave man who seems to believe everything he reads in books about Vietnam, but doesn't seem to notice the life around him. Fowler, his opposite, seems dulled and soggy by his complete acceptance of the pain of reality, but even then the horror, violence and disregard for human life of full-out warfare does break in on him.This book was recently made into a movie with Michael Caine as Fowler and Brendan Frasier as Pyle, which is why we picked it up to read aloud just now, but it is so wonderfully and timelessly Greene. It has the unreliable moral atmosphere of most Greene novels that I've read, with the antihero narrator that one dislikes while one empathizes with him. This is another Great Greene!"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Obvious metaphors, good ones though. This is my least favorite of Greene's books. maybe because the characters are not as engaging...."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"First, let me say that this novel is brilliant, insightful and lyric. It manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time and is just a true joy to read on so many levels. That said, the reading of \\"The Quiet American\\" in this audio book format leaves something to be desired.Joseph Porter has a lovely voice well-suited to the narrator, and even well-suited to the main female character Phuong. However, as soon as the titular quiet american breaks his silence, the feigned American accent Porter reads with is simply appalling. I found it beyond distracting. I find that if you can't do an accent well for a public reading, best to leave it alone and read in your own voice. Joseph Porter could be forgiven for reading the lines of the American characters with a British lilt. There was no reason to forge ahead just to decimate the reading so awfully."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Used this book for school, I personally didn't like it, but It was helpful for that class.

A british journalist, Fowler, lives with his mistress Phuong in Saigon. Everything goes the right way until Pyle enters the story. Everybody calls him the quiet American. Fowler and Pyle become friends, but then there is a problem. Pyle falls in love with Phuong and wants to marry her...The story contains interesting characters. It is the story about a friendship of two completely different men who love the same woman.First I didn't like to read the story, because it's a difficult language with all the special \\"war expressions\\". At the end many things become clear. The love story I don't find very special, but interesting. I recommend the book to people who like love stories with historical background."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"What amazes me so often is how many people think of Fowler as a heroic example of British dignity. The character is reprehensible: he is cheating on his wife, a Catholic woman, trying to force her to violate her faith to divorce him. He lies to the young Vietnamese girl with whom he is having an affair. He arranges for her true love to be assassinated, and I always read that Fowler represents the best and the American the worst. Some readers have a problem with seeing what actually is happening, and separating that from the standard refrain their college professors told them. As the author of A THINKER'S DAMN, the story about the making of The Quiet American into a film, I can tell you that Greene himself was nearly as petty as Fowler. Based on misinformation, Greene condemned the motion picture, its star, and its director, without seeing a script, seeing the movie, or waiting until the project was completed. The Quiet American is a fascinating book with an unreliable narrator--and the problem is that many readers cannot differentiate Greene from Fowler."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene's masterpiece, the Quiet American provides and interesting perspective upon Vietnam during the decline of the French presence in Indochina.

The author, a Brit, does an excellent job in setting the scene and characters. Virtually everything is appropriate to what must have been the time and place. Therein lies the diffficulty with the novel. While very well written, with sharp, cynical dialog, it is all too easy to read too much into &quot;QA&quot;. There are all kinds of opportunities to behold allegorical references in Alden Pyle (the namesake),Vigot(the French detective), Fowler(the cynical Brit journalist) and especially Phoung, the young Saigon woman. Poor Phoung!! She and that sister will outlive us all. Armed with 20/20 historical hindsight, how easy it is to proclaim that &quot;QA&quot; is prophetic and prescient! If only LBJ had read it! Or Nixon!! This reviewer (and Vietnam vet) is a bit more cynical.The devil's advocate in me might state that Greene merely wrote a superior novel, set in Vietnam, but with nothing more added. Pyle, Phoung and the whole crew represent no one other than themselves. The story can stand quite capably on its' own two feet. with no &quot;historical perspectives&quot; required. The conflict between these views is the essence of &quot;QA&quot;. I have to mention a classic line from the plot: &quot;The French Army controlled the highways until 7PM. After that, they controlled the watch towers&quot;.That was Vietnam in a sentance. Every night our unit went back to our base camp, closed the gates and posted guys in the guard towers. Vietnam is a scary place after sundown and Charley (the Viet Cong or &quot;Victor Charley&quot;) ran the place after dark. The headline is borrowed from my buddy, Jim Lydlle, the chaplain's assistant. Of the 2 opinions above, I prefer the latter. &quot;QA&quot; is not prophecy. It takes an American or a Frenchman to capture the essence of Indochina, just as I believe only Brits and Irishmen can write about Ireland. Readers wishing to appreciate the fascinating French Vietnamese period should pounce on &quot;Street Without Joy&quot; by the late Bernard Fall. The reader able to ignore all these constraints will enjoy &quot;The Quiet American&quot; on its'own merits. Too many constraints?. Welcome to Vietnam!"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The subject line is Greene's description of Alden Pyle. Readers may speculate on the larger, metaphorical dimensions of the book's three principal characters, and impose them on their countries of origin. Pyle is the young, crew-cut American, fresh out of an Ivy League school, over-schooled and undereducated, his head stuffed full of the geo-political notions of the fictional York Harding. Fowler is the cynical, accommodating middle-aged British reporter, just \\"reporting the facts,\\" not taking sides, until he finally feels he has to. And there is the lovely Ms Phuong, trying to make the best of it in a troubled landscape, a lover to both men, and perhaps a symbol of Vietnam herself.It was January, 1994, and I was leaving the Hanoi War Museum, one of the first wave of Americans to return. Vietnam was just on the cusp of letting tourists wander the country freely; the War Museum had not been \\"sanitized\\" yet (which would happen in only two more years), to remove exhibits that might offend our \\"sensibilities.\\" And over in the corner was an elderly Vietnamese lady, selling books from a small pile, only two of which were in English, this being one of them. Was it just chance, or did she know that this was the quintessential book about the American involvement in Vietnam, prescient beyond belief, having been written at the very, very beginning, in 1955? I had read it prior to my first, year-long trip there, and decided to purchase another copy.Today the book is even more relevant, in ways that even Greene did not anticipate. It continues to merit re-reads, I've finished my third. Greene modeled the character of Pyle on the very real life Kermit Roosevelt, who led the CIA's coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran, in 1953. Pyle was indifferent to the \\"collateral damage\\" of his actions, the civilians who had died for a higher purpose, \\"democracy.\\" And it was this indifference that finally pushed Fowler to take sides. For a number of years in the \`50's and \`60's the US Immigration would not allow Greene into the United States. They don't have to state a reason, but certainly this book would be a leading contender.Greene's biographers reveal a very unpleasant man, who betrayed most of his friends. No doubt there are many elements of Greene in Fowler, an unpleasant man who betrays the person who saved his life. None of the characters are \\"uplifting,\\" all are profoundly flawed, but wouldn't there be something absurdly wrong to fill a novel with uplifting characters that are involved in one of the more serious, and long-lasting follies of the 20th Century? We should dislike these people.In real life Graham Green visited Dien Bien Phu on Dec. 12, 1953 (per Bernard Fall). One of the great \\"takeaways\\" of this book for me was Greene's description of the lies of the French military, courageously retaking villages that had never been reported loss, always able to definitively report the enemy dead, but not their own, \\"because they were too busy advancing...\\" et al. All the PR \\"spin\\" that would presage our own.Greene reserves his main animus for York Harding. The professor of the Ivy League, sitting in his Ivory Tower, concocting theories that turned Vietnamese peasants into a Red Tide sweeping towards Sydney. Consider: \\"York Harding's a very courageous man. Why in Korea--.\\" \\"He wasn't an enlisted man, was he? He had a return ticket. With a return ticket, courage becomes an intellectual exercise, like a monk's flagellation.\\" Later, and more specifically: \\"He's the man you are looking for, Vigot. He killed Pyle--at long range.\\" Indeed, Harding managed to \\"blind\\" this very bright man to the reality before his eyes.How many York Harding's do we have today, constructing grandiose theories about the \\"clash of civilizations\\" and our duty to spread \\"democracy\\" throughout the Middle East, oblivious to the collateral damage, when Pyle's real life counterpart, Kermit Roosevelt, worked so hard to snuff it out because the people elected \\"the wrong guy.\\" This book should be required reading in every university today, and by all serious readers thereafter, and twice might not be enough."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is my favorite Graham Greene novel, despite \\"The Power and the Glory\\" being widely held as his masterpiece. In typical Greene style, Vietnam of the mid 50's is painted vividly as seen through the eyes of Fowler, a British journalist covering the war when the only western power involved was a crumbling colonial France.Fowler is a vestige of what our Rumsfield might have called \\"old Europe\\". He is old, tired, urbane but practical. His world weariness also makes him corruptible. He shares a flat with a Vietnamese national named Phuong, Vietnamese for Phoenix. He is good to her and she enables him, but to call what they share love would be rather too strong a word.Enter Pyle, young healthy CIA buck from the States. Pyle is idealistic as he is naive. Like a baby gorilla, he seems to be wholly unaware of his strength. Acting on a wave of badly informed idealism, Pyle wreaks havoc on the tenuous equilibrium of those trapped in a war zone. The helpless Phuong is particularly vulnerable, but like her namesake, she and her country will rise again from the destruction ravaging the land.At publication, this novel was perceived as anti-American and roundly criticized in this country. Like the Vatican's denouncement of the whisky priest in Greene's \\"The Power and the Glory\\", one tends to think that the offences were caused by Greene's rendering of a cowardly priest and naive American being dead-on. The irony is that the American backlash to the perceived slight did cause Greene to dislike Americans: a case of life imitating art imitating life.This is an outstanding book, and the last 50 years has only made it more powerful. It is the drama of global policy played out by sympathetic and flawed humans."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Here is a remarkably subtle and slowly simmering novel about, if I may resort to a clich&eacute;, love and war. The story takes place in the war-torn Vietnam of the 1950s, when the French colonialists were brutally trying to hold on to their failing system of subjugation, and the Americans were just beginning to get involved. In tandem with this mostly forgotten but ominous period of history, we get a forlorn love triangle involving an upwardly mobile young Vietnamese woman, a middle-aged British journalist who is mentally exhausted from the war, and a nave young American operative who knows nothing about the true misguided horrors of his idealism. Both the love triangle and the surrounding carnage of war are used to great effect by Graham Greene, as he slowly lays out subversive and hard-hitting ruminations on the difficulties of complex human relationships, and the soul-crushing horrors and futility of war. These realizations are mostly from the tired and cynical mind of Fowler the British journalist &#8211; a very well-drawn character who finds it impossible to maintain his attempted neutrality in both the romantic and political struggles around him. This novel is a quiet masterpiece that subversively explores how the political and the personal can affect real people. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Set during the French War in Vietnam, \\"The Quiet American\\" is a multifaceted story told in the words of Thomas Fowler, a cynical British correspondent and one of the novel's two main characters. The story involves a struggle between Fowler and Pyle, an American undercover operative and Fowler's romantic rival. Pyle and Fowler hold opposing views of the war, love, God and democracy. Whatever matters to man, they disagree about. Fowler, whose vision of reality stifles his belief in ideals, emerges as a romantic and ideological rival of Pyle, whose ideals blind him to reality. America's Cold War policy in Southeast Asia is critically presented in the person of Pyle. Masterfully written, Graham Greene confronts us with two flawed, stereotypical characters and leaves us to determine the hero and the villain. I still have not made up my mind. A work which can leave the reader in such a quandary is a great work of art. Read and form your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This slender, gripping tome about the waning days of French colonialism in Vietnam is also a fascinating meditation on American conduct in Indochina. Without having any foresight on his part, Graham Greene's \\"The Quiet American\\" offers us an excellent literary prediction of American involvement in Vietnam and the rest of Indochina. On one level this novel works as a gripping thriller, hurtling the reader with questions regarding the enigmatic Pyle and his seemingly fanatic interest in creating and nurturing a \\"third force\\" in Vietnam. It is also an elegant study in contrasts between, the older, indeed cynical, Englishman Fowler, and his seemingly naive, brash American counterpart, Pyle. A study in contrasts that is exemplified by their relationship with Phuong, the Vietnamese woman whom Fowler regards as his own, before she is seduced by Pyle. And this triangle becomes more intense, more fascinating as the novel hurls towards the end, highlighting Pyle's drastic transformation from a \\"quiet\\" American to a crafty manipulator willing to condone the deaths of innocents. Without question, this is one of the finest novels written in the last century."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Greene's The Quiet American is powerful and moving and anyone who desires to better understand the mindset of American policymakers at the outset of the United States' deepened involvement in Indochina. Greene writes with the candor and insight of a seasoned overseas correspondant and shows the ideals and idealism that propelled Vietnamese and American interests to tragically clash. Greene portrays the characters in the novel in a manner in which they are complex and very real and not soundbytes and stereotypes that confront us in other books and in the current news media.A valuable bonus of the Viking Critical Library edition are the essays at the end of the book that provide additional detail to Greene's story. In addition to reviews of the book in the context of US diplomacy, espionage and counterinsurgency, of particular worth is the brief history of American military involvement in the late 1950s/early 1960s in Indochina by Frank Futrell, former Historian of the Air Force. Futrell is knowledgeable and a prolific yet very readable writer, and his 14-page essay at the end of the book serves as a stark epilogue to the novel."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I first read this book in the early 1960's as a college student before my year as a soldier in Vietnam (1968-69), and I think I have re-read it at least 15 times since then. It is a beautiful book as a work of fiction, and compellingly prophetic (it was written in 1955) about the future of America's expedition into this strange and beautiful country. You can read and enjoy it on several levels. A classic."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I recently read THE QUIET AMERICAN directly after having read Greene's THE COMEDIANS. It is striking how similar the two novels are, although they were written about ten years apart. They both deal with political intrigue in a \\"third world\\" country (Vietnam in \\"Quiet American\\", Haiti in \\"Comedians\\"); they both are critical of American intervention (although it is much more front and center in \\"Quiet American\\"); they both feature somewhat skewed love triangles; and they both are narrated by a worldly, shrewd, selfish, and almost repugnant narrator who it is easy to see (perhaps unfairly) as the alter ego of the author. Both novels are easy to read and wear well, but I give the nod to THE QUIET AMERICAN.Written around 1955, it is remarkable for its foresight of America's misguided venture in Southeast Asia. The \\"quiet\\" American is Pyle. He is a fresh-out-of-school, supremely self-assured member of the Eastern-establishment on a somewhat nebulous mission for an American secret service, the \\"OSS\\" or whatever the current initials might be (Graham perhaps did not know that its new incarnation was the \\"CIA\\"). \\"Innocent\\" might be a more fitting adjective for Pyle than \\"quiet\\". In any event, Greene presents a scathing picture of Pyle and the United States as purblind crusaders for democracy, innocent but oh-so-dangerous in their determined self-righteous zeal. The worldly and jaded British narrator (Fowler) comments to himself about Pyle: \\"he'll always be innocent, you can't blame the innocent, they are always guiltless. All you can do is control them or eliminate them. Innocence is a kind of insanity.\\"Meanwhile the recipients of the undercover U.S. political activism and intrigue don't appreciate the efforts on their behalf. Instead, \\"They want enough rice. * * * They don't want to be shot at. They want one day to be much the same as another. They don't want our white skins around telling them what they want.\\" When dozens of civilians are killed or maimed in a bombing set by subversive forces sponsored and provisioned with explosives by Pyle, he justifies the bloodshed to Fowler with the comment that the victims \\"were only war casualties. * * * It was a pity, but you can't always hit your target. Anyway, they died in the right cause. * * * In a way you could say they died for democracy.\\" Fowler's response: \\"I wouldn't know how to translate that into Vietnamese.\\"The parallels with the current military mission in Iraq hardly need mention.Another prominent theme of THE QUIET AMERICANS, later reprised and developed further in \\"The Comedians\\", is the impossibiity (or if possible, the immorality) of a neutral, un-involved stance when cruely, death, and destruction are going on all around one.THE QUIET AMERICAN is worth reading, or re-reading, both as literate entertainment and as a sobering reminder of how little our national hubris and zeal for democracy have been moderated by wisdom and experience."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene's masterpiece, the Quiet American provides and interesting perspective upon Vietnam during the decline of the French presence in Indochina.

His romantic notion of everything occidental fueled his passion for life. As an example, Pyle's proclivity to put himself in harm's way embodies Greene's own disposition to reckless behavior . In nationalist terms, the love triangle of Pyle, Phuong and Fowler represents the best and worst of their cultures. Pyle represents the American newcomers to Southeast Asia and the beginning of the Cold War. His quiet persona offsets his cultural bigotry and ignorance of anything non-American. Fowler symbolizes not only Europe but also, more specifically, Great Britain and its failed colonial enterprises. Pyle's demise at the hands of Fowler is symbolic reparation for the colonies' defeat of the King's redcoats. Lastly, Phuong exemplifies the status quo in Vietnam. She, like her country, was willing to do what ever it took to survive. More importantly, she typifies the Vietnamese who used the French education system to oust the colonials. Greene's cold warrior is a characterization of Colonel Edward G. Lansdale. According to Michael Hunt, Lansdale arrived in Vietnam as an &quot;outgoing cold warrior bursting with fresh ideas.&quot; Lansdale was a successful advertising executive in San Francisco who sought the excitement of international espionage. He joined the newly formed spy operation, the Office of Strategic Services and, in 1945, his cold war efforts took him to the Philippines to dismantle the Communist led Huks who, like the Vietnamese, had worked to oust the Japanese during WW II. l Throughout his stay in Vietnam, Fowler sought to remain impartial and objective toward the war and his reporting of it, but his opium use contributed directly to the North's war coffers. The Viet-Minh's stake in Dien Bien Phu was opium which was pointed out by The Times (London) and Le Monde. The area according to The Times was the center of a fertile opium-growing district, which has been one of the Viet-Minh's most important sources of revenue. Le Monde said it was a major source of revenue for paying for arms, material and ammunition from China. The most important character in Greene's narrative is Phuong. She is the embodiment of the Vietnamese as they, like the mythical Egyptian bird, rose from the ashes of colonialism to reclaim their right to national emancipation. She is an Annamite who learned to speak French from the colonial schools throughout the country. Unlike the rigid examination system of the Confucian system, the French believed they could shape the people by controlling their language and literature. According to Benedict Anderson, the Confucian examinations were successfully abolished in Tonkin and Annam by 1918. The product of the effort would, therefore, be a body of civil servants that had participated in a French colonial education system. The second aim of educational policy was to produce a carefully calibrated quantum of French-speaking and French-writing Indochinese to serve as a politically reliable, grateful, and acculturated indigenous elite, filling the subordinate echelons of the colony's bureaucracies and larger commercial enterprises."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)\\"I'm too old to run with a rifle. And this isn't my war\\"Graham Greene's exploration of the French Indochina Wars evokes memories for me of Saigon, the media's coverage of the war, and my own participation as a military journalist (now there's an oxymoron if there ever was one)Written in 1955, \\"The Quiet American\\" precedes US involvement by ten years, but it accurately forecast the gradual insinuation of US influence through the CIA, for which Pyle presumably worked. The story works on several levels: as a romantic novel in which the older man, Fowler, duels with Pyle for the affection of the Vietnamese girl Phuong; as an indictment of French and British colonialism; and as an allegory of war.Fowler is the British expatriate - middle aged, cynical, addicted to his opium pipe, and detached. Pyle is the young, college-educated American covert operative, ostensibly working for the Economic Attach&eacute;, but probably involved in arms deals. (One of his shipments, imported under the guise of economic aid, actually is plastics - probably explosives.)In one pivotal scene, Fowler travels north to see the action with his own eyes, rather than through the prism of French public relations. Pyle hitches a ride and joins him - then, in a masterful dramatic scene, prevails on Fowler to let him, Pyle, take Phuong.Unlike the American journalists, who spend their days listening to official explanations, and their nights drinking at the bar at the Continental Hotel (where I, too, drank in the evenings), Fowler wants to get out in the field. When he travels north, he finds evidence that things aren't going as well as the French High Command would have him believe:\\"Now, after four days, with the help of parachutists, the enemy had been pushed back half a mile around the town. This was a defeat: no journalists were allowed, no cables could be sent, for the papers must carry only victories. \\"Fowler perceived what few others did:\\"We are the old colonial peoples, Pyle, but we've learned a bit of reality. We've learned not to play with matches. This Third Force - it comes out of a book, that's all. General The's only a bandit with a few thousand men; he's not a national democracy\\"It was as if he had been staring at me through a letterbox to see who was there, and now, letting the flap fall, had shut out the unwelcome intruder. His eyes were out of sight.\\" I don't know what you mean, Thomas.\\"\\"Those bicycle bombs. They were a good joke, even though one man did lose a foot. But Pyle, you can't trust men like The'. They aren't going to save the east from Communism. We know their kind.\\"\\"We?'\\"The old colonialists.\\"\\"I thought you took no sides.\\"\\"I don't, Pyle, but if someone has got to make a mess of things in your outfit, leave it to Joe. Go home with Phuong. Forget the Third Force.\\"Pyle's nave faith in the ability of the people to forge their own destiny echoes more recent American intervention in foreign affairs."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Reading this book in 2005, the most amazing thing about it is that it was published in 1955. The sad history that is America's in involvement is yet to unfold, and it is all foresahdowed in this book. There is an English journalist, Fowler, old Europe, world weary, war weary, cynical, realistic; an American \\"diplomat\\", Pyle, idealistic, devious, naive, manipulative, acting out an academician's \\"third way\\"; and the Vietnamese woman they vie for, Phuong, dreamy, opportunistic, flirtatious, teasing, patiently biding, shrewd.Jaklak sez Check it out."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The newest film version has attracted alot of attention, casting Pyle in a more sinister light. However, it seems that Noyce has made Pyle into a decidedly different character than that which exists in the book. Pyle is a naive young man with his Asian sense coming largely from the books of \\"York Harding,\\" his college mentor. Greene seems to be skewering the American sense of chivalry which so dominated our international relations in the 1950's. Like the knight errant, Don Quixote, we seemed to be chasing after windmills but had much more firepower at our disposal and therefor were much more dangerous. Pyle never develops beyond an American caricature in this novel. He doesn't speak French or Vietnamese, carrying out a fantasy largely of his own construction.The book can be read as political allegory, but I think this is largely due to the way things turned out in Vietnam. At the base of this story is a love triangle that uses the escalating tensions in Vietnam as a backdrop for its action. The time is the waning days of French colonial rule. The battlle of Dien Bien Phu looms on the horizon. There is one scene were Fowler and Pyle are stuck at the front but for the most part the action takes place in the sinister streets of Saigon.It is indeed a very entertaining a story. However, I question how much Greene was reporting on the war but rather using the war to create the tension necessary in this love story. Fowler is the best realized character. The others read as caricatures taken from the fictitious mind of Fowler. It has much cinematic appeal but Noyce seems to have tried to \\"correct\\" the 1950's anti-communist film version, but has gone so far in the opposite direction as to make a similar mistake."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is an interesting story starting with the narrator being told of the murder of a young American friend in a pre-war Vietnam. Fowler, the narrator, then flashes back to the events leading up to the death, gradually revealing to the reader that there is more going on than what meets the eye.Like many other highly acclaimed novels (Crime and Punishment, The Heart of Darkness), The Quiet American is actually two things: a story and an idea. Don't mistake this story for a weak plot that Graham Greene has used to make his thoughts more palatable, such as the movie Waking Life.This murder mystery stands on its own two legs and could make a great read if that's all that is being sought after. The plot is somewhat formulaic: average Joe puts the moves on the narrator's girl, but then he turns out to be something he's not and the narrator wants him dead. Sounds simple enough, but the massive roles that each character plays makes this novel rise above the other stories that have been fashioned in similar ways.The character development is excellent, letting the reader visualize the people as human beings with varying and sometimes hypocritical ideas and personalities. As the book progresses, these characters grow into complex beings with misunderstandings and an ignorance that can only be described as human. Each character reflects a different opinion about the then current state of Vietnam and what should be done, although it is obvious that Graham Greene has made Fowler as his personal representative in the book. The characters' ideas are what really make this book stand out.Throughout the story, Fowler declares that he is a completely unbiased bystander; just observing the future of Vietnam as it plays out before him. His insistence of this is only rivaled by the amount of times he acts hypocritically to the idea. Fowler is as biased as they come, and even worse, his ignorance of his biased state of mind reassures him that he is always in the right, because how could an innocent bystander be in the wrong? The only character who he can compare himself directly to is Pyle, the quiet American.Unlike Fowler, Pyle is passionate enough to seriously act upon his believes, which are just as uninformed and stubborn as Fowler's, but at least Pyle is not lying to himself and others. All Pyle thinks about is the sorry state of Vietnam and how he can help it become the world power that it could be. He has good enough intentions, but Pyle has not lived in Vietnam for very long and does not understand Vietnam the way that any of the Vietnamese do, making his good intentions into bad decisions. Fowler thinks he knows how Vietnam works and since he considers himself unbiased, he thinks he has all the answers.The situation is ironic though, because Pyle believes that a third, unbiased party (besides the Communists and the French) needs to step in and steer the country out of its slump. Fowler thinks of himself as a third, unbiased party that knows what would be good for Vietnam. If Pyle and Fowler really talked it over, Fowler could have become America's perfect third party Vietnamese president. Pyle and Fowler's ideas were almost identical, they just had different ways of acting them out: Pyle wanted to save the country as a whole, Fowler wanted to save the country by helping individuals. Obviously, both of the ideas are flawed enough and too extreme to work, so it is possible that if they worked together, a happy medium could have been reached.The Quiet American is a great novel that should be held in a higher regard. Its ideas are timeless, especially comparing America today with the America of the 50's and how each interacts with the rest of the world. America definitely could learn a thing or two about foreign policy from this book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I have really enjoyed some of Greene's other novels. He has a way of setting up interesting stories and is skilled at developing characters that give you keen insights into human nature. While there are aspects of this novel that are engaging, it overall falls flat as too wooden, too predictable, and too preachy. The novel had a lot of potential and would have been better if it would have been more subtle than what it was. Basically, the message is Americans are arrogant and naive, Brits are wiser and more cynical, and the Vietnam War was wrong. Regardless of whether you agree with those views, in a novel like this it would have been more convincing if it was not so heavy-handed. For all of that, it was still a decent book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is a landmark of 20th century fiction. It is Graham Greene's story of Fowler (\\"Foul Air\\" in French), a British journalist living in Saigon during the French war against independence of Viet Nam. The story is told in Fowler's voice, recounting the details of his life as an expatriate. Fowler relates his relationships with Phuong, a Vietnamese lover; and Pyle, a shadowy representative of the United States trade delegation in Viet Nam (or is he?). Fowler fights to keep possession of Phuong over the simplistic yet forceful advances of Pyle. This fight happens both internally within the man's thoughts, and externally during his clashes with Pyle. In the end, Pyle turns up dead. Who is to blame?This is not a book about an American, the United States, it's national character, or it's past or current foreign policy. To read it as such is not helpful. Despite its title, The Quiet American is primarily a personal story about a British man's life away from his original home, and his struggle to decide how and where to live it. It's a story about every man's eventual realization, whether it comes early or late in life, that choices must be made, a side must be chosen. Actions must be taken. To make this point, Greene develops Fowler's and Pyle's exaggerated characters and builds a story to a powerful conclusion. Greene does this well. While his character's lives can be read as metaphorical for the roles of the nation's they represent, this metaphor is not central to the story.Read this book for its examination of character and life."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Kindle book was great quality. I did not like the book but that is personal choice. I found the main character quite selfish."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"An excellent, atmospheric, romantic adventure novel placed in colonial Vietnam. I fell in love with Phuong without ever seeing her."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"A British reporter in Vietnam in 1955 has a complicated relationship, you can't call it friendship, with a member of the American economic mission. The consequences of the relationship are both personal and political.There are so many interesting concepts in this book. Innocence and naivete; are they dangerous or good? Can a person really be detached and disengaged from the world they live in? Can you trust the views of a first-person narrator? What is friendship and what is love? Interwoven with these topics is the combination of hubris and bad political theory that lead to the quagmire that was Vietnam.Everyone in the book is flawed. No one is really good. There is no innocence here."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Forget the bogus religiosity and sentimental notions of redemption. Forget also Greene's dubious morality and instead thrill at the story and the quality of his writing. The 'Quiet American' still hits all the right buttons - great characters (not even Michael Caine, in a recent screen adaptation, can ruin that!), thrilling plot and close historical and geographical detail making his evocation of French Vietnam on the eve of the (disastrous) American involvement fascinating reading. Greene at his best. Top read. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I think that cliche best sums up this book's theme. Greene makes one of the best arguments in favor of cynicism that I've ever read. This should be a must read for presidential candidates or just any guy who has ever competed with another guy for the love of a woman."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"An incredible story. I have read it twice now and it grows on me. It is a love story about Vietnam and the battle of life against historical forces. Greene was incredibly prescient about the unfolding/unraveling of Vietnam and the price both sides pay in Colonial/Imperialistic entanglements. You can read this book just for the wonderful characters and also as a larger allegory. The end notes and articles really help understand the context of the story/ the backdrop and so I suggest buying this edition. You don't have to be a fan of Greene's to enjoy this book or to care about the history of Vietnam. This is a timeless story of cultures clashing and people getting caught up in history and trying to find a place for themselves in difficult times."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is one of those books that entangles you from page 1, infuriates you at page 100, and leaves you enamored at its end. Graham Greene's is a spectacular tour of Vietnamese heritage, French imperialism, American espionage and borderless stories of lust, love, envy and idealism. The characters of Pyle and Fowler are so beautifully juxtaposed - and Phuong, a dependent between these men, emerges with the familiar power of women in this nation.I am an avid traveler, and one that loves to devour a classic work of fiction whilst in the setting. I have spent a significant amount of time in Vietnam, reading this book on my first visit in part at the square cafe of the Continental Hotel in Saigon - the site that features so prominently as the social, commercial and political centre of Saigon during French rule - and in part at the Bamboo Bar of the Metropole - a space that is consumed with the architectural charm and elegance of that moment in history. For those of you going to the country, I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"In one of his finest books, Graham Greene explores the allegorical connections in relationships, political intrigue, and violence. Set in pre-Vietnam late 1950s, a neutral reporter named Fowler who is from England is in a relationship with a local girl, ignoring the wife he has back home. He meets a younger man named Paul who although seems rather innocent and benign, has a hidden agenda representing American interference. Paul, the quiet American, subsequently falls in love with the reporter's girl named Phuong. Not wanting to give her up but also aware of being unfair to both his wife and Phuong, Fowler is determined to find the reason for Paul's presence in Vietnam and remove the threat to his relationship.Several complex and intense scenes permeate the chapters in throughout the book and we are never entirely sure what is happening or where the story is headed. This makes for a page-turner that is both energetic and thought provoking with mysterious overtones of political intrigue and relationship depth. How much does Fowler love Phuong? Enough to forsake his life in England? What is Paul's purpose in pursuing Phuong? Why are bombs going off in the city? Why did Paul follow Fowler into the jungle? And why did Paul save Fowler's life knowing he would then hurt him by taking Phuong away?Read as an emotional quest for love and the pain and joy that relationships can create, The Quiet American is a quasi-romantic story filled with deception, jealousy, selfishness, emptiness, and moments of gentle sensitivity. The touching relationship between Fowler and Phuong is tenuous, without a sense of a long-term future, making Paul's interest in Phuong more appropriate and beneficial. As the story develops, and as Fowler's wife makes a presence through her letters, we feel the pain and concern of all three characters.Read as an politically induced thriller, this marvelous book carries the reader along a path of government interference as lives are destroyed for the sake of some kind of political purpose. It causes the reader to sympathize with the people, reminding us that war and violence destroys lives of human beings and that while governments may believe in their own brand of protection of democracy, in the end, pain is inflicted on innocent lives.Read as a broad allegory melding human relationships, jealousy, and governmental involvement in foreign lands, The Quiet American shines forth as a one of a kind book that teaches valuable lessons without ever coming across as pedantic. The cavalier disconnection of Fowler to the events surrounding him changes until we realize his direct involvement with Paul. What appears as an innocent and confused American entering a country he doesn't understand, morphs into a type of symbolic evil person inflicting terror on the people. In Phuong we find a frightened but caring individual seeking after stability and never knowing who to trust for the future.A marvelous book in all respects and one worth reading over and over, The Quiet American stands out as a modern classic. Highly recommended to all readers and worth every sentence from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American by Graham Greene is and interesting study of character, morals and cultures set in Vietnam in the 1950's when the communist were fighting the French colonial power with the first American clandestine involvement. The main characters are Thomas Fowler a seasoned middle aged British reporter with a skeptical, and worldly nature, Alden Pyle, a squeaky clean and enthusiastic American whose idealism guides his choices and Phuong, a beautiful young Vietnamese woman who is guarded emotionally. Each of these are given choices and decisions which will ultimately effect the fate of the others.Greene who tells the story through the eyes of Thomas Fowler uses a dispassionate manner much like a seasoned reporter would be expected to and yet the reader is exposed to the atrocities of war, canals filled with bodies, descriptions of the horrors of napalm and women cradling dead infants.The dialogue is interesting and dynamic, it is easy to see it as a vehicle for a movie. Here is an example which reveals bot the characters and the tension of the times:\\" \\"I can't make this car move, Thomas, \\" Pyle said.\\"I will get a mechanic,\\" the commandant said and left us.\\"I interrupted you.\\"\\"Oh, it was nothing.\\" Pyle said \\"He wanted to know how much a Buick cost. These people are so friendly when you treat them right. The French don't seem to know how to handle them.\\"\\"The French don't trust them.\\"Pyle said solemnly, \\"A man becomes trustworthy when you trust him.\\" \\"Apparently world traveler, Graham Greene was inspired to write The Quiet American while traveling with an American in Vietnam in 1951 during the French colonial conflict. In writing the book he was able to convey his distaste for the war along with the moral dilemmas involved. I was greatly moved by it and thoughts of The Quiet American will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Set in French colonial Vietnam in the 1950s on the eve of the French overthrow, the book portrays the evolution of a love triangle: a jaded, cynical, opium addict British journalist (Thomas Fowler), the soft-spoken, intellectual, and idealistic quiet American (Alden Pyle), and a young Vietnamese girl (Phoung). Fowler and Phoung are lovers but Pyle steals the girl away from Fowler but winds up dead in the river. Fowler is suspected of the murder. He recalls memories of Pyle, narrating past events involving himself, Pyle, and Phoung. Phoung is highly desired by Fowler even though he takes her for granted whereas Pyle views her as a delicate flower to be protected. But the character of Phoung is weakly developed in the book and she comes around as an opportunist.Running parallel to the plot are political themes: communism, colonianism, and American foreign policies in the region. The novel touches on the horrors of war in a third world country: the class distinctions of colonianism, opium addiction, brothels, death, and destruction.It is clear throughout the book that Fowler dislikes Pyle and makes sweeping statements like, \\"The only quiet American is a dead American.\\" There are numerous instances where Fowler makes disparaging statements about Americans in a third world country so that the novel became widely known for its anti-American sentiment.The book is good and skillfully written, as befits a work by a famous author like Greene. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American by Graham Greene is about a British foreign correspondent on assignment in Vietnam.

But his nave optimism about democracy starts to cause deaths and his friend the cynical British foreign correspondent Thomas Fowler finds it hard to stand aside and watch. As Fowler intervenes, he wonders whether it is for the sake of politics or for his love for the young Phuong.Commissioned during the 1950s to write an article on guerrilla warfare in Malaya, Graham Greene stopped off in Vietnam to visit a friend, and soon fell under the spell of Indo-China. This novel is a result of his love for the country, inspired by his experiences there. Although the political situation has changed dramatically, The Quiet American continues to reflect accurately and powerfully the problems of war and the people involved in it."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"What does Greene's personality have to do with whether the book is good or not? Greene's personality is irrelevant. Also irrelevant is whether certain readers interpret Fowler as sympathetic. I found him pretty repellant as a human being but thought his character was well drawn and totally believable. He doesn't have to be likable. I'm a bit confused when people use an author's personality or other people's interpretations as their reasons for liking or disliking a book. That seems pretty superficial. Judge the book on it's own merits -- if you thought it was well-written and interesting, give it five stars. If you didn't, pan it."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I am a fan of Graham Greene; he is one of the few writers I have ever read who deals with issues of hope and dispair in real and honest terms. After reading works such as The Heart of the Matter and The Human Factor, I expected more of Greene than a shallow and naive allegory about America's involvement in Viet Nam. Greene is far more adept at revealing the frailties of the human heart than he is at reducing the complexities of world politics into individual characters. In The Quiet American, Greene tries to do both but succeeds at neither. Skip it."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Hi Everyone,I just bought this book for a World Lit class, so as far as its purpose goes, it was a fine book...but a little confusing at first when trying to get used to how the author jumps around in time when telling the story.

The author seems to be in trouble and he can't decide on things. but he seems to take it rather easy and he's not nervous about taking decision.

Heck, Greene (at least here) isn't even enough of a wordsmith to convincingly evoke l'Indochine in the 50's, so it's not even much of a travel book. I found myself doing much of the work in that regard.Obviously, the characters as \\"representative\\" of their nation's philosophies (the Brit as cynic, the American as idealist, etc.) is well-taken, though I thought the device was heavy-handed and unproductive.Another thing that, I think, had this book rolling on a flat tire was Greene's \\"in medias res\\" beginning, in which he reveals Pyle's death, etc. Although this intially seemed competent, in retrospect it robbed the rest of the story of whatever interest or suspense it would otherwise have had."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Quiet American is a wonderful book that,to an American, probes at our treasured notion high-minded idealism and our spirit that has served us well at times and not so well at others.

It's stunning how Greene in 1952 was able to see what would happen and why in Vietnam, but the novel speaks as well to us today about the dangers of imposing our own ideologies on other cultures and being blind to human suffering.

I've read a lot of post-Vietnam fiction which looked back on the war with searing cynicism and anti-war fervor, but this is much different. Greene's Fowler, a British journalist, and Pyle, an American diplomat, are brilliant portrayals of world-weary cynicism and wide-eyed innocence. In the end we are not sure which course works best. Fowler's withdrawal, his refusal to engage himself, can not stand. But Pyle's innocence is shown to have a deadly side to it. Throw in the mix a Vietnamese beauty that each man refuses to give up for wildly different reasons, and you have the makings of an intensely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Greene's classic is superbly dark, not obvious, and refreshing because of its setting in Pre-US-Combat-Troops Vietnam.

Wise and deep on many levels-as a political novel, as a love story, as a pessimistic appraisal of the human condition. The first chapter reads like a great opium-induced recollection.

Pyle and Fowler made deadly mistakes while doing what they thought was the right thing.

A lesson needed today as much as it was when this book was written."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"It's repeated as though those who say it still believe it: \\"Americans are so nave that they're amazed when they find out no one likes them.\\" Were this true, one can only imagine the wicked jolt of pleasure it would give anyone who isn't fond America to remind you of it. For the record...and my, how I do hate to break it to you this way: there aren't anymore Americans who think everyone loves them. Keep saying it if it fits into whatever scheme you have in your head, but that creature no longer exists.Graham Greene, who had a dislike of Americans himself, carries us back 50 years to Viet Nam and allows us an insight into the beginnings of what happens to be the definitive question of the day. Americans: should we love them, hate them, protect them or kill them? Choose #2 or #4, or a combination of the two, and you're in a club that is very nearly about to start turning away new recruits due to overcrowding. Greene apparently felt so deeply about it that he made the anti-American pilgrimage to tip his hat to El Caballo himself just 90 miles off of the coast of Florida. What I think of that doesn't matter.This is a masterful tale of a British correspondent, Fowler, and his dealings with the American agent, Alden Pyle. If there is a failing in this story, it would be that the character Pyle is very nearly overloaded with a naivety that would simply be unbelievable in a real person carrying out his shady mission. I realize that he is a meant to represent the idealism of a nation not only an individual, but it's just a tad too much. The thing less mentioned, I think, is how we come to get so many insights into Pyle through the eyes of jaded Fowler. Could Greene have been, whatever his personal inclinations, acknowledging that while his view of America was tainted, that view wasn't coming from anything like a neutral source? England was watching a new kid come into the scene that was about to steal it's thunder and there wasn't much to do but grumble.Whichever side you take on this question, you'll put this book down thinking \\"This is why I read.\\""},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Fowler, the narrator of the book, is a reporter from England in the Indochina War.

He starts to work for the private army of general Th&eacute;, and is responsible for several bomb attacks in the center of Saigon, where many people, mainly women and children die. When Fowler realizes that his friend, who even saved his life once, is willingly to kill innocent people for his ideology, he agrees that some communists shoud kill him. Naturally there's also a love story, there is Phuong a young, beautiful Vietnamese lady. She first lives with Fowler who loves her very much, but later goes to Pyle who can offer her a marriage and a good future. That produces another tension between the two friends.

Three main characters Greene conjurs depicts the British, Vietnamese, American, and Third Party (General The) interactions with eachother during the Vietnam war. What is so fascinating is that this novel was published in 1955, nearly a decadebefore it happened. And yet the way Greene's novel unfurls, so did the upcoming Vietnam war. I think a prominent theme in this novel is fear. Entangled in this theme lays place and time, adventure, and love all which add to the magical and sometimes depressing reality of life.This novel does an impeccable job at setting up the relationships between characters which metaphorically represent their own nations. Fowler, the cynical narrator who may not be as un-involved as he seems to think he is, represents Britain and their neutral attitude towards involvent in the war. Fowler is rough around the edges, observative, and on average is alevel minded reporter who does just that: observe, collect, accept, report. A sort of mechanical sense to him, when he demonstrates this towards Phuong. Although his intensity about her as well as Pyle and his plastics is spurred and his morality and suppressed emotion overcomes his neutrality.Phuong is a beautiful, delicate, submissive lover of life who clings to unrelaistic hopes but softens to her Vietnamese reality. Although she is smart and kind, curious, and sometimes political, she has no say in matters of love and matters of life. Like many of the Vietnamese trying to gain a sort of independance.The most peculiar and intriguing character, despite the name the &quot;Quiet American&quot;, is Pyle. A well learned American in Vietnam as a sort of Aid. (which is never really inquired about by reporters)He seems naive and somewhat manipulative. After telling Fowler he was a mdeical assistant, not much more was exposed about him, but left many to assume. After Pyle's death when Fowler is speaking with Vigot who represents an American faction of some sort, they are unsettled by this conversation. &quot;A soldiers death...might that prove confusing?...the economic Aid Mission doesn't sound like the army...&quot; said Fowler. In response to this, &quot;He had special duites.&quot; Pyle's character seemed to represent America more and more throughout the novel. And the more we find his deceptions, ignorance, &quot;York Harding&quot; simplicity in a complicated country, and his loss of humanity, the more America is being projected onto this scenario. Before Fowler discovers the Dialacton and Pyle's perfect pronunciation of French and Vietnamese, Pyle in fact remains quiet. Later though, we learn of America's alterior motives in making &quot;genuine&quot; change for the betterment of Vietnamese society. (Which i'm still havgin trouble with understanding how selling plastics for guns and explosives to General The benefits the Vietnamese)Together, America and the Third Party become the masterminds of destruction.Currently in America, Senator Ted Kennedy freely expressed that $Q is becoming Bush's Vietnam&quot;. One critique of Kennedy's statement said that if it is Bush's war, then it is America's too. This led me to think about Pyle, and just how much he really did represent America.&quot;The Quiet American&quot; was a thrilling novel that explored many ideas in the humanities. What is the loss of innocense, what is moral and immoral, how are these ideas inter-related to the Vietnam War and Graham Greene's novel? You'll have to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"It's great when an authour arrives before the fact. This novel problematizes Western involvement with Indochina affairs, more specific American military involvement in Vietnam. This problem was to be a key issue for left wing people more than a decade later from when Greene wrote his book. In that respect \\"The Quiet American\\" is similar to Hanif Kureishis \\"The Black Album\\" which problematizes British Muslim radicalization in 1995, a decade before the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

In the course of it, I mentioned the &quot;great&quot; Vietnam novel by Graham Greene. I wanted to check my memory of the watchtower sequence, so I fetched the book from the library and re-read it. Much to my surprise, with a distance of 40 years, I found that the plot-moving devices were a bit creaky, and the novel wasn't nearly as great as I had thought, or as is generally advertised. I suspect that one of the reasons people admire it is because of Greene's pervasive loathing of everything American: &quot;I was tired of the whole pack of them with their private stores of Coca-Cola and their portable hospitals and their too wide cars and their not quite latest guns&quot; (p.31). Oh yeah, all right, too bad about Americans and Coca-Cola. Forty years down the road, this strikes me as boring Euro-pique.There are nice bits about Vietnamese, French, and yes, Americans.

In short, this is the story of America's involvement in Vietnam, full stop. Astounding is the fact that this was written between 1952 and 1955, yet can serve as a metaphor for almost two further decades of US involvement in that region.This is no simple tale, although it can be read as one. It works on many different levels. In its simplest form, this is a story about two foreigners in Indo-China: a middle-aged British reporter, and a young idealistic American. They involve themselves in two main plots: one concerning the French Army's battle with the Vietminh, and the second, concerning the two men's relationship with a native woman and the subsequent fight for her affections. On this level, THE QUIET AMERICAN works as an effective thriller. Who is the mysterious &quot;third force&quot; that Pyle, the American, is aiding? Why is he even there, and why is he providing aid to this group? Will Fowler, the British journalist, abandon his policy of neutrality and enter into the conflict? Who will end up with the girl at the end?But there are all sorts of other subtexts and subtleties going on here. Pyle isn't just &quot;the quiet American&quot;; he is America -- at least as far as the US's involvement in Vietnam is concerned. And the difference in age between Pyle and Fowler is no random chance. Fowler is the older man; his country has already had its expansionist, colonial period. Fowler already knows what it's like to get one's fingers burnt interfering in other people's conflicts. But Pyle won't be told. He's the young inexperienced man who has to find out for himself -- to the detriment of everyone.This isn't just a simplistic &quot;America = idealistic, good-hearted, but naive&quot; or &quot;England = experienced, weary, and impotent&quot; view of the world. While Greene builds on several stereotypes of the Old and the New Worlds, he goes much farther beyond that. Both men desire Phuong (the Vietnamese woman), but for starkly different reasons. The woman's own interests are kept to herself deliberately. We learn far more about Pyle and Fowler simply by the way in which they view the woman. On a purely personal level, the characterization is heart-wrenching. When looked at on a national level as far as what the two men represent, it is amazingly thought provoking.After reading THE QUIET AMERICAN, I kept replaying and rethinking a number of its scenes and breaking down the characters as much as I could. There is a lot going on here, and much of what Greene wrote about wouldn't fully come into being for a number of years after the book's publication. There are many layers of subtleties occurring in this book's pages, and while I'm certain that I have not yet caught them all, it is not through a lack of interest. This is a very powerful book, and should be on everyone's &quot;To Read&quot; list."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Only the great Graham Greene could have written a story that is as wry and understated as it is prophetic. &quot;The Quiet American&quot; captures several different attitudes during Vietnam's transition from French colonial occupation to American &quot;involvement&quot;. In this novel the French do what they do best, namely they undertake a hopeless struggle and experience painful defeat. The Americans enter the scene with grandiose plans, tons of money, and utterly no sense of reality. The Vietnamese are, of course, hard-edged and practical, while the lone Englishman-God bless him-is the epitome of dying yet dignified colonialism.For those of you who haven't read the book, its both an odd love story and a metaphor for American involvement in Vietnam. The hero, Fowler is a washed up, middle aged, English war correspondent, content with his opium pipe and his Vietnamese mistress, Phuong. His world is gradually disrupted by the arrival of an American covert operative named Pyle who is both a zealous ideologue and a nave optimist. Things get complicated when Pyle steals Phuong away from Fowler, yet attempts to remain friends with him. The normally indifferent Fowler soon becomes morally repulsed by Pyle's seemingly well intended terrorist activities, and gradually becomes politically involved. By the time Fowler helps to engineer Pyle's murder it is unclear even to him whether he is doing so to help the Vietnamese people or to win Phuong back.&quot;The Quite American&quot; explores several different concepts. Like many of Greene's novels and short stories it examines the peculiar morality of love. Fowler and Phuong form a strange symbiosis. Fowler is estranged from is English wife, and is old enough to be Phuong's father. His affection for her is unabashedly sexual and certainly not made for day time TV in the U.S. Phuong's attachment to both Fowler and Pyle is based more on practical reasons than on love. Greene never passes judgement any of the trio. And when Fowler wins Phuong back in the end, he is left-like so many of us-with a lingering doubt about his motives and actions.Equally interesting is Greene's exploration of the politics of Southeast Asia in the 1950s and particularly, the shifting balance of power from European colonialism to American military and economic involvement. Pyle, who is probably based on the real life American operative, Landsdale devoutly worships the books of an intellectual whose thinking bears strong resemblance to that of George Kennan. As the French wrap up their losing streak, the Americans enter the scene with blind stupidity, you can't help but cringe at disaster to come.I loved this book for its intelligent grasp of love and politics. Like many of Greene's other works, this one contains a genius for characterization."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"The Viking Critical Library's version of Graham Greene's &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is an indispensible text for full appreciation of Greene's perceptions of Indochina, France's war there, and America's budding involvement. The editor, John C. Pratt carefully selects criticism of Greene's TQA that creates a complete and rich discourse on Greene's life and writings that serves as a backdrop to his novel. Added to that backdrop are histories, such as Frank Futrell's thirteen-page explanation of how the United States became involved in Vietnam, and official documents from the State Department, to interviews with former South Vietnamese generals and Ho Chi Minh.TQA itself a wonderful book that,to an American, probes at our treasured notion high-minded idealism and our &quot;can-do&quot; spirit that has served us well at times and not so well at others. Greene's symbolism is telling and insightful, given that it was published well before the United States' full-blown involvement in that region of the world. While Greene relates many things that he experienced or felt in Indochina as a journalist, the book is not solely a &quot;war novel&quot;. TQA, like many of Greene's books, takes the readers on the author's journey of personal morality and matters religious."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene wrote this novel in 1955. It's set in the early fifties when Vietnam was still Indo-China and there was a war raging between the French and the Vietnamese. It's obvious he's worried about the future and American involvement, and this theme resonates throughout the book as well as gives an eerie foreshadowing of what we all know happened later. At only 188 pages, it's a seemingly simple story of mystery, adventure and love. But it's also a story of a people, a place and a time as well as a warning about the future.Thomas Fowler, the narrator, is a hardened British war correspondent. He in a relationship young Vietnamese woman named Phuong, enjoys his opium pipes, and manages to get along with his fellow correspondents. Suddenly, a young nave American, named Alden Pyle, arrives in Vietnam, supposedly as an aid worker. When he declares his love for Phuong, the plot thickens. But this is just one facet of the story as both men are thrust into the war, viewing the meaningless deaths around them and coming very close to death themselves. Pyle's mission to Indo-China becomes increasingly suspect, and as Fowler discovers one clue after another, the conclusion is inevitable.I was immediately drawn into the story, which sets up a mystery and keeps the reader wondering until the very end. At the same time, the three main characters are deeply developed, not only as to their individualisms, but also as to their national character. The British correspondent takes a caustic view of the world; the American is effusive and idealistic, and the Vietnamese woman is stoic. They move around in a Vietnam where the French are fast losing their hold, and everyone knows that change is going to happen.I loved this book. Every word reverberated with a truth that existed when it was written, and which proved to be a prophesy of things to come. It also enriched my understanding of the dark period in history that followed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I'd heard of this book for years just as \\"Greene's Vietnam novel,\\" without knowing when it was written or anything else about it. So when I saw it in a bookstore in Saigon at the conclusion of a three-week tour of Vietnam in 1997, it seemed appropriate to snap it up, and I started reading it in a cafe not too far from the street where Fowler had his flat (now renamed, of course, but I don't remember what the new name is). So maybe that's why it had such an intense effect on me, but I was absolutely stunned by it. It really pulled me into a feeling of what it might have been like to be in Vietnam in 1954, and the characters were clearly portrayed (if not always nice). Among the fascinating things is the (relatively) sympathetic treatment of Pyle. Greene makes it clear that by any measure of \\"private\\" morality, Pyle is a much better person than Fowler, but in his political actions he is utterly, totally, completely wrong -- not from bad motives, but because he does not know what he is doing. AFter I finished it I looked at the copyright date and was stunned again to see that it was written in 1954, before the French got out of Vietnam. Hell, yes, it's a prophecy of what would happen with the US involvement there. I'd love to get my hands on whatever crystal ball Greene was using, and I wish he was still around so he could write an Afghanistan novel."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"(This review refers to the Viking Critical Library edition, edited by John Clark Pratt)Graham Greene's novel of Pyle, the &quot;quiet American&quot;, employed by a barely-disguised fronting organisation of the CIA, narrated by Fowler, a British journalist who comes across by turns as weary and worldly, is immensely interesting. In it, Greene offers up perhaps his most incisive and insightful political commentary, treating the danger of allowing people guided solely by ideology and schools of academic thought to be responsible for intelligence fieldwork. Pyle, a graduate of Harvard, goes into Indochina, believing intensely in the necessity of enabling a &quot;third column&quot;, General The's men, and employing them as an American proxy force.Whether or not Pyle himself sees the implicit incompatibility of this abstract idea and reality is never quite clear: certainly Pyle plays witness to the destruction that his attempts to mobilise a third column bring about. He is not subject, though, to the gross revulsion at the wanton destruction of life that Fowler is. Equally certainly, Pyle's political views cost him his life: open to question, still, is whether or not Pyle himself was ever conscious of his fallacies, or if he remains blinded throughout. Rather than being a novel of a man's moral revelations, or telling of his relationship with the Divine, &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is far more a parable.Greene's structure, his combined simplicity and complexity, and the thematic relevance of this novel, render it a deserving read. Additionally, the chronologies and commentaries upon foreign involvement in Indochina/Vietnam are both valuable and blessedly concise, and the collected reviews and critcal commentaries upon the novel serve as valuable tool for understanding."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"In preparing for my summer trip to Vietnam a number of people suggested reading The Quiet American. The story also caught my interest when I heard film crews are currently in Vietnam shooting a remake of the film. A remake which will hopefully be more loyal to the book and its message unlike the earlier version.Talk about foreshadowing. Greene writes and makes a strong case against American involvement in Vietnam. And he makes this case back in the 1950's towards the end of French involvement in Indochina.The book is well written and easy to read. The story is not dated at all. I only wish President Kennedy and LBJ and their advisors had looked at this book... the books message was all too true.The Viking critical edition comes with some awesome extra stuff including works about and by Greene, great primary sources on Vietnam, and some great background info.As a movie buff, I enjoyed some of the writings that compared the book and the movie.This is a book that deserves the title of classic."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"'The Quiet American' is a well-written novel about a love triangle set against the background of the French and American involvement in Vietnam. The narrative voice is that of Thomas Fowler, a disillusioned, middle-aged English correspondent with few professional and personal prospects who tries to keep at the margin of the incidents around him--or, as he says, who tries to report those incidents without taking sides--until he is comfronted with the dilemmas represented by Alden Pyle, a naive American who has learned politics only by reading books. Those dilemmas are, on the one hand, personal, and, on the other, political: Pyle takes away Phoung, Fowler's Vietnamese girlfriend, while at the same time is engaged in shady dealings with a dubious Vietnamese general to restore 'democracy' in the country and stop the 'spread of communism'. Should Fowler continue with his life of non-engagement and let Pyle get away with his girlfriend and the havoc he is wreaking among Vietnamese civilians with his monolithic political views? As one character in the novel says, 'one has to take sides. If one is to remain human.' And Fowler, after a senseless terrorist act in which Pyle is involved (although Pyle himself thinks that it was for 'the benefit of democracy'), is forced to act. The personal and the political merge in Fowler's difficult decision--but the reader is left uncomfortable as to what Fowler's ultimate motives are.The novel flows effortlessly from the first page to the last, both in its structure and in its prose. One often finds incisive comments and humor, and one cannot cease to be amazed at how prescient Greene's views are on the disastrous American involvement in Vietnam (the novel was written between 1952 and 1955). My only complaint about the novel is that Pyle's naiveness, although reflective of the American political position at the time, is almost caricaturesque at times, and thus detracts from his credibility as a character. Despite this, I thoroughly recommend it. It might even be an excellent tool in a political-science classroom."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene wrote one of the best novels of the 20th century with &quot;The Quiet American.&quot; His straightforward, elegant prose along with ample doses of irony and humor, make this novel a masterpiece. Greene's characters are extraordinarily complex and passionate beneath their seemingly quiet exteriors. Published in 1955, during the waning days of French colonialism and the beginning of American intervention in Southeast Asia, the book foreshadowed the America War in Vietnam.Thomas Fowler, Greene's narrator, is a cynical, veteran journalist for a London newspaper based in Saigon in 1952. The dispassionate Fowler has &quot;gone native.&quot; He has fallen in love with Vietnam and with the lovely Phoung, a one-time taxi dancer who is young enough to be his daughter. Despite the turbulent political climate, Fowler is content with filing an occasional story and living a pleasurable, carefree life. His dream is to convince his Catholic wife, back in England, to divorce him so he can live out his days idyllically with Phoung and an opium pipe in Saigon.Enter Alden Pyle, a seemingly innocuous, naive American who is supposedly part of a medical assistance delegation sent by the US government. Pyle is a passionate advocate of an American foreign policy theorist named York Harding, who has proposed that the solution to the problems in French Indochina is a &quot;third force,&quot; other than the French colonial government and the Vietminh insurgents currently battling for control of the country. Pyle has really come to Vietnam to foster this alternative third player - a Vietnamese strongman who would lead an American-backed government.Fowler and Pyle meet and improbably, the jaded, world weary Brit and the earnest, patriotic American form a friendship - until Pyle intrudes in the relationship between Fowler and Phoung. Pyle falls in love with Phuong, almost at first sight. He seduces her away from Fowler with promises of marriage and a life in America. Initially, Pyle's innocence and decency were endearing to Fowler. However, with the potential loss of his lover and the increasing evidence that Pyle is involved in violent clandestine activities, Fowler's feelings toward Pyle begin to sour and the friendship becomes strained. Still Fowler strives to remain objective about the political situation and proclaims, &quot;I don't get involved. I just report what I see&quot;.After a car bomb in downtown Saigon kills several innocent bystanders, Fowler traces the contents of the bomb back to Pyle. He realizes that Pyle, in his fervent adherence to ideological theories, has lost his humanity. He sees Pyle as the quintessential innocent and too simplistic: &quot;'...I had better look after Pyle.' That was my first instinct - to protect him. It never occurred to me that there was greater need to protect myself. Innocence always calls mutely for protection, when we would be so much wiser to guard ourselves against it. Innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world meaning no harm.&quot; And finally, Fowler is dramatically forced to take sides. He can no longer be a passive observer to the growing conflict.Graham Greene quotes Lord Byron on one of the pages preceding the novel, &quot;This is the patent age of new inventions/ For killing bodies, and for saving souls,/ All propagated with the best intentions.&quot; This novel is at once a powerfully prophetic commentary and a riveting thriller. Beautifully crafted.JANA"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"*The Quiet American* is a realistic story that uses what has become a classic theme: the innocent American abroad. The story is told from the point of view of Fowler, an English journalist, and a correspondent living in French Indochina, what is now known as Vietnam. There is a war going on: Communist Vietnamese are attempting to overtake the French colonials and their democratic Vietnamese underlings. As a Brit in this setting, Fowler is impartial, which suits his nature. He's not really for the French or the Democrats, but neither is he for the rebel Communists. Getting on in years, estranged from his wife who remains back in England, Fowler is a cynic with a fatalistic view of the world. He is detached and aloof from the actors in the war, and his perceceptions can be humorous, even in the face of the horrible circumstances of war.Fowler lives with his young Vietnamese girlfriend, Phuong. He's just biding his time with her, neither eager to return to England nor interested in his job as correspondent. In fact he has even has his hired servant, Dominquez, to write brief journalistic correspondence for his home newspaper. Fowler is an opium smoker, a habit that enables him to remain in this limbo he's carved out for himself.Enter Pyle, an American, whose zealous support of and belief in the burgeoning colonial democracy blinds him to the compexity of the causes of the war. Pyle sees the world in black and white: things are either good or bad in Pyle's view; one is either for the democracy or against it. His foil, Fowler, on the other hand, sees the gray shades of war; he understands the causes, even when they are absurd causes. In Fowler's view,war \\"heroes\\" are cold blooded killers, cowards survive, the brave are foolhardy, and whether a soldier lives or dies is purely accidental.Pyle falls in love with Fowler's girl Phuong. Being an innocent, he approaches Fowler about it and declares his intentions. He says he can offer Phuong a proper marriage; Fowler cannot promise Phuong anything but the limbo he's created. Fowler cannot argue with Pyle's logical reasons for taking Phuong from Fowler, and though he hates Pyle for taking his girl, he has to admit she will be better off.Pyle gets involved in distributing explosives to the democratic urban guerrillas. Pyle's activities in the war scenario parallel his actions in the love triangle with Fowler and Phuong: in the love triangle, he upsets Phuong and Fowler's relationship, taking her from Fowler. In the war setting, he enters the country and begins feeding war materials to the democracy, which uses the material in bombings in the city that kill innocent bystanders. In both of these scenarios, he's a blind intruder, seeing everything in black and white and oblivious to the subtle nuances of war or love. Fowler on the other hand sees these subjects and his role in them with much complexity. For this reason, he is the real hero of the novel. Though he is a cynic and resists choosing sides in the war, the reader appreciates his ability to accurately access the circumstances. His refusal to take sides is a personal choice and not the result of his not being able to see the situation clearly enough to choose sides. So it is in his love affair with Phuong: he detaches himself from her, letting her go to Pyle. He won't choose sides in the love affair either, even though he sees his relationship with her accurately."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"A capsule summation of &quot;The Quiet American&quot; doesn't do justice to this tremendous novel. In brief, a young American idealist and a cynical middle-aged journalist vie for the allegiance of an Asian female during the French Indochinese war. And, as they compete, the actions of the American force the journalist to confront the moral issues in his life. Throughout, Green tells this story with concise brilliance and his descriptive writing is absolutely first rate. Here's a quick example, with Fowler, the journalist, on patrol with French troops: &quot;...we ran on a shoal of bodies and stuck. He pushed away with his pole, sinking it into this human clay, and one body was released and floated up all its length beside the boat, like a bather lying in the sun.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"So said the main character (and narrator) Fowler about himself in an attempt to thwart his promotion to the position of editor, away from the French war in Indo China, and his mistress Phuong.And a true assessment of himself it may have been, if things had remained as they were. But once Pyle, the nave, quiet American with his eye on the selfsame Phuong, and his dangerous political meddling enters the scene, Fowler ceases to be a mere spectator, and enters the real world of action with all that it entails. This, then, is the factual gist of, for me, Graham Greene's greatest novel.It contains everything one has come to admire in Greene: an absolute economy of words, character developed through action and terse dialogue rather than descriptive language, all set within (what has seemingly become an unavoidable clich&eacute; when discussing his novels) an intriguing moral dilemma. So he breaks no new ground here, but rather perfects that which he does well to an exceptional degree.And as always, nothing is ever simple. Ambiguities attach to everything we do, as Fowler discovers, when he does what he considers to be the expedient, just thing re the quiet American. Public and private morality dovetail in Pyle's fate, which Fowler suddenly can determine in one single act, which he does. So the world-weary Fowler ceases to be a mere reporter, and attains everything what he wanted in one fell swoop. And then, in a breathtaking turn-around the jaded, cynical observer Fowler is brought to this in the last sentence of the novel;..but how I wished there existed someone to whom I could say that I was sorry.which, when I read it for the first time, carried me over the threshold of the Christian Faith, in the joyous realization that such a Someone does exist."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I read this novel on a cross-country (U.S) flight. It is fast paced and evocative of a time now lost. The book is remarkably prescient, not so much in predicting subsequent events, but more in characterizing the forces that would play a decisive role in the later twentieth century evolution of Vietnam.Fowler, a cynical journalist in French-occupied Vietnam, has his life disrupted when Pyle, and idealistic, impractical American comes on the scene and not only steals his girlfriend, but, fronting for the CIA, backs a Vietnamese general to establish a third force, democracy, to counter the communists and the French colonials, with terrible results. A key subplot involves Fowler's loss and subsequent recovery of his mistress, Phuong. To some degree, the characters and their relationships to one another mirror the stances and actions of their respective countries.One of the book's interesting dynamics is Fowler's introspective dialogue. He views Pyle with cynical disdain. Pyle, on the other hand, wants Fowler to accept him as a friend (he continually presses Fowler to call him by his first name; Fowler resists) and understand and respect his motives.With the Vietnam/French conflict as background environment, the novel seeks to explore the conflict between Fowler and Pyle. Greene provides a realistic description of Vietnam in the early fifties: of Saigon, Haiphong, the villages, the Viet Minh and so forth. The book also contains several descriptions of the casualties of war.The Quiet American is set at a time when revolutionary forces were adopting a Marxist model based on China's successful Communist revolution. The French and British were both trying to maintain a grasp on crumbling empires by resisting revolutionary forces. The Americans opposed the Soviet Union, and the spread of communism throughout the world. The Americans viewed communism as monolithic at the time, and believed in the \\"Domino Theory,\\" which stated that once Vietnam became communist, the other nations of Southeast Asia would also do so, like a line of falling dominos, each one tipping another. Subsequent events would disprove that theory and prove nationalism to be the more relevant factor.Robert Stone provides an insightful introduction to the Penguin Classics Deluxe edition."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene's success has always rested on his ability to create real, three-dimensional characters and set them in the most precarious of situations. THE QUIET AMERICAN is among the best of Greene's works because it utilizes this strategem the most fully.Set in Viet Nam in the mid-1950s, the atmosphere is one of confusion and forboding. The French invasionary forces in the country are suffering sorely because of native resistance, and things in general seem to be teetering on the verge of explosion. Englishman Thomas Fowler, enjoying his opium-induced haze, is a tough-as-nails but aloof war correspondent observing the chaos. His native-born and beatiful mistress, Phuong, is obviously caught up in the activity. Both are awaiting the arrival of the American, Alden Pyle. When he arrives, several fuses, some quite literally, are lit.Pyle brings with him a kind of ingenuous patriotism for the U.S.A. and part of his mission is to spread the good news about democracy. Along the way, he falls in love with Phuong and, more importantly, he falls deeper into the quicksand of Vietnamese policy and belligerence. As other reviewers have commented, it is quite amazing that Graham Greene wrote this novel in the mid-1950s because he prophesized, in a way, the depths to which America's involvement in Viet Nam would be pulled for the next twenty years.But THE QUIET AMERICAN is not an allegory about European/American entanglements in southeast Asia (although some of that is decidedly there). It is a story about real characters trapped in a milieu that is about to explode. And that makes THE QUIET AMERICAN a gripping, suspenseful novel and is one of Greene's masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"Graham Greene is a master story teller. In his concise and elegant prose, he exposes the ethical and moral quandary of two men against a backdrop of love and war, each driven by diametrically opposing impulses. Certain passages are graphic, but that is the unfortunate reality of war. Greene uses the right dose of irony and humour throughout his story; and even if the context could have called for it, he never allowed his characters to indulge in self-pity."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is a short book but to readers of Graham Greene, yet another star in his galaxy of literary output. It gave me a good historical perspective of the Vietnam war and filled in some blanks but it is still Graham Greene's writing and analysis of human nature and motives that rise above the setting of the book. This book does not particularly flatter American motives but does not denigrate them either. So, it is not 100% correct to say that this work does not flatter America. Greene has a remarkable talent to see good in the sordid and (seems to me, anyway) that he is forgiving of a lack of moral clarity not because as a Catholic one must but from an intellectual standpoint that even the best of us err all the time. Indeed, the very concept of moral right being the best is questioned sometimes, in this as well as several of his books. Teaches one a lot of humility when it comes to judging others.Arun Mahajan, Palo Alto, California"},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"This is an excellent book. Greene's observations on the American character are still valid. A must-read for anyone caring about America and the world."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"When this was published in the 50's, very few people had any idea of the depth of involvement of the U.S. Gov't in other countries' political processes/revolutions. Today, the covert operations and imperialist conceits of Greene's novel read, though much more interestingly written, much like so many newspaper stories of fact written since. Few novelists can compare to Greene; in weaving webs of bureaucratic and personal deception, and showing the sad effect on humanity."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"On second reading 40-plus years after original publication, Graham Greene's short and masterful novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; seems profound and prophetic. (To many of us it seemed arrogant, stereotyped and anti-American in 1957). Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be a takeoff of Edwin Lansdale, the model for William Lederer's &quot;The Ugly American,&quot; a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel. Today Alden Pyle could be seen as a character based on the Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, Henry Cabot Lodge or Robert Komer of the 1960s. Greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels."},{"Title":"The Quiet American","review":"I was challenged in reading this book to think about how America's best of intentions are often times poorly received in the parts of the world we intend to help. Greene's book is echoed in part by Niall Ferguson's Collosus, a book that argues that the idea of American empire is slightly unrealistic given the fact that Americans are unwilling to relocate and get dirty in the same way Englishmen were. The act of colonialism is not compatible with American culture, a fact Greene explores in this wonderful fictional work."},{"Title":"Champion: Bicycle Racing in the Age of Miguel Indurain","review":"The inevitable comparisons are legion now that Lance Armstrong has won his sixth (and last?) Tour De France this past July. The past winners were all manifested again during the summer of 2004 with the same predictable results...Eddy Merckz was the \\"cannibal\\", the merciless killer among the past 5 time winners...Bernard Hineault was the silent assasin, the least likely looking winner, but perhaps the meanest cycler who ever lived...Jaques Anquetil was the elegant talent, the one who modernized world class cycling in the 60's and of course Armstrong, who is still really establishing his legacy. Who, then is this Miguel Indurain and what \\"category\\" does he fit into? Samuel Abt tries to define Indurain's place in history with \\"Champion: Bicycle Riding in the Age of Indurain\\". The problem, of course, is that this work was published in 1993 and Indurain still had much more to say on the cycling front.Abt's story is one that I'd sort of compare to the early Roger Angell works on baseball...a set of diverse observations that pertain to the main event...in this case the 1991 and 1992 Tour De France. Abt descibes both races and certainly suceeds in fitting this race into the context of that day...Indurian, like Armstrong 10 years later, is the man to beat and all others, although interesting, will become mere shadows when viewed in Tour history. The reader gets all angles of world class cycling as Abt describes the growing Indurian myth and how Miguel is slowly replacing American Greg LeMond as the celebrity of the cycling world. We also hear from the less talented riders as Abt talks about their chances as well as how the economy is affecting the team structure in the early 90's. Indeed of all the teams that competed in the 1992 Tour, only the Lotto-Domo Belgian team still competed in the 2004 Tour (Indurian's Banesto team is now Illearas-Banesto).Abt's descriptions and commentary border on brilliance as he succeeds in presenting a human picture to the world class cycling world and brings to the literay world the only true historical treatment of the brilliant Indurain that can be found (the Armstrong books by comparison, past and future, overwhelm the published books on Indurain). Abt's work is also timed to descibe the end of Greg Lemond's reign as the American Champion and the book ends with a portent of the future with \\"The First Lance\\" chapter wherby he descibes the young Armstrong and gives glowing predictions of Armstrong's future.A work that true cycling fans should undertake (Abt does not attempt and does not succeed in clearing up the complex and at times maddening strategy pertaining to Tour riding) and one that sort of sets the stage for the Armstrong on-slaught, Sam Abt brings a truely worthy and capable champion to light and in the process elevates world class cycling to the level soon realized in the early 2000's."},{"Title":"Champion: Bicycle Racing in the Age of Miguel Indurain","review":"This book captured the quiet, contemplative nature of Miguel Indurain, the 90's most dominant Tour de France rider, very well. Also it played out the backroom drama of &quot;Le Tour&quot;. For any cycle racing fan, a must read."},{"Title":"Champion: Bicycle Racing in the Age of Miguel Indurain","review":"Essential information for Indurain enthusiasts giving insights into the early Tour victories of the great champion. Also provides interesting glimpses into the personality of one of the more enigmatic figures in cycling history. Noteworthy too for its sidebar coverage of Grag LeMond, whose career was begining it's decline when Indurain's Tour dominance began."},{"Title":"Champion: Bicycle Racing in the Age of Miguel Indurain","review":"A good read for anyone who followed cycling in the late 80s and 90s. This makes the struggle of stage racing a very human experience - what an incredible talent Indurain was!"},{"Title":"The Modern Machiavelli: Power and Influence at Work","review":"Like &quot;The Prince&quot;, this book is about acquiring and obtaining power. The book takes the form of an entertaining narrative of one man's search for power. Along the way, he meets Caracalla, a CEO who teases and tantalises him with glimpses of the knowledge he seeks.The book is very well structured and easy to read. It extracts the main principles of &quot;The Prince&quot; and divides them into the &quot;Principles of Power&quot;. The book itself has very little resemblance to &quot;The Prince&quot; and I'm very impressed by Demack's insightful analysis of the original text. Some of the tenets of the book are controversial, but upon reflection they do make sense for someone seeking to acquire power.The book has some very powerful lessons to offer and I believe it is applicable to many areas of life. The book is not just for power hungry moguls, it will almost certainly have some contribution to your day to day life."},{"Title":"The Modern Machiavelli: Power and Influence at Work","review":"Ian Demack shows us a story of acquiring power in the modern world, and how Machiavelli's principles still apply today. It is a scary and realistic look at the moral, ethical and legal sacrifices that must be made in pursuit of power. This is very easy reading, and it condenses Machiavelli's The Prince into a story not unlike a fairy tale, which was what George Orwell did with Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Al-Mawrid: A Modern English-Arabic Dictionary 2001","review":"The Mawrid Arabic-English is a good, complete dictionary, perhaps - no, certainly - the best published in the Middle East. It works in alphabetical order, which is good for the beginner as well as for the intermediate learner who's searched through a root-order dictionary without success for a word. The major flaw with this book is that it's aimed at Arab readers and as a result, simple grammatical information like broken plurals or masdars is not shown with the base noun or verb. Learners of Arabic will find the root-order Wehr more useful, but if they can afford two, buy this too, especially as Wehr hasn't been updated in over 25 years while the Mawrid is frequently updated. (I own both.)The Mawrid English-Arabic dictionary is perhaps the best available because, though the Oxford English-Arabic Dictionary of Current Usage is more useful to learners of Arabic for reasons of Arabic grammatical content, the Oxford is 40 years old and the language had expanded significantly. Again, buy both, but here the Mawrid English-Arabic would be my first choice (you can always use Wehr to look up the grammatical info)."},{"Title":"Al-Mawrid: A Modern English-Arabic Dictionary 2001","review":"A few years ago, a brother at a masjid gave this dictionary to me as a gift. Before that, the Hans Wehr dictionary was all I had to go on. Since this dictionary isn't based on the three consonant root system, there is no need to know the root of an arabic word before looking it up. There have been quite a few words which I could not find in my Hans Wehr because I simply didn't know the root. I use this dictionary to look up words when I don't know the root. Once a word is found, I can easily find the root by looking at the arabic definition and similar words provided. Knowing the root enables me to use my Hans Wehr in order to find the verb forms, examples of usage, and more elaborate definitions in english.This dictionary doesn't give the verb forms and the definitions are not that detailed because examples of word usage is nonexistent. The book is also too large and a real pain in the neck to carry around. It's good for looking up words quickly and finding roots, but for more serious study of arabic there is no substitute for the Hans Wehr dictionary of modern written arabic."},{"Title":"Al-Mawrid: A Modern English-Arabic Dictionary 2001","review":"If you want Al-Mawrid, buy the hardcover version; do not buy Al-Quareeb Al-Mawrid, which is a shoddy knock-off.1) The very positive reviews of this book on amazon are for a DIFFERENT BOOK! The first few reviews are labelled so, and later reviews, while not so labelled, refer to features like the \\"The fine hardcover binding...\\" and \\"... a dictionary for Arabic and English brovrebs [sic: proverbs] - translated back and forth\\" which are not included in this paperback edition. Also, both books have the same number of reviews. Without having checked all the reviews individually, I believe Amazon has cross-linked the reviews of the hardback version to the paperback version as if they were the same aside from the binding, but THEY ARE NOT.2) The typeset is too small - if you are not fairly familiar with the basic arabic script, you will have difficulty discerning the Arabic spelling of some words.3) The English-Arabic portion is poorly organized for translation into Arabic. For example, the entry \\"flush\\" is followed by 16 definitions, without English equivalents or indication of parts of speech. Multiple undifferentiated definitions of English words are common. The book appears to be an Arabic dictionary of English and an English dictionary of Arabic bound together. If you are a student of Arabic and need to translate English words into Arabic, this dictionary is of little use.4) The paperback edition currently being shipped is VERY poorly bound. The first time I opened the book a dozen pages fell out of it, and more have fallen out since then.

The Arabic words are sorted alphabetically instead according to the roots (e.g. bait=House, is typically a tough job to find as it has to be looked up normally below ba - ya - ta; whereby the middle letter ya is weak). The content of words is oriented to newspapers rather than to classical Arabic texts where it is also helpful but what would need to understand the systems of roots in Arabic to properly understand the complexity of meaning.

Most if not all of the upper-level students I've met use either this or Hans Wehr, nothing else.The pro of Mawrid over Hans is the speed at which one can find a word because there's no having to determine the root.

Although actual Arabic books run from right to left, I would prefer that both sections run from left to right--as does Wehr's dictionaryArabic-English Dictionary: The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic.

I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Chancy","review":"All worthwhile endeavors are chancy this book is no exception. Will the average reader give this book a second look? Today sex and violence seems to be the main stay of entertainment at first glance this book appeared to be no different, but I was otherwise refreshingly surprised. This is not a western, but a true historical piece. The description about a bustling boomtown before the turn of the 19th century is realistic and believable. You walk away with the feeling that the characters really existed whether con-artist, gambler, miners, bankers, and the of course the fairer of the sexes. If you drop the TV depiction of the old west and take a good hard look here, you will see the rich culture and refinement of the old west. You will also be entertained by the unusual events and how these all come together in the story line. Chancy is aptly named."},{"Title":"Chancy","review":"&quot;Chancy&quot; opened with a bang and kept my interest all the way through. There was lots of action, but what I found really cool was that, as the book went on, the plot became more and more intricate. At the end of the book, I found myself wondering what happened to the characters next. I hope there is a sequel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"William Fitzhugh and his Chesapeake world, 1676-1701: The Fitzhugh letters and other documents (Virginia Historical Society documents)","review":"This is an excellent book for descendants of William Fitzhugh (1651-1701) who was the first of the family to come to America in about 1671. The editor, Richard Beale Davis, includes early Fitzhugh genealogy in the forward. The letters to and from William Fitzhugh give an excellent picture of life in Colonial Virginia."},{"Title":"Poison and Medicine: Ethnicity, Power, and Violence in a Nigerian City, 1966 to 1986 (Social History of Africa)","review":"This is a first-rate examination of the complexities that underlie communal violence in Northern Nigeria. Drawing upon skillful fieldwork, Anthony deftly weaves together issues of ethnicity, religion, politics and economic underdevelopment to show that there is no simple explanation or single cause behind this region's all-too-common conflicts.A must-read for anyone interested in inter-communal violence anywhere, and an excellent example of how to present complex issues in clear and engaging prose. A great text to use for a course on fieldwork methods, also."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"I have several books for gluten and casein free diets. When I find a recipe I really like, I enter it on my computer. When I printed out my recipe database ALL of my favorites were from this book. Most of the recipes are every bit as good as their gluten-rich counterparts. I have this book for my son who is off of gluten, casein (dairy), soy, corn and eggs. With this book, the recipes aren't the only benefit. There are many very helpful sections about substitutions (as well as other helpful tips). I used prune baby food (as suggested by the book, 3Tbsp. = 1 egg) in place of eggs in the brownie recipe - Delicious! I used it as birthday cake for my son. He loved it. I also have to mention the bread. It is the best gluten free bread I've ever tasted (pizza crust is good too). One tip, smaller pans work much better when not using eggs (i.e. muffin cups instead of cake pan)."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"This book covered alot of basics for me, all in one book. With a gluten and Bakers yeast allergy it offers the best homemade pizza crust recipe I have found yet! I also use this book for waffles, rolls, muffins, etc. It covers alot of the basics: Pizza crust, rolls, cakes, cookies, etc. I can't find it new so I have been ordering used copies to give as gifts to allergic family members and friends."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"We are contaminating our bodies with the chemical foods we eat and this book displays very good diet solutions that put you on your way to much better health.

When first diagnosed I went looking for some cookbooks to help me figure all this out and came home with an arm load. This one has been my mainstay, my good friend, my right arm!!! I don't know what I would do without it. When I could not eat yeast it gave me delicious non yeast gluten free recipes. When I could eat yeast again it gave me delicious gluten free recipes with yeast. It has breads, cakes, snacks, dressings you name it its in there. You just have to taste the brownies! My son-in-law thought they were the best he had ever tasted and he does not eat gluten free! It even has substitutes, resource lists and everything you need. It is beautifully laid out, easy to follow and everything is very, very delicious! Ask my family! No one even knows these are gluten free they are soooo good! If you are on a gluten free diet or have allergies or sensitivities this is a &quot;must buy&quot; book for you!"},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"Although this cook book does contain some wonderful recipes, I was very surprised to find so many of the recipes called for dairy, eggs, and/or refined sugars (brown sugar is refined). I thing the author/publisher missed the mark when they included \\"Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar\\" in the titled of this book.Many of the cake recipes call for eggs. My wife has made several cakes using egg replacer or tofu which were better than \\"the real thing\\". In the Appendices, Dr Fenster does provide substitution tables, which are quite extensive. However, my expectation, based on the title, was that the recipes would be without wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, yeast, or refined sugar. I am disappointed."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"I ordered this book hoping to make some recipes for my husband, who has many allergies. The title is misleading. Most of the recipes use brown sugar, which IS refined sugar and not healthy. Many recipes use dairy and eggs. This book is also not good for someone with allergies to corn or potato either as many contain these ingredients. I was disappointed and am sending it back."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"I wanted to take the time to write this review becuase I am so grateful to the author. I have baked virtually everything in this book. For the first time, I was able to bake a birthday cake for my 5 year old daughter. It was so good, that people at her party did not even realize it was her &quot;special cake&quot;. They ate it, tofu icing and all! I cannot speak to the other recipes at the present time, however, I look forward to trying those as well. If you or your family are confronted with food sensitivities, you must try these recipies. You may just discover the same success and optimism that I did. The greatest reward is looking at my daughter's smile when she brings her snacks to school and blows out the birthday candles."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"The recipes in this book avoid all common allergens. It is practical, common sense cooking. The ingredients are easily available and appetizing. Since all of the recipes are allergy sensitive, I am not stuck with a book than I can only use part of. I think this is one of my best purchases yet, and I am delighted with it!"},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"Carol Fenster has created specialty cookbooks which contain recipes that have surpassed all our expections of wheat,gluten, dairy,and egg free cookbooks. (The recipes can be yeast and refined sugar free, as well.) The design of each recipe makes it easy to customize to your individual needs based on the substitutions she has provided in each recipe. Until I found &quot;Special Diet Solutions&quot; and &quot;Special Diet Celebrations&quot; for my child with multiple food allergies, I was very discouraged by the quality of the end product. These cookbooks have never failed to please us! The chocolate wheat free, dairy free, egg free birthday cake has been served to non-allergic guests who proclaim it to be every bit as good as a non-specialty cake. The pizza crust recipe is the best we have found. All of the recipes have great taste, texture and visual appeal. We are ever grateful to Carol Fenster for creating recipes that allow our child to have food that looks and tastes as appealing as every other child's. As a pediatric allergy nurse I also recommend these cookbooks as a must have for all families with a wheat allergic child. Delicious, nutritionally sound, easy to prepare recipes with out conventional ingredients. She has made the impossible not only possible, but delicious!"},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"This book really makes it easy to eat ALMOST anything you can imagine, even if you have to avoid wheat, gluten, eggs, and dairy, like I do.

My family doesn't know they're on my diet!"},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"We recently took our four year old son off of gluten and dairy. I initially got Roben Ryberg's book, \\"The Gluten Free Kitchen.\\" It was disappointing. Couldn't get the ingredients to blend properly and the bread never came out. A friend of mine knew someone who was using, \\"Special Diet Solutions.\\" After reading the reviews on Amazon I ordered it. It has become my baking bible! With four children, it was important to me to make yummy tasting treats that would help the entire family support our son on his new diet. We don't feel deprived one bit! The Sandwich Bread is a favorite. It tastes very good and is very easy to make. The Brownies and Chocolate Chip cookies are delicious. The kids love the waffles. I recently made the Corn Bread to go with chili and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the gluten free recipe and the old one I used containing wheat flour. It is slightly on the sweet side, but I adjusted the sugar the next time I made it and it was perfect. Living overseas in the UK, I have had some difficulty obtaining some ingredients. I've been able to substitute soy margarine for the Spectrum Brand margarine/shortening with success. Family members from the States are happy to mail dry milk powder and gluten free chocolate. The author provides alternatives to sweetners, eggs, dairy, and yeast which could be valuable for some, but if you're allergic to corn, corn starch is contained in some, but not all recipes. I've tried about three gluten free cookbooks and overall, this one is the one I use the most."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"I am avoiding wheat, eggs, dairy, peanuts, and half a dozen more foods because of my daughter's eczema, and I've had to learn a new way to cook and eat.

You can imagine the pleasure he got from eating rich, moist, really decadent chocolate cake for his birthday this year. I have also baked the carrot cake and served both to guests. Each time, our friends were so impressed, they asked for the recipes. That is powerful testimony to how truly delicious these baked goods taste."},{"Title":"Special Diet Solutions: Healthy Cooking Without Wheat, Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, Yeast, or Refined Sugar","review":"This book is excellent for both my wife who has to have a gluten free diet and myself as a diabetic. The flavors of the foods are so good, I wonder why I did not start enjoying this style of cooking many years ago. We would not have the problems we have today if we had started earlier.

And it should be titled &quot;baking, breads and desserts&quot;, not &quot;cooking&quot;. My expectation was to find some recipes for entrees I could prepare, as well as desserts.

Comic Book/Austin Powers-like? Yes (VBG). This story reminded me of some of the early Science Fiction I read 45 years or so ago as a teenager. Heavy on plot and action rather than characterization. A fun, quick read, reminiscent of simpler times.2. The genetically evolved \\"cats\\" were well thought out and are clearly the strongest characters in the story. The kind of main characters that would be perfect for a Science Fiction series for Teenagers. Maybe someone will pick up on that someday.3. Lovejoy must have planned for at least one sequel to this story. At the end of the story there is otherwise unexplained dialog indicating that a picture of the \\"cats\\" was found in an ancient Tomb, and some ground laying for an archeology expedition. In fact, it was a search for that \\"sequel\\" that lead me here.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Outworld Cats","review":"This book is a stellar example of something that should have had a sequel. The cats are great, the plot twists and turns too fast for those of slow wit, so do read carefully! I picked it up at a used book store and haven't put it down. It starts out with great Sci-Fi tugs and then moves into the antics of the two cats... who remind me of every trouble-making/overly-smart cat I have ever had. It touches on the occult and paranormal interests and the good guys are all funny, if not completely odd, characters. These cats have all the right moves at only the right moments. I do believe the only reason he wrote the book was because of the cats!I will say that if he had written it later in his career it would have been better. The bad guys are written a little flat and with assorted neurosis and paranoias. The main plot faults revolve around the irritating behaviors of the typically bungling thugs, who can't seem to outwit these very brainy cats. But, on the whole I can tell that Lovejoy enjoyed writing this book. I enjoy pulling this book out for a completely turn-my-brain-off reading night."},{"Title":"Outworld Cats","review":"The book starts out describing the race Masters who breeded and engineered cats as a useful race for engineering in their spaceships. The concept and the idea was fascinating and remarkable. And the idea of using &quot;intelligent&quot; cats for such a purpose (small size, genetically evolved to include hands, and there agility in space) is probably the more ingenious idea I seen in an author in some time.From the beginning, I was NOT disappointed in this book. This book was very well written and unless you are ridiculously critical of whether or not such-and-such a character fits the model-role of what a character should be, then I think you will enjoy this book immensely. There are many funny scenes involving the intelligent cats. Everything from them playing chess, and they would usually win :) To them battling the villians in the story. Very good book, and I look forward to reading more Lovejoy works involving these feline companions."},{"Title":"Outworld Cats","review":"As a fan of the furry sub-genre, I was lured by the summary description of \\"Outworld Cats\\". The idea of a pair of cat-like telepathic aliens uncovering a sinister plot certainly has possibilities. But I was more than a little disappointed. Most of the characters are cliche from head to toe. Far from being good sci-fi, the villains seemed more the type you'd expect to find in comic books, and their plot had all the cheesiness of an Austin Powers movie without the humor. Tim and Verna, the two primary human protagonists, are boring, and they're the best human characters in the book. The only characters I really enjoyed reading about were the two cats, whose clever and amusing scenes were too few and far between. The plot has huge holes in it, and seems to have undertones critical of how science approaches paranormal phenomena. I'd recommend it only to readers who enjoy books that are so bad they're funny."},{"Title":"Outworld Cats","review":"This book is not at all what I hoped for. With a title like \\"Outworld Cats,\\" I thought it would be an interesting story about two alien cats figuring out how to deal with Earthlings. Sadly, no. Really, it's about an odd handful of humans who defeat a maniacal businessman. The alien cats just show up from time to time to help the action along.The characterizations are all very flat. Even though potentially interesting (i.e., an occult investigator, a native American shaman in training, a bodybuilder MBA student, an Italian silent film actress), none of the characters have any depth or backstory (i.e., you now know as much about these characters as you will after finishing the book). The bad guys are brutish thugs who take pride in their lack of intelligence, and (joy) we get to follow them for a quarter of the book. I have no idea how thay managed to come \\"this close\\" to taking over the world. The alien cats are hyperintelligent but never communicate with the humans and thus spend the entire time bemusedly watching the main characters and generally having no idea what is going on. They never regale the reader with their interesting observations about human nature or culture from an alien viewpoint, but we do get to watch them smack the neighbor's cat around for being mean.OK, so at least there's action, right? Well, yeah, stuff happens, but it's not an exiting action story - there are no space battles or car chases or anything. The bad guys are mean to everyone (including each other). The good guys escape by inviting all the body builders in California to a film festival. (Really!) Since it is hard to care about the main characters, it is hard to get interested in what they are doing. The capstone: the good guys barely scratch the surface of the big bad's nefarious plan, yet the cats manage to destroy the plan through actions that were apparently taken on a whim (as they have no idea what's going on overall but can repeat whatever they see someone type on a computer).The best thing I can say is that the prose is pleasant enough to read. There's just not a lot of reason to do so."},{"Title":"Outworld Cats","review":"I really enjoyed this book--the premise, the cats, and the other characters--and how they worked together. There was suspense and fun. I enjoyed it so much that I wrote the author, and I got a reply from him dated November 4,1996 (which I found in a collection of old papers and stuff today), wherein he said that he was working on \\"a sequel called The Slave of the Lamp, in which Domino and Dominique and their friends are pitted against a super computer and an Ifrit out of the Arabian Nights, and must return there to give battle. ...\\" So, I came to search on amazon.com to see if I could find it, but it's not here."},{"Title":"American Catholic Heritage: Stories of Growth","review":"American Catholic Heritage is an excellent exposition both on the history of the Catholic Church in the United States its interaction with general U.S. History.Father Faherty orders his narrative chronologically, starting with the colonial era persecutions of the church. Not limiting his history to the water's edge, Father Faherty gives some background to the English origins of the religious rivalries which the colonists carried with them to the colonies.The road to Independence also led to greater tolerance for the Church. This resulted, in large measure, from the welcome aid the new nation received from its Catholic allies, France and Spain. The success of the Revolution brought into the nation a Catholic population which, unlike most of its new compatriots, was not of British origin. The French settlers of the interior sparsely populated a vast region in which Catholicism was the dominant faith. The first prominent American Catholic family was the Carrolls of Maryland, a family which provided a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the first Bishop in the United States. It is the legacies Lord Baltimore and of Bishop Carroll which give Baltimore its status as the oldest American diocese. As America grew through the War of 1812 and the Era of Good Feeling, the Church grew with it.The increase in immigration from Catholic countries, primarily Ireland and Germany, created both opportunities and threats for the Church. No longer a minority to be ignored, Catholics began to constitute an increasing and largely foreign portion of the populace. This lead to the Know-Nothing movement of hostility to Catholics and foreigners, bringing with it new persecutions of the Church.Responding to its new status as a surrounded minority, the Church soon became and remains a major provider of education. Distrustful of the Protestant orientation of public schools, Catholic parishes began their network of parochial grade and Catholic high schools. The growth of higher education in 19th and 20th century America was driven, to a large degree, by colleges and universities founded by Catholic religious orders.As the Church welcomed the huddled masses of Europe, a tension which strained the secular social fabric also pulled at the Church. Just as the influx of non-British immigrants challenged the definition of America as an White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nation, so it drove the Church into a defining moment. The Church had to choose whether to remain a collection of European churches serving ethnic communities in the United States or to shepherd its flocks into the mainstream of American culture. The choice was not always easy or obvious, but, ultimately, the Church did play a role in bringing its faithful into full American citizenship.The Civil War tested the Church, as it tested the nation. Like the nation of which it was a part, the loyalties largely split along geographic lines. Individual Catholics did achieve prominent positions in various roles. Catholic chaplains left heroic stories as did the Nuns who provided a large proportion of the nurses serving the sick and wounded. Like its nation, the postwar Church in America failed to seize the opportunity to help fully integrate the emancipated slaves into the American nation.The first Vatican council of 1870 was the first opportunity for American Catholic bishops to play a prominent role in the Universal Church. One major issue of the Council was the question of papal infallibility. The opposition to the doctrine was primarily centered in the English-speaking countries. Those in Catholic countries saw the definition of the doctrine as an opportunity to shore up a hierarchy under attack by democratic and anti-religous movements throughout Europe. Those prelates who served minority communities in their countries, saw that the doctrine would be misunderstood in their countries and would create problems for their flocks. The American bishops were motivated in their opposition to the definition by two concerns. One was that infallibility rested in the bishops collectively and not in the Pope individually. The other was that, even if the doctrine could be agreed on, the promulgation of it at that time would not be helpful. After the doctrine of Papal Infallibility was accepted by the Council, the American bishops who had opposed the measure pledged their acceptance of the decision.After covering the above summarized topics, Father Faherty writes of various individuals who were prominent in supporting social reforms.In the final chapters, Father Faherty records how the actions of his hero, Pope John XXIII, initiated the modernization of the Church in America and around the world. Vatican Council II was another world forum in which American bishops figured prominently and with more success than their predecessors had a century before. The exuberance of the Council ended as the winds blowing out of the Council withered some of the traditions of the Church in the without nurturing immediately adequate replacements.Father Faherty ends by saying that American Catholics of our age stand in relation to their country as the Christians of the second century did to the Roman Empire. We are part of a society which will either become totally secular or, as did the Roman Empire, totally Christian. The role of Catholics and other Christians will play a major role in the direction of our society. As we build on the past, it is the Catholics of today who will extend the American Catholic Heritage into the future."},{"Title":"Antipodes","review":"In this little collection of stories-- his second book to be published in English, the Mexican writer Ignacio Padilla establishes himself as a fantastic teller of tales. They are set all over the world and no two of them have anything in common with each other except they are all inventive and brilliant. In the story \\"Ever Wrest: Log of the Journey,\\" we have a pilot into women's clothes who climbs Mount Everest and then disappears: \\"The Chineses say nothing about how Wilson's [the cross-dressing climber] body was clothed but it is still possible to view, in the Alpine Museum of the Communist Party, a voluptuous high-heeled shoe that the legendary mountaineer Chu Ying-hua swears he found under the snow only a few paces from the British flag that Sir Edmund Hillary planted on the summit of Everest just a few days before Princess Elizabeth was crowned in Westminister Abbey.\\" Another favorite of mine is \\"Chronicle of the Second Plague\\" in which inhabitants of St. Martin believe that since they have survived the bubonic plague that they are immune from a second plague, a little like the belief many of us hold that lightning would never strike the same place twice. Then there is the narrator in \\"The Chinaman with the Heads\\" who meets a gentleman who is trying to get through customs with a box that contains \\"half a dozen human heads carefully wrapped in linen, with a penetrating odor that led me to believe they had been preserved in formaldehyde.\\"Mr. Padilla seems to be right smack in the Latin American writers' tradition of magic realism. I understand a new novel will be translated soon into English. I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Antipodes","review":"I came across this slim volume while looking around for short story collections and was pleasantly surpised by the quality of Padilla's writing. This collection reminded me of some of Italo Calvino's stories, with shifts from simplicity to elegance throughout. In under 150 pages you will visit points around globe, including the Gobi desert and a deranged explorer, a sanitorium transformed into a lush garden, and a curious city known for its flour during a time of starvation."},{"Title":"Antipodes","review":"Ignacio Padilla really delivers with this collection of eclectic, mesmerizing fables set during various historical times in the 19th and 20th centuries.Every story is well crafted and character-driven; the settings large, the stories intimate and inviting. Padilla has obviously spent his energies wisely in his choice of words, his characters' plight, and his landscapes' depth.This book was just a delight to read. It will be one of those books that I look forward to sharing with new people again and again.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Antipodes","review":"Ignacio Padilla writes wonderful \\"fables\\" with themes of colonialism, politics, adventure, ethnic superiority, personal honor and life in general run amok - entertaining tales showing potential but not yet up to the quality of the masters (Pelevin, Calvino, Borges).However, if you want a chuckle on perfect health or minimal need for sleep Padilla will provoke both thought and laughter. My favorite image is that of paintings \\"quite simply wearing away from being looked at so much.\\" Not even time is reliable in Rhodesia when settlers are afflicted with \\"nkalo.\\" War becomes a calculation of odds - based on authentic vs. imitation weapons. Padilla's story worlds are inventive and amusing but not quite compelling in the manner of Borges or Pelevin. Padilla is clearly an author worth watching in his development."},{"Title":"Antipodes","review":"Was completely charmed by this delightful collection of surreal short stories. All at once reminded of Isabel Allende, Unamuno, Rudyard Kipling and Cervantes."},{"Title":"Corruption and Anti-Corruption: An Applied Philosophical Approach (Basic Ethics in Action)","review":"Corruption is the pervasive, pernicious, pathological, preemptory, and predatory commonality within the ten high level threats to humanity as identified by the United Nations High-Level Threat Panel and published in 2004 inA More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change; and is also responsible for between 20% and 40% of the lost resources of all kinds across the twelve core policy areas as inspired by the UN but identified by the Earth Intelligence Network (501c3) dedicated to creating public intelligence in the public interest-and especially \\"true cost\\" intelligence. (E.g. Exxon did not make $40 billion in profit in its recent high year--that was stolen from current and future generations because Exxon externalizes $12 in costs for every gallon of gas that it sells for $4). SeeINTELLIGENCE for EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainabilityand also, for the underlying hope factor,Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace.This book is beyond six stars--it is righteously constructive, useful, concise, focused, relevant, and despite some heavy trails in the middle, a joy to read for anyone who believes that there is plenty of wealth for all, we just need to stop corruption in all its forms. Lawrence Lessig, I have been told, is committing the rest of his life to eradicating corruption--his latest bookRemix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economyis particularly recommended because I am discovering, as he has, that HYBRID is going to be the core concept for the 21st Century. To take a very specific example, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) has helped the Government of Guatemala put more people in jail (over 130) in relation to corruption and illegal armed groups, in four years, than the rest of the UN and I suspect INTERPOL and EUROPOL as well. It is a HYBRID organization with uniquely effective capabilities, a \\"son\\" of the United Nations but not part of \\"the\\" United Nations. I personally believe that it represents the future of multi-layered multi-stakeholder governance, still respecting the national government as the core actor, but bringing to bear transnational resources, autonomous investigative and analytic capabilities, and ultimately engaging all of the stakeholders including the oligarchs and the labor unions, so as to address the totality of a nation's problems starting with poverty--what the UN is now calling \\"Deliver As One\\" integrated holistic mission analysis.Here is my summary of this extraordinary book and I repeat, this needs to be translated into Spanish, French, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, and ideally Malay, Turkish, and several other languages as well. It is a completely different book from Overcoming Corruption [ISBN 0956478808 and strangely not coming up in the Link Feature.] I venture to suggest these two books as a starting point for a new wave of regionalization and transnationalization of anti-corruption campaigns.Up front one immediately is familiarized with a pyramid for achieving a culture of \\"ethical resistance\\" (the term emerges later in the book). The foundation, the largest part of the solution, is moral education starting in kindergarten, to instill the essential social norms that make shame inherent in misbehavior. The middle of the triangle, larger than the foundation but smaller than the apex, is the \\"carrots\\" part of the solution, including preventive anti-corruption measures that both incentivize good behavior and make bad behavior much harder. Finally, the apex, and rightfully the smallest part of the solution, is the \\"sticks,\\" the detection, the investigation, the prosecution, and ultimately the conviction but importantly a conviction followed by rehabilitation and reassimilation into society.The three authors are coherent as one. There is no clumsiness in this book. Early on they review the CONDITIONS that enable corruption including an immoral environment, the absence of accountability mechanisms, and the lack of transparency.They distinguish among individual, organized, organizational, grand, and systemic corruption, and as the book comes to a close I note to myself that all governments less Singapore, Netherlands, and the Nordics, have way too much grand systemic corruption, the USA most of all for its corruption is pervasive within the two-party tyranny and the symbiotic continuity of corruption from Bush-Cheney to Obama-Biden; and so also are most large organizations including NGOs such as the Red Cross, religions such as the Catholic Church in particular, and movements such as the Climate Change movement, corrupt as well. This book is required to understand the broad nature of corruption--as Buckminster Fuller defines INTEGRITY (seeCritical Path)--so does this book define its opposite, CORRUPTION.Among the causes of grand systemic corruption are01) Class conflict02) Unjust and unequal systems of wealth and status (think oligarchs refusing to pay taxes or yield on Native Title claims; military-industrial complexes, and of course illegal armed groups and illegal clandestine groups more often than not supported by if not actually created by government clandestine organizations much as the CIA has ruined Guatemala since 1954--no dictatorship too small to embrace.03) Moral confusion including laws not tracking with the moral codes most people innately understand04) Imbalances of power among stakeholder groupsThese conditions are exacerbated by inadequacies in investigative, legal, and correctional capabilities at the same time that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) dramatically increases the complexity, speed, and difficulty of detecting illegal transactions.Secrecy and undeclared or undetected conflicts of interest breed corruption, which is defined at this point as anything that clouds the proper exercise of judgment. The antidotes are avoidance and full disclosure.Oddly, it is at this point that I note \\"truth\\" is not a term that appears in the index. As my own mantra is \\"the truth at any cost lowers all other costs,\\" and as I believe that the truth and reconciliation process that Nelson Mandela has shown can save a nation is the underlying foundation for anti-corruption within the many failed states that cry out for transnational help, this is an anomaly I hope that authors address in what must surely be a second edition of this righteous work.I will jump past the middle section of the book to focus on the core point that the authors arrive at: that we must rethink governance top to bottom--the mechanisms, the practices, the regulations, the ethics, the obligations, the ends. It is at this point that I am reminded of two books that are part of the solution:High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve ThemThe People's Business: Controlling Corporations and Restoring DemocracyThe authors point out that corruption goes hand in hand with incompetence and bad business judgment (or bad political appointee judgment, just look at George \\"Slam Dunk\\" Tenet betraying the public interest at his first Cabinet meeting).Throughout the book, but perhaps not as explicitly as is now possible as business leaders are discovering the huge value of both compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) *and* government officials, for example in India, are discovering how valuable it can be to their own reputation to award contracts to companies absolutely known to not do bribes, the authors point out the tangible and intangible benefits of ethics to all stakeholders.There are frequent references to the need for new designs, and especially designs that eliminate stovepipe power and absolute hierarchical power. The empowerment of employees is ultimately both a productivity benefit, and a profit benefit.The book wraps up with an examination of preventive (proactive) measures including the promotion of ethical behavior; the complete makeover of corporate (and I would emphasize, government bureaucracy) governance, and the imposition of transparency in all possible forms; and with an examination of reactive anti-corruption, which is relatively passive, linear, made difficult by inherent secrecy and privilege, under-resourced, and severely challenged by the acceleration of all that is associated with globalization.The authors do a fine job of discussing how anti-corruption organizations THEMSELVES need a code of ethics and a carefully itemized list of transgressions from wasting time with Facebook and YouTube (a 20% cost in organizations I am familiar with, as well as a 40% bandwidth hog) to leaking sensitive information about ongoing investigations. In essence, anti-corruption organizations need their own \\"Rocks & Shoals\\" litany and every employee must be familiarized with it on entry and frequently thereafter. HYBRID is a word that enables polygraphing of everyone at least once a year (the UN does not allow polygraphing of all the spies pretending to be clerks would be quickly declared Personna Non Grata--the UN not only suffering spying, it suffers the incompetence and lack of productivity that comes from putting spies in cover jobs they have no clue about).The authors emphasize the truly draconian challenge of--and importance of--being able to follow global electronic transactions.They provide an entire chapter on whistle-blowing, and the lesson I draw from this is that anti-corruption campaigns need to make it very--VERY--easy for whistleblowers to submit helpful information. This is where the culture of \\"ethical resistance\\" comes in and I am actually moved to believe we can clean up our filthy governments.A chapter on the rights of suspects completes the book.See all 1500 plus of my non-fiction reviews, in 98 categories including Corruption, Crime (Corporate) and Crime (Government), at Phi Beta Iota, the Public Intelligence Blog.

Very soon, into the South Atlantic, they were in strange, new waters where mystery and superstition dominated the thoughts of the explorers. There is so much more the reader longs to know - what were the thoughts of the average crew members? What did the physical sights look like to them. What was day-to-day life like on this long voyage? Of course, Wilson had little to go on. The principal diary of Drake was lost after he turned it over to the Queen. The book is readable and exciting. With few earthly frontiers left, we can only imagine the spirit of adventure these men must have felt. But so much is lost down through the ages.

My main objection to most of these sequels is that they attempt to continue Austen's stories -- usually in ways that are counter to how I think (and have thought for years) they would have continued.This book, on the other hand, makes no changes to Austen's story at all -- it is just the exact same tale, told from a different perspective. And, since Aylmer's opinion of Mr. Darcy's motivations jibs with my own, I was comfortable with that perspective.My one real complaint was that, in places, Aylmer's use of Austen's own dialogue was jarring. In particular, the scene in which Lady Catherine confronts Darcy late in the book. Several pages of Austen's dialogue interspersed with \\"She said...\\" and \\"Then, I said...\\" Irritating and sloppy. The device of reusing Austen's dialogue worked very well when it was used in scenes that were lifted directly from the orginal. Especially since believable \\"Austen dialogue\\" seems particularly difficult for non-Austen authors to pull off. However, it worked far less well in scenes where the dialogue was reported second hand, such as in the Lady Catherine scene.I also enjoyed _Jane Fairfax_ by Susan Aiken and for the same reason -- that was Austen's _Emma_ told through the eyes of Jane Fairfax. These two have been the only Austen 'sequels' which I have found tolerable."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"When reading the reviews for this book, I was a little surprised at the negative ones. I purchased this book without reading any reviews, and so had a \\"blank slate\\" from which to judge it. I thoroughly enjoyed Janet Aylmer's take on Mr. Darcy. Ms. Aylmer took a very sympathetic view of our hero and created a very plausible complement to Jane Austen's orignial work."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Luckily, I only borrowed this book and did not buy it. A friend recommended it to me because she loves P&P. However, I didn't find that the book added anything of real value to Austen's work, nor did it keep the same tone, sweep, or appeal of the original P&P. Please look elsewhere for Darcy's story, this one is certainly not worth reading..."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"For those few born on another planet - In Longbourn, wealthy Charles Bingley rents Netherfield Park, which excites Mrs. Bennet, mother of five daughters whom she wants married to quality. At a gala Charles and the oldest Bennet sister, Jane hit it off. However, his wealthy friend Fitzwilliam Darcy acts pompous believing the next in line Elizabeth is beneath him; he alienates all the locals even Mrs. Bennet. When Jane becomes ill while visiting Charles, she is forced to stay at his leased manor house. Elizabeth continually walks over to tend to her sister, which brings her into contact with the prideful Fitzwilliam who soon finds he appreciates her honesty and intelligence while she sees through his prejudicial armor of superiority to his inner soul while Charles' arrogant sister disdains her as she feels superior and the equal of Fitzwilliam.Conceptually DARCY'S STORY is a terrific idea, however, the execution of bringing out Darcy's side of events like that first ball and how he compares Elizabeth with Miss Bingley, etc is interesting but flat. The problem is too much is lifted from the original Jane Austen classic leading to readers to want to put down this tale and go back to Pride and Prejudice. Lacking the originality of Janet Aylmer's AN ASSEMBLY SUCH AS THIS, DARCY'S STORY is for a select limited audience of Ms. Austen's fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I was suspicious of this, since Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite books, and I've read a couple of \\"sequels\\" that the author's modern sensibilites shone through a little too much.

Some of this book is straight from P&P, Some of it is the author's imagination. It is a very active imagination, though. I like this book quite a bit. Because of the change of primary protagonist, some of the characters that had little exposure in P&P (Georgiana Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet's Uncle and Aunt Gardiner) get much more exposure here and their lives are more explored. All of your favorite moments happen again, albeit perhaps slightly differently than you remembered them (try viewing things from someone else's eyes and see if it looks different to you too).

If you really love Pride & Prejudice, you might enjoy it from a slightly different angle. Instead of re-reading your favorite, you can re-live it in Darcy's Story.

This book tells Darcy's side of the story, and tells it very well. I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Darcy's Story is Pride and Prejudice from a different perspective, that of Fitzwilliam Darcy, just as Rosenkrantz and Gildenstern are Dead is Hamlet from a different perspective. Within the first couple pages, I quickly became aware that this is fan fiction (though the writing is much more skilled than fan fiction I've come across online) and that the author's style isn't as funny and witty as Jane Austen's. However, as the author points out in a note at the back of the book, the witty and satirical tone of Pride and Prejudice is appropriate since it's from Elizabeth Bennet's vivacious and witty perspective (although it's in third person), and Darcy's Story is appropriate more serious and brooding, since it's from Darcy's perspective. That said, Jane Austen would have written it with her customary wit.Darcy's Story begins chronologically before Pride and Prejudice, because it covers the time when Wickham elopes with Darcy's sister Georgiana. Since most of the novel takes place at the same time as Pride and Prejudice, the author has taken much of Jane Austen's dialog, but this time around we witness Darcy's thoughts and emotions. The book does continue after the classic novel ends, because it includes the couple's preparations for married life and it includes the wedding. I think this ending could have been omitted.If you'd like to learn more about Fitzwilliam Darcy, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Colonel Fitzwilliam, you'll enjoy this book.

Most of this book is dialogue directly from Pride & Prejudice. I understand that some people wouldn't want to tamper with the classic, but I think some creative license could have been taken. When Darcy was speaking it was all mostly word for word from Austen, or a paraphrasing of what he said in Austen's work. I thought there would be some extra scenes, and though there were a few thrown in, they were rather dull. I did gain some insight into Darcy as a person, but I felt it was more of a telling, not a showing. I love the story, so it was nice to almost read it again, but I felt after reading it that Darcy wasn't much more illuminated than in the original."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I though this book was really good.

In this case I am glad for I would have missed reading this one. I liked this book very much. I have read comments that it lifted from P&P and lacked imagination.

Maybe I liked it so very well because I dislike books that do not keep characters consistent. I found this book very pleasing, and like visiting an old friend again with fresh conversation."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I am tempted to simply say, reread the review by Jennifer Decker, as she is absolutely correct, and it is painful to think about this dreadful book long enough to review it.It is very inferior in style to Pride and Prejudice, and portrays Darcy in a much worse light than Jane Austen chose to do. I rather liked Darcy in the original (my wife says that I am very much like him), but he is an annoying twerp in this retelling. He is obnoxious and stupid, a far cry from Jane Austen's Darcy. (If you think otherwise, I suggest you reread Pride and Prejudice, as there are many subtle hints to his character that many people seem to overlook, particularly on their first reading.) One cannot help but think, in this retelling, that Elizabeth is making a big mistake in the end of this. I am sure that if I reminded my wife of Aylmer's Darcy, I would still be single.In Darcy's Story, there are lengthy excerpts from Pride and Prejudice, especially quoting dialog between Darcy and Elizabeth. The additional dialog written by Aylmer is flat and uninteresting, using stock old-fashioned phrases instead of sentences that are individualized to fit the characters. What we have here is very much like a reunion TV show, of some old beloved series, in which each character is trotted out for us to remember fondly, but with no real interest in itself. Undoubtedly, some will enjoy this, no matter how bad it is in itself, and that applies to this book as well.My wife wisely stopped reading this dreadful book after just a few chapters, despite being a fast reader who devours many books. I continued on, in order that I might be able to write a review, and save some poor soul from being parted with their time and money for such dreck.If you can't get enough Jane Austen, try reading her other novels, all of which are quite good, and add to that her juvenilia. I highly recommend The Oxford Illustrated Jane Austen (Six Volume Set) (Hardcover), edited by R.W. Chapman (ISBN: 0192547070), which can be purchased through Amazon. It is the definitive edition of all of her novels, as well as her \\"minor works\\", things written when she was quite young. It contains, unobtrusively, some commentary in the back to help one understand some of the things with which a modern reader might not be familiar. It is also an attractive, well-made set of books, well worth adding to one's library. Then, when you have run out of new material to read, reread her. Pride and Prejudice stands up well to repeated readings. This has the added advantage of making it easier to notice some of the subtle details that may go unnoticed on the first reading."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Why didn't someone stop this woman? The book is just not written in the style of Austen at all. The language isn't right, in a painful way. There are long passages quoted from Austen, only to be quoted over and over (and over). And the book is pretty short for having quoted Austen so much - that might give you a hint that there isn't much going on. Part of what I love about Austen's work is the twists and turns and how everything is woven together so nicely. Don't expect anything like that here. The scenarios are contrived and presented in a ridiculous way. Darcy explaining in a conversation with Fitzwilliam the relationship between Darcy's father and Wickham - hello! Fitzwilliam is Darcy's cousin - close enough to be Georgianna's co-guardian! I think he knows the story! This is just one example. And the letters that are received - two sentences of fluff. And don't get me started about how repetitive this book is. OK, I've got it: Darcy isn't good with words, he doesn't have Bingley's easy way with people. Stop telling me that, I got it the first time. (Forget the part where later she writes, for once in his life, he was at a loss for words.) Why? Why? Why? Oh it's painful to recall. Don't read this book, it can come to no good!"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Janet Aylmer doesn't elaborate on Jane Austen's storyline in Darcy's Story; she simply retells the original story from Darcy's view. Considering that Pride and Prejudice is told from Lizzy's perspective, and much is about her family, this book is simple, condensed, and can be read in one sitting. This is not a criticism, as I found the book charming. Yes, I noticed a few of the editing errors, but they didn't stop me from enjoying the book for what the author intended. I loved being taken back into Darcy and Elizabeth's world for a short time. Aylmer could have taken me deeper, yes, but I loved where she did take me. She illustrated Darcy's doubts about his character after being dressed down so horribly by Elizabeth. She captured his growing love for Eliza, and his goal of showing her his improvements. Nevertheless, there is not sufficient character development involved in this book for it to be read without first reading the original. This book is not meant to replace Pride and Prejudice, but rather to augment the perspective. If you are familiar with the whole story, and just want to quickly revisit the romantic passions of Austen's original, this book will satisfy."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I had been waiting for \\"The Confession of Fitzwilliam Darcy\\" by Mary Street for so long to get a novel with Darcy's point of view that I settled for this one.There's too much lifting of Jane Austen's text (which a reader would know already) from Pride and Prejudice and not enough suppositions on the what, why and feelings of Mr. Darcy..."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I purchased this on impulse the other day after re-reading P&P; and wanting (as we Austen fans so often do) to spend a little more time with the story. On a very basic level it accomplished that for me--but it offers very little to a reader already familiar with the story.An earlier review calls the writing \\"awful.\\" I wouldn't say awful so much as empty. The early chapters are excessively concerned with exposition (presumably to help those unfamiliar with P&P; to catch-up with the story), but honestly I can't imagine anyone wanting to read this book in lieu of P&P; or before reading P&P.;Unfortunately, Aylmer misses most (nearly all, really) opportunities to truly give us \\"Darcy's point of view\\" in any substantial way. It's as though her editors coached her to merely offer us a different camera angle instead of generating new material that would have genuinely fleshed out Darcy's perspective.By new material I mean, of course, introspection and dialogue. For example: Wouldn't it have been interesting to know what Darcy said to Wickham when he persuaded him to marry Lydia Bennett after their \\"elopement\\" to London? Yes of course it would. Oddly, though, Aylmer doesn't offer any of this. She tells us almost nothing we hadn't already read in the original P&P.; So why bother assembling this book at all?Perhaps Aylmer (a pen-name) is a novice writer who simply hasn't yet learned to craft dialogue (I say this not unkindly, just from an observation of the notably absent material from the text itself.) That's a real possibility. But it speaks poorly of the publisher that such a book would be released without proper editorial coaching. Honestly, the book is poorly crafted and regardless of sales reflects badly on Harper. (Not a shrewd move, given the demographics of their disappointed consumers.)After a little Amazon-searching I quickly found \\"An Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman\\" and its two companion books which appear to actually fulfill the promise of giving us a full view into Darcy's experiences and perspective. I've got my fingers crossed!"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Writing a story from the perspective of Fitzwilliam Darcy was a clever idea. Unfortunately, the story the author \\"created\\" is merely mildly interesting.

The events the entire plot revolves around are in the scenes that are clearly copied from the original Pride & Prejudice; these are the times in which Darcy interacts with P&P's heroine, Eliza Bennett. It is my opinion that the author followed Austen's original work a little too faithfully, almost to the extent that she was afraid to alter anything. Nothing can be gained from this story that won't be found in P&P. Therefore, if you choose to read DARCY'S STORY, it is my recommendation that Pride & Prejudice be read in advance (however, by then, DARCY'S STORY will have been rendered irrelevant to you)."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I impulsively bought this book at an airport bookstore because I had forgotten my current book (Jane Austen's letters) at home. Having just finished this \\"retelling\\" of Pride and Prejudice, I now wish I'd just slept through my flights instead.As other reviewers have mentioned, there is NOTHING new in this book. Not a single thing was revealed about Darcy's character that couldn't be observed with a careful reading of P&P.; I've read fanfiction online that was infinitely superior to this book. The author's own (not borrowed) writing (which rarely appeared) was completely lacking in spirit, wit, and imagination.Again, as other reviewers have pointed out, the editing errors in the book were particularly troublesome, as they made for many jarring problems for the reader. What annoyed me most, though, was the constant stating, restating, and restating AGAIN of Austen's own dialogue, as if the reader couldn't remember what was said just 2 pages before. And ditto to the reviewer who commented on the particularly awful scene with Lady Catherine confronting Darcy using the exact same language she had just used with Elizabeth. This showed a truly appalling lack of imagination on the part of the author.If you have a choice between this book and just about anything else--choose just about anything else."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. After reading Pride and Prejudice, I kept wondering more and more about Darcy, what HE was thinking, what HE was doing? Elizabeth was carefully and wonderfully portrayed by Jane Austen. I would have loved for Jane Austen to have gone into Darcy's life more, but she didn't. When I purchased Darcy's Story by Janet Aylmer, I never expected to read it like a Jane Austen novel. I just wanted a story behind Darcy, the way I would think really happened at that time in history. The fact that Janet Aylmer kept the storyline in sync with Pride and Prejudice was wonderful for me. I knew where we were with each chapter. I knew where Elizabeth was, and now I know where Darcy was.Overall, I have to say I really enjoyed reading Darcy's side of Pride and Prejudice through Janet Aylmer's interpretation. I think Jane would have approved!"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"http://tickettoanywhere.blogspot.comAlmost 200 years ago Jane Austen wrote and publilshed Pride & Prejudice, a novel that would stand the test of time, winning the hearts of new fans with each passing generation. For even though the novel was written so long ago its themes and characters have withstood the test of time. I first fell in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy several years ago by chance. Stumbling across the book one day in the bookstore not realizing that it would soon become a most beloved friend. It didn't take long to read Austen's novel and it was a book that I have revisited often over the years. Throughout all my readings I have always wondered about Mr. Darcy. What was he thinking? As well as what happened after the story ended. (Which was much to soon in my humble opinion!).Despite my wanting to know what happened afterwards I have steered away for all the various \\"sequels\\" to the story that people have written over the years. I read some of the reviews and they were always mixed from those that loved them and those that thought they were horrible additions to a beloved story. Therefore I stayed away from them all so that P&P; wouldn't be tarnished for me in any way.That is until this past weekend when a friend of mine recommended a new novel, Darcy's Story by Janet Alymer. This wasn't a sequel but a companion novel told from the point of view of the enigmatic Mr. Darcy. Others have tried to recommend books to me based on P&P; but I never really paid them much attention since there was always a little criticism mixed in with the praise. This friend was different. She admitted that while, at the time, she hadn't read much that she thoroughly enjoyed all that she had. That made me curious and so I bought the book soon afterwards.It was instant love. Alymer uses a lot of the dialogue that Austen herself wrote which adds so much realism to the story for which there has been much criticism. In my opinion, the transcribed dialogue only helps in creating a seamless transition between the original story and the new additions. I don't think that I would have enjoyed this book half as much if she hadn't used the original text. After all, if it ain't broke, why fix it?Alymer captures the essence of Mr. Darcy and all the other characters in the story. One can tell that Alymer is a true fan and took time and care with how the events were laid out. I loved all the added scenes that were only alluded to in Austen's story. They played out as I had pictured them. There has also been criticism about the length of time that Alymer spent on the various scenes between Darcy & Mr. Wickham. However, Austen herself never spent much time on them so why should Alymer do any different. Mr Wickham was only a minor character, the story revolved around Elizabeth and Mr Darcy to dwell on events not involving the two of them only takes away from their story. Reading Darcy's Story brought me back to the time when I first read Pride & Prejudice I loved every moment of it and as with P&P; hated when it was over. So many people have tried over the years to emulate Austen's style with mixed results based on all the reviews that I have read. However I find that Alymer has succeeded in channeling Austen and created a novel that will stand the test of time as a worthy companion novel to the original. I think that Jane Austen would be very proud of what Janet Alymer has done with her characters. In conclusion, I am very thankful to my friend Chris, because without her heartfelt recommendation I never would have picked up this book.http://tickettoanywhere.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"\\"Darcy's Story\\" is one in the ever growing genre of \\"sequels\\" to Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", only they're not written by Jane Austen. This is actually the second of this genre that I've read. A couple of years ago, as part of my now defunct book club, I read \\"Mr. Darcy's Daughters\\" by Elizabeth Aston. I think I liked this one much more because I knew and liked the character of Darcy, but I had not \\"met\\" the daughters.Here we see a new side to Darcy where we learn that he really is an arrogant snob, but for all the right reasons. See, the thing is, he's actually shy and socially inept. Really. I always wanted to know Darcy's side of the story regarding his meeting and tortured courtship of Elizabeth Bennett, and that is exactly the story this book tells.Aylmer tries to write in the style of Jane Austen and does it well enough; she also often uses direct quotes from P & P. What I liked best is that she parallels the timeline in P & P so that we see what Darcy is doing when we don't see him in P & P.Is this great literature? Absolutely not. Could it stand alone without P & P? No way. This book is only for tried and true fans of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - which I am. Otherwise, it's not worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Is this a original story or did the author just take lines from Miss Austen and add a few extra words? Save your money! There are much better Darcy novels out there!"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Despite the opinion of others, I rather enjoyed this book, being such an avid Austen enthusiast. I have often wondered quietly to myself what exactly was going through the mind of our dear Mr. Darcy during this moment, or what he was really thinking when Lizzie said this, that, or the other. Perhaps Miss Aylmer didn't mirror Jane Austen's style of writing completely, but when again, who really could? Jane had a style of her own, and even the best of today's authors couldn't mimic her completely. This book was meant as a light-hearted twist on a story that both Miss Aylmer and her daughter share a bond over. She wrote it for her daughter, as I understand. So despite the repetativeness, the exact copy of Pride and Prejudice passages, and the thinness of the book, I personally enjoyed it and recommend it to others. Others being strict fans of Pride and Prejudice that is."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Despite the skeptics on this book, I had a great time reading it. I read the whole thing in two sittings, which is good for me because I read rather slowly and I have a very short attention span when it comes to reading books. I love Pride and Prejudice and decided to give this one a shot. I'm incredibly pleased. Darcy is great! Just like I imagined him to be in the original. I liked the interesting plot with Lady Catherine, and his trust in Georgiana. Darcy's Story gives Darcy a human heart from page one."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"This was an enjoyable quick read. Looking forward to the next book!"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I bought this book on a whim because I love P&P. However, I think more of the book was verbatim Jane Austin than it was original. There was minimal new characterization of Darcy (although I did get more of a view of his sister). Skip this one--or at least, borrow it."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"I wish I had taken the time to read some reviews of this prior to buying it. I was not expecting a completely plagiarized retelling of Pride and Prejudice, but an alternate viewpoint story. The best of these I can recall reading was Mary Reilly, an alternate viewpoint of Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde. That was a great read that introduced a whole new perspective to the story. Darcy's Story isn't really Darcy's story at all. It is a one-dimensional story where the same scenes from P&P are revisited from Darcy's viewpoint (supposedly), but he experiences these events exactly the way we were shown in P&P and has no new insights or thoughts that were not previously revealed to us. The only person who might be expected to like this book is someone who has never read P&P, because anyone who has will be disgusted with the way that perfect novel has been edited down to half its original length with a couple of new sentences added in that add absolutely nothing to the story. This should never have been published, and the so-called author should feel fortunate she used a pseudonym in writing this. I would be humilated to have my name attached to this book."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"'Pride and Prejudice' has become a beloved classic since Jane Austen originally penned it in 1813. It is critically acclaimed, and millions of people across the globe consider it a timeless and perfect love story. Collin Firth brought Mr. Darcy to life in the 1995 BBC mini-series. And many others have tried as well. Mr. Darcy, always a mystery, was not the spotlight of Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. Austen's novel instead focused on Darcy's love interest, Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Janet Aylmer now gives is us Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy's story.Aylmer, a pen name for an Austen enthusiast, took on a task that will undergo the scrutiny of the literary world. She dares to tell Darcy's side of the romance and gives the world a glimpse into his life. Can her story, about the life of this literary hero, compete with the imaginations of those so familiar with this love story? Now the world has a chance to better sympathize with Darcy's plight. Now we can better understand his obligation to social standing, his apparent snobbery towards the Bennet family and most importantly his change of heart.Honestly this is the kind of book you wait for with trepidation. Can it possibly meet your expectations? Will the image of Darcy you created in you mind, as you filled in the missing gaps, be forever destroyed by one person's interpretation. Well, my hat off to Ms. Aylmer! She did it. She dared to take a chance for Mr. Darcy and his reputation and it paid off.Aylmer created what should be hailed as another classic. Had this book not been written nearly 200 years post 'Pride and Prejudice' then one would think Austen penned this book herself. The flow of the story matches Austen's own styling. The brilliance of intertwining Austen's original conversation helps hold the timeline of 'Pride and Prejudice' together. The language of the time is equally as beautiful and as with Austen's original Aylmer takes you back in time to the sitting rooms and country dances of yesteryear.I have to admit I have fallen in love with Fitzwilliam Darcy all over again. All of the imperfections are still there. He is frustratingly snobbish and yet now I have a better understanding as to why. Thanks to Aylmer we now understand Darcy's decisions. Your heart breaks as he blunders his way through this romance and you hold your breath as you turn the page even through you already know the story's end. While in Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' we are unsure of Darcy's doings when absent from Bennet, the same is equally true about Bennet in Aylmer's story. Now we discover what goes on in Darcy's life when he returns to Pemberley and his life of social obligation.While I am glad that Darcy's side of the story has finally been told, it is a shame that it has taken so long. Can anyone measure up to Firth's performance? I say no! And as such, this book can never make the big screen as I dream. Unmistakably, Darcy's Story is the greatest adaptation of Austen's original Pride and Prejudice. I think Austen would be pleased with Aylmer's story and even Jean Bowden, curator of the Jane Austen House, agreed that \\"[Aylmer] is faithful to Jane Austen's plot and to her characters.\\" Certainly Darcy's Story will find a permanent home on my bookshelf.Coutesy of Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Janet Aylmer had the intriguing idea of retelling Jane Austen's best-loved book from the perspective of its hero. \\"Darcy's Story\\" is \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as seen through the eyes of Fitzwilliam Darcy, the snooty aristocrat who almost loses and finally wins the book's unforgettable heroine, Elizabeth Bennet.It was a good idea, and in more competent hands, it might have made a good book. Unfortunately, Aylmer's \\"retelling\\" of the story involves lifting not just paragraphs, but whole pages of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" verbatim. She adds almost nothing to our perception of Darcy as an individual. The scene between Darcy and Wickham, for instance, when Darcy confronts Wickham over his seduction of Lydia without any intention of marrying her, could have been expanded to give us new insights into both characters; Aylmer dismisses the whole incident in a few banal paragraphs. And Aylmer's abilities as a writer in general leave a lot to be desired; the grammatical errors and punctuation gaffes in this book should have been dealt with by a competent editor before they ever saw the light of day. Austen would be turning somersaults in her grave.Ultimately, \\"Darcy's Story\\" reads like an inferior version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It's poorly written and poorly contrived. Aylmer should have heeded the time-honored dictum before attempting to retell this story: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Darcy's Story by Janet Atlmer is a retelling of the classic Pride and Prejudice story of Jane Austen. None of the actual plot has changed, only that it is now told from the perspective of Mr. Darcy.The story is kept authentic and many of the conversations are exactly as they are in P&P.; A new understanding and compassion for Mr. Darcy is present as you see his internal struggle and the truth behind his actions and motives.This is an alright P&P; retelling. Some new information is addressed, but the majority of the novel is just a dry revisit of the actual story. Those who love P&P;, but are offended by adaptations, what if? variations, and lustful recreations, will find this rendering refreshing and respectful to Austen and her characters. Purists will enjoy this greatly. Those looking for increasing romance and new exciting twists, should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Aylmer reuses dialogue from the original and this is to be expected. However, she reuses dialogue way too often and at times she reuses whole passages or even pages of the original. Especially disappointing is when she reuses dialogue even in new scenes that she creates. For instance, Aylmer ventures to describe the confrontation that occurs between Mr. Darcy and Lady Catherine after she leaves Hertfordshire. That chapter was incredibly disappointing and a complete waste of time to read. Nearly every statement that Lady Catherine made closely follows this format:\\"I told her *exact words from original* and she replied *exact words from the original*.\\"At times dialogue is reused even when she is not recalling what happened and is just addressing Darcy. A lot of examples of the author reusing Austen's words even when creating new material that did not explicitly occur or was not elaborated on in Pride and Prejudice can be found throughout the book. It's just very lazy writing.And all of Aylmer's original dialogue and writing create an awkward juxtaposition with Austen's. Aylmer's style of writing is just too simplistic. Most of the new dialogue is absolutely unbelievable and uncharacteristic.Overall, this book is not worth buying. All of the new scenes and events are poorly written and Aylmer fails to use Darcy's viewpoint to bring about any meaningful or interesting insight into the characters or the original story.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Writers who attempt to elaborate on Jane Austen's themes in modern times sometimes create silly, overblown tales which lack Jane's dignity (*The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy* by Elizabeth Aston; *Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife* by Linda Berdoll). But who knew that it was possible to err in the other direction - by taking Jane's plot and characters and draining them of life and humor while turning them inside out!? (Uh-oh, draining them? sounds a little like....zombies! I'm not going there....)In notes at the back of the book, Ms. Aylmer admits that she originally wrote this book for her daughter, just to give an idea of Darcy's side of the events in *Pride and Prejudice*. I might've thought any of us could imagine his side for ourselves. Anyway, Darcy comes off even more dull and robotlike in this book than he does in P&P.; Aylmer's (somewhat laudable) efforts to be absolutely and completely true to the events (and even the words) of the original result in something that reads a little like a legal document.Since we read Jane for her ability to portray passion and emotion lived and written about in the restrained style of an earlier time (at least I do), this book is too mechanistic to please any but the most compulsive of Austen fans."},{"Title":"Darcy's Story","review":"Nice idea, to retell from Darcy's point of view, but this book really didn't add much to what the original text describes.

Because writer tries to remain SO true to original, there's little discovery as the events unfold.Much of the dialogue is lifted from Ms Auten's work, as one would expect.

I have read many rewritings/sequels/other points of view for this novel and even the terrible ones had some new idea to put out, and this had NOTHING. I give the book two stars because it isn't really \\"bad\\", it's just boring. If you haven't reread P and P in a while, it may be less painful, but I found myself skipping ahead through passages I had read a few days previously, while re reading Pride and Prejudice.Thank goodness I got it from the library and didn'tpay for this drivel, I wouldn't want to encourage this author, especially after reading the essay the author writes for the back of the book.

It's repetitive - passages from Pride and Prejudice and from earlier in the book get needlessly repeated over and over. It's a safe bet that anyone reading this book has read Pride and Prejudice - there's no need for Elizabeth and Darcy's interactions to be essentially cut and pasted rather than retold. It really goes from bad to worse: from the boring title to the stilted dialogue to the truly atrocious exposition - Darcy practically goes through the Darcy family tree and explains everyone's connections and relationships to his cousin, Fitzwilliam, who knows those things as well as Darcy does! For all that the (awful) title proclaims that it's Darcy's side of the events of Pride and Prejudice, the book adds absolutely nothing to the experience.If you absolutely must read it, don't waste your money on it - borrow it from the library.

I did enjoy learning more about Darcy's sister, Georgiana, and her time with Wickham, but there wasn't much more to pique my interest.

At times, less than once sentence per page was written in the author's own voice. WHICH, I might add was not entertaining in the least. The author explained things very obvious and left nothing to the imagination. He was angry. He thought about her all night long. BLAH! Boring!!!! I can't tell you how much I hated this book.

The question that arises with a book such as this is the inevitable: why? I do not know the reason. The best part of this book is that is lacks the presumption to ruin the canon. The worst part is it lacks the courage to ruin the canon. In other words, the book--though not an assault on the senses of a Janeite--provides nothing for the Janeite. There is nothing here of significance that is not in Pride and Prejudice. Of course, it cannot be expected that anyone would be able to have the wit and irony of Jane's magnificent prose, but it is more than that. While the book tries, by it's very nature it lacks the power of the enigma that is Darcy's character. This is not a bad book; but it is a pale shadow compared to the delight and magnificence that is Pride and Prejudice. I'd rather just reread that for the tenth time.

The narrative is plodding and somewhat repetitive, and neither particularly pleasant nor unpleasant to read. Its greatest virtue may be its brevity--it is readable in a single sitting.My major objection to this book is the shoddy copyediting. Elizabeth is alternately referred to as Miss Elizabeth and Miss Bennet (in her elder sister's presence,) and other characters are sometimes referred to by the wrong name/title.

You'll be amazed at how much you DON'T know about your body, the environment and how we are killing ourselves until you read these books. Trust me, I am only a consumer here, but I pass these books on to everyone I care about and have for years! I'm going to post this to all the books I have read by Sherry. I just can't say enough about this woman. She literally saved my life (allergies, life and health threatening mineral and vitamin deficiencies) and my husband's too (bladder cancer). Love, Susan Manchester"},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"This book, which I dearly wish was not back ordered, is an excellent look at our polluted environment and how that pollution is effecting our health. It also helps the reader find ways to overcome the toxic pollutants in our environment, to lessen their effect on our bodies."},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"This book was a mind opener. Even though I wasn't seriously ill and have already read a lot on health maintenance, I still found crucial information, including a practice that helped me reduce muscle aches. The practice has become part of my Sunday beauty routine. The book is a bit repetitive and is written in a slapdash fashion (which actually helps authenticate the author in a way) but the information itself was valuable enough that I bought another of her books later on."},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"My husband and I have read, used , enjoyed, and shared the knowledge we have gained from this excellent book. Ms. Rogers, with her usual integrity, has done a fine job of researching and bringing to the public much needed information."},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"For anyone dealing with a serious illness, or that wants to avoid a serious illness, the books by Dr Sherry Rogers are absolutely essential reading.Her books explain in a very easy to understand manner how to deal with the causes of disease using cutting edge medical knowledge, technology and testing, and not just how to mask symptoms with drugs and other superficial treatments (which lead to worsening problems in other areas of health).As Dr Sherry Rogers writes in \`Detoxify or Die',\`I have to laugh when people ask me if I do alternative, herbal, acupuncture or holistic medicine. 'No,' I reply. 'We do state-of-the-art medicine. In other words, we find the biochemical, nutritional and environmental causes and cures rather than blindly drugging everything. Sure, herbs are gentler, safer and more physiologic than drugs and holistic medicine attempts to incorporate many diverse modalities, etc. But there is no substitute for finding the underlying biochemical causes and cures. This is real medicine. This is where medicine should and would have been decades ago, if it had not been abducted by the pharmaceutical industry.'The question is not whether you should read a book by Dr Rogers, but WHICH book of hers you should start with! Choosing which books to start with can be difficult and a bit overwhelming, as there are quite a few. My opinion, is as follows:1. For healthy people that want to stay well, healthy older people who want to avoid degenerative diseases as they get older, or parents who want to keep themselves and their kids well, then the book you need is \`Detoxify or Die.' This one book will probably contain everything you need to know as prevention is so much easier than cure!After reading this book and acting on the advice it gives, you may then like to subscribe to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter, to stay up to date with new developments - if your budget allows for this.2. For those dealing with serious illness, you need both \`Detoxify or Die' and \`No More Heartburn: Stop the Pain in 30 Days-Naturally! : The Safe, Effective Way to Prevent and Heal Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.' Almost all serious illness involve poor gut health and so poor food and nutrient absorption and one cannot improve with these diseases until the gut issues are dealt with.As Dr Sherry Rogers explains, \`The road to good health is paved with good intestines!'It is very important that you heal you gut problems as much as possible, and treat any serious nutrient deficiencies before beginning any type of detoxification program as these types of programs use up a lot of nutrients and place additional stress on the body. Once you've worked on healing your gut, and your nutrient deficiencies, you can then move onto the information in \`Detoxify or Die.'These books will be helpful no matter what disease label you have, or even if you don't yet have a correct diagnosis. They explain how to heal the body, and how to identify via testing the individual factors that affect your health and so they do not provide disease specific information, generally speaking. (With some exceptions.) This is very good news for those that don't have a correct diagnosis, or that have a disease where very little or no specific research into your disease and how to treat it is taking place.There are 3 basic principles of this type of medicine:A. Get the good stuff in. Give your body the fuel and tools it needs to work at an optimum level. Good food, nutrients and all the proper vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Make sure you aren't deficient in any of the major nutrients as the different nutrients all work together.B. Get the bad stuff out. Make sure your body can detoxify out all the toxic substances and toxic by-products of bodily processes properly. Stop as many toxins from getting in in the first place, and do a detoxification program to get rid of the ones you have. Stop doing or eating the things which cause inflammation and have a pro-oxidant effect, and so on.C. Reduce your body's total load. The total load concept is that lessening the body's overall burden/work and stress level in one area, will improve health generally and improve the body's ability to heal because the body's total load (or burden) is lessened. Fixing one problem frees up bodily resources that can be then be used to help other parts of the body function getter or to heal. In other words, you need to look at the body as a whole in order to heal, and not just the one part of the body that is generating the most symptoms.Dr Sherry Rogers explains that with treating the causes of disease, 'A life sentence to medications that block physiologic pathways is avoided.' She continues,\`Bear in mind that since medications do not fix anything, they allow the underlying problem to continue uncorrected and actually accelerate. Meanwhile, new symptoms and new seemingly unrelated diseases are the inevitable consequence of this biochemical faux pas. Furthermore, drug side effects are the leading cause of death. NSAIDs as an example of only one group of medications, are fatally toxic to thousands of people each year by damaging joints, lungs, kidneys, eyes, hearts, and intestines. And they are covered by insurance.You and your doctor have been screwed into believing every symptom is a deficiency of some drug or surgery. You've been led to believe you have no control, when in truth you're the one who must take control. Unfortunately, the modus operandi in medicine is to find a drug to turn off the damaged part that is producing symptoms. A simple example is the prescription of calcium channel blockers, the number one drug used by cardiologists for angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia. But as with any drug, this does not fix anything that is broken. It merely poisons normal physiological pathways, thereby forcing the chemistry in a direction that attenuates symptoms.Since nothing has been done in terms of getting rid of the underlying cause, the disease continues. In addition the missing fatty acids and minerals in the cell membranes that house and calcium channels are not identified and repaired. Nor are the sequestered membrane chemicals that caused the damage, like unavoidable PCBs and Mercury, gotten rid of. If this were not enough perpetuation and acceleration of damage, the side effects of drugs are not innocuous. For example, calcium channel blockers have been shown by MRI to cause definitive shrinkage of the brain and loss of brain function, a side effect rarely mentioned by clinicians or news media.It should not come as a shock that this type of information is ignored, since studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association document how the practice guidelines for American medicine are made by physicians who receive compensation from the drug industry. (Choudhry, JAMA 2002; 287: 612-617). In addition so is the FDA, the very government regulatory body that approves drugs, riddled with advisers with financial ties to (and is heavily lobbied by) the very drug industry that is seeking its approval. And as the New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American Medical Association warm, even the hired clinical investigators for new drugs may have their price. 'If after following the advice in \`Detoxify or Die' (and using your FIR sauna daily or every second day etc.) for a year or two, your progress stalls, then you need to follow a more intensive plan. The book \`The High Blood Pressure Hoax' is the Part 2 to \`Detoxify or Die' and shows you where to go from there to start making progress again with healing. Part 3 is called \`The Cholesterol Hoax' and again this book is recommended only if after following the advice in Part 2, your progress stalls.After reading a couple of Dr Rogers' books, you may also then like to subscribe to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter, to stay up to date with new developments - if your budget allows for this.3. Doctors are recommended to read \`Detoxify or Die.' The book \`Is Your Cardiologist Killing You?' is also recommended if they commonly prescribe statins, beta blockers, Coumadin and other cardiac drugs.-----Information on each of Dr Sherry Rogers' books:1. Detoxify or Die (2002) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is excellent. It is also very easy to read and understand. It talks about the importance of treating the causes of disease and the most important chemicals to avoid in food and in cleaning and personal care products, the impact of each of the major chemical types on the body, tests which can be used to determine your toxic load (as well as your nutrients levels and how well your detoxification pathways are functioning etc.), the problems with many common prescribed drugs, the benefits of a daily detox cocktail, the benefits of juicing and enemas, the benefits and safety of regular FIR sauna use, how to use the sauna safely and what to expect when doing a sauna program, and so much more. There is also a great little summary of the parts of the book on FIR saunas that is available as a free PDF online which is exceptionally good. (Google the relevant terms to find it.)2. No More Heartburn: Stop the Pain in 30 Days--Naturally! : The Safe, Effective Way to Prevent and Heal Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders (2000) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is excellent (even if the title is NOT!). It is also very easy to read and understand. It talks about the importance of treating the causes of disease and why healing the gut is an essential first part of any healing program - whether you feel like you have any gut issues or not. It discusses food allergies and intolerances, low stomach acid, dysbiosis, the problems with many prescription and over the counter medications (such as NSAIDs, aspirin and ibuprofen) on gut health, rotation diets, Candida, enemas, and leaky gut syndrome and the tests which can be used to determine which gut issues you have.It also discusses the importance of detoxification enemas and other detoxification regimes and the all-important concept of the \`total load.'3. Pain Free in 6 Weeks (2001) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book may be useful if you are generally in good health, but suffer with chronic pain. If chronic pain is part of a serious disease complex then you'll be treating the pain along with all of your other symptoms by following the advice given in the books on gut health and detoxification and so this book probably wont be necessary. Several supplements which can help with chronic pain are discussed in this book as well as a nightshade-free diet, improving gut health and lowering your toxic load and detoxification enemas for pain relief.4. Wellness Against All Odds (1994) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.In most of Dr Rogers' books the only diet recommended is the macrobiotic diet, although every now and again there were also comments about how not every diet works for everyone and that some people may not do well on the macrobiotic diet and should read \`Wellness Against All Odds' for more information about other diets. This book explains that while the macrobiotic diet suits a large percentage of ill people, some of us need far more protein and fat in our diets and do much better when our food is cooked rather than raw. Dr Rogers explains that some of us may need a raw food macro diet to heal, and others a cooked diet with lots of animal protein and fat or something between these two extremes, and that as we heal we'll all likely move more into the middle and eat some raw food, some cooked food and a balance of plant and animal foods. What is most important is eating whole foods and making sure to find the diet that works best for us at this point in time.As well as discussing different diets, this book also contains excellent information on enemas, detoxifying salt baths, the liver and gallbladder flush, the castor oil and olive oil body rub and the use of systemic enzymes to treat cancer and other diseases. It's an interesting read and probably essential extra reading if you have cancer.5. The High Blood Pressure Hoax (2008) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.Part 2 to \`Detoxify or Die.' Also contains useful information on how to treat and how not to treat high blood pressure.6. The Cholesterol Hoax (2008) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.Part 3 to \`Detoxify or Die.' Also contains useful information on why the \`cholesterol hypothesis' is dead and why statin drugs are hazardous to your health.7. Is Your Cardiologist Killing You? by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone taking statin drugs, daily aspirin, Coumadin, NSAIDs, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers etc. The information given on these drugs and the problems they cause was frightening.Overall, this book is very easy to read and well organised and very clear in its message and with its references. If you're taking some of the above drugs, this book really is essential. It not only warns you of the dangers of these drugs but tell you how to safely get off them. (Very gradually!) If you aren't taking any of these drugs, you are much better off with 'Detoxify or Die' instead as it contains much more detailed treatment information for those of us with heart problems.This book is highly recommended for any doctor that commonly prescribes the above drugs as well.7. Depression: Cured At Last? by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This (very long) book is kind of an early version of \`Detoxify or Die' although it does contain a small amount of material that isn't in any of the other books. While I took 8 pages of handwritten notes from \`DOD' I still managed to write 2 pages of notes on the new information in this book that was of interest. Most of it was information about the specific role of each vitamin and mineral. This book looks at how nutrient deficiencies and toxic overload are the root causes of disease, using depression as an example. It makes a strong case for the use of environmental medicine in treating all disease, including mental illnesses. This book is an interesting read if you're able to get a copy, and read such a large amount of text. It is probably essential reading if you have depression, anxiety or disorders such as schizophrenia or OCD and so on.8. Chemical Sensitivity (1998), The EI Syndrome Revised (1995) and Tired or Toxic? A Blueprint for Health (1990) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.So far I have chosen not to buy these books as a) They are older compared to \`Detoxify or Die' b) I have read a huge amount about chemical sensitivity and its associated problems already and c) The book \`Detoxify or Die' seems to be an updated version of all of these books, to a large extent. They are recommended reading if you are very new to the subject of chemical sensitivities and would like to know more about this problem and what symptoms it causes and so on.9. The Scientific Basis for Selected Environmental Medicine Techniques (1994) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is designed to be given to doctors and perhaps also insurance companies. It contains summarised information about the basic principles of environmental medicine, along with lots of reference lists. Unfortunately, as this book is now almost 20 years old, most doctors would probably see it as outdated and you may be far better off using books such as \`Detoxify or Die' to try and get relevant information to doctors and other professionals. This book is not necessary for patients to buy for themselves and it doesn't contain any information that isn't given in far more detail in \`Detoxify or Die.'10. Macro Mellow : Recipes for Macrobiotic Cooking (1993) by Shirley Gallinger and Sherry A. RogersThis is one of three books on macrobiotic cooking by Dr Rogers. I need to eat in a way quite opposite to the macrobiotic diet and so I haven't bought any of these books. These books are highly recommended if the macrobiotic diet works for you however.-----General comments on Dr Rogers' books:1. There is a bit of repetition in some of the books, as some reviewers have noted. But overall it isn't a big problem and it does help you remember all the major points she is making.2. There are some typographical errors in some of the books, but please don't let that put you off. These books aren't produced for massive profits and are written by someone who never planned to be an author, isn't in it for the money and doesn't advertise her books, instead relying on word of mouth sales. There may be a few typographical errors and some books may have somewhat of a \`homemade' feel to them in parts, but the information in the books and their references are spot on and that is what is important. The books are very well written and extremely well referenced.3. The books almost always give recommendations for actual brand name products, as Dr Rogers notes that the quality of supplements varies widely and she only feels comfortable recommending trusted brands and long-term tested products. This is helpful as it gives you a starting point in your research of which products to buy, whether you end up buying those exact brands or not. Note that Dr Rogers has no financial ties with ANY of these companies.4. All of the recommendations in the books can seem overwhelming, but all you need to do is start small. Do one small thing at a time and make gradual changes. The worst thing you could do, especially if you are very ill, is jump into taking and doing lots of different things all at once anyway.(Actually, the need to start some supplements very slow is something I feel Dr Rogers could have given more attention to. Some of us would get (even more) extremely ill taking the amounts of reduced alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, reduced GSH and garlic etc. she recommends if we didn't raise the doses very gradually over 1 - 3 months or more. Perhaps this is just an issue for people like me who have M.E., that almost all have to be especially slow in introducing new supplements of this kind, but perhaps it relates to at least a small group other patients as well, which is why I am mentioning it. I can now take her recommended daily detox cocktail with no problems at all, but the first time I took 5 g of vitamin C, and even 100 mg of ALA daily, it really knocked me around. It was awful and very severe.)5. Dr Rogers books are to some extent \`do-it-yourself' health books but ideally Dr Rogers recommends that you get well with the help of a qualified practitioner that will be able to order the appropriate tests for you, and also help you interpret them.6. One extra thing I feel I have to mention in relation to Dr Rogers' books is the amount of religious material some of them contain. In books such as the one on gut health and \`Detoxify or Die' it is fairly minimal, but in books such as \`Depression: Cured At last?' and \`Wellness Against All Odds; and others it is quite extreme. Topics are mentioned such as the need for prayer in schools, what a terrible idea it is to teach kids about homosexuality and condoms at a young age, evolution is mocked as unscientific and the theory of intelligent design and creationism is discussed, evidence is given for biblical events/artifacts such as the Ark and the moral decay caused by more people rejecting religion. The push for readers to embrace religion and Christianity is very full-on and a very hard-sell.I really hope that readers that have big problems with this type of information, or just with its appearing in a scientific textbook, will be able to take the mountain of very good information on health in these books and perhaps just skip over the religious parts (which are generally focused on one chapter towards the end of the book) and agree to disagree with the author on this topic. It would be such a loss for anyone to miss out on these books because of the religious content, I hope nobody does. It is also important that you know these books have this content if you are going to give them to others, so that you can also mention it to them beforehand, this avoiding or minimising any upset on their behalf as well (or a very unfortunate blanket rejection of all the health information in them).7. You will often be referred to other books while you're reading one of Dr Rogers' books. I think I actually would really rather pay more and have the one BIG book (or set of 3 books) with everything in it and all up to date, rather than keep being referred to other books when reading. I'm ill and get easily overwhelmed, as I know many others do too. I'd rather not buy an extra whole book just for a few pages of relevant information in it too, but I realise the one big book idea may be too difficult to do for a whole host of reasons. (Sorry Dr Rogers, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, I'm a big fan. This is just a suggestion.)8. In addition to books by Dr Sherry Rogers I'd also recommend books by Dr Lawrence Wilson (and his website), Dr Abram Hoffer, Andrew Saul, Sally Fallon and Mary Enig (most especially \`Eat Fat, Lose Fat' and \`Know Your Fats) and any and all of the vitamin C experts such as Linus Pauling and Dr Thomas Levy. Other excellent books include \`Good Calories, Bad Calories' and \`Deep Nutrition' as well as books on the SCD eating plan and the GAPS diet for the treatment of dysbiosis and a diet-based plan to heal the gut.That's it!BTW I'm writing all this as someone that subscribes to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter and owns most of her books, and that is slowly improving month by month from a very severe neurological disease - thanks in part to the work of Dr Rogers, and others like her - that has left me housebound and almost entirely bedbound for many years. I wish so much I had had this information early on in my disease, rather than coming to it more than 10 years in. Healing is so much easier the earlier you start it.Best wishes for future health to anyone still reading this far! And a big thank you to Dr Sherry Rogers for sharing all this valuable information!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E."},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"Wellness Against all Odds came to me through reviews and readings of other books by this author. I agree with the reviews here; it offers much clarity and common sense about nutrition and medical conditions and for this reason I would recommend it heartily. However, Sherry lost me when she added the final chapter which included personal comments that were out of place in this otherwise wonderful book of reason. I did not need to hear her interpretation of religion and societal ills which she seems to think are due in part to the separation of church and state. Such views left a bad taste in my mouth by the time I finished the book, and were harder to ignore than the many typos in this book."},{"Title":"Wellness Against All Odds","review":"The subject is hard to follow because the book is so disorganized.

Thank you. wildwolf777@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book was a disappointment. Miranda Cheever fell in love with Nigel \\"Turner\\" Bevelstoke, Viscount Turner at the tender age of 10. On that fateful day, he encouraged her to write a journal so that she could mark how she \\"grew into herself.\\" Nine or ten years later, Miranda is a debutante on the Marriage Mart and is still waiting to grow into herself. She has continued her childish love in Turner, a man decidedly *not* grieving the death of his unfaithful wife. Miranda is thrilled yet confused when the now tortured and bitter Turner begins to pay attention to her.A major problem with this novel is that the main characters are not very sympathetic. Miranda has spent most of her life watching other people live theirs, (including Turner's sister, her vivacious - and much more interesting, IMHO - friend Olivia). Despite the encouragement to keep a journal, Miranda is not a very good journalist. Instead, Miranda writes such scintillating entries as \\"Breakfast: toast, half a muffin, jam. Lunch: ham, apples. Dinner: roast beef, potatoes, dumpling tart.\\" The journal entries are an unnecessary addition to the story and do not move it forward. This is a special disappointment since Julia Quinn is best known for her Lady Whistledown chapter headings that piqued and amused in her Bridgerton series. That the entries do not provide any insight into Miranda's character is telling, I think - Miranda doesn't really have much character to reveal. She's... well, she's boring. She is a Penelope-shadow, forever pining and waiting for her Odysseus.Turner is one of the most unlikeable heroes I've encountered. The reader can see that he once was a pleasant enough person and I understand why Miranda first fell in love with him. But he acts like a cad during their \\"courtship.\\" Actions are taken at one point that demand a gentleman of the time make an immediate offer of marriage and in short time. Turner, however, grudgingly offers marriage, and then disappears for *six weeks.* After marrying her, Turner's inability to commit comes across as mean-spirited and petty rather than a tortured hero trying to overcome the hurt of a previous relationship. That Miranda accepts his behavior with little squabble shows her apparent congenital lack of a spine.Definitely not one of Quinn's best efforts. I heartily recommend any of her previous novels, especially the Bridgerton series pre-Lady Whistledown reveal, but I think this will be the first Quinn novel that I will not keep on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book is one of my favorites by Julia Quinn. To me, it shares the honor with The Duke & I and Romancing Mister Bridgerton. It is going immediately on my All-Time-Favorites shelf.The early interactions between a ten year old Miranda and a nineteen year old Turner - they made me melt. The innocence they both possessed, the effect Turner had on Miranda even then, it really set the foundation for the whole story.Usually I tend to favor the hero for my favorite, and I truly adore Turner - despite his faults and hangups - but Miranda was such a presence. I felt everything she felt. Believe me. I don't think I've cried so much throughout an entire book as I did with this one. Tears of sadness, tears of happiness... Tears for all the emotions the characters had.I think Julia Quinn's greatest strength is in the depth she gives her characters. The way she makes you invest in them. You grow to truly care for their outcome. She did a magnificent job with Miranda and Turner.I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the diary aspects of the novel, but I really shouldn't have feared. Her talent with the Lady Whistledown parts of the earlier Bridgerton books translated well to the diary entries. They were a sweet addition.I loved this book. I loved Miranda and Turner. I stayed up till nearly 3am reading it - and went to bed with only 60 or so pages left. My eyes were drooping and I really didn't want to not give the end my full attention. Such a wonderful love story. It will make you swoon, it will melt you, and it will make you weep - make you frustrated and distressed. And in the end you will want to hug the book, since you can't hug the characters.("},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is a Regency romance set in England in the 1810's...Miranda Cheever is only ten years old in 1810, when she falls in love with her best friend's older brother. The years are not good to Viscount Turner. He falls deeply in love and marries a woman who is not kind to him (to say the least). By the time Miranda is old enough to try to engage his affections and romantic interest, Turner is an angry and embittered widower. It takes everything Miranda has to redeem Turner, and not only capture him, but to eventually turn him into a thoughtful mate.While I have enjoyed many of Julia Quinn's books, I am not so sure about this one. Turner was a little too bitter and nasty for me to even understand why a woman would want him, even if she has had a crush on him for years. I also did not find his redemption completely believable. I think she made him into too much of a jerk...in a romance you have to root for the hero and heroine to get together, and in this book, I was hoping Miranda would find a nice man (any nice man) to hook up with other than Turner."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Julia Quinn's next book was supposed to be \\"The Two Dukes of Wyndham,\\" but, as the author herself reported on her website, she found it impossible to write one duke's story without writing the other's simultaneously. But I guess she had a contractual obligation to deliver a book for June 2007, and this is the very, very disappointing result.The hero is thoroughly unlikeable, the heroine only slightly less so. The hackneyed \\"I had my heart broken and will never love again\\" conflict is tritely handled. And Quinn's usually sparkling repartee sometimes devolves into the heroine pounding her little fists against the hero's broad chest--please, Julia, you can do better than this!Save your money and re-read \\"When He Was Wicked.\\""},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'd been holding back from ordering this book because of its dismal ratings and reviews. Well, I finally broke down and bought it. I love Julia Quinn, sometimes better than others, but I read them all anyway. They are like comfort food. She is a good writer, always makes me chuckle, and her stories move quickly, a perfect escape. Well, well, big surprise! I LOVED this book. Miranda was a very intriguing and strong character, but of course a very inexperienced one, hence her confusing responses. Of course she was not upset when she lost her baby! She was twenty-years-old, the guy had disappeared. Why in the world would she have wanted to be pregnant? And he was such a male, never knowing what his own feelings were, and he was either angry, cynical or ready to have sex. I have known many, many men in my many, many years on this earth.

I will go back to it often."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I have to say this book was ok. It was not bad, but neither was it great!

The end was endearing but as a whole it lacked something BIG to make it Great."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"but I felt it could have been a little better. I, oddly enough, loved \\"On the Way To the Wedding but couldn't get into this one. While some of the banter was laugh out loud funny others were repetitive.

I kept thinking I've read over that part where the attraction on his part began.Another thing that go tedious was Miranda's declaration (in her mind) that it was LOVE she felt for Turner...I felt like her feelings were shoved down our throats. We got it!The bright spot was Olivia...she was entertaining and is begging for her own story."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever has everything that Ms. Quinn's fans usually adore about her. It's witty, clever, and funny. The writing is perfectly on par with her usual style that I've always loved. Though, I still did not like this book very much. Scratch that, what I should say, is that I didn't like her characters very much, because the plot isn't a bad one. It completely took me back to my first crush. However, I really didn't care for Miranda, or Turner for that matter. Miranda is very insecure and she's so in love with Turner that she let's him get away with anything that he wishes. Finally, FINALLY, when she does stand up for herself, the charade last but a minute because who wouldn't turn to jelly for that smile? Turner *Grrr* Turner is a self absorbed ass. I'm not completely heartless and realize his pain for what Leticia did to him, but he spends most of his time using Miranda as he sees fit to suit his needs. It seems as though he's only interested in her, because she's there, in love with him, and showing him attention.No, The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever was not a good read for me, but the second Bevelstoke, What Happens in London, was and I can't wait to read the third, Ten Things I love About You."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I just got this book from the library yesterday and finished it by the time I went to bed. I liked the book because it was a good story that didn't have all sorts of crazy twists and turns that I sometimes find irritating because it seems like they're just there to prolong the narrative long enough that the author can justify publishing the book based on its length. The story was fairly relatable and had some good humorous parts. The end is a bit weak, but I thought that overall the book was stronger than some of Quinn's last books in the Bridgerton series (where it just seemed like she lost a little steam writing about the 7th and 8th siblings' love stories). Anyway, if you are looking for a fun, light read and don't need all sorts of adventurous distractions then this book will probably fit the bill."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This was my introduction to Julia Quinn. I read it, loved it and immediately went on a search for all of her books. I later read the online reviews of this book and found that I disagreed with many. I found the character of Miranda strong and endearing. I found the romance between the two protagonists believable and sweet. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I so very much wanted to like this book. The characters were okay, likeable but not very memorable, the story was a cute one, BUT there was barely any plot. Yes, we got the message that Miranda was an ugly duckling and felt like one, but repeating that for 300 pages was way more than I could bear.Julia Quinn is a very talented writer who can do better than this."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This was the most wonderful book ever !!! I found myself laughing and stayed up until 4am reading because I just couldn't pull myself away from it !!! It was a borrowed copy, and after reading it I went out and bought one for myself... To read it again !!! Awesome !!!Ohhhh and I bought several more copies and gave them to family and friends!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Observant & average-looking heroine has written in her journal about her unrequited love for her BFF's older brother since she was 10. She is shocked that Hero kissed her even though it was mostly due to his anger with his recently deceased wife. Hero is shocked at his behavior as well, given that he's never looked at heroine other than as a longtime family friend. But hero finds himself becoming more drawn to willing heroine. Their attraction eventually ends up in a consummation but hero leaves the next day but promises to marry heroine esp if she finds herself pregnant. Heroine accepts his proposal, even though she knows he proposed only out of duty. But she wishes he married her for love & her wish becomes more & more evident to both of them during their marriage, placing the pressure on hero to figure out what he's going to do about it.Like the other Quinn books I read recently, this book was not too exciting. Quinn does write well enough to capture my interest & not tempt me to skip pages. But the pace of the story & romance lagged & the intensity of emotions b/w the main characters was missing. Yes, heroine is described as desperately longing for hero for years but it didn't show in her demeanor or behaviors. Heroine was emotionally passive. Hero was more emotionally intense but his obsession & desire was focused on his deceased wife & his strong feelings for heroine were guilt & confusion. I pitied the heroine at 1st & then later I got tired of her doormat behaviors & thought she was pathetic. She was settling for hero's crumbs & hero settled for heroine out of duty & guilt. Not very romantic.Read only if can stand heroine pining for & pursuing reluctant hero."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Good book. Light hearted and warm story of a young womans growing pains. I like historical romance and this was a nice addition to my collection."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book pretty much has it all! Unrequited love, abandonment, small secrets, heart-wrenching moments. It's a wonderful read if you really get into the emotions of the characters!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"The idea here was that life had created what was a happy and loving young man dark and jaded...but he didn't seem that bad. At best he was sort of bland."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I loved this book its so good to me. I fell in love with the people in the book. To me she gave a good point of view for each person and you might be able to understand where they were coming from. The end of the book could have been a little better but i still enjoyed the book. I read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I liked this book because I liked Miranda. Turner, he had his moments, but was mostly a douche (pardon my French). Not quite as funny as some of Quinn's other books, this had a delicious beginning, and was fairly solid throughout. But Turner's still a douche."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I am shocked to find that so many people didn't care for this book. A bit darker than some of Quinn's others, but still thoroughly enjoyable. I do agree that there were a few \\"not so Regency\\" moments or sayings, but I found that it was easy to connect with these characters. Turner, like many males, wasn't able to voice his love for this woman after being foolish and hurt in the past. I mean, what male is able to talk about his feelings, right? Then, Miranda wanted more than just the actions, and it seems more than understandable considering that for half of her life she had such strong feelings for this man. The supporting characters weren't too bad either. I loved Olivia and Miranda's friendship and how loyal they were to each other. Plus, all the parents and grandparents are very kind throughout the story. Unlike some of her other books, the story didn't take any unbelievable twists that wouldn't seem to happen in real life. Overall, I liked the book and it will go on my list of favorites from Julia Quinn."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book is an easy, light read. It's not one of Quinn's best, but she's a fairly competent writer so even her mediocre work is good enough to keep someone occupied on a rainy day.Good:The dialogue is entertaining.Olivia is really fun to read about.The hero is pretty original (Other reviews say that he can be pretty childish and mean, but I'm counting him as a positive because feels very realistic to me. Too often, romance novel heroes have cosmetic \\"flaws\\" that can be easily overlooked. This guy is childish, immature, and petty but he's also genuinely a good person about other things. He might not be the perfect fantasy guy to . . . fantasize about, but he's certainly someone who feels real).No unnecessary, convoluted, big misunderstandings to stretch out the book.BadIt's forgettable. I finished this book about two days ago and it's already fading from memory.It's not interesting enough to re-read.*Spoiler* I don't think the heroine's miscarriage was handled very well.If you have some extra money and you like Julia Quinn, it's probably worth it to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love Julia Quinn books, but this one was not my favorite. Everything about it was mediocre. I didn't find myself liking the main characters as much as I have in her past books."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Although a huge fan of Julia Quinn's, I found that her more recent works, this included, have been rather lacking. A few weeks prior to the release of this book, I got a sneak peek via the 2nd Epilogues she released in e-book format and I found that the first two chapters she enclosed were really promising; I was really anticipating this book. Unfortunately, the chapters that followed could neither uphold the charm nor my interest. Don't get me wrong, I finished the book but there really wasn't anything exemplary about it. I understand the concern that the story concept was very much reminiscent of \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton,\\" but where that book held all of Quinn's trademarks without falling flat, she could not keep this one afloat. She may have focused on making Miranda and Turner's romance into something unlike Penelope and Colin's, perhaps she should have made their path to \\"happily ever after\\" more interesting and less predictable. Turner wasn't exactly endearing, Olivia was a good relief to the monotony, and I was actually hoping that Miranda would closely consider her \\"options\\" (readers will know WHO I'm referring to)."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I loved every minute of this book that I actually finished it in one night. It's full of banter filled with dry humor. The chemistry between Miranda and Turner just sparks. It's refreshing to see Julia Quinn write something other than the Bridgerton family, but I must admit I love the little references to them in this book.Of course the plot is the same as most other romance novels, but I felt such an affinity towards Miranda that I couldn't help but wish that I had a puppy love that actually developed into something more substantial.So I guess if you're just looking to escape reality for a couple of hours and want to read something not to challenging (and love reading cheesy romance novels) then this is something you might be interested in."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Miranda fell in love with Turner when she was child. They are both adults and he is now widow and she is still in love. It is a sweet simple story of love being the answer to a happy life. Miranda and Turner both have to grow up and a nice process. I finished this in a day and it left me all warm in fuzzy."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'm a big Julia Quinn fan, and I felt like this was just as great as her other books. I loved the story. I see that a few reviewers thought that Miranda was too young and immature, but I didn't really feel that way. I thought that she just felt hurt when she didn't think that Turner loved her back. I won't summarize the story as others have already done that, but I will say that if you love Julia, then I think that you should enjoy this book as well. Great job Julia, keep it coming!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Julia Quinn's books and wait for new ones to hit the shelves. This one does not disappoint. The story is fun and the characters make you want to read more about them. A definite hit in my book."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I know it seems a bit lukewarm, but this was not as great as some of the books that preceded this one. And yes, I did laugh, and yes, the last few chapters did make me cry, but I found myself looking more forward to reading Olivia's story (which is hopefully forthcoming!)than in seeing how this one ended. It could have probably been a short story, come to think of it. Oh well, any thing new from Julia is a good thing!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Alas, I have been waiting for this book for nearly a month...ahh JQ's books are great. She still held the humor in most of her books (like the Bridgerton novels and the spin offs). But it was as funny as were the tears dropping from your eyes. If you want a really emotional book, but with a humorous flare, this is a great book.The characters were well developed; along with liking the heroine and the heroe, Olivia is a great supporting character. Always there calling people: cows, goats and a lot more other interesting names. Anyway grab the book if you can...any thing from JQ is worth buying."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I would like to give this book a 2 1/2 but that wasn't an option.It's not that the writing wasn't very good, it was. However, there is absolutely nothing to tie this book into being a Regency other than the extraneous use of Lord this and Earl that.Miranda, the heroine, is very likable and forthright without being annoying or cloying. The hero, Nigel, or Turner (Viscount) is also very interesting and hero-like. Miranda begins a puppy love period at the age of 10 with Turner, her best friend Olivia's elder brother. After a bad marriage and a fortuitous death of his wife, Turner begins to circulate among the living.Miranda is the family hanger-on and available, especially since her puppy love has grown into adoration. One thing leads to another and slowly but surely we come to the inevitable awakening of feelings, passion etc.. and the happy ending.I think this book captures conversations and feelings very well but I certainly missed the Regency flair. Something about horses, balls, dresses, anything!! would have been very welcome. I think that Ms. Quinn should invest a bit more in research and add a little more of the era's 'je ne sais quoi' and her next book would elicit 5 stars from me for sure."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Entertaining and filled with information, this book is fun and inspires a closer inspection of the subject matter."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"IT'S HILARIOUS, WITTY, CHARMING, EMOTIONAL, & EXTREMELY PASSIONATE, A TRUE GEM!! IF JULIA QUINN'S OTHER NOVELS POSSESS THESE OUTSTANDING ATTRIBUTES, UNDOUBTEDLY I WILL BE VERY EAGER TO READING THEM. DESERVES WELL BEYOND A 5 STAR RATING!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'm a really big JQ fan and love regency romance novels. However, there was something missing in this book. I really wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. The pace of the book is off resulting in a disjointed story. The first half moved entirely too slow, then the last half was too quick. Nigel was definitely not a likable character. I understand he was tortured, his ex screwed him over, blah, blah, blah. I actually like tortured \\"heroes\\" in romance novels. But, I've seen Julia handle this w/ more finesse in some of her other books (\\"The Duke and I,\\" \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\"). Also, I know she wasn't supposed to. But, Miranda REALLY got on my nerves. I can't go into details w/ using spoilers.I enjoyed that the book focused on the couple w/o using some subplot to draw them together. However, the couple is so hot and cold, that I found myself wondering how they fell in love. It was just odd. The characters needed more development and particular parts of their love story should have been detailed better (SPOILER: i.e. the wedding, her pregnancy, Etc.). There are some really nice moments in the latter half of the book. However, I still found myself dissatisfied w/ how they came to be together. There was just something missing in this story.It seems to me that JQ has been off kilter since, \\"It's in His Kiss.\\" No, she hasn't put out any \\"bad\\" books. But, she's definitely on par w/ the standard she set in past writings (The Duke & I, An Offer from a Gentleman, and Romancing Mr. Bridgerton). I'll keep supporting her. But, I REALLY hope to see better work in the future. Of course, I'm not limited to the Bridgerton books. So, if you want a great JQ book w/o the Bridgerton clan, read \\"Splendid\\" or \\"How to Marry a Marquis\\" instead of this book."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I also like reading julia quinn books too.I also like books that have connecting characters in them.And i like this book.mags"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I did not enjoy this as much as JQ other stories, but I thought is was a nice read none the less. I find people keep having bad things to say about Miranda, that are not true. She was a much stronger person than people give her credit for. I can understand why she let her feelings be hurt by Turner, but as she matured she became her own person. She didn't wait around for Turner to rescue her, that I really respected. Worth the time to read!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"All I can say is there was a big disconnect between the two characters. The book was entertaining as all of Ms. Quinn's novels---funny to say the least. However, the the interplay was somehow disjointed. Oh well, maybe next time."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I adore Julia Quinn's books... all of them, not just the Bridgerton series. So I was more than a little disappointed when I read this newest addition to her collection. It just didn't have the same bounce, the same levity, nor the same levity that JQ's books usually have. It was a fun read, don't get me wrong, and I'd still recommend it to others... but once you're spoiled with her other books (which I read over and over and over), this one just leaves you wanting. Just my opinion, of course."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"when i spend the money, i want to at least enjoy it...that said, normally I love julia quinn. but, this book was just- boring. i hate to say it- but julia can do much better than this. there were no sparks. i wasn't rooting for anyone. woman in that time sparkled much more by being defiant or different, not spouting political beliefs that sound inane and ridiculous in the context of the book."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I am bored of Julia Quinn. Her stories have no imagination whatsoever. After Penelope and Colin's story, all of her books have become the same old stuff. Just no imagination. She is selling her books only from the name she made in her earlier work. Don't even bother buying her recent books. This is the 4th book that I have gotten from the library and did not finish at all b/c it was just a waste of my time."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"If you love Julia Quinn then you'll love this one. The only bad thing I can think to say is that the ending was a little cheesy. I loved Turner but I really can't wait to get to know more about his brother Winston and Miranda's best friend Olivia. She is sure to have her own story told, I can't wait to read that one. Overall I throughly enjoyed this book I could barely tear myself away from it and devoured it every chance I could get. I wanted it to go on and never end."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Ten-year-old Miranda Cheever fell in love with Nigel Bevelstoke, Viscount Turner, as he walked her home from his twin siblings' birthday party. Turner was stunned by her intelligence. Miranda was blinded by his kind nature. Turner suggested she begin keeping a journal. Thus, Miranda began doing so less than an hour later.The story begins at the funeral of Turner's wife, Leticia. After all the pain and humiliation Leticia had put him through, Turner vows never to let anyone close again. Refusing even to pretend to mourn Leticia, he goes to London only to dance with his young sister, Lady Olivia, and her best friend, Miranda, in order to ensure their success during the Season. He always thought of Miranda as another little sister. After all, Miranda's mother was now deceased and her father had always closeted himself away with his work, leaving Miranda to fend for herself. Miranda had all but moved in to the Bevelstoke residence and grown up there. Though Miranda is not, and never was, a great beauty like Olivia, she is now even more intelligent. Turner is drawn to Miranda's innocence and compassion. Therefore, Turner never seven stopped to really consider what could happen between them.Miranda hates Leticia for the devestation of Turner. Even though Turner is no longer the considerate young man Miranda once knew, she is still in love with him. Miranda is determined to help heal Turner's soul, but at what cost will it take?** NOT the best story by author Julia Quinn, but still good for some afternoon light reading. Haunt a local used book store for this one. In the meantime, turn your attention to ANY of the author's previous releases. Hopefully, the next story will be back up to Julia Quinn's normal standing. And perhaps we will see more of the butler, MacDownes. In my opinion, he was the best character in the tale. **Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This story would have been an acceptable (but unexceptional) contribution to an anthology. If it had been 1/4 to 1/3 as long as it was, it wouldn't have felt so contrived. As it was, its one of those books that is mostly filler. The heroine is 20 but acts about l4. The hero, who wallows endlessly in self pity is, frankly, irritating. The supporting characters are fine, but add nothing. They pretty much enter the scene, say something, flutter about insignificantly, and exit-stage-left, like in a bad high-school play. The premise of the story line is cute, but can't carry a full length book. I couldn't form an attachment for either of the leads and kept wondering if they'd ever grow up. The book, as a whole, lacks character and substance and seems to have been written for melodramatic adolescents. Julia Quinn can and has done better, but she needs to work harder and not take her readers for granted."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This story has perhaps the most awful, horrible, selfish, mean, and cruel hero I've read in a long time. I'd heard such good things about Julia Quinn, so I was eager to read this book, and in the first couple of chapters all was going swimmingly, and then--BOOM. Horrid horrid selfish mean cruel Turner makes his horridness manifest. Apparently Turner's odious character is excusable because he married a Very Bad Woman Who Crushed His Soul Before Conveniently Dying, and he's been struggling to survive ever since. Delightful. That's not a flimsy excuse for cruelty and selfishness AT ALL.Poor Miranda Cheever. She's the heroine of this farce, and I feel so bad for her. She seems very likable and sweet, so it boggles my mind that she continues to love this pathetic excuse for a romance hero after he insults her, humiliates her, bosses her around, and tortures her. Wow, what a wonderful romance! I'm so glad I read this travesty!There are a few good things about this novel: the secondary characters are quite fun, and the dialogue is good when it's not composed of Turner \\"verbally sparring\\" with poor Miranda (read: goading, harassing and bullying her).Other than that, there is nothing good about this book. The only way this book could have been redeemed is if Turner is run over by a curricle on the last page of the book and dies immediately, leaving Miranda to find a man who actually treats her well. Now THAT'S a book I'd enjoy.Summation: if you have a high tolerance for heroes who are not kind-hearted and make the heroine cry, then you probably will not be bothered by this book. If you have a low tolerance, avoid this novel at all costs."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I was so excited when I heard that a new Julia Quinn was coming out that I preordered it. I've always enjoyed her funny, flippant characters that do not follow the plot line of every other romance book... But then I got it. It had very little clever conversation and most of the book was the melodramatic pap written by others with much less skill. It made me wonder if she had a ghost writer. If so, she should fire her. She would have been better waiting until she had the inspiration for a better book. I will be caution when buying her books in the future. Julia, how could you?"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I was excited about this book because I thought it was going to be something from Julia that was different from the Bridgertons. Which Julia hasn't done in a long time. I agree with the other reviews that her last offerings of the Bridgertons were not very good. But the old Julia books I would sit and read in one sitting. I have had this book so a few weeks and I am still having trouble of finish it.The story doesn't ring true and I couldn't help and think that these plot line are very similar to some of her other books. Enough already of the hunting lodge.If you have never read any of Julia's books try some of her old stuff like Minx or To Catch an Heiress."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Yes, I know romance novels are formulaic, but it's the twist the author puts on the formula that makes the difference for me. I've read all of Julia Quinn's books and enjoyed most of them, because she makes them original & entertaining. (To really see what Ms. Quinn is capable of, try Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.)I'm afraid Ms. Quinn just used the Romance writer's checklist for this one: Unattainable hero? Check. Bluestocking heroine adoring from afar? Check. Late-night drunken passion in the study? Check. More passion in the huting cabin during a rainstorm? Check. A near-death that makes the hero come to his sense? Check. Even the love scenes are bland.I'm giving 2 stars because the dialogue, as always, is witty, and Julia Quinn's mediocre is better than most other's best effort. I'm hoping for better next time."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'm a huge Quinn fan and never fail to enjoy her novels in one aspect or another - generally because she has a firm grasp on humor and can make me laugh out loud at least once. Which is why it pains me to say that this is not a shining example of her work.It's not horrid, by any means, and a bad Quinn novel is heads above other authors' best works to be sure. It just doesn't stand up against her other novels. Miranda, our heroine, is rather a brat and as others have mentioned seems very young emotionally. Turner, our hero, is aloof and unlovable and the reader never quite makes the connection with him that's necessary for a great hero.Their relationship seems stiff and somewhat forced at times. True Quinn fans like myself will read this regardless simply as part of her library, but for readers wanting a good introduction to her work I suggest other titles: How To Marry A Marquis or An Offer From a Gentleman are especially noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I normally love Julia Quinn's books, but this one fell flat for me. I could not get into it and considered putting it down several times. I was extremely upset that I bought this one new. My advice is to wait until you see it at the half price store. :("},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I agree with Phillipa. She wrote a very complete review. For Ms. Quinn's fans, only borrow this from the library. Don't bother buying this turkey. It was soooo uneven."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I have enjoyed so many of her earlier books, and I was eagerly waiting for this book to be published. My favorite aspects of her other books are the humorous conversations and likeable characters. Neither was to be found in \\"The Secret Diaries...\\". Turner came across as mean-spirited and a bit useless. Miranda's love for him seemed out of place considering how he acted towards her. Miranda also seemed unable to put a coherent sentence together, and mostly used snarky little one-liners to get back at Turner. The supporting characters also seemed like they had been tossed in to the mix for a bit of humor, but were not people I hoped to see in upcoming books (unlike the Bridgerton books where I actually looked forward to reading each of their installments). Anyway, I am glad this is not the first book of Julia Quinn's I have picked up because I think it would have been my last. I am willing to try new books she puts out in the future, but this one was definitely a major disappointment."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"After checking out the countless other reviews, I was afraid this book was going to go the path of the later Bridgertons, but it did not! I haven't felt so happy and lighthearted while reading a romance novel in a long time. Miranda and Turner are two great main characters; they have likeable and understandable personalities and are just good people. I cared about what happened to them.Quinn's prose reads/flows very well and unlike some of her more recent novels, made me laugh, a lot. The earlier part when Turner was just beginning to realize that he was attracted to Miranda is especially hilarious. Who doesn't love a romance novel that makes them laugh and then not much later makes them hurt for the characters. Another strong point of the novel was the supporting cast of Olivia and Lady Rudland. They too are loving good people (and I'd love to read a story about Olivia).As for the heroine being too young, most historical romances have a heroine who's age is between 18 and 22ish. Since age is not usually a complaint people have, and I thought Miranda was smarter and more mature than many older characters in other books, I don't understand what the big deal was about. Another thing that seems to annoy people is that it took Turner too long to come out of his tortured state. I, however, thought his very gradual departure from it made a lot of sense and aided my liking of him because it made me believe he had actually been hurt by his Leticia, but was a good enough man to want to be happy and try again.I borrowed this book from the library, but I will definitely go out and buy it now because it is one that I want to read over and over again--completly lovable."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'm addicted to historical romance books and this one is by far my favorite. I've gone back and read it multiple times cause I enjoyed the plot so much. Some of the chapters left me in tears it was so good."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"The description:At the age of ten, Miranda Cheever showed no signs of Great Beauty. And even at ten, Miranda learned to accept the expectations society held for her--until the afternoon when Nigel Bevelstoke, the handsome and dashing Viscount Turner, solemnly kissed her hand and promised her that one day she would grow into herself, that one day she would be as beautiful as she already was smart. And even at ten, Miranda knew she would love him forever.But the years that followed were as cruel to Turner as they were kind to Miranda. She is as intriguing as the viscount boldly predicted on that memorable day--while he is a lonely, bitter man, crushed by a devastating loss. But Miranda has never forgotten the truth she set down on paper all those years earlier--and she will not allow the love that is her destiny to slip lightly through her fingers . . .This was only my second Julia Quinn, and she's probably going to go onto the auto buy list. Miranda was fun; I'd like to hang out with her. She wasn't a doormat by any stretch of the imagination, and though I didn't agree with all of her decisions, at least she was the one making them. So many historicals that I've read have dealt with women who just go along with whatever they're told to do and have no decision-making ability of their own. I liked that Miranda knew what she wanted and did her best to get it, including Turner.And Turner was damaged without being a complete jerk. He had his moments (everyone does) but for the most part, he seemed to keep his issues internalized. The biggest one for Miranda is that he can't quite put his finger on how he feels about her. For Miranda, who values words above almost all else, this is torture.There weren't too many side characters outside Turner's siblings. I assume we'll get Olivia's story at some point, which I'm looking forward to. I loved her reaction when she discovered something dastardly Turner had done. She's a genuinely good person, even with all her apparent flightiness, and I'm looking forward to reading her book.flag"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Amazing story.

Then one day I was talking to a friend and I quoted it. I did not even realized it at the time. As I was going to bed I realized where the quote came from and realized how much I loved it. This book is my second favorite book (Pride and Prejudiced is the first). I am so glad that this book came into my life."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love, love, loved, this book! Made me cry and smile. Kept me coming back to Julia Quinn for more."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I like books about childhood friends falling in love later in life. I don't like books quite so much when there's a 9 year age difference so only one of them was a child at the time and said child never considers another, even when the older member of the pair marries someone else. That's a bit obsessive and desperate, no matter how charming either one of them is supposed to be.What we have here is a handsome 19-year-old young man who behaved nicely to an unhappy 10-year-old girl, and the girl just never let it go. So the guy gets married (to a cheating slut apparently lacking in any redeeming qualities, of course; God forbid anyone like their first spouses in romance novels ::insert eye rolling here::) who is conveniently dead by the time our book really gets going, and his temperament is ruined so he's horrible and selfish and has a low opinion of women (he's tortured and it's all that nasty cheating slut's fault, oh boohoohoo), and the girl grows up firm in her belief that they are destined and consequently behaves like his doormat.They both just strike me as very immature and naive, and the way they reacted to situations later in the book seemed frankly bizarre and inappropriate. There's only so much I can suspend my disbelief. The writing itself was enjoyable enough, but the characters are very lacking."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Though I've read this 'series' backwards (Ten Things I Love About You 1st, What Happens in London 2nd and now Secret Diaries) - it didn't interrupt the enjoyment factor of these stories. Each of these novels contain such delightfully likable characters and journeys. It's delightful to find an author that I can count on to provide reliably enjoyable books.Thanks Julia!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I enjoyed this book, and I read it in two sittings. Yes, the hot n cold emotions of the guy are very much overdone in today's books and movies. However...it is very real and very well explained. I found the realness of the character's emotions to be very compelling. The thoughts that the herione has are hilarious and enjoyable. I found myself lost in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has way too much on their minds that just wants a pleasant distraction. :)"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Julia Quinn knows all the ways to get me caring about her characters. The protagonists are never one dimensional even if some side characters appear to be. She knows how to make me care about the feelings of our heroine when at the same time I understand our hero's actions even if I cannot approve.There is a bit of the \\"soap-opera\\" about this novel, overly dramatic at times but I can still forgive the dramatics because the romance is so delicious.This is perhaps not my favorite Quinn romance but I certainly liked it and recommend it.This book is also introducing characters that will appear in the next book in this series (the Bevelstoke Series). Each book is stand alone but it is nice to know the various family members."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"After reading other historical romance novals just to get my fix for a year, it was refreshing to sit down and read a new book by Julia Quinn.I got it yesterday at around 5pm. Tried reading it at my bf's house but thats impossible. but when I got home at around 10pm I didn't put it down until around 530am. Thats what I love about her novals. They are so captivating that you never want it to end. I was Dissapointed when it did end cuz I know I have to wait until next July to get my New Julia Quinn Noval.I started a new book today just a few minutes ago but I put it down cuz it wasn't Julia. I am seriously tempted to rereading all her books all though it won't last me a year. When I first started reading her books 4 years ago it only took me three months to read them all and that was more then 5 books. Her books are addicting.I'm sorry I havn't said my review on this book yet lol. here goes. LOVED IT!!! Like I said before I could not put it down. I fell inlove with Turner and understand fully why the whole Nigel name thing was brought into it. When she was 10 she was the only one who new to call him that. It was their secret. That was special to her. It had a meaning in the book.I'm so glad her character acted her age. Girls her age act that way and it was refreshing to have someone not to young for their age or act to mature for their age....that gets boring.There were some parts that could have been left out. I was reading it and thinking about if it was made into a movie and what the producers would cut out. The whole bookstore thing could have been lived without as it lead to where he gets the book for her when he gets back from london after they are married. You would think her seeing that would make her forget she was mad but the later you found out she moved outta his room anyways so the whole point was moot. There was also the miscarriage which I didn't truly believe had actually happend until after the wedding because there were no histarics about it. You would think that she would be weeping in bed not shopping and then see sadness in Turner as he was so worried when he found out she was pregnant.Also I was disappointed that we didn't get to go throught her pregnancy with her. It did fast forward rather quickly with her second pregnancy. Almost as if it were the starting of an Epilogue yet there was none.This disappointments did not make me think any less of Julia Quinn. I think she is a remarkable writter and as i said i couldn't put the book down so it still diserves 5 stars....buy it trust me its a great read. Until next time Julia.-Jamace"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read julia quinn work.

It is a delightful romance which I could not put down. It is a testament to those who have known from the very first that they have found their one true love."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I have always gone right out and bought Julia Quinns novels, and really enjoyed them. The first few books in the Bridgerton novels were keepers (The Viscount Who Loved Me, and The Duke and I) , but the last few were missing the humor and characters that you really cheer for. The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever is the same. Enjoyable, but not like some of her other novels. I am glad I have read the books, but it might not be reread and enjoyed as much as some of her other books."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Several other reviewers didn't care for it because it had a slightly different feel from the Bridgerton series. Thankfully. There were several Bridgerton books I had to force myself through (and two I didn't even finish) because they were either so heavy in grief that the romance was unbelievable or, two the main characters were in love with someone else. This one reminded me of her beginning novels that I fell in love with (how to marry a marquis, etc) where they're just light, fun and have characters you like to read about. Yes, plot wise it's a bit of a stretch and the one thing I didn't like was the two characters ability to carry on a romance while he was attached to her good friend, but overall it was worth the read. It's not the best thing of hers I've ever read, but definetly better than some of the Bridgerton novels."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is not exactly War and Peace but a frothy romance novel with no unexpected outcomes.

This one delivered as always and I read a book a day, ladies, so I know whereof I speak!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is not the best example of Julia Quinn's work, but I did not think that it was as bad as some of the reviews are indicating! This isn't a deep story, but it is definitely relationship-driven (which I actually thought was a nice change from so many of the regencies that have a contrived mystery). The characters have their faults, but they work through their problems and we get our happily ever after. Overall, I don't know that this one is a keeper, but it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I like Julia Quinn's books.. I like her humor, her heros and heroines, her secondary characters, her style. But if you're looking for something \\"new\\" or \\"erotic\\" then this SECRET DIARIES isn't it.It is a light, lovely, well-written fairytale. Miranda is sweet, strong in her own way, dependable and most of all, loveable. Turner is everything a Regency Hero should be: handsome, rich and embittered by the memory of his diceased wife's cheating.Of course it has a happy ending... a fairytale ending. Anything less wouldn't be Julia Quinn... and for me, she's a gem in a field of what is very often paste."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love everything about this book. Julia Quinn is one of my favorite authors, and she did not let me down!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Ms. Miranda Cheever has been in love with Lord Turner from the tender age of 10. At the age of 19 this childhood devotion has not lessened or died but has blossomed though unknown to Lord Turner and unrequited. The first chapter starts with a funeral scene (definitely one of my favourite scenes in the book due to its outrageous dialogue. The novel centres mostly around Lady Olivia, Lord Turner and Ms. Cheever. Olivia who is Miranda's closest and perhaps only friend has a deep love for Miranda and is quite loyal to her defending her against anyone who would dare to utter an unkind word about her friend. It is this devotion that prompts Olivia to attempt to matchmake Miranda with her twin Winston so that the two can be sisters. However, unbeknown to Olivia Miranda does love her brother but not Winston but Turner.The drama continues when Turner tries to thwart Olivia's matchmaking for reasons that he can not explain.The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever is filled with a lot of witty dialogue both in the entries of Miranda's diaries and interaction between the characters. The characters are endearing and are not vapid. The book is sure to make you laugh, cry and laugh again. I have read it twice now and unlike other novels that I would read again by scanning for the sections that interested me the most this one I read again in its entirety and it only took my a few hours.I strongly recommend this book. If you are a reader who lives for a lot of detailed love scenes well you may be a trifle disappointed as the book has just one detailed event. The other encounters are spoken about in the characters reverie which for me spoke volume as to the depth of emotion the hero and heroine felt for each other. In my estimation the lack of love scenes did not take away from the novel as the writer was able to communicate the feeling of the characters quite well without them."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"One of the best of the best Authors.

I Love her."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is one of the best books I've read from Julia Quinn. I actually cried at the ending. The book was more than a romance book because the saddness of our heroin to her braveness was remarkable. three thumbs up"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This story was a bit too juvenile for me. The only thing that made the story worth reading was the hero (Turner). It wasn't a bad story. It just was not hot enough for me. I liked the plot and most of the characters. There is only two very short sex scenes. This is the first book I have ever read from JQ. I don't think I'll be reading anymore from her. A little too modest for me."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love this book it was a page turner.

I've read all of the books in the Bridgerton series and some of Julia Quinn's novellas. Overall, I like her writing style compared to some other authors in her genre. If you guys think this book is bad, try Edith Layton's \\"A Bride for His Convenience\\"."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"So...I started off loving this book even though the \\"hero\\" (Turner) was kind of (for a lack of a better word) weak. I instantly connected with Miranda... oh how I love the ugly duckling turned beautiful swan stories...but something happened that threw the book way off track and it never came full circle for me. I have read so many books where the main man went through a great tragedy and never quite moved on until he was faced with the loss of the smartest and the most gorgeous gal in England. Turner just didn't fit the bill and I kept hoping Quinn would man him up a bit, but she never really did. I hate that Miranda didn't get the man that she deserved...I bet that's one thing she'll never right that diary of hers!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"if you like your romance with some heartach this is a perfect read. its not all smooth sailing but all (as expected) comes good in the end.I Love all JQ books and this is no exception!

The reviews were so immediately negative that I put off reading it for quite a long time. Having just finished Ms. Quinn's latest release (Two Dukes....), and disliking it so much, I really hesitated to read this one. Am I glad that I did!What I read was a story that seemed much more \\"real\\" to me than most of Ms. Quinn's works. I enjoy her comedy but it is not what would happen in real life. This book is different. I could see things playing out the way they did in this book - the funny parts and the sad parts. Both of the main characters have their strengths and their weakness and Ms. Quinn showed both sides to us.I hope Ms. Quinn continues to stretch as an author - even though it may disappoint some of her fans. In this book, she could have gone into more depth as to society's reaction to a man marrying so soon after his first wife's death; Miranda's conflicted feelings about her miscarriage (I'm sure there was both considerable relief as well as sadness); Winston's disappointment, and some fleshing out of Miranda's father. These comments are not critical rather an expression of what I would have liked to read and what probably kept me from giving the book a 5 star - something that I reserve for books that I intend to keep on my bookshelf!While I still have a lot of problems with the sexual situations and how in detail they are described, that is pretty much what we have in Regency books today. While I long for books written as Ms. Heyer, Ms. Smith, and Ms. Aiken Hodge wrote, I acknowledge that those books are not the fashion for the majority of readers. I buy those as they are re-released or on the second hand market.In the meantime... cheers, Ms. Quinn - thank you for a great read. I look forward to more works of this nature in the future."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I will admit that when I picked this book up I didn't know it was your standard romance novel, and I'm not a romance novel person (at least not romance novels from contemporary authors). By the description on the back cover I thought that the main character's diaries would play a much bigger part in the story...also, I was severely disappointed in how historically INaccurate so very many parts of this novel were. It was an okay light fluffy read but I wouldn't highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I've read and loved all of Julia Quinn's books, but not this one. Miranda wasn't much of a female lead. She seemed to be a somewhat vague and twit-like character. When she is told her father committed an unforgiveable crime, she doesn't even doubt the story, even though it's told to her by someone she doesn't like and who doesn't like her. She just goes along without much of an objection to the destruction of her life. NOT a keeper."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book had me laughing out loud and crying all at the same time. I've read many Julia Quinn books and this was the best by far!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I've become a huge fan of Julia Quinn after falling in love with the Bridgerton family and just couldn't wait to read more by her. I read the first chapter of this book online and was hooked but had to wait I a month before getting it. I loved the characters and there was Julia Quinn's classic, witty writing. I would now love to see a book about Olivia I loved her character and felt she didn't have enough play time so to speak. Julia Quinn is a hit with me and so was this book!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I just got done with this book . The hole reason I picked it up was because it was a quinn. From the back I was like this sounds like a good read. I agree with others on this one"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I just finished reading this book yesterday. All in all, it was a quick, easy, fun read. However, like the other reviewers, I do have a couple of bones to pick.First, Miranda is a bit young. When the book begins, she's only 19. She does turn 20, and by the end, I think she's edging toward 21. I think we'll see a sequel come in the form of Olivia's story, perhaps Winston will have one as well. She acts a bit childish at times, not like a 20 year old at all at points. As someone else pointed out, at the end, she becomes rather meek--like she lost her spark.Turner, on the other hand, was quite charming at times. I was frustrated with the premise that he couldn't say \\"I love you\\" to Miranda. It was brought up so many times that I wanted to throw the book across the room! Otherwise, I loved the banter between Turner and Miranda. I didn't love the way he snarled \\"You little fool!\\" all the time.Not one of Julia Quinn's finest, but certainly entertaining nonetheless. It was a quick read and overall worth reading."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Julia Quinn's regency romances all have a very particular flavour; this author excels in writing dialogue between characters, usually witty and snappy, and her main characters are often intelligent people who are matches for each other.\\"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever\\" follows this pattern. Miranda Cheever first falls in love with Lord Turner, the eldest brother of her best friend, when she is ten. He's nine years older than her and is just helping out his sister Olivia's friend by escorting her home and giving her a little pep-talk. Olivia is clearly going to be beautiful when she grows up, Miranda is rather more plain and gangly and so Turner says a few nice words to her - and she promptly falls in love.The story moves on nine years to the funeral of Turner's wife. Leticia turned out to be an awful woman and Turner is relieved at her death. He vows not to marry again and has become rather hard and cold. Unfortunately for him, with Miranda running tame about his parents house they meet up on many occasions and he finds himself rather drawn to her. When Miranda and Turner find themselves in an awkward situation they have to try to build an adult relationship out of what was a childhood infatuation.It's in this part of the book that I felt the author was less successful. As in so many romances published today, the central point of the plot is that the hero can't say \\"I love you\\" even if his actions show that he does; resolution of the book only comes when the man realises his mistake and verbalises the words. I find all this rather difficult to believe in a Regency setting, particularly in a society when marriages often were for social position rather than love and this would be considered the norm for most people. As usual in Julia Quinn's books the historical setting is rather vague. Her characters speak with modern concepts and constructs, if sometimes in Regency language, they use American rather than English word forms in many cases, and their behaviour isn't accurate for the period in many cases.Still it's an enjoyable read with a rather touching scene at the end when Miranda has a child and Turner is a pleasant enough, if sometimes a little vague, hero. The original avuncular relationship between him and Miranda still seems partly in place and Miranda's vacillating feelings, although understandable, are sometimes annoying. This book is, however, a great deal better than a lot of the Regencies out there because of the spirited heroine, pleasant hero and good cast of supporting characters.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book, www.curledup.com. Helen Hancox 2007"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I agree with other reviewers - this is really a 3.5 book, but I am giving it 4 stars if only to reward Julia Quinn for having broken the now-tiresome pattern of so many other romance writers (I am talking to you, Stephanie Laurens, Nicole Jordan, Jo Beverley, etcetera) - i.e., repetitively writing the same basic story about the same characters and their increasingly irrelevant and tangential hangers-on, past the point of exhaustion. Plus - even at her flimsiest, Quinn writes more entertainingly than most other romance authors."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"All I can say is WOW - and that, not in a good way. I have been an avid lover of Julia Quinn's novels, since Brighter than the Sun and Minx. I have most of the Bridgerton series, although that did start to give way when she wrote Francesca's story. Regardless, as for Miranda and Turner/Nigel, it just killed it for me. Miranda is a pain-in-the crotch, spinelss wuss and Turner is just plain rude, egotistical and selfish Recall the marriage night? My Heavens, I don't think any woman, regency era or not, would have been quite so forgiving knowing her husband was comparing her to his whoring first wife!!I could not really get into the story at all, it was murder just plowing through to the end. And yes, I agree [...] that Miranda's reactoin to her pregnancy is completely out-of-period! In the Regency period it was practically death for a young woman to have sex outside of marriage, let alone get pregnant - and have such an insouciant attitude? Not hardly!!The remaining characters are rather under-developed, including her father, good heavens, there were only a handful of pages with him having dialogue with his only child! And, yes, I too thought that the pregnancies were handled horibly. With the first one, she's pregnant one day, then all of a sudden 10 weeks later, Turner shows up and she's miscarried, and Turner doesn't know?! How unbelievable is that? You would htink that after not having written him of the pregnancy to begin with, that perhaps in her grief (we cna only assume since Ms Quinn did not delve into that too much) that she might have at least written Olivia!As unfortunate as it is though, I am not surprised that this book is not good. I had been hoping for a return to her earlier quip-filled, humourous romances, a la The Duke and I and Minx, but it was not to be with this one.Ms Quinn has been sliding since When He Was Wicked, and completely broken since It's In His Kiss, at this point, I am not certain how much more drivel can come out of her beloved laptop. Either way, I too have seen this happen with many authors, especially of the Regency genre, it's a shame, it is such a wonderful time period! Bottom line, save your money on this one and get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"And I described this book to my mother as \\"vintage\\" before I knew Ms. Quinn wrote it early in her career.Here's what I liked:Miranda Cheever is an intelligent, slightly snarky young woman who knows her own heart. She'd met Nigel Bevelstoke, Lord Turner at the age of 10~an impressionable age indeed~and never met anyone she liked better. Although a sensible, well read young miss, she was not someone to be trifled with or talked down to. So, why are some reviewers so put off by her behavior in the bookstore? Think in terms of character development~Miranda's father, her own love of books, wanting, Wanting, WANTING Turner as she did, and always having to accept her place in his life ... and her father's life. She wanted the book, and she wouldn't stand for some misogynist to dismiss her so rudely. If she hadn't reacted as she did, I'd think her emotionally dead. Quite honestly, the bookstore was my favorite scene and practically put this book on my DIK shelf.I rooted for Miranda, who lived in her beautiful friend Olivia's shadow. Miranda was practically a charity case to the Bevelstokes. Indeed, had they not taken her in as they did, she'd have lived a very neglected life with her father. Her father~one of the things I didn't like about this book.And, although I am loath to admit it, I liked the complete lack of a sub-plot. Normally, I prefer a book with perfectly orchestrated character development and sub-plot, bordering on suspense or mystery or the downright diabolical. I never missed the sub-plot in TSDOMMC. I happily concentrated on the romance, and that was well done. BRAVO. I could feel Miranda's emotions, and they were written so well that I asked myself how Julia Quinn~no longer a young miss herself (sorry dear author)~could remember those feelings ... first love and all that. They were so vivid.Also, the plot, as I saw it, was how Miranda would deal with Turner, having been so clever and funny and handsome~the man of her dreams~becoming something/someone else altogether. And, then there was Turner's younger brother, who she liked well enough when she saw the qualities of the younger Turner in him, but, alas, he was not Turner. Turner's personality is there though, buried with his unfaithful, dead wife. Miranda's \\"crush\\" on Turner revives everytime she sees glimpses of his former charming self.What I didn't especially like, but liked well enough to still call this book one of my favorites and certainly my favorite Julia Quinn book (some spoilers):Olivia's mother (Turner's mother, too, of course) had no idea Miranda and Turner had feelings for each other. I expected she'd have guessed and either found some reason to object, or every reason to foster the relationship.Miranda's father~I expected him to make an appearance, and be chastised by Turner. Gosh, I really don't think he cared at all. He should have been arrested for neglect. Could he have caught a bad cold at the end and died, or something? My bad.Julia Quinn's style is amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this read, light and quick and hot. Yes HOT! I saw somewhere that TSDOMMC was rated \\"warm.\\" Not in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I had a really hard time getting through the last Bridgerton book, so this was a vast improvement and very enjoyable to read. Unfortunately, this book is also very similar to Romancing Mister Bridgerton, which compared to this book, is a 5 star book.Romancing Mr. Bridgeton:The heroine, Peneloupe, who isn't thought to be attractive by societies standards, is secretly in love with her best friends older brother and has been since she was a child. The hero only sees her as his sister's friend until he starts to find himself attracted to her.Just change the names to Miranda and Turner and you have the same story. Like Miranda, Peneloupe also secretly writes, but she actually earns at living at it writing a gossip column under the name of Mrs. Whistledon, while Miranda merely writes her thoughts and feeling in her diary.Colin, the hero is Romancing Mr. B, is probably a more heroic hero than Turner is. There are times when Turner can be a real jerk you want to smack, like after he has sex with Miranda, and then promptly takes off for about seven weeks not wanting to deal with the fact he has to marry Miranda now. There are other times when you want to cheer him on when he lets his true feelings show at his faithless wife's funeral and when he refuses to wear an armband in mourning for her. In a lot of ways, Turner is more darker and complex than Colin Bridgerton was in Romancing Mr. B.Near the end of the book when Miranda starts demanding Turner declare his love and doesn't seem to be able to understand that he can't because of what his first wife did to him, she loses major brownie points. Especially when she moves out of their bedroom.Still, it's a good book to read and one I'll read again in future. The ending was great the way Turner and Miranda came full circle."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is one of the best books I have read this summer.

It was funny, sad, heartwarming, heartwrenching, and romantic. Everything you could you want from a romance book. I hope we'll get to read Olivia's and Winston's stories."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I thought it would be a bit more in-depth, but, none-the-less it was an easy read, with some humor added in. I recommend it if you enjoy reading, because it has a nice storyline, and can be read through pretty fast. The heroine was a touch campy in her life-long obsession of the leading man, but still a good read."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"The only reason I ever pick up a Quinn novel (I haven't bothered for the last few years) is that the plot always sounds intriguing on the back of the book jacket. If she could just contain herself when writing dialogue, I would be more pleased with her books. As it is, the reader has to force herself to make it past the first 150 pages. Quinn tries so hard to write witty dialogue, but in reality, it just comes across as stupid. And for some reason, she seems to shove all this stupidity to the beginning of her novels. You want to give up reading long before wading through the inanity to get to the good part. She often redeems herself somwhat in the last 100 pages, as she does here, because Quinn finally becomes serious and moves her characters along without allowing them to talk as much. But, really, there is no reason to spend your good money on a Quinn novel. Go pick up a Mary Balogh or Jo Beverley book if you want to read truly gifted Regency writers."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I like Julia Quinn a lot. However, why do I think she became busy with other endeavors and farmed this out to an inept ghost writer? 1.) the dialogue was inane. 2.) After our heroine snares the hero all she does is whine about why he doesn't love her. Puhleeze! 3.)I did not connect with the characters. ABout the only one I was interested in was the heroine's best friend, Olivia, who also happens to be the hero's little sister. 4.) The plot consisted of the heroine pining for the hero.Do not buy this if you have never read Julia Quinn. I would wait until it is in a used book store or skip it and wait for her next offering."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I found this to be a very fast read, I loved it from the start to the finish. There were even a few \\"tear-jerker\\" moments."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I found the plot of this book rather refreshingly uncomplicated and straightforward. Unlike most historicals, this one isn't overly plotted with unlikely villains and incidents, but instead concentrates on the characters themselves and their feelings.Miranda Cheever falls in love with her best friend's brother Turner, at a young age. He makes a short-lived disastrous marriage that traumatizes him, and Miranda has to try to see if she can succeed in getting him to heal and be able to return her love. The interaction between the two is interesting and believable. Turner is not superman, solving some crime or working some espionage for the crown, he is just a nobleman of his time, with emotional baggage he has to let go of. Those who prefer their romances to be strictly romances without plot distractions, contrived misunderstandings or a heroine that's TSTL (too stupid to live), this one's for you. Julia Quinn is at her best with the emotionally moving and sensual scenes,(plenty of hot sex) and the reader is caught up with the protaganists all the way. No doubt Turner's sister Olivia, will get a book of her own soon. I'll look forward to it!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"When I picked this book up (a day early from the release date, lucky no?) I was hoping that it was going to be better than some of her latest Bridgerton books. Boy was I in for a surprise! This book is now #2 on my favorite JQ book list (only being beaten by Romancing Mr. Bridgerton). It was funny, heart wrenching, and simply beautiful!Some of the other reviewers have mentioned that they are not alright with Miranda's age, implying that at 19 she is far too young. I disagree. Overall she is very mature for her age and has more sense than many of her elders. Besides this is a historical romance meaning that during this period women frequently got married at that age, sometimes even younger. Does Miranda act her age later in the book? Yes, but doesn't make everyone a little foolish?"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This book is wonderful. I read it in an entire sitting because I just could not put it down. The plot was wonderful and Turner was the greatest tortured hero ever. I love the wit and snappy banter that Julia puts into her characters - it makes them so enjoyable to get to know. The ending was great and I cried when Turner declared himself to Miranda. It is a great story, but then Julia never disappoints."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I was so excited for this book as Julia Quinn is a favorite of mine; I normally love her work and I also (surprise, surprise) love to see the quiet/shy girl get the guy. Though there was witty dialog and moments that had me laughing out loud, I really have to say I was disappointed and bothered by many aspects of this book.PRAISE:(1) Funny moments that will make you laugh(2) Connection between Turner and Miranda is interesting to watch in about the first half of the book(3) I liked Olivia and Turner's motherCRITICISM:Key: *Semi-spoiler, **Spoiler(1) Turner (hero) and Miranda (heroine) are not written / portrayed consistently; they seem to (often) do things that are just very out of character(2) Depiction of Miranda's father was very flat and I know he's supposed to be the absent-minded-doesn't-really-pay-attention type of character, but these type of one-dimensional portrayals bother me(3) Development of their relationship is very uneven and they have sex at a pretty reasonable point in the book page-wise (halfway or so), but their relationship had definitely not developed fast enough for that; only two other physical scenes before that, both kissing, and one of them doesn't count because it is before Turner is really attracted to Miranda and is done more in anger* (4) Miranda was really spineless throughout the latter half of the novel. I think that Turner's horrible absence either needed to be kept and her reaction and anger upped or he needed to show up much, much sooner to deserve her easy acquiescence. (I mean she caves in to marrying him after 3 days when she doesn't supposedly want to? Have a backbone!)** (5) Miranda is not even UPSET by the fact that she miscarries and regardless of the kind-of-explanation that her mother had many miscarriages also, I just found this VERY troubling - you'd think she would somehow be affected** (6) I didn't like the progression of the book, one example being the fact that we basically skip over the first six months of Miranda's second pregnancy and are just given one of her diary entries as a substitute** (7) I was annoyed with Miranda (if you couldn't tell, Miranda gets progressively more annoying as you read) when she finally gets her long-awaited declaration of love and she reacts negatively at first because she doesn't want him to have realized his love only because he almost lost her(8) The ending was very, very corny and yes, I know, I'm reading a romance novel, but the whole journal-revealing moment and Turner's comments (\\"My God, Miranda,\\" he breathed reverently. \\"You really love me, don't you?\\")CONCLUSION:Save your money, buy one of Julia Quinn's other books as she has many great masterpieces to offer that will be one of those reread and keep-forever historical romances. Some suggestions include: The Viscount Who Loved Me, An Offer From a Gentleman, and Romancing Mister Bridgerton - these three are amazing."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":".....but I didn't. And that is really too bad. It had most of the elements I want when I read a Regency and yet I still didn't love it.For me, Miranda was just too young. Ms Quinn wrote herself into a corner by establishing the age as 10 years old when Miranda fell in love with Nigel. I'm sure it sounded quite fetching when thinking about it from a promotional standpoint for the book but then she was stuck. Miranda kept saying that she was not a child anymore (Was she 19 or was she 20? I could never figure it out.) and yet she seemed to always act out as a child, with the episode in the bookstore being a prime example. And she didn't even just go there once and act awful, she did it twice! Her rage didn't come across to me as righteous indignation. It seemed like she was just throwing a hissy fit. She and Turner even reverted to childish behavior many times with the \\"Did not\\", \\"Did so\\" childish type arguments. She constantly told Turner that it didn't matter if he loved her or not, yet she kept trying to make him say that he loved her and punished him in various ways when he didn't say it. From my standpoint, all examples of a girl, young emotionally as well as in age. Not a mature woman ready to truly love a man. Ms Quinn did not do Miranda any favors by having her live such a sheltered, countryfied life completely without any socially maturing experiences before this story takes place.Turner was \\"tortured\\" for way too long and I didn't like him at all. I actually began to wonder why Miranda bothered with him. There was a huge lack of other male characters in this book. Turner needed someone to talk to so that he could verbalize his feelings and have some opportunity to see how awful he was acting. As it was, he only came across as totally self-absorbed and a man who made dreadful decisions when he was drinking too much. I knew early on I would not like him when he was such a pig about people using his given name (Nigel). I didn't think that little insight into his character served any purpose whatsoever unless Ms Quinn wanted us to see how disrespectful and selfish he was going to become.When the scene at the hunting lodge began to unfold I just thought to myself: No, Ms Quinn, don't do this. Surely she won't do this. Good grief, she did this. It was an awful scene and totally out of character for both these people at this point in the story.If you love all things written by Julia Quinn, go ahead and buy this book. Everyone else, think if over carefully before you spend your money on it. This is a great candidate for a library check-out or even a used book store. If I could get mine to you, you would be welcomed to it."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I want to start by saying I have read EVERY single one of Julia Quinn's novels and I consider myself a tremendous fan. That said, I will not rate this book more than it deserves.The Secret Diaries is a horribly contrived story with equally horrid writing.Permit me to quote this gem\\"Miranda wasn't sure why that should be the case- an unplanned pregnancy was an unplanned pregnancy was an unplanned pregrancy\\" (pg 45)WHAT the hell is THAT phrasing doing in a Regency novel? In many of Julia Quinns previous novels, she uses phrases like 'I'm kidding' that are hopelessly out of the period, but those mishaps are wonderfully ensconsed in a good book. This time I could not let it go!Another problem with this book is that it is TOO much 'Regency Lite'. Miranda's absent father was too TOO convenient, especially after she became pregnant. The situations she and Turner got into made absolutely no logical sense. After the first couple of times he kisses/gropes her, he makes a point to avoid her since , as he puts it, girls have been RUINED for doing less. He then avoids her like a plague and breaks her heart . Makes sense. But then they meet at a house party a week later AND HAVE SEX! Huh? As I was reading the lead up to the scene, I was thinking that he couldn't possibly take her virginity and she couldn't possibly LET him. *Sigh*Another aspect of the novel I could not fathom was the relationship between the protagonists. Unrequited love can be wonderful storyline if executed properly. This one wasn't.The prologue, in my opinon was the most awful way to start any romance novel. A 10 year old falling in love with a man, and loving him forever since. Gah! Her journal entries amplify the 'Gah!' factor even more. Throughout her growing years it seems she ends every journal entry with 'I dreamt of him.'Really Miranda? I mean, did you REALLY dream of him every single night ?!?Miranda even attended his wedding and wished it was her. At this point, her love is more and more like a overblown crush. There was nothing in in their interactions that said 'Love' to me.Ironically, after they marry they settle in a nice routine and they finally FINALLY have seem to gain some sense, Miranda decides that she is upset because he doesn't say 'I love you.' I'm sorry but the fact that the tension is built around SAYING the words, rather than whether he loves her or not was rather silly of the author. I felt I was reading a contemporary romance with where the crux of the romance is 'gasp' , saying I love you.I'm sorry Julia, this was not a good book.**8/12/2007. I just read 'The Masquerade' by Brenda Joyce, and if I could downgrade this book to 1 star I would.In BJ's book, the heroine falls in love with the hero at age 10, however the end product was more fulfilling IMO**"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Let me begin by saying that I love Julia Quinn. Love her. She can do no wrong in my eyes and I'll recommend her books to anyone, which is why I'm so angry that she did what she did with this book. The Secret Diaries of Miranda Cheever had such potential. The beginning has been done before, heroine meets hero as an ungainly and awkward child and falls instantly in love when he makes her feel that she could grow out of it and become a beautiful woman some day. It's the twist that gives the book its potential, hero is cuckolded, turned into a sullen whiner, and widowed by the same beautiful woman; therefore, hero will never love again. Again, it's been done before, but it has potential with an author of Quinn's talent and achievement. Does she take advantage of it? No. It's like every other historical romance you've ever read (or contemporary for that matter) when the man refuses to stop acting like a child and take responsibility for his future. And in that respect, it was boring, useless, and a waste of my time. I love Julia Quinn. Love her. But it's going to take me awhile to forgive her for this one. I can only hope that the upcoming The Two Dukes of Wyndham redeems her in my eyes. I'd suggest you pick up one of her winners (think Minx, The Duke and I, or The Viscount Who Loved Me) and leave this half-hearted effort on the shelf where it belongs"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I really find it hard to believe that Julia Quinn wrote this book. Turner and Miranda are the worst hero and heroine I have read in a looooooong time.From the beginning I had the feeling that Turner was a total jerk.And he didn't prove me wrong. A man doesn't take the virginity of a young lady (who is also his sister's best friend and practically a member of his family) leave without even saying goodbye, and as if that wasn't enough he doesn't contact her for SIX WEEKS!!!!!!!! After that there was nothing he could do to redeem himself in my eyes. This is a man who had been married and was almost thirty years old. UGH!!!!!! So its not like he should have been lacking experience or maturity...How self centered and selfish could he get????I agree with another reviewer that Miranda was way too young. She was also a spineless doormat who spent the entire book as if Turner was some sort of God. I really like to see the H/H on equal footing. This story gave me the feeling that Miranda wasn't good enough. Over and over we read that she isn't pretty, doesn't fit in with the ton, she doesn't have a dowry etc. etc. It was like the author kept demeaning her again and again.And what happened to all the secondary characters???? JQ is known for her well developed characters, whether primary or secondary. Olivia is the only one who we got to know a little and I do mean little.I really miss Ms.Quinn's early books. This one is for sure the one to skip over. And I am really sorry to have to say this, cause I adore so many of her other novels."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"i am a big fan of julia quinn...but this book just left me irritated. it's hard to like a book when you don't like the main characters. i can say with certain feeling that i did not like the hero AT ALL. he had that \\"i know what's best for you\\" attitude and was overly arrogant and selfish until the last few pages...and to me being redeemed within 5 pages of ending doesn't make me like him any more than i did at the beginning. the heroine was too meek and blindly followed anyone (mostly the \\"hero\\") who told her what to do. it seemed unrealistic that a child-love/crush from one nice comment could actually survive all of the hero's selfish ways and cruel behaviors; any woman i know would wash her hands clean of the man and move on. i hope ms. quinn's next novel is as good as all her others."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"It is my understanding that this book had been in the mothballs for several years and Ms. Quinn decided to do a re-write, fluff it up as it were and release it. I wish that she had never done it, I have read all of her books, not only the Bridgerton series, but Minx, How to marry a Marquess and so forth, she should be ashamed to have attached her name to this, it is so foolish, no real conflict or plot, it does remind me of someones first draft. She should have burned it. I hope her next book is new and she uses the talent she now possesses"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I wasn't impressed with the last two Julia Quinn books but that didn't stop me from buying her latest. I have to say it was definitely a step up from On the Way to the Wedding and To Sir Phillip, With Love. And while it wasn't as good as The Viscount Who Loved Me, When He Was Wicked, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton and all her really early work, it was an enjoyable read. I liked Turner right from the beginning and I liked Miranda but eventually she began to grate. They were going to get married after he compromised her and that was fine with her but then everything confusingly shifted when all of a sudden she wouldn't marry him unless he loved her, not at all understanding that he'd been burned once and didn't want it to happen again. And then everything shifted again when she married him anyway. But all in all, it was a pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"because I, too, was disappointed by this book. This reminded me of Quinn's early work, when she suffered from the new young writer syndrome of uneven and inconsistent story, poor characterization, questionable character motives, slow movement of the story and plot, and dialogue that seems written merely to be cute instead of serving the story. Ultimately for me, the book committed that sin of sins for a writer: boring the reader. The more I read the more I realized I cared little about the hero or the heroine. I struggled to finish it.Several romance authors appear to have dusted off early drafts now that their very name assures the sale of a new title: Linda Howard comes immediately to mind, and I've stopped buying her for that reason. But I'm wondering now if Mary Balogh and Julia Quinn haven't also done this in that their last two offerings have seemed weak. Writing is hard so who could blame them? But the least they can do for their faithful readers is to re-edit that early draft with the skill they have acquired over the years. There are too many good writers out there to waste one's time on a bad product from a writer you once liked.Having said all that, I do think Julia Quinn's dedications to her husband, Paul, are unexceptionally witty and clever; these small offerings in the front of her books are evidence of what appears to be a real love story."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This is the last time I buy a Julia Quinn book on the strength of her name alone. After the first 3 books in the Bridgerton series, I would have bought ANYTHING with her name on it - even a cookbook and I don't like to cook! (the Duke and I was EXCELLENT btw, its on my \\"keeper\\" shelf!) BUT the last 2 books in the series were BAD and this book though not a Bridgerton is just horrible! The premise, \\"tortured\\" hero and \\"unrequited love\\" heroine story, did have promise early on but by the 3rd chapter it was over! Julia where are you? I swear there's some other \\"writer\\" out there putting your name on their \\"mess\\". It's obvious to me that you're having to crank out books faster than you can make them good. Unfortunately this has also happened to Elizabeth Lowell, Andrea Kane, Madeline Hunter the list goes on. I wish publishers would concentrate on quality instead of quantity! ANYWAY, save your money and if you must buy it used or check it out of the library - frankly you won't miss much if you skip it altogether, there was NOTHING to like about the characters or story."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I am extremely bummed about this book. I loved the Brigerton series and was hoping for more of the same with this one.I found that Miranda and Nigel/Turner were extremely immature and acted more like bickering teenagers than adults.*Spoiler* I agree wholeheartedly with Phillipa J's review. The part that really bothered me, so much so that I haven't even read the remainder of the book, is the totally blase approach to Miranda's miscarriage. I mean what the heck?? And the description? \\"...I bled and then I wasn't pregnant anymore.\\" It was the most astounding thing I've ever read and the fact that it was supposedly not worth mourning over because her mother had told her those babies were not meant to be? I would never have thought Julia Quinn would write those words and I was so disturbed by the complete lack of feeling on Miranda and Turner's part (and Julia's!) that I haven't picked up the book since. And honestly after reading all of the juvenile dialogue between the two of them, I really can't say that I'm sorry. So disappointed...ugh."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love Julia Quinn's novels because her heroines are so intelligent and have such an amazing spirit. I enjoy the witty banter between the characters. Her plots are unique and fresh.Unfortunately, in this book, Quinn returns to the plots and devices of 1970's romances. Viscount Turner, the male lead (I cannot call him a hero), pushes the female lead around and forces her to marry him. And she is secretly happy about it. Turner treated the protagonist horribly through out the book, except for the brief 20 minutes they had sex. This is not romance. This is masochism on the part of Miss Miranda Cheever.Other readers might say that this book is not set in moderns times and that reader must understand that females married much earlier, etc.; however, this book is written for the modern reader. I would not want such a reluctant groom and I imagine that no woman would. I would not want to be forced into marriage, either. If this book had been set in modern times, there would be an outrage over the male lead's behavior.Quinn often delves into the psyche of her male leads which can be interesting; however, in this novel, it seems repetitive since the reader is told over and over how awful his first marriage was, as if this were an excuse to treat Miranda so horribly for so many pages. Turner doesn't seem to evolve at all. One could argue that this book takes place in the space of a year, which does not give him much time to evolve. However, his marriage had never been a good one, so he had much more than a year to come to terms with it. A mature person deals with his loss without hurting others. Turner was very immature. Also, the subplot of the two brothers who were both interested in Miranda was magically resolved. When two men, especially two brothers, both want to date one woman it is always complicated and it doesn't just work itself out. The people involved must work it out.Again, until this novel, I always enjoyed Julia Quinn's novels. She is an intelligent, compassionate writer. I hope that in her next novels, she will return to intelligent, compelling heroines who are not doormats. Miranda's best friend Olivia was a very interesting character and deserves her own book. Also, the cover and back of The Secret Diaries was beautifully done."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"To be honest, I can't quite believe that this book was written by Julia Quinn. I love the majority of her novels, and even the ones that I don't love (the last few editions in the Brighton [edit] sorry, Bridgerton (my apologies, don't know what I was thinking) series) I generally like well enough to buy and reread, but this was... well, I haven't actually been able to finish it, and don't believe I will any time soon. I realise it's a bit rich of me to therefore offer my opinion, but I'm so disappointed in this offering that I felt compelled to say something.As many people before me have said, the characters came across as unsympathetic and unlikeable, a death knell as far as I'm concerned in any story. \\"Turner\\" is the most unheroic hero I've come across in a long, long time. I couldn't stand him! Miranda is, in theory, the sort of female character I usually adore, but she came across as whiny and immature. I certainly wasn't rooting for them to get together; frankly I think they would have been better off going their separate ways!I dearly hope that Quinn has only misplaced her spark, and not lost it completely, because her earlier novels, \\"Duke and I\\", \\"Viscount Who Loved Me\\" and \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton,\\" are three of my very most favourite Regency Romances and I know she has better than this in her!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I don't understand how this author continues to write some disappointing stuff, yet it all gets published. I forced myself to finish this even though I found both characters hopeless after a while. I think I'm going to sell all my copies of her books at my next yard sale."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Our hero, Nigel \\"Turner\\" Bevelstoke is a man that due to a horrible marriage, had his emotions shredded and destoyed and now he is the shell of the wonderous man that he once upon a time was. He a deep, dark FUNNY hero unlike any other hero that Quinn has ever produced. He has a wry wit and a darkness that haunts his soul. It took two pages for me to fall in love with him myself.Miranda Cheever, only child, and best friend to Nigel's younger and most wonderful sister, Olivia, is intellegent, observant and has been in love with Turner for nearly a decade when she is thrust back into his life. And Turner is torn between his growing emotions for Miranda and his own anger with his past mistake.MIranda is a remarkable warm and insightful heroine. Because of a childhood encounter with Turner, she is documents everything--in her journal. (Pesonally this reminds me a bit of the stories of Jane Austin, our Regency Queen, and her observing, evaluating and writing) And since the age of 11, Miranda was in love with Turner. For years she has been observing his life, documenting it in her journal and burning a torch for him when suddenly she is thrust in the midst of Turner's turmoil.The Chemistry between Turner and Miranda is entertaining and very passionate. There is a lot of classic Quinn Chatter and barbs. Turner and Miranda are intellectual equals and I found myself giggling at a lot of their conversations. Their closeness is so real, we just want Miranda to win over her man--and for him to believe in love once again!The character development is very satisfying. Turner is not the one dimensional dark character--we feel his pain. Turner's inability to trust again is understandable and then we, as readers feel Miranda's pure love and her pain that this is not given back in return. And Miranda has a spine and has a lot of spirit despite her quietness. She is witty and a bit fiesty and :) punchy!I have noticed two themes in negative reviews and I have to add my personal opinion on both.One: Miranda's age. Remember. This is a REGENCY novel--not one set in our era. At 20, women were expected to marry. At 22 they were considered spinsters--on the shelf! And part of what is amazing about Miranda is that she UNDERSTANDS so much for someone so young. Nigel first meets her when she is a mere 11--and is enchanted with this albeit, odd looking, but highly intellegent child. AND her father is a scholar and she is highly educated herself. There is nothing upsetting or odd about this. (btw if this was a modern romance, I would have a different opinion. this is appropriate for this era)Second, the criticism that Nigel is tortured for so long. The poor guy had JUST lost his horrible wife when he and Miranda find themselves thrown together once again. In fact from start to end of this book--hardly one year has passed--and it is not realistic for anyone who suffered public humilation and a broken heart to just \\"get over it\\" so quickly. This is why I love Quinn books. There is that realism--and understanding of the human psyche and heart. And a heart that has been tortured as Turner's had, is not going to instantly mend at the time he encounters his the first fluttering eyelashes at a ball.This is Quinn's first non Bridgerton Novel in 8 years--and as much as I enjoyed the Bridgertons and was frustrated with the last two installment, this novel is the breath of fresh and entertaining air I have been hoping for!! I found myself so entertained--and so moved by the emotions in this novel. I loved Miranda and Turner and found that the succession of emotions were realistic and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"The cover art and come-ons got me. \\"This generation's Jane Austen.\\" Please, never ever do that to me again.

This book was terrible."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Okay, so it's not the best Julia Quinn book, but it's a giant improvement over the last two Bridgerton books and has therefore restored my faith in the author. There are some problems with predictability, and Miranda's continued refusal to even consider marrying Turner is quite baffling given her situation and the time period, but for the most part this book is a perfectly good summer read. The characters are interesting and the arguments between the main characters are pretty funny. This is definitely the only romance novel I can think of that involves the hero throwing a scone at the heroine.

Couldn't put it down!!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"If you want a riotous historical romp about wine, debauchery and adventure, this book isn't for you. However, if you're after a gentle tale of love (with a bit of sex thrown in for good measure), then The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever will keep you entertained for hours.The story takes place in 19th century England, and is a predicable tale of unrequited love. Miranda is our heroine - a shy and quiet country girl who yearns for the love of her best friend's eldest brother (Turner). She writes daily in her diary of her longing to be with her beloved, but unfortunately, the dashing Turner has no interest in the plain and awkward Miranda.The reader will know exactly how it's all going to turn out, but don't let that put you off. Like any good romance, there are still some surprises along the way, and the author has done a marvellous job of keeping the pace light and entertaining.A relaxing weekend read.Zara StevensBoy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I thought unlike what most of the reviewers thought giving this book less than a four and even three that it was really good. I read this book in two days. Once I started I couldn't stop. I loved Miranda and Nigel and even thought that since her Bridgeon series that Julia Quinndid a great job on this book. For me this book was very simple. It was simple and nice and I think that most people can take simple as not nice, but it was a good change from other books. It will be a part of my collecton."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"Even though I'm an incredible sucker for romance novels, looking back at this one it was a little bit saccharin. It had too much - every possible clich&eacute;: the gawky, not-conventionally pretty heroine, the emotionally damaged hero, and scandal. And not much else. There wasn't an air of mystery, or any interesting side story, or much in the way of a great supporting cast. I feel a little bit cheated, and sincerely hope there's another book that explores Olivia's character and gives her a little depth. Because despite it all, I would like to know what happens to her!And despite being so harsh with it thus far, I still can't give it too low of a rating because the writing and the story still kept me entertained. I read through it one sitting, and enjoyed it, as trite as it might have been. It's one of those books that can keep you interested only so long as you're actively reading it, I think, then quietly slips off your radar. It's not on par with her Bridgerton series, but it's worth a lazy Sunday read for the romance novel lover."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"This wasn't bad but it wasn't fabulous either.I enjoyed it and will keep it on my bookshelf.

Not the best book, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I thought this book was a great fluff read, I liked that it was more about the couple than a sub plot. I also liked that Miranda didn't want to marry Turner right away. Loved that she stuck up for herself and knew what she wanted."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"For all of Julia Quinn's followers who loved the Bridgerton Family, this book might seem a let-down. I believe that's due to the totally different circumstances of the characters.Almost every young girl falls in love with an 'older' man, usually a friend's male cousin or brother sometimes almost a decade her senior. Miranda Cheever fits that mold but her youthful crush has far outlived its usefulness. Growing up on the lower rungs of British society she was not a commoner although there was no question that her lineage would benefit immensely from an infusion of blue blood. But instead she watches as the love of her life marries another.When Viscount Turner suddenly becomes widowed, he turns stoic. Not missing in the least his philandering wife he directs his attention to being the head of his family, which conveniently includes Miranda, his sister's best friend. As Miranda grows into herself she becomes an attractive young woman who does not see her own good qualities.The Viscount takes Miranda under his societal wing as she goes through the motions of attracting a suitable spouse only to find himself becoming so overly protective of her that he compromises her. Rather than inform the Viscount of his impending fatherhood, Miranda takes herself off to distant parts where she miscarries the child.When at last Nigel (the Viscount) recognizes that his life is empty without Miranda and goes off in search of her, love takes advantage of the opportunity and a happy ending brings Miranda's secret diary entries to a satisfactory conclusion.A thoroughly entertaining story by one of the best romance writers, this story actually rates a 3.5 but since it falls far short of the Bridgerton series I am only giving it 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'd say this is more a 3 and a half star book. They banter was witty, the plot moved quickly (too quickly maybe?) and I happen to be a sucker for the plotline (crush on the older, more worldly man). As other reviewers did, I have some issues though. First, Miranda's hero-worship never quite matures into a believable love. Second, I feel that losing a baby should have caused more emotion. It's traumatic no matter what the circumstances and I thought it coldly written off.Third, Turner treated Miranda horribly after they were intimate and should have been made to grovel. It should also have taken Miranda longer to give in. But even so it was an enjoyable read that just never quite lived up to it's potential."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"There was absolutely nothing that stood out for me in this novel. I am very disappointed. SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED- How many times does a romance writer have to use the whole, the couple is at a house party routine, gets caught in the rain then has sex in the wood shed...? Then dum dum dum....the heroine gets pregnant. I mean oh my god, that's as predictable as a soap opera. I've come to expect better from Ms. Quinn than this! Shame on her for churning out such crap and expecting us to buy it because it has her name on it. I hate to be this harsh, but really now! This book is so typical, so mundane, so every stereotypical romance scenerio that it is appalling."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I have to say I'm surprised so many people disliked this book! I thought Julia Quinn was in fine form in this story. I found myself anxious to find out what would happen next. I found Turner to be more interesting than some of Quinn's other heroes - he wasn't Mr. Perfect. I've noticed that some people have said that Turner ignored Miranda too long after the whole hunting lodge incident. Well, yes, he did. However, we must remember that this guy was married to a pretty horrible woman. He probably didn't want to jump into another marriage right away, and understandably so. Furthermore, many other readers have said that Miranda was too young. 20 was not too young in those days to get married! As a sidenote, Kate was 20 in The Viscount Who Loved Me. Look it up.At any rate, I also have a few complaints about this one: (spoiler alert)The secondary characters just disappeared in the second half of the novel. And what about Winston? Wasn't he the slightest bit upset that Turner moved in on Miranda? I thought that could have been explored more. In general, I found that I didn't have a lot of respect for Miranda afer the whole hunting lodge incident. Those of you that have read the novel know what I'm talking about. Miranda seems a little promiscuous here. I get that she loves Turner, but still, all I could think was \\"have a little self-control here people.\\"I love Julia Quinn's writing, and for the most part I enjoyed this story. The dialogue was crisp and entertaining as always, and Miranda made for a good heroine (even if she was a bit uneven at times). However, I've noticed that in general, there is a trend in romance novels now to turn up the sensuality factor. Julia Quinn had always resisted this trend, and now she seems to be caving in. Go back to the way you were Julia! We liked your books just fine."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"\\"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever\\" lacked the sparkle and wit that Julia Quinn creates in her books. The chemistry between Miranda and Turner never sparked or crackled, it was always at a mellow hum. The passion seemed to be on the side of lacking, there was anger, but not the passion typical of the genre. The book had its pleasing moments. I found the last 75 pages or so very compelling, the only part of the book that I could not put down, but I felt like I had to drudge through a lot to get there. Quinn was very redundant in her writing, restating and restating things, I wondered if she had forgotten that she had already written similar statements and feelings."},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I love Quinn's clever style and her references to literature and history. Can't get enough Austen and Mary Wollstencraft references, though it's been done before. I love a nerdy heroine who reads, because I like to think of myself as a nerdy heroine who reads! Sigh. I really enjoyed the heroine and the hero. Sometimes they behaved stupidly, as readers here have written, but who among us has not behaved stupidly when in love?Spoilers Here:If you read the All About Romance review, the critic says that the last 1/3 of the book, in which Miranda is hung up on Turner's inability to say \\"I love you,\\" causes her to give the book a \\"B\\" rather than an \\"A.\\" I think that the idea that a hurt would eat away at a person, breaking down communication until it damages the relationship, is completely logical, at least for a romance novel.Other criticisms readers have written here on Amazon include: why does Miranda not care more about her miscarriage? I dunno, but I didn't think about it at the time. She does write in her diary that she is torn between weeping and rejoicing. And I would imagine she might have been a bit relieved to lose the baby of a man who didn't love her (or so she thought).I loved the characters, loved the pacing, loved the vivid descriptions of setting and sparkling dialogue. When I finished this novel I thought, \\"I wouldn't change a thing,\\" and despite what this glowing review might lead you to think, that isn't something I usually feel when finishing a romance novel. I don't have a lot of keepers, but this is one of them, so...give it a try if you like Quinn.

The stories I love best are always character driven, not plot driven, and I was totally captivated by both hero and heroine. Over the past two years I've read more than 400 romance novels, and this was the first time I've cried happy tears at the ending of any of them.

(he's a man! he needs consolation! and, well, he's a man!

He kisses her hand as if she was a beautiful lady before he bids adieu. The ten year old believes the viscount, but also knows he is one day destined to be her soul mate.Almost a decade later, Miranda is as beautiful as Nigel had predicted. She has never forgotten the nice viscount and is excited when they meet for the first time since he boosted her confidence with his kind words. However, Nigel is not the same amiable caring person she remembers; instead he is an acrimonious grump grieving a tragic loss. When they make love, she thinks forever while he thinks an error. However, when she becomes pregnant they marry, but Miranda knows that unless she can heal him with her love, they are doomed to an unhappy existence.Miranda steals the show in this wonderful regency romance with her diary entries over the years as she continued her dream that one day her prince Nigel will come for her. When he does, he is a broken person; no longer the kind hero who took some time with a distraught little girl. Readers will enjoy this fine historical as Miranda's preadolescent fantasy turns into an adult reality if her love can heal Nigel's soul.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever","review":"I'll admit this upfront: as far as I'm concerned, Julia Quinn can do no wrong. I think she's the best historical romance writer out there today and although I also love Loretta Chase and Kresley Cole, JQ is still the queen of witty dialogue, expert pacing, and loveable heroines and heroes.The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever puts a new twist on an old romance convention: namely, the young woman desperately in love with her best friend's brother. In this novel, Miranda falls in love with Turner, her friend Olivia's dashing older brother, when Miranda is only ten. She thinks Turner is perfect and when we first meet him, he very nearly is. Unfortunately, a disastrous first marriage sours Turner on love, making him cynical, selfish and altogether bitter.Nevertheless, Miranda still has deep feelings for Turner, and those feelings only grow stronger as they spend time together. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but circumstances force these two together, although Quinn cleverly gives both characters room to make their own choices so their coming together is very satisfying. The question throughout is: \\"Will Turner be able to let go of his fear and anger and let himself recognize and acknowledge his love for Miranda?\\" Some readers may find the journey to answering that question a little repetitious at times-- Miranda and Turner do tend to go around in circles a bit in some of their later arguments about Turner's feelings-- but I felt the end so emotionally satisfying that it made up for the frustration Turner's stubborness caused here and there.There are also some very cute scenes along the way, including a scuffle at a gentleman's bookshop, and some marks of the time (house parties, balls, etc) that make the action feel rooted in the period.What I loved about this novel is that despite Miranda's love for Turner, she never lets him walk all over her. And Turner can be idiotic in his refusal to let go of his anger at his first wife, but that idiocy makes sense. Quinn does a great job of showing Turner acting like a jerk while still letting us glimpse the stubborn heart that hides under the surface. These two have great chemistry, too-- their banter is frequently laugh-out-loud funny, and Miranda has several moments where she so effectively puts Turner in his place it's hard not to stand up and cheer.Like all of Quinn's novels, this one reads quickly, and is filled with wonderful supporting characters (I hope Olivia gets her book next). And the happy ending feels like something both characters truly earn and deserve.If you enjoy lighthearted historical romances, this is definitely a book to savor. Diehard Quinn fans won't be disappointed, either."},{"Title":"The Mirror Within","review":"Eevery one should read this book, especially since all of us live some part of the story or poem.

I would have given it a 5 if there were less letters about her and more stories coming directly from her. Even though I enjoyed the letters describing her. It's just not always do I find books with stories coming directly from Harriet Tubman herself."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"How does an illiterate escaped slave, Harriet Tubman, help 200 more fellow slaves escape their plight from the antebellum southern United States? After reading this biography by her friend Sarah Bradford, I'd say she gives God all the credit. Her Christian faith is very prominent and unashamed, which is a shock to this reader 150 years later, but much appreciated. Bradford wrote the book to raise funds for Harriet's ministry in her old age, providing a rest home for aged former slaves. Regarding Tubman's faith, Bradford writes,Harriet's religious character I have not yet touched upon. Brought up by parents possessed of strong faith in God, she had never known the time, I imagine, when she did not trust Him, and cling to Him, with an all-abiding confidence. She seemed ever to feel the Divine Presence near, and she talked with God \\"as a man talketh with his friend.\\" Hers was not the religion of a morning and evening prayer at stated times, but when she felt a need, she simply told God of it, and trusted Him to set the matter right. p. 14Tubman's faith is real and gritty. She doesn't stop at letting us know that not only did she pray for her owner's conversion but also for his death, so that his wickedness against here and her family would end. God responded to the latter prayer!...all I could say was, 'Oh, Lord, convert ole master.' Den I heard dat as soon as I was able to move I was to be sent with my brudders, in the chain-gang to de far South. Then I changed my prayer, and I said, 'Lord, if you ain't never going to change dat man's heart, -kill him-, Lord, and take him out of de way, so he won't do no more mischief.' Next ting I heard ole master was dead; and he died just as he had lived, a wicked, bad man. p.14The genocidal cancer of slavery was malignant and could not be confined to slave states, which resulted in the federal law, the Fugitive Slave Act which allowed slave catchers to head into free states to reclaim escaped human beings. Tubman had to conduct her escapees a couple hundred miles farther north into Canada to assure their freedom....she brought her people to what was then their land of Canaan; the State of New York. But alas! this State did not continue to be their refuge. For in 1850, I think, the Fugitive Slave Law was put in force, which bound the people north of Mason and Dixon's line, to return to bondage any fugitive found in their territories. \\"After that,\\" said Harriet, \\"I wouldn't trust Uncle Sam wid my people no longer, but I brought 'em all clar off to Canada.\\" p.22Life in southern slave states was not the libertarian ideal some people I know claim it to be. The examples are abundant, but I keep finding new ones. One man was condemned to prison for possessing the most popular work of fiction in those times.They met at the house of Sam Green, the man who was afterwards sent to prison for ten years for having a copy of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" in his house. p. 23Slaves had no right to privacy, so their letters were previewed by whites to protect their \\"property\\".Jacob was not allowed to have his letters in those days, until the self-elected inspectors of correspondence had had the perusal of them, and consulted over their secret meaning. These wise-acres therefore assembled, wiped their glasses carefully, put them on, and proceeded to examine this suspicious document. What it meant they could not imagine. p. 34This mindset of slaves as property and not as fellow humans led to ridiculous assumptions about their fellow creatures, such as they did not care about the separation of their families.I have often heard it said by Southern people that \\"ni**ers had no feeling; they did not care when their children were taken from them.\\" I have seen enough of them to know that their love for their offspring is quite equal to that of the \\"superior race,\\" and it is enough to hear the tale of Harriet's endurance and self-sacrifice to rescue her brothers and sisters, to convince one that a heart, truer and more loving than that of many a white woman, dwelt in her bosom. p. 37Everyone Tubman liberated remained liberated and were never recaptured.... of the three hundred and more fugitives whom Harriet piloted from slavery, not one was ever recaptured, though all the cunning and skill of white men, backed by offered rewards of large sums of money, were brought into requisition for their recovery. p. 25Harriet Tubman later volunteered for the federal forces in the American Civil War as a nurse, a liaison to slaves bewildered by the invading forces, and as a spy. This 2nd hand account Bradford records while trying to retain the flavor of the local dialect...Den I heard 'twas de Yankee ship firin' out de big eggs, an dey had come to set us free. Den I praise de Lord. He come an' put he little finger in de work, an de Sesh Buckra all go; and de birds stop flyin', and de rabens stop cryin', an' when I go to catch a fish to eat wid my rice, dey's no fish dar. De Lord A'mighty 'd come and frightened 'em all out of de waters. Oh! Praise de Lord! I'd prayed seventy-three years, an' now he's come an' we's all free.\\" p. 56The irony of Tubman's life is that she should have been born free, but since slaves had no rights the neglect of their owner's wills was not uncommon, see the earlier book response to Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.In 1849 the young man died, and the slaves were to be sold, though previously set free by an old will. p. 58Some Christian writers in today's dialogs over human rights claim that there is nothing in the Bible to use to argue against slavery. I don't think that is true, but I also like to hear about the Christians who found plenty in their faith to risk their lives and livelihoods to rescue slaves and oppose slavery. One person I haven't hear of before is Thomas Garrett, and what a mighty work he did. \\"She became known to Thomas Garrett, the large-hearted Quaker of Wilmington, who has aided the escape of three thousand fugitives...\\" p. 59Recently, on Facebook, I was telling a pro-choice friend that my heros are the abolitionists, because they helped convince their nation that darker skin nor African genes did not affect the humanity, nor the human rights, of their neighbor, the slave. Slavery is still an awful issue today, please learn more from Love146, it's an agreed upon evil by most of society but still perpetuated."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"The book made me realize that enyone can do anything they wish.

This reads like a primary source:so the style is very different from what it would be in a book published today.Reading this book should be a must for Black History Month coming up.I was so impressed with how I got swept up in the life of Harriet Tubman and the many lives she touched. The Underground Railroad has always been one of the GREAT Stories in American History. The LAWS had not changed during pre-CivilWar Era... so brave Americans of conscience took it upon themselves to make a difference for their fellow human beings who were in chains.I love the song lyrics. I love the details. With reading one gets a sense of what it took for a slave to risk a flight for freedom. The risk. The deprivation. Tubman used opium to keep the young children quiet during the long nights...I gained a deeper sense of appreciation for the courage of individuals who took huge risks to help others along the stations of the Underground Railroad because if they had been found out... they could lose their own freedom. One Quaker went to jail for 10years rather than stop his work to help slaves escape to freedom.Favorite section...a crossing of Niagara Falls to get to Canada after passage of Fugitive Slave Act in 1850.Imagine this for a slave who had never been more than a few miles from the plantation where she/he was born.Tubman had to be a spiritual leader as well as a guide. And her spiritual faith never waivered.I used to wonder HOW she did all she did against such odds. Her survival through a horrific childhood in slavery and her strong faith saw her through.Her heart and generosity were unfailing.I was constantly asking myself... would I have had such courage?"},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"Too much repetition in the book for me.

Sarah Bradford's account of this courageous woman is revealing not only because it was written during Harriet Tubman's time (thereby showing some of the abolitionist sentiment of this period), but also because it contains Harriet Tubman's views on Harriet Tubman. Harriet's perspective of her own life is a deeply spiritual one--and the spiritual panoramic begins from her birth to old age, the common thread being her faith in God, her unshakable vision of freedom, and her consuming desire to see the freedom of others come to pass. Her courage, her incredible faith in God, her selflessness and sacrifice, her almost brutal determination, and her demonstrated love for others will bring those who read this book into a deep self-examination. &quot;Harriet Tubman&quot; is a transforming book that I will read over and over. I recommend this book for all ages, and for anyone doing indepth research on Tubman's roles as an Underground Railroad conductor and abolitionist, Civil War nurse, soldier,and spy. Many thanks to the publishers for making this classic available for this generation."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"A very informative book. Prior to reading this book, I had assumed Mrs. Tubman took her people to the North, the land of \\"Freedom\\". I was wrong, Mrs. Tubman had to take her people all the way to Canada, to be free. In the North, with the passage of the fugitive slave act, Harriett Tubman knew her people would/and could be 'captured' by Northern slave catches, ( who frequently captured free African-Americans as well) and sold them back into slavery) Traveling at night, hiding in the swamps, carring laudnum to keep the crying babies from crying and giving them away, and a pistol for safety, and risking her very life should she be captured.I regret there was never more recorded history on Harriett Tubman. Her bravery, and heroism are awe inspiring. She risked her life 19 times, to save her people, and bring them to Canada, for Canada was the end of the Undergound Railroad.Mrs. Tubman serves as a true American Hero, that went far beyond and above, what the vast majority of us would do.I take my hat off to you, Mrs Tubman. God Bless you."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"I thought that this book was great. I enjoyed that it was written by someone in Harriet's time, except that some of the terminolgy is confusing. If you read this book, you will learn a lot about Harriet, and her adventures, but remember the dictionary!"},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"In 1868 after the war Harriet Tubman was induced to dictate her autobiography. In the various editions the story changed, becoming more militant over the years. She also needed the funds from the sale of the book.Tubman was and is a great American hero. That can not be denied. But with the exception of a few newspaper articles, a few letters and this book, much of what we know about her has been passed from one author to another, each changing or embellishing the story as she or he saw fit.Unfortunately there are some exaggerations, and or glaring mistakes in this book. Being that she was illiterate it could be that the story was just told wrong. I would hope so.The Combahee River Raid during the American Civil War is a good example of the problems with her story.While the raid did take place historians to this day have no documented proof of exactly what her role was and how extensive her involvement in the planning. Unfortunately the reports by the Union commanders are missing. In addition certain parts of the narrative, which are presented as fact, simply didn't happen. The raid never came within five miles by water of the railroad. Only private buildings, farms, plantations, mills were burnt or destroyed. No governmental supply depots were even in the area. Unfortunately this brings into question of what really did happen.What we do know is she was on the raid, she had a major role in the raid. Most importantly over 750 slaves were freed. Many of these freed slaves eventually did serve in the Union cause.A good story, but don't take all of the facts for fact before you really do your homework."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"Harriet Tubman was respected among white, black, soldier, politician, and a variety of church leaders. It was surprising to see references to a near psychic ability secondary to a severe head injury that allowed Ms. Tubman to choose the path less traveled to freedom for her charges. Her entire life was spent serving others with nothing more than hart work and an innocent faith in others to support her efforts."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"From childhood until adulthood I have heard the story of Harriet Tubman, however I now feel like I know the true story.

Some pictures are helpful to the story. Enjoyed. Wish there was more well written about Harriet."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"This book is fantastic. It's the best free book I've read so far. It's a short read.There is a distinct correlation between Tubman's childhood problems and who she eventually came to be. Had Harriot not experience the hardships she endured when she was young, she never could become the tough warrior that she did. Mentally and physically stronger than any male slave she lead to freedom, Tubman escaped detection and capture. Nobody knew who she was or what she looked like. The slave owners only knew her as \\"that ghost woman\\" who, once sighted at a distance, would cause their slaves to disappear within a few days. Knowing that the plantation owners read all slave mail before delivering it to them, Tubman used codes and secret messages to communicate her intentions. She created a series of safe houses from the south to the north to protect the escaping slaves on their journey north. When a slave had grown tired of wandering through the night wilderness, and he threatened to return to the plantation, Tubman pulled a pistol from her dress and threatened to kill him where he stood. She admitted later in life that she would have killed him to prevent him from disclosing her identity as well as her underground railroad.I'm keeping this book in my Kindle so I can read it again and again."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Moses of her people","review":"I read this book on my Kindle as a free download.

I got the book because I was always curious about her. She truly was an amazing, godly woman. She had absolute trust in God to help her and her faith was inspiring. I believe she was extremely brave but SHE probably wouldn't have described herself that way. She would have said it was God that did it all. But, she had to agree to do it and I do not believe many could or would have done what she did. Or we would be reading about them as well! The writing is old-fashioned and kind of in a voice and style that Harriet would have spoken in sometimes. I must say I more than enjoyed the book; I loved it!

Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take THE LONELY MEN for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed THE LONELY MEN, a Sackett tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. Tell Sackett is tricked into a dangerous venture in Apache-held country. He and his friends find much more than they bargain for. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"This book offers the adventures of six feet three inch William Tell Sackett in the mid-1870's in the borderlands of southern Arizona Territory and eastern Sonora. He and three other 'lonely men', who banded together in Yuma, continue to ride together from Tucson into eastern Sonora and the Sierra Mountain stronghold of rancherias of the Apaches. At least two of the Apaches we meet in the book, Kahtenny and Toclani, were actual people, with Toclani serving as Apache scout with Captain Emmett Crawford, one of the better Army officers who was later killed in error within the Sierra Madre Mountain strongholds by the Mexican Army.Tell Sackett is trying to locate and return his brother Orrin's son from Apache captivity. Two problems here: Orrin has no son, and the Apaches haven't stolen a son that never existed. Through several week's hard riding and hard living, Sackett and the 3 other men riding with him learn that he is following a lie, so they grab all the white children available from the Apaches, trying then to ride and shoot their way back to Tucson.One of the more standout chapters of this book is Chapter 5; wherein Louis L'Amour shares some of his vast knowledge concerning the desert and how to stay alive in it. Lieutenant L'Amour, during his WWII years, had taught a survival course on just these matters and later in civilian life delighted in just taking off getting lost wandering and living in the desert. So the information shared here is information the reader can count on.Two other important people from real life we meet along the way in this novel are Pete Kitchen and William S. Oury. Kitchen is a legendary pioneer in Arizona Territory never allowing the Apache to chase him out as true of so many other Arizona pioneers, and the 'Apache pin cushions' mentioned by Louis are from true life. And Pete Kitchen's ranch was a famous stopping place along the Tucson to Nogales trail. William Oury had once been a noted Texas Ranger, a pioneer rancher, and was at the time of this story, Tucson's first mayor. As Louis stated in another book, many books could be written on these two men alone.One other fact Louis includes in this book concerns the 'deserted ranchos' scattered in eastern Sonora. The Spanish and Mexican ranchers had been fighting the Apaches for many years before the coming of the Americans, and the fight generally went against them. The Apaches from the time of Mangas Coloradas through Cochise pretty much controlled and owned this eastern Sonora area. The Mexican Army early on from the mid-1700's had established what they called \\"presidios\\" or 'bastions of the Spanish borderlands' which were many times themselves also wiped out by the roaming, raiding Apache war parties. The extreme desolation mentioned by L'Amour in his writing in The Lonely Men is quite accurate to the time and place.This is a rather good read with much historical accuracy included, just the discussions of the Shoo-Fly Restaurant operated by Mrs Wallen in Tucson is portrayed exactly as it would have appeared circa 1869. So read and enjoy but also learn some history in this book by the very talented Louis L'Amour."},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"Orrin Sackett's treacherous wife sends Tell Sackett on a false rescue mission. He and three of his drifter friends pursue the elusive Apache to save Orrin's kidnapped child.This is a basic white men vs. Apache tale. There are plot twists the reader can easily see coming. The action is fast and violent. The writing is colorful. Tell Sackett's first person narrative rambles in places, but that adds to the Western aura. One can almost visualize Tell weaving engrossing tales to listeners around a crackling campfire. There is irony in men facing suffering and death because of loneliness and a woman's deceit. The &quot;Lonely Men&quot; of the title refers to the four men who band together because they have nothing else of meaning in their lives. The Apaches are portrayed as fierce killers, but also as honorable men who respect a worthy enemy.Louis L'Amour instills new life into the familiar elements of the Western story. His novels and stories stress character and atmosphere over the routine plot elements of &quot;a man, a horse, and a gun.&quot; As with many of his novels, this book serves the purpose of good, lightweight reading. It doesn't require in-depth analysis to get the point. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"I have read all but 4 of Mr. L'Amour's (that doesn't include his short stories) and I have to admit this is not his best book but still is earns 5 stars in my opinion.

But then all is not as it seems and their could be more against him than just the Apaches!

I found this story to be more complex with more plot twists than many of the other L'Amour westerns I've read. Very much worth reading.If there is one complaint I have about this story it's that the main character escapes from certain death so many times that it was unrealistic."},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"I now have most of this author's books as I collect these. They are one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"Two features stand out about this book. One, human nature is the same now as it was in the old West. Two, like L'Amour I am fascinated with the era when the West was being explored and settled. The adventurers who carved civilization out of the wilderness were a commendable stock. Going back to the first feature, this book centers around a manipulative woman who is ruthless in the way she sets up other people for destruction. She plots the deaths of the lead character and 3 of his fellow cowpokes. The acknowledgment of bravery and mutual respect between Tell Sackett and Kahtenny, a leader of the Apaches is a secondary theme. In more than one espisode the two help each other even though they are techincally on opposing sides. This story helps demonstrate how there are various forms of knowledge. Tell Sackett talks of reading the desert like other people read books. Things such as tracks, flora, rock formations all have meaning for the astute observer. The weakness in this and other L'Amour books is the way he disregards the Christian way of life. His character saw it as something to be taken lightly. For Christians it is the only thing that gives meaning to life."},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"Over the years I have read all, and posess all, of Louis L'Mour's books.

I'm just an honest, hard-working mountain boy with strong family roots, but I could swear as sure as I'm standing here that Mr. L'Amour's narration jumps from first person to third person without warning or explanation in Chapters 2 and 10.

Needless to say this story is full of Loius' fabulous Western prose and development of multiple story lines. Highly recommend for those Western buffs who enjoy a good yarn while driving .Very typical of the Sackett series that Louis constructed."},{"Title":"Lonely Men, The","review":"L'Amour does it again! This short quick read will have you turning the pages eating up this tale of story of deceit, bravery and the love of family. The Sackett family proves their roughness as they make friends along the way in the far Outwest. Having lived in the area of the story, I fell in love with the vivid imagery as I followed the Sackett gang on their adventure South of the US border.This was another example of L'amour pitting good against evil.

Before this, I read Waley's translations of \\"The Analects of Confucius\\" and the \\"Tao Te Ching\\". These were good but they left me with more questions than answers and they were a good deal drier in their approaches.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"It's easy to give short shrift to a book that hopes to summarize three major traditions of philosophy in just over 200 pages. What makes this brilliant is Waley's assembling views of Daoist, Confucist and Realist thinking in the form of imaginary colloquia between the various philosophers.The result is an introduction, for the Western reader, to the rich and highly conflicted intellectual background of Chinese civilization.As China becomes more of a world power, this little book, even without mention of Maoist thought and legacy will remain a good, short introduction to the foundations of that world.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy.

It was the first time I read about women in Canada that had a realistic feel without any stereotypical canadiana themes. The various short stories portray people with whom the reader can identify because they are presented as women dealing with many of the problems our society presents today, like divorce and its ramifications.

It gives a clear, concise road map to have a highly productive and motivated workforce.Greg Blencoe divides his book into eight main parts to discuss eight important issues within a related chapter. He also summarizes these issues end of each chapter as following:1. Surround yourself with high quality employees: Just as a chef needs high quality ingredients to make a great meal, a manager needs high quality employees to give customers a great product. Who do you have around you?2. Replace unproductive employees: Remove unproductive employees from your organization or they will be the seed of your destruction.3. Understand that all motivation stems from self-interest: Employees are motivated by:- Money;-Being part of a high quality organization;- Establishing their individual importance and receiving respect from others within the organization;- Doing enjoyable and fulfilling work.4. Tell employees what you expect of them, then don't micromanage: Let employees know what needs to be done and then get out of their way. Don't be a micromanager unless you want microprofits.5. Give praise instead of criticism: Praise is like putting water on a plant. Criticism is like putting acid on a plant. Will your employee morale and motivation blossom or wilt?6. Issue instructions in a respectful manner: Employees will be much more motivated if tasks are assigned in a respectful manner. Got it, drill sergeant?7. Listen to employees: Right now, each one of your employees is probably unhappy about something regarding work and has ideas about how to improve the business. Go listen to them.8. Implement a profit sharing program: If you want your employees to think and act like entrepreneurs, implement a profit sharing program.Finally, as conclusion, he says that &quot;What should you do now? Quite simply, you should put these ideas into practice. Since you likely have a manager yourself, however, there will be times when you will not have the power to do everything you want. For example, your manager may not allow you to hire who you want if the prospective employee demands a high salary. Even though you may be right to want to spend more on your top candidate, you will have to settle for somebody else. When your choices are limited, just do the best you can with the resources you've been given. That's all you can ever ask of yourself&quot; (pp.107-108).Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Be an Effective Manager: A Basic Guide to Maximizing Employee Morale, Motivation, and Productivity","review":"I would have rated this book another \\"Star\\" had Blencoe developed his ideas in much greater depth. (I hope he does so in another book at some later date.) This really is a \\"basic guide\\" and, as such, well-written. Blencoe does not claim to provide more than guidelines to \\"maximizing employee morale, motivation, and productivity.\\" The guidelines are sound, obviously based on a wealth of real-world experience which Blencoe has accumulated. The material is organized within seven chapters, each of which develops a key (albeit obvious) point: Surround yourself with high quality employees; replace unproductive employees; understand that all motivation stems from self-interest; tell employees what you expect of them, then don't micromanage; give praise instead of criticism [Note: My own opinion is that all praise should be expressed in public but that all constructive criticism should be expressed only in private.]; issue instructions in a respectful manner; and listen to employees. Blencoe then provides a \\"Bonus Chapter for High-Level Managers\\" in which he explains the importance of implementing a profit sharing program. He then offers a brief, heart-felt Conclusion in which he suggests that \\"When your choices are limited, just do the best you can with the resources available. That's all you can ever ask of yourself.\\"What we have here is a primer rather than a full-length book such as any of Peter Drucker's or even a manual such as Rex P. Gatto's The Smart Manager's F.A.Q. Guide: A Survival Guide for Today's Workplace or Milgram, Spector, and Treger's Managing Smart: 325 High-Performance Tips Every Manager Must Know. For whom will Blencoe's book be most valuable? My own opinion is that it would be of greatest benefit to those who are about to assume responsibilty for supervising others or who have only recently done so. I strongly urge those who supervise them either to provide a copy or require them to obtain one, have them read it, and then meet with them to discuss each of the seven aforementioned key points. My own extensive experience with inexperienced managers has convinced me that (a) they are under-prepared to supervise others effectively, and (b) the most effective managers at all levels throughout any organization are also those who are most effective in supporting their own supervisors.So, if you are one of those relatively inexperienced managers, buy Blencoe's book. If you have relatively inexperienced managers reporting to you, buy a copy for each, then meet with them and discuss it. My personal preference is what I call an on-site \\"brown bag seminar.\\" The group discussion would focus on each of Blencoe's seven key points. The supervisor who leads the discussion should only ask questions, resisting the temptation to \\"explain\\" and/or reminisce. Blencoe encourages all of his readers to contact him directly at an e-mail address provided on the book's last page. He and I both agree with Ken Blanchard: \\"Feedback is the breakfast food of champions.\\""},{"Title":"How to Be an Effective Manager: A Basic Guide to Maximizing Employee Morale, Motivation, and Productivity","review":"I just finished How To Be An Effective Manager by Greg Blencoe and while simply written, it certainly makes a point.

Most family companies that I have seen have no plan for the businesss. It just sort of happens. Especially when the businesses get to the point where they need some managerial experience (either by hiring within the company or from outside sources). By reading and implementing the suggestions of the book, family businesses could run much smoother.I would also suggest that new managers in general would benefit as well.

Although it is over a hundred pages long, it is printed in large type and the 8 chapters seem to average about 12 short paragraphs each.It is important to make sure you fit the target audience for this booklet or you will be very disappointed. I wish the author had been more explicit (e.g. in the subtitle) about his target audience as the grand title is misleading. The booklet is way too simplistic for those with significant management experience, those who have a management degree, and those who regularly read management books. Those who may find the booklet most useful are young readers just starting in a management or supervisory role, especially those that supervise young (e.g. high school age) employees. Also, it may be good for a small business owner to give to its young management trainees as a starting point for discussions on the management role. However, those serious about management effectiveness as a career should look elsewhere (e.g. Peter Drucker).The advice given is overly simplistic, but generally good. How can you argue with chapter topics like \\"hire talented employees\\", \\"don't micromanage\\", \\"give praise instead of criticism\\", and \\"listen to employees\\". However, some of the advice is definitely not appropriate for managers of college educated or \\"knowledge\\" workers. As an example, the author's statement that \\"Money is the primary motivation for working\\" may be true for high school students at McDonalds, but it is definitely NOT true for knowledge workers in general. I was disappointed the author never makes this distinction.The following sample statements will give you taste of the author's style and tone: \\"you should always treat employees with respect saying \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\"; \\"Most employees will straighten out once you get a little tough with them.\\"; and \\"Managers should also listen to employees in order to get ideas about how to improve the business.\\"Finally, the \\"Bonus Chapter for High Level Managers\\" which discusses the benefits of profit sharing plans just doesn't seem to fit. Such \\"High Level Managers\\" (a term which implies an organization large enough to have a management hierarchy) should be reading management books with ideas way beyond the simplistic ones in this booklet. If you're a manager with authority to institute a profit sharing plan and you find this booklet useful, something is amiss. For such high level managers, the book rates way below 3 stars.[feedback welcome]"},{"Title":"How to Be an Effective Manager: A Basic Guide to Maximizing Employee Morale, Motivation, and Productivity","review":"The formula for being an effective manager is simple. Hire the very best people, give them interesting work and then stay out of their way as much as possible. Advice that is so simple, so well-known, so true and so ignored. Blencoe is yet another voice added to the list of people who raise these issues. In that sense, there is not much that is new in the book. Nevertheless, it is well worth reading, or perhaps even better, a good gift for your supervisor.It continues to amaze me how many managers seem to think that adding more rigorous controls to workers will right performance issues. I have seen companies implement rules where workers were required to account for their activities in fifteen minute intervals. Of course, all that did was require them to spend over fifteen minutes each day or one minute out of every 32, filling out the form. To say nothing of the nearly full-time activity of another worker whose task it was to read all the daily reports, distill them and pass this important information along. Needless to say this was one plan for increased productivity that had the opposite result. Blencoe's strategy is to refute such silliness, which along with the other suggestions, reveals the possession of a great deal of sensible thought.I cannot say that this book contains any dramatic new insights. However, few books do.

But if you've been in a corporate environment, you probably know these facts from corporate training courses, and need more depth of information. For example, if you are firing an employee, there are things that you must do in a corporate setting that are more complicated and structured, due to the corporate guidelines you have to follow.What's really great about Blencoe's book is that it can be grasped by anyone and the techniques apply across any industry, whether it is fast food, an auto body shop, or a small computer store. This book should be on the shelf of every small business owner to give to the managers. So many family owned companies and small companies \\"just grow\\" and fail to provide good management training.

He experienced hierarchical methods of organizational direction in a large business with governmental customers. And he encountered such methods in the local church where they were characterized by manifestations of \\"ego, power and privilege - as well as men's timidity, passivity, and acquiescence in responsibility.\\"A primary value of \\"Eldership in Action\\" is its practicality. Dick provides practical guidance for efficient conduct of meetings, determining vision, mission, and strategic planning, delegation, reporting and accountability, communication among leadership and with the congregation, confidentiality, emergency decisions, and terminology which reinforces Biblical truths; and the like.In dealing with an elder council as a corporate body, \\"Eldership in Action\\" is an excellent complement to \\"Biblical Eldership\\" by Alexander Strauch, which focuses on the personal attributes and conduct of individual elders. Both books are of value, not only for present elders, but in the training of elder candidates."},{"Title":"Eldership in Action: Through Biblical Governance of the Church","review":"Our church (a large one) has been moving from a Sr. Pastor model of church leadership to an Elder-Led model. This book has turned out to be a gold mine of practical information for us! From the biblical basis for multiple leadership, to how elders are to function, to how staff and elders relate--this book covers many of those difficult issues an elder-led church must deal with.I would highly recommend this book whether you are already functioning under an elder-led model, or whether you are reconsidering your current structure. This book challenges the prevailing thinking regarding church leadership, giving us a more biblical alternative to the common Sr. Pastor model."},{"Title":"Eldership in Action: Through Biblical Governance of the Church","review":"This book is a valuable addition to the study of the pastoral leadership of the church. Where a book such as Strauch's \\"Biblical Eldership\\" provides the necessary doctrinal foundation of church leadership, Swartley builds on that foundation and gives us incredibly helpful insights regarding the nuts and bolts of 'eldering.' We benefit from the author's experience and wisdom.He covers all of the topics that one would expect in this kind of book, such as the processes for selecting and appointing elders, the make up of the elder council, interaction with the rest of the congregation, the necessity of prayer, effective council meetings, church discipline, confidentiality, etc. Along the way, he also discusses some key issues that church elders will appreciate. For instance, he clarifies the relationship between the terms elder and pastor, reminding us that all elders are pastors, but not all pastors are elders. This is helpful because we tend to equate the two. He also---more than once---gives strong warning regarding the danger of distinguishing one elder as 'the pastor,' showing how this undermines a true biblical eldership, and has no scriptural basis.I appreciated Swartley's wisdom on the benefits of team teaching/preaching. This model perfectly fits the concept of the church being pastored by a team of elders, and I'm pleased to see significant attention paid to it. He criticizes the use of Robert's Rules of Order, and shows a much healthier way of elders interacting that fosters consensus rather than politicking. Swartley advocates a middle ground between the rule of the majority and absolute unanimity. He values consensus, but warns against the possibility of decisions being determined, in a sense, by the lone holdout. His thinking has merit, but is challenging to those trained to hold unanimous consensus as almost sacred in elder deliberations. He also cautions regarding potential groupthink, where harmonizing with one's fellow elders can become more important than what is actually right (and wrong).Swartley also has an interesting proposal concerning having a designated leadership team drawn from the elders of a council that has grown too large to efficiently lead as a whole. As with any book that includes practical insights and suggestions, readers may not agree with every idea but will gain from thinking through and responding to them. He also includes a lot of helpful, practical thinking on the need for councils to be proactive rather than simply reactionary, to intentionally provide opportunities for fellowship among elders, how to delegate effectively, the process of making proposals, etc.Leaders of larger churches with paid staffs (or churches who hope to grow to that point) will want to carefully read Swartley's thoughts on the subtle danger of dividing the staff from both the elders and the church's volunteers. The staff can too easily become the actual, active leadership of the church, with the elders serving merely as a type of trustee board. Elders must be actual pastors and leaders, and the author emphasizes this repeatedly.This is an excellent resource, and I think any church seeking to wisely implement a truly biblical eldership will find this both challenging and edifying. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Eldership in Action: Through Biblical Governance of the Church","review":"It seems like your wife and your son and his wife being so kind to you, but the truth is that your book is not interesting and it is a waste of time.

The book tackles a lot of big subjects under the heading of &quot;nothing&quot; and tries to prove that what Cole refers to as &quot;nothing&quot; is really where everything in the universe comes from. And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the &quot;nothing is everything&quot; theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited. They may be more concise."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"K.C. Cole's previous books gave the non-scientific reader a delicious taste of what physics is all about. This time she has provided a multicourse meal, cleverly cooked up out of nothing at all.Building on a foundation of nothing, she constructs the multifaceted story of what scientists know about the universe today. She even takes you to the universe inside the brain to show how nothing matters in there just as much as nothing matters out in space. Understanding nothing is also the essence of understanding matter and mathematics.Nobody expresses herself in print more clearly about these things. Cole gracefully skates over the surface of nothing, poking holes in it here and there to reveal all the something that nothing conceals. In some places she gets pretty deep; in some places she skates right to the edge of scientific knowledge. It is a very up to date book.She does like to make a lot of nothing puns, but that is after all what the book is about. As for critics who suggest that only scientists should write about science, that's like saying only football players should be allowed to announce the Super Bowl. Doing science and explaining science are too different things, and for the general reader, nobody does the latter better than K.C. Cole."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This highly unusual book presents an utterly engaging and easily comprehended discussion of many of the latest developments in modern physics.K. C. Cole explains how the apparent emptiness of space between stars and galaxies - which she calls \\"Nothing,\\" must contain something that completes the equations of modern physics. Nothing also exerts a powerful force. The universe is expanding at an accelerating pace. There is no way to explain this expansion without resorting to a \\"hidden factor\\" that produces the acceleration, and Nothing fits perfectly in this gap. (I prefer to capitalize Nothing but Cole leaves it in lower case, which often produces startling and humorous statements.)\\"I hope to convince the reader that nothing matters. Most of modern physics and mathematics would be unthinkable without it. The human mind we use to perceive and explore those worlds relies on notions of \\"nothing\\" in very tangible ways - creating something out of nothing as handily as it does the reverse.\\" (p. xi)\\"Space isn't empty; what we think of as empty space is permeated by powerful influences. Indeed, matter itself is only the energetic geometry of forces in empty space.\\" (p. 69)While most readers untrained in science would expect to not understand much in a book that explores advanced theories of physics, nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to this book. Cole has a gift for explaining complex theories in simple terms and images.Cole gives brief acknowledgement to the overlaps of transpersonal awarenesses and modern physics - as in Buddhist awareness of emptiness.Cole presents her discussion in little bytes, punctuated with quotes from physicists that counterpoint Nothing in particular.My only criticism of this gem: While a substantial list of references is provided, many quotes and points of discussion are presented without references."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"What if, someday soon, physicists discover the equations that explain all of creation, but nobody else can understand them? We are very close to that point now--the incomprehensibility of physics' leading edge, not the ultimate equations. Even the best science popularizers have trouble transmitting the current state of things to the public.So a book like this is probably inevitable. It is survey of cosmology for curious Sunday newspaper readers. It seems to be a digest of other popularized science books, books that are written for a more educated audience. In fact, quotes from those other books are sprinkled throughout this one, fun-facts style. Which is fine--I grew up on Isaac Asimov's books of science essays.The first few dozen pages about the numeral zero and the &quot;psychology&quot; of nothingness are kind of superfluous, but Cole soon settles down into her main narrative treating cosmology. Her humor is cute or cutesy, depending on your taste or mood. But the analogies she uses, in a subject where the only substitute for analogy is math so rarified it doesn't even use numerals, are quite apposite. She is a little too free in stating that &quot;scientists think&quot; this or &quot;physicists have discovered&quot; that, as many of the theories here have not been totally or even widely accepted. And many of the theories that do hold sway are merely the best of an unpalatable lot, in the currect unsettled state of cosmology.So, if your usual popular science reading includes people like Timothy Ferris, Dennis Overbye, or Rocky Kolb, this book may be a tad superficial for you. But if you want a fast skim of the subject, or if you are coming to it cold, it'll do fine."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"My science background consists of high school chemistry, biology and physics and one college course in physics.

Therefore I much appreciated the reviewerswho provided their backgrounds, particularly the person who said that he (?)was already familiar with the latest concepts in physics, and that thisbook was not for such a person. I will say that I am not very familiar witha lot of modern physics, though I have read a lot on quantum physics and thesupposed parallels with metaphysics. I have not studied relativity and E-mc2quite enough to understand them, but this book helps a lot, at least withthe latter.Overall I would give Ms. Cole a great deal of credit and appreciationfor very clear, intuitive, even profound explanations of most of the topicscovered in the book. She takes on some very hard concepts and makesthem as understandable as just about any book on physics for thelayperson I've read. As other reviewers have written, at times herfragmented writing style is annoying, but to me only when I don't carefor the topic she is discussing, most particularly string theory. Yetthe problem might not be with her explanations, but rather with anyoneattempting to explain subjects that must require a multitude of assumptionsand math that even Ph.D.'s would balk at to comprehend! I give the authora lot of credit for trying to teach the reader to do a kind of spatialthinking required to see the &quot;whole,&quot; by which I mean that science cannotstand alone, verified only by mathematical equations of &quot;objective&quot; reality.Clearly the reality of sub-atomic physics, for example, is weird and ofteninexplicable anyway.Ms. Cole lays a marvelous foundation for discussing how nothing hasbecome certain stage in particle physics. In the first chapter shetries to get the reader simply to ponder what nothing is. Nothingmight be the number 0, or the supposed missing matter related to bigbang cosmology, or the missing neutrinos from the sun, or even the potentialforce of gravity in motionless objects. Nothing is also the fact that allproperties of matter emanate from &quot;nothing,&quot; which as she explains quite wellthroughout the book is the &quot;resurrection&quot; of the ether, which is called thequantum vacuum today. In this excellent first chapter and later the authorreaffirms the unmistakeable parallels between the &quot;nothing&quot; in physics and theno-thing in Eastern religions like Buddhism, the idea that mystics perceivethe ground that underlies all being, and that a person who wants to advancespiritually (and maybe in contemporary physics) must verse him/herself in thevoid to be open/aware of the big picture. This first chapter alone is likea book in itself becase of its wealth of ideas.My other favorite chapter by far is Chapter 4, &quot;Nothing TakesCenter Stage.&quot; We learn that what was proven by Faraday and furthersubstantiated by Einstein and other physicists is that nothing, thevaccum, spacetime, etc,, along with the fields that emanated fromthis nothing, is (to physics) *the* reality. One of the topic headingsin this chapter is &quot;Matter As Metaphor&quot; - again, what counts is notparticles but rather the fields that emanate from the particles andthe spaces between them. I totally enjoyed her explanation of theparticle-antiparticle phenomenom, which I had read before but didn'tunderstand. On p. 82 is an excellent diagram of P. Dirac's explanationof how when a particle is created from nothing (the vacuum), there isa hole (anti-particle) created at the same time. When these two entitiescollide they destroy each other, given by E = 2 * mc2, since thereare 2 particles. I feel Einstein's famous equation can be understoodquite well from a careful read of this chapter.As I mentioned above I did not care for the chapter(s) on stringtheory. I cannot grasp the value of strings, which make protons looklike planets (or larger), and exist in at least eleven dimensions.Until I do further reading on this topic I must wonder if physicistshave taken the amazing discoveries of quantum physics too far in theirreductionist quest for the ultimate &quot;nothing.&quot; And the author herselfstates that there is no one ground in current string theory.The short bios and bibliography at the end are very commendablepoints to recommend the book, and show that the author has made agallant attempt to summarize an amazing variety of books on physicsand other disciplines that (she believes) are related to the topicsshe discusses.I really look forward to reading at least 3 books from thebibliogrpahy and returning to &quot;A Hole In The Universe&quot; tosee how well the author aided my understanding of these topics."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"Having read a few other books about string theory, at first I became a bit impatient with K.C. Cole's gentle easing of the reader along the conceptual path from zero to the generative nothingness of a zero-sum universe. Cole begins with a generous dose of clever musings on the nature of nothing that necessarily leads us to the theory of everything. Throughout the book, Cole's frequent quotes of her colleagues (and familiar figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Sartre) create the sense of an informal conversation that provides the inexperienced reader with a degree of uncommon comfort. The deliberate pace at times frustrated me. I found myself wishing she would stop alluding to the theories that would be explained in later chapters and just explain them.As a teacher, though, I realize that Cole's style is merely evidence of her strength as an educator. She \\"scaffolds\\" the discussion of cosmological theory, providing comprehensible chunks of information that the reader can use to better understand what comes later in the text. By the time Cole gets around to the consideration of the multi-dimensional topology in string theory, the reader is ready.Her style makes this a great book for the non-expert. After reading it, I actually found myself having several conversations with friends and family about theoretical physics. I guess nothing's impossible after all."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"A lot of books try to be about something, but turn out to be about nothing. This book says it's about nothing, which reveals everything. Well, at least something. This book starts from zero and goes nowhere fast. But the concept of zero is very important, as well as very funny for some reason. Or maybe none at all. Nothing itself turns out to be something. For example, sometimes nothing is equilibrium, which is the sum of opposing somethings. Then again, sometimes there's nothing until you look at it. Only then it is something. Or something like that. You would think nothing and emptiness have nothing in common, but it turns out they do have something, and maybe everything. K.C. Cole is a columnist and teacher, and uses those skills to create a book you can read a little or a lot at a time. Wit and a good ear also help move things along. This book goes from zero to the speed of space. It's a fast laugh track around physics, quantum mechanics, string theory--life, the universe and...nothing. Yes, it's everything you ever wanted to know about nothing but were afraid to ask. Lovers of games, paradox and cosmic concepts with everyday implications should find this a relatively painless way to understand why humans makes so much ado about nothing. I can see Einstein and Groucho Marx reading passages to each other and laughing hysterically, while Buddha smiles and nods. To most people physics has been sounding crazier all the time, with its quarks of color and raspberry flavored gluons, as if maybe making the Bomb unhinged them all, so it's worth listening to what a knowledgeable and articulate non-scientist makes of it. Sometimes the metaphors don't quite work, and sometimes such a big universe in such a small space means it simplifies maybe a bit too much. But what we may lose in sophistication we make up in a refreshing respite from scientific self-importance. Besides, it's not easy to express complexities simply--I suspect some of these painless paragraphs cost blood, sweat and tears to write. So if you have zero interest in boring explanations, you'll find this book quite something. Prepare your mind for quite a ride-if you don't get dizzy, you missed something-or maybe nothing. And if you've suspected that science and the absurd are like two parallel lines about to intersect, this book may confirm it. Which is not to say that science is wrong, although it's clear that even now with everything we've learned, we know next to nothing for certain about anything. At one point Cole asks us to imagine the universe as the scum on the surface of a pond. Sounds reasonable to me--pond scum explains a lot. After reading Cole I'm confirmed in my belief that this is the most ridiculous universe I've ever heard."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"K.C. Kole is perhaps not the deepest science writer on the block, but maybe she's deeper than her lighthearted musing sounds at first. After all, what subject could be deeper than the Hole in the Universe? She chose one of the least-represented subjects to write about, and she really covered it well. The subject of &quot;nothing&quot; is something we fall into from time to time. After all, what was there before there was &quot;something?&quot; Who hasn't peered blankly into that void? Science afficionados will quickly realize what we're talking about here: the spontaneous origins of forces from which have sprung such beautiful oddities as String Theory.Don't mistake this book for a Sienfeld episode. This is a book about Nothing, with a capital N. The Nothing from which everything came. My only criticism is that I wanted about another 100 pages to go deeper into the mysteries, but truthfully I suspect that the material is just not there yet. We simply don't know enough yet. But if you're a novice and looking for exposure to the more esoteric beauties of scientific exploration, this book really does take you on a wonderful trip. I fully recommend it. I was going to give it four stars, but I really can't think of a reason why not to give it 5. Kole's style is engaging, witty, and she brings up very thoughtful insights and clues into this journey through Nothing. Five stars it is, then! Jump into the hole in the universe. Let Nothing distract you from everything around you for weeks to come!Shooshie"},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I walked into a local book store and was browsing with no intent to purchase anything. That was before I saw The Hole in the Universe. The book seemed to stand out on the shelve, calling to me. I had decided to purchase it before I even touched it. I have often and long contemplated the idea of nothing. I used to stare at the stars and imagine what the edge of the universe must be like. How could all this something abrubtly end and what would that nothing be like? Needless to say this was the perfect book to bring me up to speed on the state of mainstream physics today.The book is brilliantly written, clear and as simplified as I imagine is possible considering the subject matter. For anyone looking to brush up on thier understanding of the universe, this book is an excellent start.On a personal note, I picked this book up because I am a free energy researcher. I was am looking for holes in the mainstream explanation of the universe that would allow for free energy. There are plenty."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This book has had wonderful and horrible reviews. I will take a middle ground. My main criticism is that it has a certain lack of focus and that some chapters do not correspond to the title. Cole tries to talk about the philosophical Nothing, the physicist's vacuum and the mathematician's zero, mingled with Buddhism. I was tempted to abandon the book after the first few pages feeling betrayed by the subject. Happily, I continued. So, is the book worth reading? Yes. Would the book be a better one with more focus on the main subject? Definitely, yes.I would also appreciate that when the author speaks about \\"nothing\\", either she uses inverted commas or majuscules.There are also a few errors as when in page 201 she indicates that the acceleration due to Dark Energy revved up in the \\"not too distant past\\", which, according to astronomers, is about 5 billion years. However, I discovered some new things and read it through in one weekend. There are good analogies and good citations."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book although a few sections did require skimming and skipping because they were a bit too tedious. The book had a tendency to diverge into tangents. And some tangents were interesting and some were not. For one thing, the coverage on the history of the number zero seemed extremeley tedious. I can see how it relates to the book but I simply had no interest in reading it. Other tangents were more interesting. I really enjoyed the ones that described the inconsistencies in human perception and how it's easier for us to notice the presence of something than the absence of something. Also, it described links between quantum physics and Buddhism as well as delving into oddities like strange disorders where people who have lost a limb still feel as though it is there. *phantom limbs*..oooh spooky! :P The book didn't just focus on the scientific zero, it explored many aspects of zero. Some were appealing and some were not.The scientific portion of the book was fairly good :) The explanations were clear enough and the analogies were helpful in understanding stuff. Generally speaking, the book focuses on how the universe began (out of nothing) and how it will end. Perhaps, my favourite part was its theoretical dive into what happened before the big bang. It does an excellent job in explaining all the recent developments in science (the book was published 2001) from super string theory to the connections between space and time (the classic space-time fabric). Worth noting is the description of the creation of something (anti particle and particle) out of nothing. And how nothing is actually something and we only perceive it as nothing because nothing changes. And of course, the 'frozen' vacuum that we live in today. Frozen so we can recognize different forces and particles and melted before as one blob of nothing (pre-bigbang). It's twisted but the book gives you an edgy grasp to a very edgy piece of science.The book speculates and questions and drags you in along with it :). So many questions still remain, from what triggered the big bang to what kept anti-matter and matter from anihilating each other to whether our universe was accident or formula. It questions whether we need to remodel our understanding of the universe. Just as Einstein changed the view of the universe with his conception of spacetime, perhaps we need another Einstein to come along and change our view of the universe and replace it with something even more bizarre and inexplicable than before.I will complain of the cryptic table of contents. The author uses metaphorical and 'witty' chapter titles which are nice and pretty but they tell you nothing of what the chapter is about. It can be really frustrating! It takes away the wonderful freedom of jumping around to sections of interest but the book is worth skimming. Skip sections that aren't interesting but read some sections because they are truly enlightening :)The book also has many quotes nicely dispersed throughout. Quotes are fun :) The book even contains a few cheesie jokes (Bills, Monicas and puns)"},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"It took 2-3 chapters to get past cutesy &quot;nothing&quot; garbage. The whole &quot;nothing&quot; thing was very annoying. Too much &quot;more on this later&quot;, and a lot of irrelevant stuff as well. If you thought this book would be interesting you've probably already read better coverage of most of what's in it. Get Brian Greene's book, or read it again if you already have it. I suspect K.C. had more fun researching it than anyone will have reading it."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This book is another from the wave of books that popularize theorethical physics, mainly string theory, and cosmology. It does a good job, as good as any other. The book suposedly concentrates on the role &quot;nothing&quot; plays out in the universe. Of course this is tricky buisness, and a definition escapes Cole- &quot;perfect symmetry&quot; is as close as one will get. Of course, the big picture is that there is no such thing as a &quot;nothing&quot;, but maybe there is &quot;nothingness&quot;, or lack of change, supersymetry. But the notion is confusingly refered to as many things, space-time, vacums, subjective limits, and at the end the whole buisiness is rather mixed up. So it could be argued that no new insights, or theories are advanced, and the book is just about a popular account of far-out physics and cosmology.Maybe a little more quantum physics would have been welcome. For example, at a point, the author says something in the lines of the universe being defined by our perceptions, or in other words, raises the old observation problem. Now this should either have been explored, or taken to a logical conclusion: we define &quot;nothing&quot; subjectively. But this seems not to be consistent with the rest of the book, so maybe the author could have explained no-collapse (so no observation problem) interpretations of quantum physics. But string theory takes the spotlight, and here too, one would swiftly notice that &quot;nothing&quot; cannot exist in a universe composed out of strings, scince all is strings, and it is meaningless to assume a &quot;nothing&quot; by definition stringless. But these considerations are left aside to build on the story.But of course, there can be no ending to the story, at least not yet. There are some big problems still to solve in the physics framework, and the author points this out. For example, quantum gravity, the cosmological constant, and the quantum-relativity theory inconsistencies still elude the brightest minds in the planet. But as the author points out, it all points to whatever this &quot;nothing&quot; is, because clearly the interesting &quot;nothing&quot; is something after all.The book is actually pretty complete. It goes from mathemathical notions of &quot;nothing&quot;, to physics, cosmology, particle physics, superstring, some psychology, and builds an informative review of some of the most impressive, and of course, weird, scientific modern theories. If anything, the constant &quot;nothing&quot; puns become anoying after a while. So nothing in the book is quite central. And it seems scientists are about to make some still more incresible discoveries in the coming years. But thats what physics is all about these days. There is nothing to it."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I found this book amazingly easy and fascinating. The author explains &quot;Nothing&quot; quite compellingly.This book went from &quot;zero&quot;, to black holes, to vacua, to quarks, matter and anti-matter......my head was spinning. Sometimes the ideas were so huge, I would have to put the book down for a week before I could take it anymore.After reading this book my interest in cosmology and quantum physics has quadrupled and I am now reading Stephen Hawkings A Brief History of Time and I am understanding it and enjoying it.For those of you who never really understood: E=MC(squared) I highly recommend KC Coles fine book."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This is book is so much fun to read.

You also get to experience here the thrill and creative power at work in the exciting quest for ultimate truths. Nobody writes with such evident joy and command of theoretical physics as does K.C. Cole. And there's no dogma here. The book permits you to dream along with her about what else might be possible in the paradoxical world of nothing.

Isn't that something? If you have meditated for many years and fringed on dharmakaya this book is a delightful dance with that from which everything comes. Ken Wilber too confusing, or too long? K.

Would have liked even more diagrams, and more pictures."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This is a book about \\"nothing\\" inspired by recent discoveries in physics, similar to the one written by Brit physicist John D. Barrow, The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas about the Origins of the Universe (2000). While Barrow devoted several chapters to the history of the concept of zero and the idea of nothing, Cole, while covering much of the same territory, emphasizes recent discoveries about the vacuum and ideas from string and loop theory while her extensive use of quotations gives her book a more journalist feel. Otherwise the books are strikingly similar, even to the typographic use of subheads in capital letters followed by epigram-like quotes from various authors that break up the text. It's almost as if the same person did the layout for both books! Both authors sometimes even use the same examples, e.g., John Cage's \\"musical composition\\" entitled, 4' 33\\" (four minutes and 33 seconds of pure silence). Noteworthy in Cole's book is the interesting material on silence beginning on page 211 and then some examples from the psychology of perception on pages 214-231 with an excursion into the concept of nothing from Zen Buddhism.Cole is a science journalist who writes for the Los Angeles Times and is the author of The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty (1998) and First You Build a Cloud: And Other Reflections on Physics as a Way of Life (1999). I enjoyed both books and reviewed the latter favorably for Amazon.com readers, and so it was with pleasant anticipation the I began reading The Hole in the Universe, hoping that I would learn more about the bizarre properties of the vacuum than I was to glean from Barrow's excellent book. What I learned was just how difficult the subject really is, and how far removed it is from our common sense notions about the world.I would rate this book higher but sometimes Cole's ready metaphors and analogies run into each other, further obscuring an already dusky subject matter, and there are some slips. She writes on page 251, \\"It's easy to imagine ten dimensions of space because you can just add one on top of the other.\\" (Not for me, at any rate, it isn't.) And there's a bad take on the anthropic principle on page 242. Cole writes. \\"...in a sense, our very perception determines the kind of universe we populate.\\" It's really the other way around: we are created from the stuff of the universe and that stuff determines our perception. It's not even clear that \\"We perceive the only universe we can perceive\\" (also from page 242), because the universe could be a little different and we could still perceive it. Finally, Cole, in discussing the Higgs field, uses the simile, \\"the Higgs field to our universe is like water to a fish--the same everywhere and therefore utterly imperceptible.\\" We can imagine that the fish \\"perceives\\" the water when it touches the sand at the bottom and when it leaps above the surface.These quibbles aside, this is an exciting and stimulating book. Let me share some impressions:First, it is apparent that there is no such thing as nothing, or I should say, nothing is something!Second, the idea that time and space began with the big bang and that there was nothing as a matter of definition beyond the big bang can be discarded. It now seems more likely that our universe is just one of a possible infinity of universes, popping probabilistically out of the vacuum that used to be nothing but is now a bubbling caldron of potential energy.Third, my favorite question, Why is there something rather than nothing? has an easy answer: There is something rather than nothing because there is no such thing as nothing.Fourth, the world of string theory with its eleven dimensions and it ultra tiny strings at the scale of 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, is entirely of the stuff we will never perceive or have any ability to comprehend beyond the report of the equations.Fifth, the old bugaboo about the universe having no beginning or being created from nothing is no longer such a quandary because, One, nothing is something; and Two, nothing has always been here. In other words, the question is answered: the universe (or mega-universe or super-universe, or whatever) had no beginning and is eternal. (God, the creator, is not going to like this, but I'm sure something can be worked out.)Sixth, perhaps, as Cole suggests in the final chapter, a good definition of \\"nothing\\" is perfect symmetry.Finally, I came away from reading this book with the clear sense that the universe exists indefinitely in every direction from the macro to the micro, from the distant past to the distance future. In other words, we exist not as on a darkling plain as the poet Matthew Arnold had it, but in a bubble of space and time smack in the middle of a possible infinity of bubbles, our ability to see in any one \\"direction\\" limited by our senses and our instruments, but enhanced by our ability to reason and extrapolate from evidence, but ultimately stopped cold by our imaginations and the realization of how really tiny is our arena of discernment compared to the incredible vastness gaping away from us in any and all directions. If this realization doesn't make us humble and awestruck, I don't know what will.Incidentally, both Cole and Barrow, while carousing merrily about all sorts of whimsical notions of nothing, failed to acknowledge the \\"god of nothing,\\" that is, the ineffable god of the Vedas about whom nothing can be said: \\"Neti, neti, neti\\"--not this, not this, and not this!--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\""},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe before The Hole in the Universe. No doubt, the scientific depth of Greene's near-masterpiece bolstered my negative reaction to Cole's rather light-weight book. A serious science reader should avoid &quot;Hole&quot;: it is superficial, contains a bizarre digression, and is too clever for its own good. One could argue that Hole's relatively short length is a benefit. Undoubtedly, some short science books are very good. (Short works by Martin Rees, John Barrow, and Paul Davies demonstrate this point.) Hole's short length, however, is not evidence of the author having synthesized mind-bending and mathematically challenging material into clear, tight prose. Hole is so short because it's so superficial. In fact, I would argue that the book is too long. The bizarre digression I mentioned above occurs at the end of the book where Cole discusses how the human brain perceives (or misperceives) the world. The connection to her main subject -- &quot;nothing&quot; -- is tenuous, at best. The only plausible explanation I can come up with for Cole's wierd digression is that it allowed her to briefly discuss two books she likes (one of which -- Phantoms in the Brain -- I have read and was shocked to find mentioned in Hole). Finally, I was extremely annoyed by the clever word play and frequent interruptions in Hole. The word play got old very quickly. Nothing, something, and anything -- yes, these words can create cute sentences when the subject is nothing, but not past the first chapter. Thankfully, the word play decreased after the third or fourth chapter, but my irritation with the author never left me. As for the interruptions, I dislike headers and quotes every 2.5 pages of a book. It gave Hole the feel of a very long Newsweek article. If I could, I would put a sticker on the jacket advertising Hole as a MTV Book Club selection, &quot;catering to short attention spans.&quot; Hole isn't useless, but I didn't find it particularly enlightening. Several contemporary physicists have written popular science books that cover the topic of nothing more deeply and more satisfyingly."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I may not be the right person to review a book like this because I am already familiar with most of the subjects that are addressed here through better popularizations by Greene, Guth, Ganz, Thorne and others. This book is &quot;accessible&quot; as the book jacket promises, but in order to make it easy on its targeted audience the information is so diluted that at the end I was not sure that there was anything new that had not been said elsewhere, nor is it expressed in a way that is particularly original or imaginative. It reads like a long newspaper article - lots of adjectives, lots of enthusiasm, lots of questions, but very little to say. If you are looking for information about string theory, the big bang, the importance of the vacumn, dark matter and energy, etc. this is not the place to start, nor is it a place to pick up any new analogies or metaphors that will help you on your way. This is unfortunate because I believe the author has bravely chosen a subject that desperately needs good interpreters. The problem is that nearly every subject she tackles is very, very difficult. There may be no simple way to explain any of it because so many of these ideas are in rapid development. So little is understood, much less agreed upon, by the very people that originated the ideas discussed in this book. The author must depend on other popularizations for her own understanding. So while the book is sincere and enthusiastic, this reader had no confidence that the author knew what she was talking about.I was left with one strong impression. Science journalists should not try to explain or simplify the ideas. Leave that to scientists in the field and their editors. (There are notorious counter examples to disprove that rule !) Journalists who are non- scientists often more successful when commenting on the personalities and the social conditions in which the ideas are generated. Many years will pass before we get a good book that might begin to &quot;explain&quot; string theory to the layman, and my guess is that this will be done by an active researcher. But I would bet there are a fascinating stories now in plain view as to the political environment which decides at any moment what the &quot;correct&quot; interpretations of any theory are at any time. This is also useful work."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I was hoping for a layman's review of the latest findings in cosmology. Instead I got a completely disorganized mish mash of random quotes from scientists (seemed to be the author's attempt to curry favor with those she may need for future articles) and endless puns on the word &quot;nothing&quot;. Unlike the Universe, her book has no discernable structure, and NO attempt to clearly explain any of the new concepts (string theory, anti-matter etc.)."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"Physics -- in particular quantum physics and Einstein's theories -- has always fascinated me. And, though I've admittedly not read many physics books (I was a biology major), most of them lose me in the math early on, and I am quickly frustrated with them. That is, it's often hard for me to see the big picture and conceptually understand what the author is talking about. Perhaps I am dense (aka stupid) but my desire to understand physics has always been there. This book was written for people like me...KC Cole amazingly pulls together the current theories in cosmology, string theory, etc., into one coherent statement that is an amazing, stirring read. She doesn't write like a physicist but rather speaks in layman's terms. As a non-physicist, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and plan further readings of &quot;real&quot; physics books now that I have a bigger picture to start from.If you already understand much in physics, this book admittedly isn't for you. But, if you love science, but have never quite been able to get a foothold in the world of quantum states and quarks, this is a great place to start. The ideas, eloquently expressed, will leave you in awe."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I posted a previous review...so it might appear &quot;unfair.&quot; to comment a second time. But I hope to bear my prejudices more openly for criticism.Immediately after reading Cole's book I was able to read another popular science book that was excellent, although on a somewhat different subject. In the second book I felt that the author had made every effort to reveal the exact pathway of his thinking, original thinking, step by step, in a way that made you feel as though you were right with him on the subject. You were free to accept or reject his ideas on their own merits. You weren't just left with the feeling that you just had to believe her because everything was just so gosh darn exciting!There were no short cuts in the second book. The argument was obviously honed over years of the give and take found in teaching and public presentation, counter arguments presented with their full integrity, the information built up in a logical and memorable manner. And there was no doubt that the author knew what he was talking about because he was able to discuss the essence of the experiments and the data in just the right amount of detail. Whenever he indulged in speculation, he knew it, and he openly admitted it. As a reader you knew exactly where you stood with respect to the author and his ideas. These kind of books only come along once or twice a year, in a very good year, and they are hard to write.By comparison Cole's book reads like a gossip column. This is Quantum Mechanics by Dear Abby. Every subject begins with something quoted form another book, second or third hand to give the illusion of credibility, conversations or fragments of conversations only partly understood. All that she is left to do is breathlessly amplify or wholly exagerate what she doesn't already understand. And then she asks more questions that nobody can answer. There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm, but no thinking involved. By comparison a book like the &quot;Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; or &quot;Tao of Physics&quot; would actually seem hard core.I think you are actually worse off with a book like this because you suddenly become enlightened and conversant in an exciting but imaginary world of hype, rumor, and speculation. I guess there is always a market for this even in the sciences.If it seems that I am being harsh it is only because there are some really good books out there that are better worth your while. We are now experiencing a tremendous surge in the quality of science writing not only because the science is interesting, but because, like all good writing, somebody has written honestly about something they have taken the considerable effort to think about. Cole may be a good observer and her instincts are sound, but she does not have the tools or the training to handle the original sources. This is the wrong type of book for her to write."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"Despite its grandiose title, Cole's concise volume focuses less on &quot;everything&quot; (or a theory thereof) and more on historical and contemporary concepts of &quot;nothing&quot; and of &quot;zero.&quot; In the first paragraph of her introduction, the author admits the difficulty of writing such a book and claims she avoids the temptations of &quot;following [nothing] wherever it leads, getting lost in the semantic thicket of nothing puns, or simply bouncing the idea around on one's knee, string together curious facts and ancient history.&quot; In fact, this perplexing book succumbs to all three faults.After an introductory, overlong, and (yes) pun-packed overview, Cole gets to the meat of the book. A history of zero and nothingness from the Greeks to the nineteenth century precedes a chapter on mathematical concepts, three chapters on physics (fields, quantum theory, spacetime, black holes, string theory), and two chapters on cosmology (big bang, inflation, the cosmological constant, repulsive force). The penultimate chapter, on how visual perception and psychological factors influence the concepts of nothingness, seems noticeably out of place.Yet this outline of the book is deceptive, since the vaguely structured chapters seldom confine themselves to the topics at hand. A lack of transitions, a fondness for rhetorical questions, and an excess of tangents further confuse Cole's rambling banter. A symptom of the book's lack of organization is the unjustifiable frequency with which the author interjects that there will be &quot;more on this topic later.&quot;And then there are the puns. In spite of the author's preemptive reassurance to the contrary, there are so many quips along the lines of the one I've used to title this review that it's occasionally difficult to know how seriously a statement or observation is meant. Cole is quite capable of hitting her targets: there are a number of mind-expanding images, genuine bursts of witticism, and sharply described concepts, but, just as often, the discussion falters in linguistic limbo. Granted, Cole has an unenviable task, since even scientists haven't yet developed the language to discuss many of the concepts she describes, but her prose isn't aided by the preference for clever wordplay and winking asides over straightforward exposition and unambiguous definitions.The book is not entirely without merit; one's reaction will surely depend on one's interests and background. Some readers, especially those who enjoy works of popular metaphysics, might regard the ideas presented here as mind-expanding, even satisfying, but fans of science writing are likely to be disappointed. Those readers should investigate instead the significant number of books listed in Cole's bibliography, most of which discuss these topics far more clearly."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"I hope I do not offend anyone by posting &quot;unfairly&quot; a second time, but I have some information that might be useful for those who are more favorable towards Cole's book.I have just been reading the &quot;Book of Nothing&quot; by John Barrow recently published in England by Cape press. I do not know when it will appear in America. The book covers essentially the same material - a bit too similar to be a coincidence, in my opinion. Although not perfect Barrow's book is, again in my opinion, far better written and editied, far better illustrated and stays the course on the most difficult and vital topics. It is a far more reliable guide, for example, on the subject of inflation and the meaning of such quantities as the density of vacume energy. Those who are particularly interested in &quot;nothing&quot; should consider moving on to Barrow's fairly soon.I have also just finished another book on cosmology, an excellent book which I will not mention, but which offered me some insight into just what it was in particular that increases my distaste for Cole's book. This second book had the quality not only of being authorative, but which brought the reader, step by step, to share in the reasoning process of the writer. The great strength of modern science even in popular translation is that it engages the process of reasoning. This is particularly true when considering a subject like cosmology which is very weird and getting weirder. A science writer that disengages from the logical development of a scientific subject and relies on description, no matter how well intended, is only going to confuse the issues.Cole's book will only confuse. You are asked to understand and to believe in the world she is writing about because she continually announces that it is just so gosh darn interesting! Her book does not reveal her or anyone's thought process.( I hope not, at least.) Rather it reads like a gossip colummn. Her references are all second and third hand, overheard conversations, or fragments of conversations that she only partly understands. This is quantum mechanics by Dear Abby. By comparison &quot;The Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; seemed hard core. I am sure there is a market for this kind of thing, specifically a readership that feels comforted by the semblance of intimacy and privledge afforded by the gossiping style. But I don't think it is fair to most readers who are hopefully intelligent enough to be interested in her book to begin with.Again, I strongly suspect the editors for many of Cole's problems. I don't think a writer of Cole's proven ability would have allowed herself into this mess without pressure from the publishers. There are a lot of exceptionally good science books out there stimulating the demand for other good books, but I fear that the public will be drawn away from them as publishers see bigger profits in flooding the market with mumbo jumbo."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"This book will blow your mind. It is elegant, deep, crystal clear. A tour of nothingness that will turn you inside out: whether Cole is writing about the number zero, the perceptual aspects of seeing and feeling &quot;nothing,&quot; the physics of the vacuum or the origin of time, you will feel right at home in this universe."},{"Title":"The Hole In The Universe - How Scientists Peered Over The Edge Of Emptiness And Found Everything","review":"The Hole in the Universe is everything promised by those raves from Oliver Sacks and Brian Greene and Dava Sobel -- and much more! It is a deep look at an elusive, yet centrally important subject, presented with eloquence, originality and charm. It amazes me that Cole has been able to take us to the frontiers of physics, exploring questions that physicists sstill puzzle over, and yet still make it entirely accessible (and, yes, even fun) to a complete novice like myself. I have read about ideas like string theory and the strange &quot;repulsive force&quot; that seems to be expanding the universe, but never before were these ideas so clear and appealing to me. Her writing is so fresh and lovely, it takes your breath away. And I love the connections between the notion of &quot;nothing&quot; in perception -- the holes in our heads, as Cole calls them -- and the nothings of mathematics and physics.

If you want to read 254 pages of contradicting theories backed up by little to no fact, this is the book for you. The one interesting and revelatory thing that I did pick up from this book is that the work produced by modern physicists is largely insubsantial and speculatory. The theories presented to explain space and time are no better than those created by those ancient Greek thinkers and philosophers who happened to have been proven wrong about things, or perhaps those of your average back-alley lunatic. These physicists, who should more likely be called sophists, simply pull from their anterior regions fantastic, thouroughly imaginitive structures to apply to the workings of the universe, simply because they truly have no legitimate answers.Seriously, I'm an average guy, though fairly well educated, and I'm telling you, if you're the snooty, self-important type of intellectual who likes to make up smart sounding stuff (yeah, I said \\"stuff\\") just for the sake of sounding intelligent, and would like to read this book simply for the sake of self-indulgence, then you've found the perfect read.

It contains many words for parts of modern life (bemisemagak, \\"airplane,\\" wiisiniwigamig, \\"restaurant,\\" odaabaan, \\"car\\"), but also a wealth of terms for traditional aspects of Ojibwe life (zibaaska'iganagooday, \\"jingle dress,\\" bagida'waa, \\"fish with a net,\\" wiigwaasi-makak, \\"birch-bark basket\\"). It may not have 100,000 words like large dictionaries of well-studied languages like English, but it does have over 7,000 (which, for a language like Ojibwe, which has only recieved a lot of serious scholarship relatively recently, is quite impressive). Which may not sound like a lot, but I've found that, whenever I need to look something up, it's almost certain to be in there. The first few pages offer a (very brief) sketch of the phonology and a quick overview of some aspects of the grammar, although only enough to be used as a starting point for more detailed study using other resources. The book does not purport to be a grammar, however, but merely a dictionary, and a \\"concise\\" one at that. For a \\"concise\\" dictionary to nearly always have the word I'm looking up (I've been using it for about a year now, and there are still only a few words I've tried looking up that I haven't found) is a fairly impressive feat, at least in my mind. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Ojibwe people or the language."},{"Title":"A CONCISE DICTIONARY OF MINNESOTA OJIBWE.","review":"Given the price, I was not expecting this dictionary to be as long or as detailed as it is.

Power broker Flavia Constantine wants the police to reopen the case of her brother Anderson Stratton who supposedly committed suicide eight years ago. She demands the police prove it was murder and find the perpetrator.After doing multiple interviews, Jane discovers a link between Stratton, his social worker Erica Renzler and building superintendent Larry Vale. Jane assumes that Erica visited Stratton as an excuse to talk to Vale. Eight years ago Erica also supposedly committed suicide after she quit her job at social services; Jane thinks the two deaths are linked. When she finds Erica's secret postal box with hidden records hinting that she was involved in something illegal, both cases are officially reopened as murder investigations. Someone doesn't want the police investigating and someone named Bill Fletcher takes off with the daughter of Jane's partner. When that doesn't cause the detective to back off, someone tries to kill Jane.This is a very dynamic and exciting police procedural. The author gives the audience a step-by-step insight into an ongoing investigation so that readers see how a case is solved. Jane is a remote individual so it is hard to warn up to her but nobody can doubt her dedication to solving the case especially after her two partners are deeply affected by one of the perpetrators. Lee Harris can always be counted on to give her fans an exciting mystery although her Manhattan mysteries are darker and grittier than the Christine Bennet tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder in Alphabet City: A Manhattan Mystery","review":"We were delighted to see this second entry in the Jane Bauer series about a NYPD Detective and her two sidekicks that specialize on cold cases. As the author's ex-nun Chris Bennett series seems to sputter a little, this new character is a welcome change from Lee Harris; one that features a somewhat grittier storyline and less family machinations than the \\"holiday\\" set. As with other reviewers, though, we do agree that Jane's ten-year affair with a married man (Hack) seems out of character, and a rather unwelcome twist to what we presume to be the author's values on such matters...In the fine storyline, a mentally troubled man (Stratton) is dead from apparent self-starvation. His prominent sister, with connections high up in the NYPD, wants the case re-opened eight years later, as she never accepted it as a suicide. When Jane and partners Defino and MacHovec start interviewing people and chasing now-distant clues, a suicide of the man's case worker is discovered, which seems way too coincidental to the cops. Eventually that latter death is ruled a murder, and that case is reopened as well. Most of the book then actually pursues that crime and its real circumstances, outcome, and perpetrators to a somewhat surprising conclusion that significantly endangers Bauer. Possibly the only dissatisfaction to the novel is the somewhat unresolved status of Stratton's death.We seem to enjoy Harris' mysteries and feel she is on the right track to promote Bauer's exploits and maybe let the other series fade away. If she can dream up further interesting cases and maybe fix Bauer's love life while she's at it, we predict she can pump out another dozen or so stories in this set! Not bad for an author with some forty books (under various names) already under her belt!"},{"Title":"Murder in Alphabet City: A Manhattan Mystery","review":"Eight years ago, Andrew Stratton starved to death. That was the official cause of death of the cold case Jane Bauer, NYPD, and her two partners are assigned to investigate.

Things don't add up and soon they discover it was murder. They continue investigating and trying to discover what really happened to Andrew and his social worker. And what were they involved in.I really enjoy this series by Lee Harris. Jane Bauer is a great detective and I like the way she works and thinks.

With Jane being a NYPD detective, the stories are a lot more plausible and the writing just seems to be on a much higher level.The only thing I don't like about the series is Jane's relationship with Hack. She comes across as such an intelligent, self-sufficient heroine in the books that it's disappointing to see her acting like a lovesick schoolgirl over a married man. Hopefully, as the series progresses, Hack will become history and Jane will find a real romance."},{"Title":"Murder in Alphabet City: A Manhattan Mystery","review":"I want to state emphatically that I am a huge fan of Lee Harris. Adore the Christine Bennett stories and can't believe there are no more of them. I keep all mine and have reread them at least 3 times already. I just started ordering them for my sister who is in a group home in New Mexico. And, thanks Amazon for making it so easy to purchase them and have them shipped to her. Didn't think I'd like the Cold Case Unit Detective stories at first but really loved the first one when I got into it. Also really enjoyed Murder in Alphabet City till it came to near the end when the detectives find out how 4 babies died. Jane's glib assurance to the people at the laundry that \\"it was just an accident and nobody is to blame\\" is just so wrong that I'm surprised that it ever got past the book editor. Lee Harris is supposed to know so much about the police and the law that I can't believe that she never heard the phrase \\"criminally negligent homicide\\" or \\"injury to a child\\" and just passes over the deaths of 4 babies like it wasn't really important. I guess I let myself get upset about it even though I kept telling myself \\"it's fiction - didn't actually happen\\". It just disappointed me that Lee Harris could have written that because I am such a great admirer of her books. I sort of wish that Jane Bauer could find a man who isn't already married but it's a very human thing about her that she doesn't really want a man that she might have to actually commit to at some point in time. What she has with \\"Hack\\" is all that she is really capable of having with a man. Very human trait that makes her character more interesting."},{"Title":"Murder in Alphabet City: A Manhattan Mystery","review":"I really like this Manhattan Series.

Several practical formulas for design of noise control systems are discussed and given in the text. Formulas for calculation of sound propagation in various practical situations are also given. I recommend this book to people who have an interest in reducing noise in most practical problems.The book is also suitable to students in mechanical, aerospace, automotive, electrical, environmental, highways and building engineering who have an interest in acoustics or noise control problems. The book is however not suitable as a class textbook as not many formulas are derived neither are there many worked examples or tutorial problems that can assist a student to prepare for examinations."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"It is interesting to read \\"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy\\" at the same time I am working my way through the essays in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale.\\" The tone of this tribute volume by Candace Havens to the creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Firefly,\\" is informal rather than scholarly. More importantly, the goal of this volume is primarily to supply behind the scenes information for fans of these shows, although there is some critical insights offered in the chapter devoted to \\"Secrets of Success,\\" which enumerates the seven elements that make \\"BtVS\\" a cult television series. Havens is working from various articles and websites about Whedon and his creations, and although it does not explicitly say so I assume she conducted interviews with various people quoted in this book. Since she shares with us impressions about her tours of the sets for Whedon's three television series I assume she took time to talk to some of these people; however, there are few references to specific interview (e.g., with Whedon's film professor, Jeanine Basinger) as to how much access she had to the cast and crew and I am rather curious as to how much of the material here is from primary sources (without going through all the secondary sources and doing a process of elimination).\\"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy\\" is called a biography, but the focus is clearly more on his career than his life. The first chapter looks at his life through college while the second covers his work early work in television writing episodes of \\"Roseanne\\" and as a \\"script doctor\\" on films like \\"The Quick and the Dead,\\" \\"Speed,\\" \\"Waterworld,\\" and \\"Toy Story.\\" More importantly, this is where we learn about the key formative experiences Whedon had with his two major screenplays, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Alien Resurrection.\\" That sets the stage for \\"Buffy: Round Two\\" in the third chapter, where Whedon gets a second chance at bringing his vision of \\"BtVS\\" to life. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the secrets of the success of \\"BtVS,\\" a review of the seven seasons of the show (okay, six and a half seasons when this book went to press), a look at \\"Angel,\\" Whedon's foray into comics and other screenplay ideas, his new show \\"Firefly\\" (now on eternal hiatus), a look at \\"Joss the Mentor,\\" and a summary chapter on \\"The Real Joss.\\" Throughout the books there are sidebars focusing on various actors (e.g., Alyson Hannigan, Anthony Stewart Head), most pages have choice quotes emblazon in white on black, and there are scores of black & white photographs, mostly by Sue Schneider (yes, I am curious her prominent role in this effort as well).All things considered, this book is a quick and enjoyable read. The main complaint, such as it is, would be that once Havens starts dispensing tidbits you want more of it; I was particularly interested to know more specifics about what lines from Whedon's script doctoring efforts were left in the films he worked on (I am always interested to hear what Whedon lines work there way into episodes of \\"BtVS\\" for which he was not the listed writer). The timing of the book might be considered problematic given the fate of \\"Firefly\\" and the impending end of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" but not if you consider it as part of an effort to promote Whedon's late but not particularly lamented new series. The main point is that in terms of its target audience, the legion of fans of Joss Whedon, this volume is on target and there are enough one-liners from the man himself to appease most of them. This book does not intend to be a scholarly effort, and of the various \\"pop\\" volumes devoted to the \\"BtVS\\" phenomenon this is one of the better efforts. Final Note: I was surprised that the title of a book honoring Joss Whedon would violate his disdain for abbreviating his cult television series other than as \\"BtVS.\\" I just want to point out that I have done very well at avoiding making that particular mistook in my reviews of all things \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" related."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This is not a biography, it's not a \\"making of\\" and it's not about the facts of the television production industry.This is a book like none other I've ever read.Candace Haven has given us a glimpse of the man who created Buffy, of where inside him this concept came from -- but even more she's given us a glimpse of what it takes to be the sort of person who can succeed in breaking all the taboos in the television industry.What taboos did he break? Well, Buffy is a strong story-arc show like Babylon 5 and Dallas -- but without the (perceived) broad audience appeal of those shows. Buffy is about a young girl who kicks [butt]-- like Nikkita -- but going for a major network. Buffy is a series about vampires -- but it has a teen protagonist. Parents don't want their kids watching \\"that kind of thing.\\" (or so they believed) The list of taboos is almost endless.The genius that Havens refers to is, I think, Whedon's deliberate, pre-meditated integration of 4 distinct genres, horror, action, comedy and drama, into a single cohesive and coherent story and then finding a way to sell this package to Hollywood despite violating all those taboos.Candace Haven writes in Joss Whedon The Genius Behind Buffy: \\"This integration lies at the core of Buffy's appeal, but it made the show almost impossible to desribe in a way that movie and network executives understood. How do you sell a show that doesn't fall into a clear genre? For this reason, the movie version of Buffy was turned into a comedy, much to Joss's dismay. As a television show, Buffy was rejected by the major networks. Ultimately, the fledgling WB accepted Buffy as a cross-genre show. This acceptance was either a result of WB's vision or of its executives' inexperience. But the reality is that it's unlikely Buffy would have been allowed to proceed with its cross-genre approach on one of the more established networks.\\"But WB did let the show become established as a genre-mix, and that is quite literally changing the whole fiction industry from movies, to television -- even to books. Now mixed genre novels such as my own Sime~Gen novels which are based on the vampire archetype, or my vampire romances Those of My Blood and Dreamspy, or Jean Lorrah's hot selling Blood Will Tell, abound and are beginning to find an audience among the Buffy fans. Because of the effect this show has had on the entire fiction industry, this book has become a very \\"important\\" book for those who want to enter that industry.You have to read this book if you want to know \\"who\\" Joss Whedon is that he could get this show on the air and keep it there until its audience found it. Much of that information about who he is lies within the subtext of Candace Haven's fannish point of view cast against her journalistic professionalism. Read between the lines. You have to read this book to learn where inside Whedon the Buffy material came from and why the scripts for this show are so very, VERY well written. For just how well written I think they are, see my article in Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Discuss Their Favorite Television Show edited by Glenn Yeffeth.You won't find exactly this kind of information about a producer in any other kind of book. A biography could not include this exact point of view, a fan's point of view. A making-of could not include 3-D glimpses of other people who knew Whedon when he was young and in other contexts.This book about Whedon&Buffy; is a hybrid -- a kind of cross-genre biography/making-of/tribute-to book as Buffy itself is a cross-genre horror/action/comedy/drama. The very form of this book is awesomely appropriate to the subject matter. For that reason alone, reading this not-biography is a profound pleasure!"},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"Don't be fooled by the intentionally deceptive marketing used to peddle this book as a biography - this is actually a handful of Whedon interviews, readily available on the Internet, retyped in roughly chronological order.

It has a lot of great Buffy information but it could have used more on Angel. It has a section on Firefly even though it was written before the show aired. The section on Joss' Fray comic convinced me that I need to go buy it now. My only major complaints are that the writer misspelled a character's name and the lack of Angel information. Despite those flaws, any fan of Joss Whedon will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"Anyone who has seen or noticed many of my reviews probably knows at least one thing: I love BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FIREFLY/SERENITY. I'm about as big a fan of the work of Joss Whedon as you are likely to find. And I'm awaiting the start of his new series DOLLHOUSE more than one can easily imagine.Nonetheless, this book is basically a puff piece. It is not a critical study, a critical analysis, or anything other than a fan raving about someone they admire. That being said, it is not a bad book for that. I merely point it out that this book is not there to dish the dirt, if dirt there is to be dished. And there is some, if not much. For instance, the book passes over a few unpleasantries, such as the inelegant dismissal of Charisma Carpenter from ANGEL (accounts vary, but one very prevalent rumor is that she was written out of the show because of a spur of the moment leave of absence she took during a few late Season Three episodes, only to return for filming the next season pregnant, something she had not apprised them of, resulting in the need for significant rewriting). Nor does the author delve into the botched attempt to have Amber Benson return in Season Seven (again, two rumors persist, one that she would have been the person that Willow saw in the otherwise wonderful episode \\"Conversations with Dead People,\\" and the other that she might have returned to the show as the result of a wish that Buffy would have been granted -- after struggling with whether to remove Angel's curse or bring her mother back to life, the word is that she would have brought Tara back). Now, these are rumors. Perhaps there is truth to them. Perhaps there is none. But this is not the book that would dare deal with them. Nor Glenn Quinn's drug use, that got his arc on ANGEL ended earlier than they originally intended.Still, I did pick up a few things that I didn't already know. And there were many snippets from interviews with Whedon and those on his shows that were obviously done for the writing for this book. So, the book becomes a source for those wanting to know more about Whedon, and not merely a book quoting other sources.Nonetheless, I didn't end the book with complete confidence in it. I was a bit bothered by its unwillingness to engage anything the least bit controversial. I was also suspicious about whether it got every part of the story correct. Much is made of one of Whedon's college professors. Yet I know from other sources that he also profited from taking classes with renowned historian Richard Slotkin. I've read that it was in one of Slotkin's courses that he encountered Joseph Campbell's THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES and someone with strong Wesleyan film studies connections told me that he took Slotkin's course on Western films. (Slotkin is the author of a classic three-volume work on the imaginative response to wilderness in U.S. history. The third volume of that work, GUNFIGHTER NATION deals with the rise of the Western in American culture.) My point is that I'm not sure that his book tells the whole story. I could be wrong. My sources could be wrong. Perhaps Richard Slotkin did not even teach Joss Whedon. Or if he did, perhaps he did not have any influence (I took classes with many famous scholars, virtually none of which had any actual influence on me.)So, I can recommend this and can even consider it a pretty decent book, but one must be aware of its limitations."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This book is great. I've been a fan of Joss since the first time I saw Buffy. This book isn't all about Buffy though. It covers Buffy, Angel, Firefly and more. Funny as hell too.I couldn't put the book down. I read it straight through in one afternoon. A lot of insight into Joss and all of the cast members of his show are interviewed. It's part biography and part, well, everything else.Best book I've read in a while. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This was so far beyond what I expected that I hardly know where to begin. There is enough detail about Joss' life to satisfy the curious, but not enough to bore the casual reader. The interviews are masterfully done. I'm amazed that Ms. Havens got to speak to so many people in and around Joss' life. Also, she managed to capture both Joss' genius and his wonderfully quirky sense of humor.In short, this book did something that I thought could not be done. It increased my respect and admiration for Joss Whedon."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"I highly recommend this book to the many fans of Joss Whedon. Highly informative and very well-written, this book offers wonderful insights into the mind of one of my all-time favorite writers.Joss' fans all know Joss is a genius - this book gives us insight into where that genius came from and how it developed. It also clarifies some of the difficulties Mr. Whedon faced in his early career in Hollywood with some of his screenplays such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the movie) and Alien: Ressurrection. It gives us insight into Joss' early T.V. writing and script-doctoring career, as well as detailed description of his Buffy, Angel and Firefly television days.I'd like to see this book updated, as it seems to have been published before BtVS season 7 aired, let alone the green-lighting of Serenity, the movie based on Firefly. Joss has many wonderful things in his future - let's see it here."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"Candace Havens does a brilliant job of pulling back the curtain on one of the most creative minds in film and television. Her style is informative, clever and engaging. While Havens is clearly a fan of Whedon's work, she maintains journalistic integrity as she reveals behind-the-scenes facts and fresh tidbits for the most rabid fans. Treat yourself to a great read and buy this book!"},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This book is an interesting and concise overview of Joss Whedon and his work and life. As an avid Buffy fan, I enjoyed reading about Joss's inspirations and paths which led him to create the wonderful shows he had created. However, I found the writing style to be very basic and uninspired, reminding me of biographies I read in elementary school. This book merely tells the story, without taking the time to write with elegance or engaging prose."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"I totally love it.As a fan of Buffy and Joss, and also a huge fan of the screen-writing/filmmaking itself I really enjoyed it.This book reveals a lot of stuff.Joss is so unique. The author really broken down Buffy as a show and Joss's vision and how he approaches many things: screen-writing, directing, twisting plot and why he does it,etc. Book also narrates his story as a person, from child to recognized name in the industry. Some humor applies.Hardcore Buffy fans will find lotsa trivia for themselves, from episodes trivia to actors trivia to romance and on - all in Joss's words.Only one remark. I hate it when people write about someone in a fashion where they are absolutely praising the guy. I mean, Joss is God, yes..then again, keep it down a little.Still, this is definitely one fine fine read about a mind-blowing genius that Joss is."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This was an interesting book. It was written from the perspective of someone who is not prescicly friends with him but who is familiar to and with him. Someone who visited the sets of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. Someone who had his blessing to speak with people very influential in his life (his favorite college professor, the appreciation seems to go both ways) and other business partners like producers for his shows and writers and directors. I got a good basic knowledge of Joss and a feel of what it's like to be around him. I don't think I got into his head much but then, I'm not sure someone who's not Joss could explain that very well. I'll wait for the autobiography for that."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"The only reason I bought this book was to put it in my Buffy Book collection. But when I recieved it three days ago, I could not put it down. It has all the regular Buffy anidotes that most non-fiction Buffy books have, but then it had much more. The realy biographical chapters have so much information that I have never known before (and have read every published Buffy book, and as many buffy web articles that i can get my hands on). This book is the perfect addition to the perfect Buffy Library."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"An interesting but somewhat fluffy look at Joss Whedon's career. This book has the same almost naive as the Mary Tyler Moore biography I read last year. The book was written at a time when Buffy and Angel were both on the air. Firefly though floundering was still on the air but there's no mention of the upcoming film, Serenity.What the book doesn't admit to is the possibility that Joss could burn out -- which it appears he has from recent interviews. Joss is clearly very driven and clearly loves his work but does he know how to slow down?I found the insights into the storylines fascinating. Joss clearly lives by the adage of \\"write what you know\\" and it shows in his work."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"This book is wonderful. It takes Joss from his childhood (he was a very sad kid) to the present time, with everything in between. There are lots of quotes from Joss, who is always got something funny and brilliant to say about everything. There's also a great analysis of Buffy that explains exactly how Joss turned Buffy into a fan phenom. Also, Firefly, Angel, Fray, Toy Story, Speed etc. Also lots of great pics."},{"Title":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy","review":"Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy is so lacking in any healthy cynicism about its subject as to render itself totally useless to anyone who is not already a full-blown devotee.Whedon's accomplishments merit attention; at his best, he is a good producer and director of television, a supremely talented writer and gifted creator. A distressing amount of Joss Whedon's fans, however, seem unable to conceive of their hero ever making a mistake, doing a not-so-nice thing or sometimes being a not-so-nice person.An independent-thinking writer could make much of questions such as:Is Whedon \\"the Charles Dickens of the New Millennium\\", as some would have it, or \\"just\\" a talented writer who plays to a passionate niche audience?In its final seasons, did Buffy prove the truth of David Mamet's comment that \\"If we watch any television drama long enough... we will see the original dramatic thrust give way to domestic squabbles?'Is the story \\"God\\" as Whedon has sometimes claimed to justify unpopular plot points? Or do the desires of fans, networks, or series stars ever affect it, for the better or worse, as increasing evidence seems to suggest?Someone who is awed by their biographical subject ought to choose another line of work. Good biographers, even flawed, sensationalistic ones like Randy Taraborrelli or Bob Woodward, approach their subjects as reporters, not fans. Here, author Candace Havens seems to have embraced every utterance from Whedon's mouth as some sort of universal truth. Any controversial questions, such as those raised by fans who objected to the death of the character Tara on the Buffy series, are answered only by Whedon's stock replies, without the author having to devote a moment's thought to the validity of any of the issues.One could hope that if Havens were writing her book now, at the end of the seventh and last season of Buffy, she would question some of Whedon's statements quoted here. Like:If 'blood is kept to a minimum' on Buffy, then what about the demon tearing big hunks of Willow's flesh off her body?If \\"one or two vampires is just as good as 100 if the story is good,\\" what are we to infer about an interminable, 22-episode story featuring an army of \\"Ubervamps\\" as its rousing conclusion?Havens' writing is so over-the-top gushy and fawning that one is sorely tempted to ask (appropriately enough for Buffy's high school fixation), If you love Joss Whedon so much, why don't you marry him? When Havens finally admits there might be a teensy flaw in the \\"Jossverse\\" (the drug addiction metaphor of Willow's falling into dark magic was \\"not very subtle\\") one is dumbfounded. It's as if Bill Clinton endorsed George W. Bush.It might be impressive, as Havens believes, that everyone she quotes has only the nicest things to say about Whedon. Until you reflect that almost without exception at the time they were interviewed, those quoted were employed by Joss Whedon.Not content to let Whedon's statements raise unanswered questions, Havens raises more herself through sloppy writing:At one point she appears to equate Willow's lesbianism with her magic addiction, but Havens' writing is so unclear I honestly can't tell if she meant to make that point.If \\"no writer, however talented, can write 22 episodes a year,\\" what are we to tell J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote 60 episodes of Babylon 5 in an unbroken streak?If \\"most things Joss is involved with are successful\\" what about Firefly, Alien Resurrection, or the original Buffy movie? Actually, for that question, at least, Havens does provide an answer. As a rule, judging from this book, everything worthy is to Joss Whedon's credit, and any unworthiness is the fault of others, the not-Joss. Meanwhile, Havens gives the impression Whedon produced, directed and wrote Buffy almost single-handedly; he developed the special effects and choreographed the dance numbers of the musical episode himself. He created the Angel series alone too. A Joss Whedon written and directed episode is automatically one of the Standouts of All Time. Joss is Right About Everything."},{"Title":"Lilias!

I had heard about it months previously and knew that at some point I would read it. I thought it was very \\"appropriate \\" that I came across this book on the last day of training. The reason is that Lilias Folan was the first yoga teacher I was ever exposed to back in the seventies via her PBS television program. So here I am almost 30 years later, my last day of classroom teacher training and I find her book, not in a conventional bookstore but in a gift and candy store. There she was, looking up and smiling at me from the front cover in her purple long sleeved shirt and black pants, arms out stretched lovingly with her palms open. No accident.This book gently introduces yoga to an aging population (Lilias and I are both a part of that population now) in typical Lilias fashion.Not only does this book discuss asana (and adaptations) but also much of the book is dedicated to meditation, pranayama, the koshas, as well as a little information regarding the Yamas and the Niyams and the stage of life that people our age (Lilias and me) are in now.

Yoga Gets Better with Age","review":"Lilias! Yoga Gets Better With AgeBy Lilias FolanRodale Books, July 2005Reviewed by Sharon SteffensenYoga gets better with age--and so does Lilias. In her new book she shares what she has learned along the path since the early days of her TV show, Lilias! Yoga and You, which first aired on PBS in 1972. By the mid-1980s the series was airing daily nationwide. It is likely that for people age 40 and older, Lilias is the most well-known yoga teacher in the U.S., having introduced millions to yoga.Because she is familiar to so many of us, we trust Lilias as an authority on yoga. In her book she has adapted yoga postures so they can be practiced safely by people of any age. In her easy manner, Lilias clears up misconceptions about yoga. (Even today, some people are afraid of yoga because of its Indian roots.) Lilias writes about the koshas (the sheaths, or subtle bodies) and explains how to connect with these deeper layers of the Self. Lilias discusses the spiritual benefits and gives techniques for healing our emotions, connecting with our wisdom and feeling our bliss.Lilias has also developed some new movements, one of which she calls the \\"three R's\\" --resist, relax and restretch--that free up muscles and allow much greater movement than ever imagined possible. She describes her style as yin--defined as cool, calm, inward and focused (for stretching)--as opposed to a yang approach, which is heated and intense (for strength). Therefore, her book is geared toward people who are 40 and over as well as to younger people who are looking for a gentler, yet powerful, approach to yoga.Lilias demonstrates all the poses in 200 full-color photos. She looks fabulous as always. Like her TV show, her book is friendly, down-to-earth and very likeable."},{"Title":"Lilias!

However, I noticed that recently (I'm now 60) things don't bend and stretch like they used to. I almost injured my knee by trying to bend in a pose the way I had always done. Lilias' book has some great ideas on how to avoid injury in your later years. What I really loved was the new technique she teaches that helps you get into the pose deeper without strain or pain.

It came out in 1972, when Hitch was basically the only film director widely known to the public. In that, as in many things, he was ahead of his time.What makes the book really fun is that it's a compendium of articles by Hitchcock himself and a slew of other writers. There is his interview with Peter Bogdanovich (from the latter's book of director interviews, 'Who the Devil Made It'). There are articles by Hitchcock on direction in general and about 'Rear Window' in particular. There are articles about Hitchcock by Andre Sarris and Robin Wood, among others. And there are nine short articles by various luminaries about specific films and characters, including: James Agee on 'Notorious'; Pauline Kael on '39 Steps', 'Spellbound' and 'Strangers on a Train'; Raymond Chandler on 'Strangers on a Train'; Eric Rohmer on 'The Wrong Man'.

This is who she was, who she is, and who she would always be. It would never be any different...'Not only does Joshua Collin's witness his best friend, Brad, commit suicide, but later in life he also loses his mother to breast cancer while struggling with a strange disorder of hallucinations. Mainly due to the constant cuts and bruises he gets from hurting himself whenever he goes into one of his episodes, he's the center of everyone's gossip in the small town of Nickel, Texas where he buys a house with the money he inherits from his mother's passing; sealing all the windows shut (which is an issue that has to do with the traumatic death of Brad back in High School). He lives a rather secluded life, mostly painting, because he's afraid of hurting those around him. He thus tries to stay within his safety zones, leaving the house only to see his psychiatrist several times a week or to do some grocery shopping. That way it'll insure that if he's about to hallucinate he'll have enough time to return home where he locks himself within his own padded cellar that's timed for his eventual release. Then, out of nowhere, a stranger appears with her black flowing robes, armed with a sword at her side. She introduces herself as the Angel of Death ~ collector of souls ~ and is just as confused as he is about why He has sent her to this \\"familiar\\" mortal. At first she seems aloof and wary but they soon become closer, cherishing what little time they get together and falling in love as they realize they both live in lonely isolation. There's, however, another who has much in common with the darkly cloaked servant of God, and that would be Lucifer who was once her friend but now her enemy ~ banished from the gates of Heaven. They too are alike, and not only in the way they are dressed but also in how they're extremely different from all the other angels. She therefore finds it hard to hate him because she sees herself in the Devil as well. She refuses to let her guard down, though, for she knows he's a menace, and he will do everything in his power to put an end to this growing union between her and Joshua.I just finished reading Cynthia Cody's first novel, \\"Angel Lover\\", and I have mixed emotions about it. I felt she should have incorporate more depth and realism to the character's development. The writing could have used some improvement too, and with better editing. But other than that I thought it was an interesting and engaging story that was fast-paced and an enjoyable, easy read. I did, however, think that at times it was a little TOO simple. The concept was good, though, and proves that Cynthia Cody has much potential. And I do hope there's a sequel to this book (perhaps it will explain the ending better)."},{"Title":"Just a Minute","review":"I loved this book!I think everyone can relate to this wait-y subject.Have you ever had to wait?

When Johnny isn't pressing his nose to the windows of the store he's drowning in a strange sea as the sun burns, \\"to a cinder of vermilion\\". The colors are bright and lively and the illustrations well composed. Details (like Johnny's glasses suddenly becoming bifocals when he's an old man) will continually catch your eye. Kids might enjoy finding the odd large-beaked bird that appears in the oddest of moments throughout the tale.But I was not overwhelmingly impressed. Here's the deal: Though Johnny may only be pretending that he's growing old as his mother is upstairs, it's unclear that this is all (in some odd way) a dream. When the very store itself crumbles from the force of an earthquake, kids are going to wonder how and why it's happening. Moreover, when Johnny's mother reappears and everything looks exactly the way it was... heck I was confused for a while. Why does Johnny need to learn, \\"how to walk again\\" at the end? Why, when he's told at the end that there will be more shopping, do his hands suddenly quake and steam? I know this is all a metaphor for how children feel when their adults abandon them for the supposed \\"minute\\" but couldn't this have been conveyed with a little more clarity? In the end, the book's going to raise a lot more questions than it could ever answer. The literal minded child will not take to this book.The open-minded child just may like this story, however. If you've a hankering for a tale that displays a childish mindset in the face of abandonment, this might be the book you'd like. But if it isn't, don't be too surprised. It may simply be a matter of taste."},{"Title":"Just a Minute","review":"It isn't funny or entertaining in the least. Our daughter (almost 4) is good at getting the jokes that are aimed at her age, did not understand why this boy's mother had abandoned him. I had to explain what was happening. The mother depicted in the book represents a truly poor parent by dumping her son with some aunt in a department store basement while she spends an extraordinary amount of time shopping for luxury stuff for herself. When she comes back she admonishes him for going to slow because they have \\"miles more shopping to due\\". I guess you're supposed to say \\"Yeah that's really funny, I'll have to try that some time\\". This bozo need to stay away from writing children's books."},{"Title":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin","review":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin is one of my favorite Beatrix Potter stories along with The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Ginger and Pickles. It is the story of a rather mischievous young squirrel named Nutkin who loves to tease old Mr. Brown, the owl who lives on an island filled with nut trees. The little rythmes and verses Nutkin recites throughout the story are absolutely delightful. The illustrations are one of Ms. Potter's finest---filled with wonderful detail and color. Some might be offended by the way Nutkin is punished by old Mr. Brown---mainly by having his tail torn off, but if one thinks about it that is the way owls behave in nature. Ms. Potter never honeys things over and her tales always remain a joy to read. Children should not miss out reading this humorous tale."},{"Title":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin","review":"The story of Squirrel Nutkin who is a very disrespectful and rude and provocative squirrel who gets taught a very tough lesson.

Nutkin is the name of a cheeky and insolent squirrel who thinks far too much of himself until he is caught by an Owl who has both patience and wisdom as he endures many insults from Nutkin. At last he reacts and it appears that it is the end for the impudent squirrel. At the last moment he escapes from the owl's home when his tail breaks in two and he scurries off to safety. He is left with a partial tail as a reminder to mind his manners in the future. An important correction is necessary regarding this owing to an error in an above review. Nutkin did NOT chew his tail off to escape and I invite the reviewer to actually read the book so she understands this important point. This is a wonderful story for young children with many inportant messages. My own children greatly enjoyed these tales when they were young and still talk about them from time to time. There is a reason why Beatrix Potter's books remain among the best selling childrens books of all time. Her stories and the lessons therein are timeless and the moral absolutes are of critical value at a time when our anything goes culture is in chaos and espouses the worst behavior possible. It is truly refreshing and hopeful that brilliant childrens tales written in 1903 still have much to teach us in 2007."},{"Title":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin","review":"This is a must-read, short story.

They LOVE to have this story about a very naughty squirrel and very scary old owl read to them. (who knew impertinent squirrels and creepy owls were so much fun!) Her words are only a well-chosen few, which makes it easy for small children to follow, but not simplistic, so that they learn to understand sophisticated vocabulary. The few words are augmented by exquisite watercolors that tell so much more of the story, and make the children crave to hear them again and again. For instance, I'll never forget the relief and also confusion i used to feel every time he got away -- mainly because of the picture that went with it, which is still in my mind today. Oh, and, one more thing -- the reviewer below who characterized this tale as rude, violent and gory, also said this about The Tale of Jeremy Fisher: \\"My own favorite thing about Jeremy Fisher is that he is eaten, then spit back out because his rain gear doesn't taste good to the fish who's swallowed him! How many books do you know where the main character is eaten? Good stuff.\\" So, Leggo, it's ok to eat frogs but not squirrels?"},{"Title":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin","review":"This is a delightful timeless Tale about an misbehaving squirrel. The riddles are delightful, and the vocabulary exquisite.Unfortunately, some of the reviewers have looked at this story with the eyes and wisdom of this present age. In time, we will see value in teaching that good can overcome evil, rather than pretending that evil simply doesn't exist. Owls do eat squirrels, impertinance is punished.

Nutkin teases and mocks an elderly owl, old Brown. In the end Old Brown traps Nutkin and prepares to eat him. Nutkin escapes by gnawing off his own tail! Pretty violent stuff really.Though one reviewer here finds the rhymes and riddles \\"delightful,\\" let's face it: they make absolutely no sense to today's readers adults and children. While sense is not a necessity certainly, Potter's works in general barely make sense at all and we should consider retiring many of these titles. A number of them are over a hundred years old now, and, if the stories themselves are so great (most are not really), they should be updated in the same way that classic fairy tales are.The one bright spot in Squirrel Nutkin is the picture of the squirrels using their \\"tails as sails.\\" Other reviewers mention this, but fail to note that this is but one picture and is trivial in the story."},{"Title":"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin","review":"I was offended and disturbed by the sudden and swift use of violence to teach Squirrel a lesson.

Rosh Hashonah and Passover, aside from more important things, then also meant eating Mama's gefilte fish, which she made from fresh carp. By the day before the holiday, the market had no more big fish, so Mama always bought her carp a week in advance, and stored it, fresh, in the bathtub.This particular year, though, Harry and Leah fell in love with the carp. &quot;Some carp are much more lovable than others, and that Passover, we had an unusually playful and intelligent carp in our bathtub,&quot; says Leah. To save the carp, they brought the fish downstairs to Mrs. Ginzburg, who agreed to put the carp in her bathtub instead.They hoped their father would save &quot;Joe,&quot; but Papa would have none of it. He went straight to Mrs. Ginzburg's apartment, and retrieved their beloved fish before their mother even knew he was missing.The children in the story never ate gefilte fish again, but a few weeks after their favorite carp died, their father brought home a cat, which they also named Joe.Aside from teaching kids about bygone traditions, this story explains that they cannot always have what they want. No surprise, they love it as much as most kids love gefilte fish. Alyssa A.

For example, the narrator and her brother regret being the fortunate family with a bathroom in their apartment, since it means they have to take more baths. When the children meet their father at the subway, as he is returning exhausted from a long day of work in a sweatshop, his fatigue vanishes at the sight of the children, they barely notice their own effect. The histrionics of the widow downstairs are slyly manipulated by the children in an ill-thought-out plot to save their beloved carp, and they treat her grief as alien. The voice of the narrator never breaks the childhood blitheness of which the reader is fully aware. The children really don't understand why the carp has to be sacrificed, and while they don't realize the sacrifice their parents make for them, they do understand the love they receive.

While the premise is interesting the execution (so to speak)leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps, being charitable, this is because it is dated. Its appeal (being charitable) seems to be in its evocation of nostalgia. However the ending involves a fish (which the children in the story view as a pet) being dispatched by a mother wielding a club on the kitchen table. This does not inspire warm feelings about Passover. My son and I were both upset by the ending.

Especially noticible is his personal courage to be simply himself in flaw, and fineness. The author dares to express himself through an open, revealing style.

This massive (594 pages) tome is not just for Subud members, but for anyone who seeks the reality that lies beyond the material world. At last, here is a book I can give to friends and family members who are curious about what I do when I go off to receive the latihan, but are not yet ready to jump into the deep end to find out for themselves! For the merely curious, Monbaron's book recounts the history of Subud, and how it grew from a small group in Indonesia to a world-wide spiritual phenomenom. It tells the story of Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo, an unremarkable government clerk whose life changed when a ball of light entered the top of his head when he was out for an evening stroll. And it discusses many aspects of the latihan, which is the central core of Subud. For those who are considering joining Subud, the Monbaron's book provides information regarding what this involves, as well as a detailed description of the Subud organization. Readers may also skip around and find out what Bapak had to say about topics as varied as suicide, feminism, reincarnation, sex, drug use, and many other questions and issues with which people struggle.Whether you use it as reference manual, a source of fascinating anecdotes and spiritual insights, or a way to learn about a spiritual path of profound power and simplicity, Subud the Coming New Age of Reality is a treasure chest of immense value."},{"Title":"Subud The Coming New Age of Reality: The Most Complete Book on Subud","review":"Like many books written about Subud, this one is &quot;Subud as seen through the eyes of the author&quot;.

I wouldn't go as far as to connect my spiritual evolution to a review of a book on Amazon but Mr. Monbaron is entitled to his opinion. It's just that I prefer my privacy whilst still believing I have the right to an opinion on a publicly available work.I have found the book an interesting discussion of Subud(a movement I am currently looking into) and although he is critical of some of the practices he finds in some groups there is no reason to doubt that this is a sincere expression of his experiences.Many of the reviewers speak of the individualistic nature of the revelation obtained from Subud and in particular the practice of the Latihan. This is reflected in the fact that many of the reviewers do not recognise their experience of Subud from Monbaron's account.Whether or not this is the case, I have found a good deal of this book informative and useful however I would agree with some critics that there is also a lot of more orthodox religious belief interwoven in the narrative and with the greatest respect to the author, I find myself hoping that this is not representative of Subud (perhaps it more reflects the cultural background of the founder?). As a non-member I note on the one hand the all-inclusive tone of the organisation (open to all, dogma free) but on the other find some of the assertions made in the book , for example that homosexuality is a spiritual disease and that one use of the Latihan is to overcome this, rather unpalatable. Similarly to state that the will of God is that everyone have children might possibly be worth qualifying in an overcrowded world.

This recital of the facts and details of the westward expansion focuses on five distinct times, commencing with the Ashley-Henry expedition and culminating with the Native American &quot;Ghost Dancers&quot; attempt to return their lands to the people as a whole, rather than to individuals or companies.Neihardt neither praises nor condemns the expansion itself but shows how it occurred, warts and all. While sympathetic to the Native American cause, Neihardt judges neither the white man nor the Plains folk.Neihardt praises the beauty of the human form, spirit and tenacity. He sees the beauty underneath the blemishes that are all too obvious. He shows the power of perseverence in his song of Hugh Glass. He shows the love and jealousy of two men in the shooting of the cup. He shows the Native American subjugation through religion as no other writer could.His simple rhyming couplets that extend for five full length books, reveal the mystical relationship Neihardt had not only with Native Americans but also with the Earth and all of her denizens.From his early days as a Kansas farm boy to his later years as a professor of literature, Neihardt has sustained this objective but sympathetic view from the Native American's eyes.Only John Gneisenau Neihardt could hear the songs from the Wind, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, the Spirits of the Fathers and Grandfathers that went before and then place them on paper, for those who cared to listen, to hear them.This compendium of information, data, insight and welt geist is not only accurate in detail but is also related in a gracious flowing poetry that, while beautiful on the page, also sings on the lips of the intuitive aloud reader."},{"Title":"The Twilight of the Sioux (Volume II of A Cycle of the West)","review":"I had the good fortune to meet Dr. Neihardt when I was 15. We had been discussing poetry in my high school literature class, focusing on meaning in the poetry we read. I asked Dr. Neihardt what he considered the most important thing in writing poetry, expecting to hear something about philosophy or emotion or, at least, meaning. \\"Technique,\\" he answered. As I look at his work I can see what he meant. His magnum opus, A Cycle of the West, is an example of the finest of the writing art. In keeping with his view that poetry is a vocal art and with his background of absorbing Homer in the Greek and Virgil in the Latin as a kid, he titles the five divisions of the work as songs: The Song of Three Friends, The Song of Hugh Glass, The song of Jed Smith, The Song of the Indian Wars, and The Song of the Messiah. Dr. Neihardt adopted a rule to apply throughout his work: the entire work would be in iambic pentameter with rhymed couplets. The entire work, properly termed an epic poem, required faithful daily application for thirty years of his life. On some of those days he could progress only five lines. He described to me how he often had to revise whole hard-won sections he thought he had gotten to be good but on the next day's review, weren't. One should not forget the difficult research Neihardt had to do, too. Travel in the early 1900s was very difficult, and Neihardt covered thousands of miles to get his material for the Cycle. All the advice one reads from Strunk and White, Barzun, and others is reflected in every sentence of the Cycle. Every word does all the work that can be gotten out of it. The reader is placed on scene in every sentence. Scene, description, and summary are subtly blended everywhere. The passage of time is also smoothly handled. Neihardt achieved mood through technique. He would often select dark and bright words as needed. He used every rhetorical tool. One will not find inert material anywhere, either. The extremely few adverbs and adjectives Neihardt allowed into his work are indispensable, and each one is there to take the place of many words. Beyond this, though, the Cycle fulfills its job of allowing for a captivating, smoothly flowing recital aloud. The reader will stumble on no clumsy wording. An example from the end of his Song of the Indian Wars, where Crazy Horse is taken off to be buried by his parents: \\"And when the morning heard the meadowlark/ The last great Sioux rode silently away./ Before the pony drag on which he lay/ An old man tottered. Bowed above the bier,/A little wrinkled woman kept the rear/ With not a sound and nothing in her eyes./ (white space) Who knows the crumbling summit where he lies/ Alone among the badlands? Kiotes prowl/ About it, and the voices of the owl/ Assume the day-long sorrow of the crows,/ These many grasses and these many snows.\\" Powerful stuff! It's all that good. Little wonder it was selected for inclusion in The Best Books of the World from Homer to Hemingway."},{"Title":"Gravity, the Glue of the Universe: History and Activities","review":"Well thought and displayed information clearly.

Stanley uses the Old Testament Book of Proverbs as a teaching tool to show the necessity of studying and living by God's Truth. He begins with comparing the benefits of Godly Wisdom with the shortcomings of Worldly Knowledge/living, exploring the most common problems Christians can/will face in a self focused world and the need to stay strongly focused on the teachings in God's Word, the Bible. After going over the benefits and essentials of learning Godly Wisdom, Dr. Stanley then devotes entire chapters to closely examining the problems of temptation, the importance Godly friendships (think having a non-believer as a close friend is good for both you and the non-believer, think again!) and work environments (where your faith can be hammered mercilessly by non-believers), and the need of wisdom strengthened faith in times of conflict and crisis.

We read this one to our 3-4 year old countless times and it improved her ways with food. That alone was well worth the price of the book.

D.W. is fine with this at first, but soon realizes it's a problem.This story is totally relatable. I'm something of a picky eater myself --- like D.W., I don't like tomato sauce on spaghetti.

W.

She tell her mom a long list of everything she won't eat, and number one on that list is spinach.D.W. is so picky that she won't eat anything at her house or a friend's house and especially not at a resturant.Her parents decide that they won't take D.W. to anymore resturants because of the tantrums she throws when they try to make her eat something.Then their Grandma Thora's brithday comes around. D.W. doesn't want to be left out on her grandma's birthday so she promises that she will be nice at dinner.They go to a resturant and D.W. tries to hide under the table so that the waiter doesn't see her, but it doesn't work and the waiter gives D.W. a kiddie menu to order off of instead of the grown up one. She orders a Little Bo Peep Pot Pie. She eats it and she likes it a lot. Then at the end the waiter tells her that it was made with spinach.I think that this is a great book for kids because we all go through a phase when we are little where we won't eat anything, that's why I think that this is good for kids to read because it takes a funny view on the matter when the waiter tells D.W. that it is made from spinach.It also tells kids that it is ok to try new things and that you should because you may just like it.

This is still one of the best \\"classic\\" British \\"who- dunnits\\" ever. It was the movie \\"39 Steps to Baker Street,\\" I believe, starring Van Johnson -- but the book beats the movie by a mile. Pure enjoyment and hard to put down. The author is more famous for \\"The List of Adrian Messenger,\\" but this is a better story, in my opinion, and it grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go."},{"Title":"Warrant for X","review":"In Philip MacDonald's world the butler just may have done it. I was watching a movie \\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\" (1956), about a blind man (Van Johnson) overhearing a kidnap and murder plot. The credits said based on a story by Philip MacDonald. The story turns out to be Warrant for X.With a few differences the story was going paralleling the film then I recognized the name of Anthony Gethryn. It turns out that this book is part of a series that includes Colonel Gethryn. I have even seen another movie with him in it that was totally different from 23 paces but matched the book to a tee. The List of Adrian Messenger (1963) where George C. Scott plays Anthony Gethryn.Naturally the book s more complex than the movie. And just incase you come in the middle of the series as I did; there is sufficient references to earlier novels to keep you from getting lost. The mystery will keep you and the edge of your seat and just as you think they have a handle on \\"the who, what and why,\\" they are off and running again."},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I started reading adult novels when I was about 10 or 11 with authors who were very popular at the time. I didn't realize until I was much older that most of them couldn't write for beans. So until I was 18, I didn't read nearly as much as I might have. But at 18 I read Glitz by Elmore Leonard, who showed me how cool the written word could be.A Coyote's in the House, Leonard's first children's novel, ought to be required reading in classrooms everywhere. Kids are subjected to so much lame, stilted, uninteresting reading material it ought to be a crime. This book reads like Technicolor in that black-and-white world. It will inspire kids to read more. Adults will love it too. There's simply nothing like it.The story features Antwan, a coyote living wild in the Hollywood Hills; Buddy, a German shepherd that formerly starred in movies; and Miss Betty, a poodle living with the family that also owns Buddy. Antwan and Buddy run into one another one day, and a plan is eventually hatched for each to see how the other half lives. Can Buddy run with the pack? Can Antwan \\"pass\\" as a dog? The social commentary lying beneath this fanciful storyline shines through constantly. If it doesn't bring a smile to your face, you're a statue.Early on, Antwan and his little coyote sister, Ramona, are hiding in the bushes overlooking a dog park, where owners are walking their pets. Antwan is explaining the way of the world to her.\\"Here comes a working dog, a Border collie,\\" Antwan said, \\"only he's out of work. Rides around Hollywood in his owner's car looking for sheep to herd.\\"\\"I know what collies look like,\\" Ramona said. \\"They have that long, pointy face.\\"\\"Other dogs do, too,\\" Antwan said. \\"Your borzois, your Afghan hounds ... What's that white one coming?\\"\\"A greyhound?\\"\\"You're close, but it's a saluki.\\"\\"What's it do?\\"\\"Lays around the house thinking it's somebody.\\"Later, Antwan gets invited inside the house with Buddy and immediately scarfs down a plateful of cookies on the table. He thinks there must be something wrong with the dog:(Antwan) said, \\"Homes, can't you smell?\\"\\"Of course I can smell.\\"\\"You know cookies are sitting here and you don't eat none?\\"\\"We're not allowed cookies,\\" the big German dog said, sounding like a wimp. He turned his head to point to two dog dishes sitting on the floor, each with a name on it. Buddy on one, Miss Betty on the other.Antwan said, \\"Which one's yours, homes?\\"Ultimately, the plot centers around efforts to make Buddy feel like a hero again, like he was in the movies. Leonard peppers enough excitement into the 149-page novel to keep young readers plenty interested, and enough observations, allusions and commentary on social strata and the Hollywood movie industry to please adults. A book that can be read on many levels, A Coyote's in the House deserves the widest possible audience."},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Antwan, a coyote, notices Buddy, a German Shepard, in a fancy yard, in the Hollywood Hills. Buddy calls to Antwan, invites him in the house. Buddy wants to trade lives with Antwan. He wants Antwan to live in his house while he runs with the gang (pack). When the family comes home, the young, snippety daughter discovers Antwan in the house. She yells, \\"There's a coyote in the house!\\" Antwan escapes, but later returns as \\"Timmy.\\" The family adopts Timmy (Antwan). While living with them, Antwan comes to understand dogs and cats, but isn't sure he will ever like their masters.The females in the storyline are Miss Betty, the poodle princess, Lola, the movie star cat, and Romana, Antwan's sister. They get in the act when Miss Betty decides she doesn't like Buddy being depressed. She wants him to feel like the hero he played in the movies. She creates a plan involving Lola. (Lola steals the show during this thread of the storyline.)Elmore Leonard shares the tale of a wild coyote who swears never to be tamed. He likes running with his gang. The story begins with Antwan talking to his gang, about the various dogs and their backgrounds. Antwan, Buddy, and the rest experience various adventures. There are fun and of course gross moments. Kids will love it.Actor Neil Patrick Harris narrates A Coyote's in the House. He brings out the hip, jazzy personality of Antwan and the older, wiser tone of Buddy. But it's with Miss Betty and Lola that Harris seems to have the most fun. I have to say, Lola is my favorite"},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Elmore Leonard's A Coyote's in the House is a fun read and I recommend it for folks both young and old with one small reservation. Thinking about the book with my adult analytical mind disengaged, I found the story of Antwan the coyote, Buddy the movie star dog, and Miss Betty the show poodle to be a fun fast read. The story takes place in the Hollywood Hills where Antwan the coyote lives in the hills and Buddy the movie star dog lives in the house his family bought using the money Buddy made in the movies. Antwan and Buddy become friends and through the course of the story go through a series of adventures and switch rolls. My usual dislike of anthropomorphized animals did not wreck my enjoyment of this story. Now my reservation [adult analytical mind reengaged] - I found that Leonard's choice of names for the characters and use of urban dialect [inconsistently] for certain characters raised my stereotype hackles. When Leonard uses broad stereotypes in his adult novels, the audience is adult and sophisticated enough to get the point. It concerns me that a slightly less sophisticated young reader might get the wrong message from the characters in A Coyote in the House. I recommend that if you are an adult thinking of getting a copy of A Coyote's in the House for a young reader, scan a copy first to see whether you feel my reservation might be valid. Better yet, read it, enjoy it, and then decide whether to hand it down to the young reader."},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I was going to buy this book for my friend for her birthday. But after I bought it and started reading it, I couldn't let go of it! So I ended up buying 2 copies. One for my friend, and one for me.This book is so funny and I love how, for a change, the book tells the story from an animal's point of view. It really got you thinking about how a coyote's life is compared to a pet dog's. This book is great for reading when you're bored. You'll start off planning to read for only a few minutes but then you get addicted and end up reading for hours!"},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"This book is nicely written but I think the ending was a little unsatisfying.

I loved how Antwan was both lovable and a little dangerous, like all of Leonard's best characters. Picture Chili Palmer as a Hollywood Hills Coyote and you'll be pretty much on the mark.This will make an excellent animated film (take notice, Disney!)- one that, like \\"Shrek\\", will delight adults as much as kids. One star off for the brief toilet humor, which wasn't necessary...."},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"We'll just have to face it - some writers are so deft that they can switch genres as easily as changing jackets. That seems to be the case with Elmore Leonard who after winning legions of adult fans has now set about capturing the younger generation. He'll probably do it with \\"A Coyote's In The House, a delicious animal fable set in Hollywood.It's not easy being the voice of animals but performer Neil Patrick Harris is superb as listeners hear the story of Buddy, a past his prime German shepherd movie star; Antwan, a lone coyote who's always been down on his luck; and the gorgeous Miss Betty, a pulchritudinous poodle.Late one evening Antwan is poking among tempting garbage in the Hollywood Hills. Surely he'll find a more than appetizing meal there. Instead, he meets Buddy. A little bit bored and discouraged Buddy thinks it would be exciting to live as Antwan does, so why don't the two switch places? Well, Antwan has never been a cosseted coyote, so that sounds like a good deal to him. The rub is in passing Antwan off as a dog. But, it works.You know the old saying about the grass always looking greener - Buddy soon decides that he misses his family, and he sure doesn't like not having any attention at all.Leave it to Leonard to come up with a satisfying conclusion for all. Listen, laugh, and enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"Elmore Leonard is, of course, renowned for his realistic adult crime books, in which his amazing dialogue conveys the seamy side of the criminal caper genre. When I saw he had written a book for kids, I knew it would be perfect for my 12-year old son,who craves the dark humor and lack of sachrine that typify Leonard.We listened to this book together on tape. It is not a crime caper at all, but we were not disappointed. The book is considerably less dark than his work for adults (a change I frankly enjoyed), but the lean Leonard writing, the skill at avoiding undue sentiment and the dark humor all carried over. We couldn't put it down, so to speak. A clear winner.There was one matter, though, that disconcerted me. The book is concerned with two worlds: the domestic, behave-yourself world of Dogs, and the dangerous, do-what-you-want world of Coyotes. For some reason, Leonard injected race into this characterization--the Coyotes seem African-American. They have black names (Antwan,Cletus) and use black vernacular -- words like \\"homes\\" and \\"crew\\" for friend and gang, sister for female Coyote and so on. This Coyotes-as-African-Americans is reenforced in the book-on-tape version by the vocalization of Neil Patrick Harris. The Coyotes are not portrayed negatively in the book---ultimately their freedom and independence is given the highest value, and the Coyote hero is consistently cool and able. But there is a stereotyped aspect to the cultural characterization, and I found it unsettling---not quite sure what to make of it or why Leonard put it in there. There's some subtle racial image being portrayed here that parents may at least want to be aware of."},{"Title":"A Coyote's in the House (Leonard, Elmore)","review":"I really liked this book.

However, even though women have gained a great deal in the world of business over the last few decades, most books neglect the special challenges that face women in today's marketplace. Particularly as the pressures to succeed and maintain a &quot;traditional&quot; household build up to create an almost impossible ideal.Nicole Williams sets out to create the first guide for young, intelligent, sophisticated women in today's world. She provides the reader with advice on everything from appearance to attitude to personal and professional conduct. Most importantly for me, she manages to show that many of the women who have already gained great power and success in their chosen careers continue to struggle with their own self doubts and esteem issues. Nicole offers advice as a mentor and as a friend, erasing the tensions that often interfere when women interact in a competitive environment and offering support and guidance."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"The book was a big surprise to me in the fact that it was entertaining and an enjoyable read. Usually I dislike to read career books because they can be so boring and in the end not very useful for most people. This book had wonderful advice for women who are just starting out. I wouldnt think it was that good though for women who have been in their careers for awhile unless perhaps they wanted to see what the younger women are up to. I enjoyed the quotes in the book from successful women they ranged from Oprah to Jewel. I loved the added stories from women in the book. The one called stork free zone cracked me up. I also enjoyed the boxes in the book that was called one-on-one. I think this book is an excellent idea for a graduation present. One that they will be using over and over again. Plus thanking you for all their success from it."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"'Wildly Sophisticated' is subtitled &quot;a bold new attitude for career success&quot;. That alone tells you what the book is about - a book written in the 21st century for the working women of the 21st century. However, this book is not as cliche as some, including myself, may originally assume. It truly introduces new ideas, new concepts, and new all-around thought into the mind. The best part of this book by far, in my opinion, is the wonderful quotes from everyone from Drew Barrymore to Alanis Morisette to Helen Keller to Coco Chanel. They range from inspiring to funny empowering. This book is worth reading for the variety of quotes alone. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"I have always been a successful business woman but I have never felt fully fulfilled. I knew that although I was making great money and climbing up the corporate ladder that there had to be more to explore inside my field...not just inside my own mind. This book taught me the importance of having a mentor, since reading this book I have found a woman who inspires me and teaches me how to be better, happier, and more passionate every single day. Perhaps you already have a mentor but I guarantee that you will not read this and walk away empty handed."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"I work in the HR / Recruiting field and am always amazed by the number of people whom I interview that don't know what direction they want to go in their career.

Be different but not too different, you wouldn't want to stand out. Be sexy, but not to sexy, you wouldn't want people to think your sleeping with the boss. It's ok to carry last season's handbag. Honestly this book drove me nuts. It constantly states things and then takes it back. I ended up giving my copy away to a friend who is going into a business career. This book would probably be great for a Cosmopolitan reading, big city girl. I picture a girl like Jessica Simpson loving this book."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"White American women are the most over-priveleged class of people in the history of human civilization and this book merely serves to highlight the severity of this cultural disease in contemporary America. Nicole Williams has been all over the news lately hyping her book and the alleged wisdom of women using sex appeal to gain advantage in the work place.I'm a 42 year old white male in a management position at a financial firm. I have seen many, MANY sexual harassment lawsuits filed (none involving me, in case you're wondering) wherein a man says something \\"inappropriate\\", the human resources department is called in, an investigation is begun, depositions are taken and, quite often, a large cash sum is disbursed to the offended female. There is no, I mean NO, margin for error for the men in these cases and for me listen to Williams vacuously babble about playing around with issues that destroy some men's careers and lives makes me want to vomit. I am NOT saying that all sexual harassment lawsuits are frivolous. However, all kinds of allowances are made for unprofessional, inappropriate behavior by women that would get a man fired in two seconds.I love women as much as the next guy and greatly appreciate the many women who are intelligent, fair-minded and have a sense of humor about the sort of nonsense represented by books like Williams'. BUT...I am also weary and wary of the many young women, fresh out of our fine, fine universities, who have a dim understanding of basic economics but an extensive education in the myriad of evils perpetrated against them on a daily basis by the evil patriarchal phallocracy. By the way, in case you haven't heard, more than 50% of the management positions in America are now held by women.It is not too much to ask women in the workplace to act like adults instead of the whining over-aged infants embodied in Cosmo magazine and in books like Williams'."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"I am a thirty-something mom of 3 and I'm not currently interested in any career other than raising my children. I loved this book and it's great advice for women. It not only applies to women working towards a career, but those of us who just want to improve themselves. I found it too be funny, enlightening and thought provoking. I found myself rethinking how I portray myself amongst my friends, peers, and my community. Nicole Williams is witty and felt like someone I could just sit and chat with.

It was not life changing. There were no big secrets that everyone needs to know.One of my favorite things about the book was reading some of the stories that made me realize my career objectives, my ambition, and the way that I think about things aren't entirely unheard of. Sometimes I feel alone, like few others have the same perspective on setting sights high and progressively climbing towards that objective. It was nice to read testimonials of women who are an awful lot like me. It was also nice to know that my mindset is not found in everyone and that it has the potential to take me places.There is good, solid advice, humor, and some inspiration. I do not feel, however, like a new person, like huge questions have been answered, or that I am now prepared to make my future a reality in an unprecidented manner and in an incredibly short amount of time.On the other hand, it was enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I did!"},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"First off, the layout of Nicole William's \\"Wildly Sophisticated\\" makes it a fun read. In terms of context, William's spotlights many of the career-doubts and self-doubts that women in all stages of their career struggle with, such as childbearing and quitting a hated job.Reading \\"Wildly Sophisticated\\" was like sitting in on a conversation with women eager to enhance their careers, yet confused by conflicting feelings of undeserving success, short-selling themselves, and questioning whether they are doing enough or too much.William's layout includes inspiring quotes from actresses and \\"great thinkers\\" that help reinforce the message of her book- you are responsible for your career success. The \\"strategy\\" area adds practicality as she gives her readers immediate steps for fortifying their career path. With the \\"Career Confessions\\" section, Williams reminds every woman that she is not alone in her journey to at-once have everything she desires, most specifically a fulfilling career.If you are baffled with your career path or need to talk over your career plans, but no one is listening, pick up \\"Wildly Sophisticated\\". William's honest anecdotes easers the lonesome yoke of feeling like a career looser, while inviting women to a world where risk, embarrassment and failure are essential for success. William's tested advice speaks openly to the needs of ambitious career women."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"When I first heard of this book I was very excited to read it. I am getting ready to graduate from my university and was desperately trying to find a job in my field. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted and told employers I would take anything!After receiving this WILDLY SOPHISTICATED, I was amazed with my new confidence. This book reads very smoothly and doesn't bog you down with out of reach concepts. It contains read world terms and several exercies to help you figure out who you are and what you want. After going through the exercises, I was able to examine myself and where I was at, I was then able to figure out where I wanted to be.With my new found confidence and drive, spiffed up my resume, put on my most empowering suit and I attended a job fair at my university. Shaking hands and passing out resumes is what it was all about. I told potential employers exact what I wanted to do and how I could help them. I then went home and hand wrote notes to those companies I was most interested in. My response? Every Company I wrote a note to called me and after interviews I had several job offers.So this book gave me so much confidence and gave me a passion for my work and I know now exactly where I want to be.I recommend this book for graduating students or thoses already in the real world that aren't sure where they are or where they want to go."},{"Title":"Wildly Sophisticated: A Bold New Attitude for Career Success","review":"I've been looking for a job and reading career guides for months now.

The quotes from famous women and &quot;Career Confessions&quot; reassure you that other people have the same fears you do.

I was riding a high of &quot;I can do this&quot; after hearing her speak (graduation from college was right around the corner). However, after a few months of slogging through temp jobs to make ends meet, I had completely forgotten about Nicole's message and started viewing the coming years and student loan repayment with something close to panic--ok, it WAS panic.Thankfully, my little reminder note popped up the other day and I dashed out to buy this book. And Nicole didn't let me down. I'm following her advice and narrowing down my thousands of career ideas to the ones I'm truly passionate about. In the future I'm going to refer to Nicole's book when I start losing sight of what can be in my future: a great career, not just a paycheck.If you have the opportunity, go listen to her speak.

I wish someone had shown me this stuff even as early as high school, so that I could have saved myself a lot of soul searching and mistakes. The excercises she included really made me feel good about my particular talents and would have been helpful in establishing my career path.I am a 25-year old small-business owner (I do landscaping), and while I found a lot of the excercises and advice helpful, they were geared more towards people working in the business world, as employees rather than as employers.I think this book would be most helpful for those who are just beginning in their careers and perhaps need inspiration and support while they navigate common career issues and find their personal career path. I certainly wish someone had bought it for me years ago!

Of course, like any other book, there are somme haters that will poke fun of this book. How can you judge a book if you so not know what the book is about. I let my friends skim through the story, especially the basketball players and they said after reading this book, it is possible that he will return and lead the Wizards to their first of many championships. Read the book. It won't disappoint you."},{"Title":"Michael Jordan Returns to NBA (Again)","review":"I give this story two thumbs up! I loved the way the writer mixed fact and fiction. I also liked the fact that we get a peek into what Jordan must be like off the court. I was really stunned though when I was reading the part where Jordan was engaging in extra marital sex. The writer certainly avoided any controversy by coming up with a very imaginative way for Jordan to have an affair without being unfaithful to his wife. Right now, the media is still speculating about whether Jordan will return to the game. I think this writer presented a believable scenario about how and when Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan first discussed the issue and agreed to go on diet and exercise regimens to get in shape. That's all Barkley has been talking about on TNT during half times of the NBA games. They've been weighing him and now it looks like he's going to be in Chicago so Jordan can insure that he steps up his exercise program. This writer must be psychic. I believe she's right on the money by having Jordan return to the NBA in her story."},{"Title":"Michael Jordan Returns to NBA (Again)","review":"I enjoyed Genie Saint Louis' story about Michael Jordan.

With a warrior's heart and an artist's grace, Jordan long ago transcended the sport to become one of the 20th century's global icons.On the court, his almost mythic flair for the spectacular prompted former Los Angeles Laker superstar Magic Johnson to say simply, &quot;There's Michael, then there's all the rest of us&quot;Off the court, Jordan's ability to alter markets and drive the business of his marketing partners is unprecedented.Through it all, Jordan showed the world that greatness, true greatness, comes from the inside out. He remains perhaps the greatest practice player in the history of sports, his desire to improve upon his own example legendary. When critics questioned his all-around ability, he became the game's most dominant defensive player at his position. When teams decided to close down the lane and eliminate drives to the basket, he became a deadly jump shooter. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson had the most successfully teams of the 1980s but never won more than two consecutive championships. The Bulls won three straight--twice.In Michael Jordan Returns to the NBA Again, the writer pulls back the curtain on one of the most remarkable sports figure of the 20th century and delves into the question of why he returns to the NBA after going out on top in 1998."},{"Title":"Michael Jordan Returns to NBA (Again)","review":"Michael Jordan is not just a basketball star, or a baseball player, or a golfer, or a walking endorsement, or a motivator.

The author documents and substantiates his historical analysis of the religious and political ebb and flow that lead up to the 20th century in the U.S. He reveals what few current historical books will say, that Christianity was alive and well and at the same time, under far more attack and opposition than is commonly understood.The current views on our American history seem to suffer from two extremes: those that argue this was a Christian nation exclusively and those that argue this was a nation built on Enlightenment principles with little or no Christian influence, except from a few radical and boisterous bigots. I find Bacon's survey of American history refreshingly in agreement with Ira Stoll's biography of Samuel Adams and David McCullough's biography of John Adams.He paints the period prior to, during, and after the Revolution as a time of contention between the religious roots of Christianity and the followers of the Enlightenment who contended for a world view more consistent with our present day secular humanists, a time when the battle for the heart and soul of the new nation was fought intensely with times of progress and failure. The ebb and flow he describes is as vivid and detailed as a good drama made for TV. You may find yourself stopping to translate terms used in a context which is not familiar to the 21st century. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"A history of American Christianity (The American church history series)","review":"I found somewhat difficult to read but will continue to work thru the text.

Because 22 of 27 people so far have found his/her review &quot;helpful&quot; I feel obliged to put in a word, though not on account of any agenda. Opinions on translation are nearly as personal as opinions on more recognizable arts, yet some objections are also clearly mistaken.The reviewer below complains that paragraphs have been invented. S/he uses this as a representative example of the numerous 'mistakes'. Yes, paragraphs have been invented but if you look at other modern translations - here on Amazon, where you can use the Look Inside feature - you will notice the paragraphs in Frame's and Raffel's versions break off at the same point as Cohen's, for whatever common purpose they have in mind (I assume readability). Urquhart's translation (incomplete, 17th century, finished by Motteux) is regarded as a classic, but it is not the &quot;best&quot;, the most accurate or the most readable. The reviewer also insists Cohen's translation is not literal enough, as if this were a major fault. Literalness is not the most important, much less the only principle by which to judge a translation, it is one among many. Many readers who pick up the Urquhart today would probably be put off by Rabelais. (I am put off by the Raffel, though it is recent, so contemporaneity is not an overriding concern either.) Also remember Rabelais was writing in the early 16th century, and the language has changed significantly, so even the average French reader today engages in a certain degree of &quot;translation&quot; - comparing every word and syntactical deviation between the French and English texts is misleading. Literary translation is an inherently faulty art, and the translator has priorities that differ from the author's (you can't always be faithful to the author when the reader needs more attention); s/he is bound to make compromises. Not that comparison is impossible, nor that there is no such thing as a poor translation, but Cohen was one of the best in his trade and this translation, which I too have compared with the original text, is not particularly &quot;worse&quot; or &quot;better&quot; than Frame et al. Each of them lapses where another succeeds, each of them make choices that may be more or less accurate, reader-friendly, or grammatically consistent. To pick the first paragraph as an example again, Rabelais alludes to a popular saying of &quot;Flacce&quot; in the original - Frame translates the name as Flaccus, Cohen as Horace. The latter choice may seem egregious at first, but consider: Flaccus was a popular name in Rome and may stand for nearly any one of the several Roman personalities with Flaccus as a last name, whereas it would be quite clear to Latin readers, which most or all literate people of Rabelais' period and society were, that Rabelais is talking about Horace, whose full name was Quintus Horatius Flaccus. Frame remains literal, but Cohen opts to remove a possible early stumble for the contemporary reader. Yet, on the next page, Cohen does not translate the inscription HIC BIBITUR, but Frame does: &quot;Here you drink&quot;.If you want to choose a suitable translation, in this case, you have to decide which one appeals to you most by browsing several first; the scholarly-minded will have to learn the language anyway if they want to carry out a textual analysis. There are also previous versions by LeClerq and Putnam (one of the highly recommended translators of Cervantes). And of course, once you read Rabelais, the irony of discussing academic questions about his work won't evade you; though if it does, then you probably did pick a bad translation ..."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"If you thought the vulgar humor in such films as PORKY'S and AMERICAN PIE was a modern phenomena, you're in for a shock: both are fairly mild in comparison with the works of Rabelais, which plumb the depths of human crassness in full Renaissance style. Writing before European authors had codified the novel as a form, Rabelais presents a series of very episodic tales about the adventures of the giant Gargantua, his son Pantagruel, and Pantagruel's trickster friend Panurge--and the three vomit, belch, fart, and engage in a number of equally distasteful bodily functions across page after page in some of the funniest writings found in the whole of Western literature.But unlike contemporary bad-taste comedy, Rabelais is hardly willing to let his reader go with just a laugh. There is sharp intelligence behind his naughty laughter--and he directs his considerable wit at everything from education to fashionable society in page after page of unspeakably hilarious incident. (My own favorite passage concerns the trick Panurge plays upon the fashionable, church-going lady who spurns his attentions; it never fails to throw me into near-hysterical laughter.) Vividly written and extremely memorable, GARGANTUA AND PANTAGRUEL is the sort of stuff they don't teach in highschool... and more's the pity: it would probably convert more students to the classics than all the Romantics combined. Truly serious scholars should, of course, compare various translations, but the Cohen translation will do the trick for the more casual reader. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"Some years ago I read a quote by Rabelais -- something about whether a chimera bombinating in a vacuum could devour second intentions -- and I sensed that his humor might appeal to me. \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel,\\" his literary landmark and the source of that quote, is a virtual encyclopedia of Renaissance satire that contrives a heroic epic as a backdrop for a comprehensive commentary of medieval and classical history and mythology.The story, which concerns the adventures of the giant Gargantua, his son Pantagruel, and Pantagruel's friend Panurge, is completely silly; just scan the chapter titles in the table of contents for an indication. Silly, but not stupid: Rabelais is a serious scholar who has written a book that is not intended to be taken seriously. An epicure with an insatiable appetite for learning and a fascination with bodily functions, he believes that wine, scatology, and the pursuit of knowledge are inseparable. The book is all codpieces, urination, defecation, and flatulence at the service of satirizing the pedantry in the medical, legal, ecclesiastical, and academic professions as they existed in the sixteenth century. It should be noted that Rabelais's satire is generally playful and cheerful rather than bitter and mean-spirited, so the book's tone is always light even if its content is very erudite.The plot, such as it is, is episodic rather than unified. Gargantua defends his country, Utopia, from invasion by King Picrochole of Lerne, in a war started by an argument between Utopian shepherds and Lernean cake-bakers; Pantagruel and Panurge then defend Utopia from invasion by Anarch, King of the Dipsodes; Panurge conducts inquiries among a variety of experts on whether or not he should get married, which leads to several discussions about cuckoldry, impotence, and cuckoldry as a consequence of impotence; and Pantagruel and Panurge, along with their monkish friend Friar John and several cohorts, embark on a sea voyage to consult the oracle of the Temple of the Bottle, visiting many strange islands and encountering many bizarre creatures along the way. As mentioned, it is of course all nonsense, but it is a definite precursor to the more farcical works of Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, Lewis Carroll, and James Joyce, and for that reason it has significant value as a ribald curiosity."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"I am not commenting on Rabelais, whom I would give 5 stars, but rather on his translator J.M. Cohen. Cohen's translation of Gargantua departs so far from Rabelais' syntax and vocabulary that it is outright scandalous. If Rabelais uses the phrase &quot;et &agrave; non autres&quot;, you can count on Cohen rendering it &quot;and to everyone&quot; instead of the correct &quot;and to no others&quot;. If Rabelais wanted to say &quot;and to everyone&quot; nothing prohibited him from doing so: French is no different from English in at least this respect. There is always someone in translating classes who asks the teacher, say, &quot;Can't one render the phrase 'es ist nicht unmoglich' 'it is possible?'&quot; as opposed to the correct &quot;It is not possible.&quot; The answer, of course, is &quot;OF COURSE NOT! THIS IS NOT YOUR TEXT; IT IS THE AUTHOR'S: YOU'RE _HIS_ TRANSLATOR!!!&quot; But Cohen's rendering above is only one example; there are much graver mistakes at higher structural levels: one need look not beyond the first paragraph, for example: it turns out that Cohen's paragraph breaks off after the third or fourth sentence, while in fact the original text begins with a paragraph that extends for, if I remember, more than one page. Apparently Cohen thinks that he can invent paragraphs for Rabelais whenever he feels it will make things more clear or easier to read. If such intentions don't bother you, then fine, buy this text; but if translators who refuse to say things as the author said things bother you, then order instead the very good (i.e., literal) Urquart translation."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"Gargantua and Pantagruel is a vast, comfortable book, bristling with crudity, humor, invention, and an erudition reminiscent of Robert Burton or Isaac Disraeli. It is one of those books which, before reading, I knew to be earthy, I suspected to be boring, and which, by virtue of my low expectations, was almost sure to win me over. The plot (a description of the life and times of Gargantua, and his son Pantagruel) exists only as a springboard for the author's verbal games, and the espousement of his philosophy, which is essentially: eat, drink, and be merry. It might be added that Rabelais never appears disingenuous in this -- in fact, there are chapters where one suspects he was drunk at the time of composition. Fortunately for the reader he is a happy drunk, and like many others of that sort, hospitably invites the reader to approach his work in the same state.In addition to being written by an author of great learning, earthiness, and personal charm, Gargantua and Pantagruel is remarkably eccentric. Reading it, I sometimes felt as if I were watching a Peter Greenaway movie that went on for days. There is chapter describing Gargantua's clothes, a chapter that is an inventory of the various games he played at school, chapters consisting of rhyming epithets for certain characters, chapters listing different kinds of food, etc. One is a list of unusual deaths suffered by real historical figures. Another discusses the death of the giant Slit-Nose, whose diet consisted of windmills. The haggling scene from Life of Brian is prefigured here, and for the entirety of Book Three, Pantagruel and his friend Panurge debate whether or not the latter should marry, much to the delight of the reader. In short, it feels more avant-garde than almost anything published today, which may only be another way of saying that it is a classic."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"Reading doesn't get much more enjoyable than books 1 and 2 of Gargantua and Pantagruel. Both are wonderfully ludicrous, playfully crass, consistently hilarious and jolly good fun. Of course, there's more to Rabelais than all that but you get the distinct impression that the man himself would rather be entertaining than painstakingly examined - and entertain he most certainly does!For me, book 3 doesn't live up to the first two. I admit to finding it a bit dull! The trademark humour is still there but it's neither as concentrated nor as consistent and that's a shame. Book 4 is excellent once again, although I still feel it doesn't reach the glorious heights (or should that be dirty depths?) of the first two, whilst book 5 is rather bizarre!All in all, Gargantua and Pantagruel is brilliant but I couldn't give it the full 5 stars because of that third book."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"I know that this was considered an important transition between renaissance literature and the beginnings of what we call the novel, but I found this next to impossible to get into. Rabelais might not have invented toilet humor, but he stretches it out about as far as it can possibly go (which ultimately, isn't that far). The constant references to glands and bodily fluids get old real fast. I suppose that in the 16th century, the fact that people poop, pee, spit, vomit, sneeze, fornicate and fart was cause for endless laughter, and those things can still be funny, just not for 700 pages on end. The whole thing is a colorful and inventive mess, but a mess none the less. If you're looking for something to read from this era, try Don Quixote instead, it's got plenty of toilet humor but actually has good characters and a delirious narrative structure which really puts this bloated thing to shame."},{"Title":"Gargantua and Pantagruel: The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin Classics)","review":"Rabelais is much heralded for his skewering of the rich and powerful. Frankly he does not measure up to Thomas More, Machiavelli, Erasmus or Castiglione or their writings. Some may find his works clever or cute, they may certainly rattle pre-conceptions of the stiffness of the era. As for me, it lacked wit and was mostly just crude, which some find to be groundbreaking but in fact crudeness has existed through out the ages."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The introduction notes that Trollope wrote the first novel sequences, the Barsetshire and the Palliser novels, in English. The Barsetshire books were written over a twelve year period. Mr. Crawley, perpetual curate at Hogglestock, is accused of stealing a cheque for twenty pounds. Grace Crawley, his daughter, nineteen years old, is a teacher. Dean Arabin has undertaken to finance the studies of Bob Crawley, currently in school at Marlborough, and headed for Cambridge. The son of Archdeacon Grantly, Major Grantly, is interested in Grace Crawley. Griselda Grantly, daughter of the archdeacon, is now Marchioness of Hartletop.Mr. Crawley's role in the twenty pound cheque matter is a muddle, notwithstanding his innate honestly and his superior intellect and academic achievement. Grace Crawley and Lily Dale of Allington are friends. For Crawley's hearing, the board of magistrates includes Lord Lufton, a member of the DeCourcy family, and Dr. Thorne. Mr. Robarts advises Mrs. Crawley that he will arrange bail, should it be necessary.The case is bound over to be heard by the Assizes in April and Mr. Crawley is released on bail, (he had refused to be represented by a lawyer). Bitterness is produced by poverty in the poor gentry. The Crawley family is in such circumstances. Behind Mr. Crawley's humility there is crushing pride. Later when Mr. Robarts tries to persuade him to accept the services of an attorney, Crawley reponds that he doesn't want to obstruct justice and is reluctant to mislead a jury.Grace's mother seeks to shield her from the trouble and she is sent to visit Lily Dale. Mrs. Proudie worries about the souls at Hogglestock and tries to have Crawley removed from his curacy. At the preliminary stage it is not really within the bishop's power to act against Mr. Crawley. John Eames, Grace's cousin, undertakes a journey to uncover the truth in Crawley's case.Trollope is particularly good on pecuniary matters, changes of fortune. He writes movingly, also, of honor. The portrait of Mr. Crawley, of stiff-necked pride, is a wonder. The novel is a highly satisfactory end to the Barset sextet."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"Trollope ends his Barsetshire cycle of novels with the longest one of the series, but the one with the weakest plot and with a most unsatisfying resolution. But that's OK and it is usual with Trollope. He is not writing a mystery novel or a complex spy thriller. His plots may well be flat and uninteresting, but his characters gain all the more.After all, real life seldom offers us complicated situations. Whether fortune smiles or frowns on us, we understand our lot pretty well, even if we often fail to act as we should. If our lives and situations are simple, we are not. Trollope offers us brilliantly recreated complex people from which even casual readers may draw insight into their own lives.As usual, there are no white hats and black hats. The main character, Josiah Crawley, is an unimpeachable, principled man accused of theft. He could not have done it, but looks guilty. He stubbornly refuses all charity and comes off as dour. He wears his tattered pauper's cassock with sinful pride. But he suffers greatly and so we sympathize, empathize even as we dislike him.Lily Dale stubbornly resists her suitor Johnny Eames. One could think of her as an early feminist if she simply stated that a woman's happiness does not necessarily require sharing her life with a man. But no: she turns down Eames because she refuses to get over a previous heartbreak.Johnny Eames is continually refused by a Lily Dale who only offers him the \\"F\\" word (i.e. friendship), so he flirts with other women but stubbornly refuses committing to any one else because of his devotion to Lily.Archdeacon Grantly stubbornly refuses to accept that his son may marry whomever he wishes. His son, Major Grantly, stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that his father has a right to at least have feelings about his choice of a mate.In the end, some relent some do not; material or matrimonial happiness comes to some of the characters but not to others. But true happiness comes only to those who trust and hope whether or not they realize their temporal desires.Indeed my favorite line in the novel is spoken by Mr. Harding, the hero of the first Barset novel and a man who sees the good even in his foes. \\"Why should anyone weep for those who go away full of years - and full of hope?\\" Happiness is to trust and to hope.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"Took me awhile with the holidays and all, but I finally finished last week - a wonderful wrap-up for a very enjoyable series. I had devoured the usual 19th-century novels that would appeal to any young woman of sense (and sensibility): beloved Jane, the melodramatic Bronte sisters, and even dabbled in the lesser-known Mrs. Gaskell (\\"Cranford\\" - loved it!); heck, I even forced down some Dickens when compelled in school (not a fan in my younger days, but there was nary a Darcy nor a Knightley nor a Heathcliffe in sight - YAWN! What's a girl to do?!) But I had never read Trollope until this series, and I am so glad I discovered him. I now haunt my used book store looking for ANY of his books - I am grateful someone is compelling students to read him, although when I said in my Amazon review of \\"Small House at Allington\\" that he should be more widely read, a commenter wryly noted \\"better not, or this review page would be clogged with 50-100 students whining about how boring he is!\\"Well, the plot of \\"Last Chronicle\\" is described above - quirky, extremely poor clergyman appears to have stolen a check, he is torn apart by self-doubt, his family supports him but worries as their future fate hangs in the balance, sides are taken, honor is questioned - sounds simple, but since this is Trollope, you know you're in for a grand tale! I love Trollope's writing - his ability to gently skewer the pomposities and eccentricities of his landed gentry, clerics of all ranks and regular folks both in the country and in London; his humorous dialogue; his ease moving back and forth between myriad plotlines - it feels like sitting down for a comfortable coze with an old friend over a cup of tea. As with the previous entry in the series, \\"Small House at Allington\\", this story takes us beyond the confines of Barsetshire to London, where we again follow Johnny Eames and his adventures as a private secretary to the hilarious windbag Sir Raffle and young man about town. I read in another review that one of the many sub-plots involving a blossoming romance between John's painter friend and an heiress was totally superfluous and added nothing to the plot and should be skipped over; I admit I took this advice toward the last quarter of the book, but I skimmed closely because some of the romantic histrionics and cheesy dialogue were very funny. Trollope doesn't just throw in extra characters to fill up space or deliver a line - he always gives us something special about every character, even if it's just a footman's passing thought as he escorts someone into a room - that brings that character to life and gives them dimension. It's an amazing gift, and such a joy to read, you don't want to miss anything!"},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The novel is finely written. The reader would do well to read the first five in the series, as this calls more than most on things from the past. Trollope delights in bringing and tying together most of the major characters of his series in a satisfying stew. Septamus Harding is especially well drawn and unifies the entire series. The reader learns much more of Josiah Crawley, whose travails form the spine of the plot. All in all the reader is treated to a portrayal of Victorian society that strikes me as entirely believable."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"I see I am in the minority here, but I don't feel the finale of the Barsetshire novels is up to the mark of the works that preceded it. It cannot be called a disappointment, exactly, since it has moments of grandeur and brilliance, and as always Trollope is unfailingly, even painfully true to his people. Lily Dale's and Johnny Eames's non-courtship is brought to a heartbreaking non-conclusion. The fall of Mrs Proudie could hardly be more satisfying, even sad, and I was moved to tears to see the last of Mr Harding. Johnny's dalliance with a manhunter is truly original and wonderfully rendered, by turns hilarious and scary.But the plot construction is poor and the book feels bloated, overwritten, about 100 pages too long. The nominal love interests, Grace and Henry, are just ghosts of characters, and to make his plot work Trollope resorts to the embarrassing tactic of keeping the parties who will instantly unravel it off-stage and incommunicado for hundreds of pages. Meanwhile we are treated to repetitive scenes that show us the frustrating, self-pitying Josiah Crawley being frustrating and self-pitying.THE LAST CHRONICLE's chief pleasure -- and for a Trollope reader it is a very great pleasure -- is in seeing all our old favorites from the previous novels respond to the Crawleys' predicament, and in having Lily's and Johnny's story told to its end, replete with the new cast of characters Johnny has taken up. I would not have missed it. I only wish Trollope had had a strong-minded editor by."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The best way to spend a winter's night?

Very fast and enjoyable novel--my second favorite of Trollope's after Barchester Towers."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"THE LAST CHRONICLE OF BARSET is one of the great novels in the English language, and yet it is not widely read. The reason for this is obvious: it is the LAST novel in the Barsetshire series of novels, and a relatively small number make it all the way through the previous five volumes. This is a shame, because while all the previous novels are quite excellent and thoroughly entertaining, the final novel in the series is a work of an entirely different level of magnitude.This novel is also one of the darkest that Trollope wrote. The moral dilemma in which Crawley finds himself would seem to belong more readily to the world of Dostoevsky than Victorian England.Can this novel be read on its own, without reading the novels that precede it? Yes, but I do feel that it is best read after working through the other books in the series first. This is hardly an unfortunate situation, since all the books in the series are superb (with the exception of the first novel, THE WARDEN, which, while nice, is merely a prelude to the far superior five novels that came after it). Many of the characters in THE LAST CHRONICLE appeared first as characters in the other novels, and the central character of the book, Crawley, himself appeared earlier.Trollope is...one of the most entertaining writers the English language has produced. At this point I have read around 20 of his novels, and fully intend to read more. But of all his books, this one might be his finest. The only two that I feel are close to the same level are his incredible books THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT (possibly the finest work on excessive jealousy since OTHELLO). Anyone who loves the English novel owes it to him or herself to read as many of these volumes as possible. My recommendation would be to read first the six novels in the Barsetshire Chronicles, and then to move on to the other two novels I mentioned. If still hooked, then try his other major series of novels, variously known as the Political novels or the Palliser novels or the Parliamentary novels, which begin with CAN YOU FORGIVE HER?"},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The Rev. Josiah Crawley, impoverished curate of Hogglestock, has been accused of stealing a check for 20 pounds. Confused about how the check came into his possession, he has no defense to offer. Mrs. Proudie, shrewish tyrant over her husband, the Bishop, is determined to hound Crawley out of his meager position. Also caught up in the problem is young Henry Grantly, son of the aristocratic Archdeacon, who is in love with the beautiful and intelligent daughter of the accused man--a match that his father bitterly opposes.This is the main plot, but there is a wealth of subplots, each worthy of its own novel. Among these is a continuation of John Eames' wooing of Lily Dale, carried over from &quot;The Small House at Allington.&quot;The Last Chronicle is the longest of the Barsetshire novels--and the best, considerably better in style than the more popular &quot;Barchester Towers.&quot; Trollope's characterizations are, as usual, superb, among the very best in all literature. He skillfully interweaves all the various strands of the novel into a very satisfying whole.

This book merits consideration as a true masterwork."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"As time passes, the novels of Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) seem to gain in freshness, stature and influence. He lived long enough to see his modest reputation fade, in contrast to that of many of his famous novelist contemporaries. Nowadays the situation seems to be reversing.Of special merit, amongst his huge output, are the so-called Barsetshire (\\"clerical\\") novels, and the so-called Palliser (\\"political\\") novels. Of the former, the last and longest is \\"The Last Chronicle of Barset\\". Not only are there fresh concerns, complications and current affairs introduced here, but there are also fond and final appearances of people and places encountered in the earlier Barsetshire novels. Everybody's favourite literary virago, Mrs Proudie, is again denouncing and dominating everybody. Trollope even contrives to create a character who has the temerity to say to her, \\"Peace, Woman!\\"There are the innumerable characters of marriageable age, whose names are perhaps more memorable than their characters, whose charming dialogues and relationship problems are deftly laid out and interwoven. Above all, there is master story-teller Anthony Trollope, admitting finally that for him Barset has been a real place, a place where he as been induced to wander too long by his \\"love of old friendships, and by the sweetness of old faces\\".Superb TV and radio adaptations of Trollope's Barsetshire novels have appeared in recent years. His novels read aloud well, too, and audio cassette readings, some of them unabridged, can provide endless hours of rich listening pleasure."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"How one man could hold in his mind so much of his age, and then relate it back to us peopled with so many and varied characters in--how many? 20?-- interconnected novels of surpassing richness of detail and sagacity of moral observation, is a great mystery of human psychology.&quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; is surely one of the most successful and satisfying of the whole Barset and Palliser series, illustrating perhaps better than any of the former Trollope's admirable gift for creating multi-dimensional characters that are as recognizable to us today as they were in his time."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The Last Chronicle of Barset is the final, longest (862 pages) and best of the Barset novels of Anthony Trollope (1815-1882). The novels comprising the clerical series are: The Warden; Barchester Towers; Doctor Thorne; Framley Parsonage; The Small House at Allington and The Last Chronicle of Barset. This novel was written and published serially in 1866-1867. It is a massive three decker in the Victorian style. The prolific Trollope authored over 40 novels, short-stories and travel accounts in his storied career. The Last Chronicle of Barset has several characters and stories any one of which could have made a full fledged novel in itself! The main players are:Josiah Crawley-The eccentric pastor of the poor Hogglestock bricklayer parish is accused of stealing a check for 20 pounds. Lawyer Mr. Toogood, the Grantleys and Lady Lufton seek to win him acquittal. We see this gloomy man put his wife Mary and daughters Grace and Jane through the purgatory of suffering and dread as his case is due to be brought up before the assizes. Crawley is one of the most interesting characters in all of Trollope's voluminous writing.Several love stories are reported:a. Johnny Eames still loves Lily Dale. Lily jilted him for the rake Adolphus Cosbie seven years previous to the opening of the novel. Johnny has a good job in London but Lily still says no. Will she marry Johnny or will she wed Adolphus? Or will she write two letters after her name \\"OM\\" for Old Maid? Read the novel and see!b. Major Henry Grantley is the son of archdeacon Grantley. He is widowed with a small daughter. Henry falls in love with the intelligent and beautiful Grace Crawley daughter of the accused thief the Rev. Josiah Crawley. Will true love conquer?c. The London artist Conway Dalrymple is torn between a married womanand Miss Van Siever. Whom will he choose as his life's companion? This story has little to do with the action in Barsetshire and was added by Trollope to fulfill his contract for so many pages per month to a periodical.In addition to the mystery regarding the theft of the check and the usual Trollopian love stories there are two key deaths of major characters in the Barset series:a. The Rev. Septimus Harding-the aged fathere of Eleanor Arabin the dean's wife and Susan Harding the spouse of the archedeacon of Barset.Mr. Harding is one of the kindest men seen in the pages of English fiction.b. Mrs. Proudie-the busybody, interfering, harridan who has made her husband her uxorious tool dies of a heart attack in this final volume. She is one of the best comical characters in fiction.There is also a suicide of a minor character Mr. Broughton.I have read these Barset novels for many years and they are eminently worthy of rereading! Countless hours of pleasure and profitable wisdom await those who have the time and patience to devote to a huge Victorian novel. I was touched by Trollope's final paragraphs in which he bids adieu to Barset and the characters he so lovingly created with his genius pen."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The Last Chronicle of Barset,the final book in the Barsetshire series, is among the best novels Anthony Trollope ever wrote, and that is saying something special, for Trollope is, in my opinion, one of the finest English novelists. The Last Chronicle of Barset brings together many of the characters introduced to the reader in the first five novels of the series; we are happy to see our old friends back in action one last time.Septimus Harding, the Warden in the first novel of that name in the series, makes his final, quiet appearance. He is a good and loving man, a model clergyman, and a friend, even to his adversaries. His son-in-law, Archdeacon Grantly, takes center stage again. We remember him well from his central role in battling the new Bishop of Barchester in Barchester Towers, the second and most famous book in the series -- not as good, I think, as the novel being reviewed here. Now the archdeacon is angry with his son Henry over Henry's choice of bride, the lovely Grace, daughter of the main character in the story, the reverend Josiah Crawley, who is accused of stealing a check made out for twenty pounds. The mystery of how Mr. Crawley got the money begins the final novel and is not resolved until the end of the book. One of Trollope's most famous villain's, the Bishop of Barchester's wife, Mrs. Proudie, takes a great interest in Mr. Crawley's case, much to the dismay of her long suffering husband. We have watched Mrs. Proudie cause trouble and vexation since she was introduced to us in Barchester Towers.Many more of our friends from past novels in the series make their entrances and exits as loose ends from previous stories finally get resolved. For example, Johnny Eames and Lily Dale, two of the main characters in The Small House at Allington, my least favorite novel in the series, at last come to a final decision concerning their relationship.The reader of this review may be wondering if it is necessary to read all the books in the Barsetshire Novels to get full value, enjoyment, and appreciation of Trollope's final story. I don't think so, not that I don't recommend reading the first five books of the series. Trollope is careful to include enough information for the reader to make sense of the various plot lines drawn from the previous stories.The Last Chronicle of Barset is a wonderful book, almost certain to delight lovers of classic English literature. It is Trollope at the height of his powers. He is a reader's best friend; that is the highest recommendation I can give for him.One last comment: I read the Folio edition of this novel, which I recommend. This version includes many fine drawings carefully placed throughout the text; I think most readers will enjoy this complement to the story."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"There is no better way to immerse yourself in 19th century England than the works of Anthony Trollope. About every 10 years I re-read the \\"Barsetshire Novels\\" and each time re-discover what a engaging storyteller he was, what a perceptive creator of character, what an acute chronicler of his times. The Barsetshire novels are all lengthy (except for the slim prequel, \\"The Warden\\"), and \\"Last Chronicle\\" is the longest of all, but by the time you get to it you're glad it's so mammoth because you don't want to leave Trollope's world. His plots are simple: who will marry who, who will inherit what, who will rise in the Victorian world and who will fall. But his characters are so endearing, so engaging, and - some of them - so enraging. I can't recommend Trollope highly enough for anyone who wants to understand the 19th century. His books are more rural in focus than Dickens, quieter in tone and more realistic of plot. Just finishing up \\"Last Chronicle of Barset\\" and I practically want to start the whole thing over again."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The core of the final volume of Anthony Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire is bad trouble in some families that we know from previous meetings: the Crawleys and the Grantlys, 2 clerical families from opposite ends of the social scale.Archdeacon Grantly, from the upper crust of the pie, is not a bad man, he is just a snob and a conceited fool, whereas Curate Crawley is dirt poor, highly educated and intelligent, but unable to manage his affairs. He is always arguing with somebody, he never accepts help, he is a total pain. Somehow he has managed to maneuver himself into a position where he is accused of theft ... And he cannot account for the money that he is said to have stolen. He can't remember where he got it from and he gives, in his confusion, contradictory explanations. Public opinion seems to settle on this unsavory conclusion: the curate certainly took the money, probably unknowingly, hence he must be a madman if he is not a thief. Hovering over the sad affair is the she-Beelzebub, proud Mrs. Proudie, the mean wife of the stupid bishop.Trollope's sympathies were solidly with the underdog, but he doesn't simplify things for us. We can compare Mr. Crawley's predicament with Septimus Harding's, the Warden's in the eponymous first volume of the series. Mr. Harding was accused of a kind of abuse of his position that he could not entirely refute... And thus he resigned. Crawley's despair is worse. He is stubborn, proud and obstinate and will not be helped. Certainly not by a lawyer. We feel like kicking him in the pants.Trollope at his best was a master in following the meandering minds of undecided, uncertain, and confused people. This novel is certainly among his best, despite its 860 pages. The Crawley story is its strong core.Its weakness are the women. Hair raising lunacy on the part of the heroines makes them reject the right guys. The absurd Lily Dale annoyed me already in the Small House. She gets jilted by a turd and remains loyal to the turd. Or the equally unbearable Grace Crawley who sends away her suitor because she does not want him to sacrifice his prospects by an alliance with the daughter of a thief.Also, being the nit picker that I am, I find fault with the following: this novel will not work so well as a stand alone volume. It is full of the people from the previous 5 volumes of the series, and you miss a lot if you don't know these people from former encounters.At 860 pages, the novel has serious overweight. It could have been slimmed down by trimming the London chapters. They are fluff. This is Barchester, after all."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"Over the last year I read all 12 novels comprising Trollope's two \\"series\\"... the Pallisers and the Barset novels. On the whole, I'd have to say I liked the Palliser novels much better, which could be attributed to the fact they are the later works, and thus more refined and mature. I did find it interesting, however, to watch Trollope's advancement in style from THE WARDEN to this LAST CHRONICLE... the Barset novels did come early in his career as a writer, and so it is much easier to see the evolution in the writing. I would say somewhere between FRAMLEY PARSONAGE and SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON, we see the true Trollope emerge.But I digress ... after the first five novels in the series introduce new characters, this final novel brings them all back to the stage for the final \\"tying up of loose ends.\\" With the lamentable exception of Obadiah Slope, almost every major figure in the past novels makes some amount of an appearance in this work. From that standpoint alone, it is a very enjoyable read - seeing the characters whose lives we have observed come back for a final tale makes for a bittersweet ending.As I alluded to in my title above, the novel is broken into multiple storylines that have varying degrees of intersection with one another, as is common in Trollope's work. The \\"A\\" story finds Trollope taking one of his incidental characters from FRAMLEY PARSONAGE, and thrusting him to the forefront as our \\"lead character.\\" I don't know that I would quite call him the protagonist of the novel, but it is the events surrounding him that form the nucleus of the story. Josiah Crawley has been accused of stealing a check for 20 pounds, and as he cannot remember exactly where he got it from, he spends the majority of the novel dreading the coming court trial and inevitable loss of his meager income as a perpetual curate in a small country parish, while at the same time refusing, in his pride, to give up his position until he has to. Crawley is an odd character, to say the least, for Trollope to hang a novel on ... he's half-mad, destitute, extremely prideful, and generally unpleasant. He's difficult to cheer for, which is what makes it hard for me to really call him the protagonist.Lacking a proper protagonist, then, this really becomes more of an ensemble castas we follow the various characters who are affected by this coming embarassment on the clergy of Barset, and we see how it turns into a rallying point for the two \\"factions\\" ... namely, the Bishop and Mrs. Proudie, who want Crawley immediately removed from his position even before the trial, and those who are of the \\"anti-Proudie faction\\" who wish to aid Crawley, despite his refusal of their help. Here we find the Grantly's, the Luftons, and a lawyer working pro-bono named Toogood.These are the main elements of the novel, and make for an entertaining and page-turning read, which is remarkable given the sheer length of the novel, easily 200+ pages longer than SMALL HOUSE. The story comes to a head when one character, with one simple bit of information, turns the entire issue on its head. In fact, this moment in the novel very nearly feels like Trollope simply realizing \\"well, it's time to wrap things up, so let's take the quickest way out of here.\\" Were it not for Trollope's expert skill in unfolding his characters and their reactions to the events around them, it would indeed feel like a cop-out. But Trollope excellently takes his characters through even this obvious turn of events, to keep the story entertaining.For our \\"B\\" story, we get what could be loosely called a direct sequel to SMALL HOUSE in that John Eames is still pursuing Lily Dale, and Lily is still insistent that she will remain an old maid for life. It is in this \\"B\\" story that I found the most frustration ... for starters, the man who ruined Lily in the previous novel makes a reappearance here, and were one to expect to find a goldmine of dramatic conflict, one would be disappointed, for almost as soon as he appears, he is dismissed again. Furthermore, the conclusion of Lily and John's story here is almost exactly the same as in the previous story ... so, ultimately, it is a wholly pointless part of the story. I realize my 21st century mindset cannot appreciate her the way Victorian era readers might, but I find Lily to be a most frustrating and annoying character, the more I am exposed to her.Beyond these two plot points are a \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" story as well ... the \\"C\\" story is the token \\"lovers trying to overcome obstacles to get married\\" story that appears in so many of Trollope's work ... in this case, the son of archdeacon Grantly wishes to marry the daughter of the disgraced Crawley, and the archdeacon strongly opposes it. Par for the course, and nothing particularly compelling in it.But it is the \\"D\\" story that robs the novel of it's shiney fifth star here ... a completely unrelated story dealing with an artist attempting to paint a portrait of a woman in hopes of using the time to convince her to marry him. In this sub-story we have also a married woman who is pining for the artist, and who's husband is close to financial ruin. This element of the novel has almost no bearing on the central plot, and feels like a simple device to pad out the novel's length in order to sell more installments to the serial publication in which it originally appeared. As it is, it could have been removed and published as a seperate short-story, and it's absence would not be felt at all.At the bottom is an \\"E\\" story that takes up all of three chapters concerning John Eames flirtation with another young woman, who's mother is trying to help her \\"trap a man\\" in marriage. I only mention it because the final chapter in this little side-story is, in fact, one of the most amusing in the entire novel.Trollope is not a great story-teller or plot maker ... but where he truly shines is in writing characters and scenes in which they interact ... and in this LAST CHRONICLE, we see Trollope hitting his stride in this regard. As he closed this series, he was just launching into the Palliser series, in which we find some of his best novels. All told, I did like the novel - it was a fair wrapping up of all our characters ... my only misgivings are the disappointing and seemingly pointless conclusion to the Lily Dale storyline, and the fact that one of the main characters dies off before learning the final revelation of Crawley's story, who's reaction would no doubt have been the best. Such misgivings may simply be the result of being raised in a generation that demands all stories have a point and a riveting and dramatic climax. Combined with the needless story of the artist, I can't quite call it my favorite in the series ... but I will say that it still contains some of Trollope's best writing ... particularly in the fact that he took a rather dull character from a previous novel (Crawley) and expertly turned him into one of his most fascinating characters! That alone makes it worth the read."},{"Title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","review":"The Last Chronicle of Barset,the final book in the Barsetshire series, is among the best novels Anthony Trollope ever wrote, and that is saying something special, for Trollope is, in my opinion, one of the finest English novelists. The Last Chronicle of Barset brings together many of the characters introduced to the reader in the first five novels of the series; we are happy to see our old friends back in action one last time.Septimus Harding, the Warden in the first novel of that name in the series, makes his final, quiet appearance. He is a good and loving man, a model clergyman, and a friend, even to his adversaries. His son-in-law, Archdeacon Grantly, takes center stage again. We remember him well from his central role in battling the new Bishop of Barchester in Barchester Towers, the second and most famous book in the series -- not as good, I think, as the novel being reviewed here. Now the archdeacon is angry with his son Henry over Henry's choice of bride, the lovely Grace, daughter of the main character in the story, the reverend Josiah Crawley, who is accused of stealing a check made out for twenty pounds. The mystery of how Mr. Crawley got the money begins the final novel and is not resolved until the end of the book. One of Trollope's most famous villain's, the Bishop of Barchester's wife, Mrs. Proudie, takes a great interest in Mr. Crawley's case, much to the dismay of her long suffering husband. We have watched Mrs. Proudie cause trouble and vexation since she was introduced to us in Barchester Towers.Many more of our friends from past novels in the series make their entrances and exits as loose ends from previous stories finally get resolved. For example, Johnny Eames and Lily Dale, two of the main characters in The Small House at Allington, my least favorite novel in the series, at last come to a final decision concerning their relationship.The reader of this review may be wondering if it is necessary to read all the books in the Barsetshire Novels to get full value, enjoyment, and appreciation of Trollope's final story. I don't think so, not that I don't recommend reading the first five books of the series. Trollope is careful to include enough information for the reader to make sense of the various plot lines drawn from the previous stories.The Last Chronicle of Barset is a wonderful book, almost certain to delight lovers of classic English literature. It is Trollope at the height of his powers. He is a reader's best friend; that is the highest recommendation I can give for him.One last comment: I read the Folio edition of this novel, which I recommend. This version includes many fine drawings carefully placed throughout the text; I think most readers will enjoy this complement to the story."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"\\"The Kingdom is not a logical world.\\" July 24, 1997With remarkable understatement, a fellow airline passenger tries to prepare Fran Shore for her stay as an expatriate wife in Saudi Arabia. A cartographer by profession, she is told, \\"You're redundant. They don't have maps,\\" an observation which Fran quickly discovers to be correct-she is redundant, irrelevant, and unimportant in this culture, and there is no way for her to participate in this closed society. With her social life limited almost exclusively to her apartment complex and the foreign business community, Fran writes in her diary, trying to make sense of the culture which envelops herUnable to participate in the world belonging to her Muslim neighbors and unable to explore Jeddah on her own, Fran, bored and frustrated, finds herself fixating on the mysterious activities and strange, painful noises emanating from the supposedly empty apartment above her. Her female Muslim neighbors seem to accept this mystery without any sense of curiosity, and, to her dismay, she can discover nothing about what's happening up there, despite her growing horror at what she suspects is happening.Overwhelmed by unanswered questions and by the restrictions on her life, Fran wonders, at one point, \\"Am I visible?\\" And that, perhaps, is the point. She IS visible in a world which values veils, a woman who does not fit into the culture, destined never to comprehend fully the daily lives of her hosts. Soon the mystery of the flat upstairs and the growing number of empty flats around her assume symbolic significance.Mantel is masterly at creating a sense of place, not surprising since she lived in Saudi Arabia for four years, and with a sharp eye for detail, she creates a devastating portrait of the lives of Saudi women. With a sense of detachment, she also portrays Fran as a foreigner who means well but has no idea of how she is regarded by the Saudi women who are her neighbors. The novel is darkly humorous, and consummately ironic, especially in its conclusion. A fascinating book filled with ambiguities and the differences of perception which arise from different cultures, Eight Months on Ghazzah Street takes a close look at life in Jeddah as it is seen both from the inside and from the outside, and shows the reader that \\"The Kingdom is not a logical world, and besides, logic is not an ornament of young ladies.\\" Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"I picked up this book, the cover photo on the one I read was very similar to the one of Sally Field on \\"Not Without My Daughter\\". About a third of the way through the book I suddenly realized it was a novel -however, it is still a good read.Frances is a British woman of the world, she has travelled well, lived in Africa for over five years and worked as a cartographer (maps). Her husband is a civil engineer and when work is drying up, he is offered a job in Saudi Arabia.Frances can't work and needs to follow the laws of Islam, down to dressing modestly, and quickly becomes incredibly bored. Meanwhile, in between reading her crime novels she is sure she can hear sobbing coming from the empty apartment upstairs...I thought the book was interesting, but would have enjoyed it more is the woman of the book didn't immediatly retreat into herself and become so much like the women she wanted to not be like. A complete drip, who occasionally came out of her shell to act modern and feisty with her questions. Just a bit predictable -having said that the ending was a shocker and I read every page to the end. Well written and interesting."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Frances Shore is a worldly, well-traveled woman, who would never entertain paranoia. When her husband is posted to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1984, after their last few years in Africa, the couple has no idea of the cultural adjustments that await them, but look forward to a new city and its opportunities. In Saudi Arabia, the Europeans make a useful contribution to the infrastructure of a country with a surplus of oil and wealth. Happy to oblige for spectacular remuneration, the men are not nearly as constricted as the few wives who accompany their husbands.Living quarters are provided through the construction company Andrew Shore has contracted with, as well as a daily stipend and a set of rules unlike any in their experience.Before the journey, Frances educates herself about the country where she will reside, understanding the complex cultural and religious differences of this new posting. What she isn't prepared for is the emotional toll of living in a repressed society, the streets patrolled by vigilant religious police. Increasing her uneasiness, watchful, mocking eyes follow her every move. Curiosity is fleeting to those who live in the Kingdom; not all information is available, but foreigners will be told whatever they are allowed to know.Much is forbidden and it is imperative not to offend the host country. Their apartment complex is surrounded by walls blocking any view of the outside world; women cannot drive, but must be driven by a male. At the mercy of such restrictions, Fran draws inward, conscious of those who live in the building but are never seen, watching and listening. Thus begins an assault on Fran's senses; in her hyper-vigilant state, Fran becomes convinced that something sinister is going on in the empty apartment above theirs. \\"First unease and then fear become her habitual state of mind.\\"Mantel has masterfully created a psychological thriller that takes root Frances's first day on Ghazzah Street. Surrounded by oppressive silence and mysterious comings and goings, Frances Shore is more than a victim of her own fears and delusions, a reality that time and tragedy will bear out. It isn't that no one wants to listen to Frances' concerns; rather, they are fearful for their own safety, trying to maintain a delicate balance in a host country intolerant of Western arrogance, contemptuous of Western values. Eventually, even Andrew Shore is forced to admit that not everything is as it seems. The Shores have one last hurdle: no one leaves the Kingdom without permission.

However, the story line was more odd, and at points made no sense at all. Very poorly written, coupled with a poor story line."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Thought the book was going to be much better because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed. I didn't get a woman slowly losing it, nor did I get much of a mystery. I got a book that didn't seem to go anywhere in a place that was hot and dirty and confining. The descriptions of her immediate environment (people, places, customs)was interesting, but I was hoping for a knock 'em, sock 'em mystery and instead read a slow plod."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"This book had amazing potential to be a real page-turner but it failed miserably. The characters were not only shallow and uninteresting, but they were unlikable as well. I especially found it hard to like Fran's husband, whose unbelievable self-centeredness and arrogance angered me at every page.After moving to Saudi Arabia for a job that he wanted, he proceeds to treat his wife almost as condescendingly as the Saudi's treat their own women. They move into a depressing housing complex where they have a depressing apartment and depressing neighbors who sit around drinking coffee and discussing cultural differences. These discussions were, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the book because they taught me about cultures I knew very little about.Mantel attempts to bring intrigue and mystery to the story by introducing an empty apartment in the complex that is veiled in secrecy. Is it a love nest? Do illegal events take place there? Unfortunately, we never learn the whole truth and this in and of itself was VERY disappointing. It's like there was no payoff for trudging through this story."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"While I did find the description of the Saudi lifestyles both interesting and disturbing there was little else in this book to hold on to.

I still want to go back some day. As a man, I often thought how much freedom I had there, although paradoxically this may have been because I knew how limited it was, and how quickly it could be taken away.Mantell's world -- the woman's one --is totally different.

I lived there for six years, and her version of expat life is nothing like what I experienced. To begin with, Jeddah is the most Westernized city in Saudi, a really happening place with lots and lots of foreigners, who enjoy life hugely and manage to skate around the restrictions without letting them get in the way. NO ONE I knew just sat in their apartment and moped! There were parties, concerts, art shows, plays, classes, picnics, camping in the desert, and fishing and swimming outings.No legal alcohol? Home brew. Women can't drive? Tons of taxis, plus a modern bus service.Shopping? Most of the shop assistants are from Ceylon, Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen, Bangladesh, Phillipines, Taiwan, etc., etc. The idea that they \\"don't see a woman as a person\\" is ludicrous! Also, even Saudi men, who traditionally avert their eyes from unrelated women out of politeness, have mostly learned that Western women can and do have minds and opinions, and can be conversed with.I had a good laugh when someone on the airplane says \\"Cartographers are redundant. They don't have maps.\\" She wrote that in 1988. However, when my husband and I left in 1985, there WERE maps. We used them to drive around the country.There are people from all over the world living in the Kingdom, in addition to Americans. Getting to know people from so many countries and cultures was an adventure by itself. My best friends while I was there were Lebanese, Mexican, Canadian and British. My husband and I were invited to visit Saudis, who were invariably as friendly and curious to know about us and our lives as we were about them. Language, by the way, is rarely a problem, as English is used as a sort of lingua franca.In my opinion, Mantel wanted to write a thriller about a woman in a place where she couldn't depend on anything she used to know, and she chose Saudi Arabia, then cherry-picked the negative elements and exaggerated them.If you want a more authentic view on Saudi, try \\"At the Drop of a Veil\\" by Marianne Alireza. She was probably the first American to marry a Saudi, and while she doesn't avoid the difficulties or the negative things, she also gives a wonderful view of the fascinating culture of the country, and the warmth of the Saudi family she married into."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"This is a briskly entertaining read. It is creepy and funny by turns, with a well-realized female protagonist and an interestingly exotic locale. The plot is intentionally opaque, and this adds to the tension; there may (or may not be) murders, kidnapings, and other skullduggery in and around the heroine's hermetic apartment building, and we may (or may not) find out.The vividness of the place (Saudi Arabia) brought to mind Graham Greene's African novels. (Why are the Brits so good at this?) Mantel's style takes a bit of patience, but it pays off quickly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"With remarkable understatement, a fellow airline passenger tries to prepare Fran Shore for her life as an expatriate wife in Saudi Arabia.

Mantel's book is okay, readable. I expected more. But twenty years down the road, admiring Mantel as I do, I realize what she was up against. I had a very restricted life and my husband was Saudi: we knew people. Mantel was only there 8 months. She describes life as it very well ought to have been at the time she was there, which I believe was a couple years before me. There wasn't even an English second channel when I got there. I personally did not have a telephone for ten years.As for her interpretation of Islam and women's covering, I know a writer named Sylvia Fowler whose poignant memoir of life in Saudi Arabia was not picked up by any big house, despite the fact she had a prestigious London agent, because not enough limbs dropped in the book. It didn't outdo Not Without My Daughter in horror and misery. In other words, editors overall want a stereotype, and if it is not delivered, the book doesn't get published.Personally, I have opted to put out my stories on Saudi Arabia without fanfare, biding my time as I write other things, hoping that at the end of my quest, I will write with even a mere portion of the flourish and skill that Hilary Mantel has recently exhibited in her Tudor series. She demonstrates the old rule that practice makes perfect."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"This novel transported me into another world and into the mind of a woman who inhabited it.

I did not approach this book wanting a travel book about Saudi Arabia and I am surprised about the number of reviews evaluating the novel compared to their own experience of Saudi Arabia - it's a novel!

I have not enjoyed any that I've read so far (I read Beyond Black and The Giant, O'Brien prior to this one). I find her novels oddly constructed and curiously unengaging.\\"Eight Months\\" could have been a great novel. Could have been. The plot set-up was very promising, with oodles of potential that was never realised. It's 1985 and clueless, young, English expat couple, Andrew and Frances Shore have just arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after accepting a job offer. Instead of being housed in an expat compound, the Shores are housed at a small, claustrophobic block of four apartments. Their neighbours are two Muslim couples and a mysterious, unoccupied apartment directly above them. But is it unoccupied? Mantel attempts to create dramatic tension by building a sense of foreboding about the apartment. Frances swears she hears footsteps, sobs and other strange noises coming from the apartment. There are rumours that the apartment is an illicit love-nest for a minor Saudi Prince. But could it be a torture chamber? Frances's paranoia about the apartment is fed by her female Muslim neighbours with whom she has strange coffee-and-conversation sessions. Their views on life are so diametrically opposed to Frances's, and she never comes to grips with their typically Islamic approach to life.My main problem with this novel is that it is filled to the brim with two-dimensional, unsympathetic characters. Andrew and Frances, the main characters, are particularly unlikeable and difficult to relate to. The other expat characters are cardboard cut-outs. The Muslim neighbours were by far the most interesting characters. The final chapters of the book dealing with an expat death and the mysterious empty apartment are poorly resolved. We never find out exactly what transpired in the apartment, nor do we find out what really happened to the Shore's neighbours. I was most unsatisfied with the ending.To be honest, I do not recommend this novel. It was a hard slog through a sea of unpleasant characters. The Saudi setting is very intriguing b ut does not make up for a plot that runs out of steam. I thought the storyline would be a lot more engaging than what it was and I feel that the novel's potential was squandered due to poor characterisation and insufficient resolution of the supposed \\"mystery\\" of the unoccupied apartment."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Saudi Arabia is extremely difficult for Westerners to live in. It is restrictive. However, most of the information about Saudi Arabia is grossly exaggerated. Women cannot drive but they are free to take a taxi alone at any time.

Yet it is exaggerated because they are also not that way.Any culture (as every American knows) can be viewed through the lens that portrays it as venal, banal, empty. Or it can be viewed as rich in possibilities and adventure if you approach it from where it stands.To be fair, I think the character of Fran tries to do that. And yet, the people she is with remind me of one set of people I know in Dubai. And they are a handful of empty-headed Brits and Aussies who would rather drink than do anything else. And yet I know Brits, Aussies, Americans, Indians, Arabs, Pakistanis, and Persians in the city who have endlessly enriched my life through what I've experienced in my time there.Also, the explanations of Islam are annoyingly one-sided. For once and for all it is NOT written in the Koran that women must cover themselves. It says only that they must be modest in their dress, and the definition of modest is what changes from culture to culture and from generation to generation. I feel that Mantel never really tries to show us the rich complexity which would make the odd alienation Fran feels that much more profound, nor does she give any insight into why certain people would stay for years.As a final note, if nothing else the book obviously works on one level, because so very many of its reviewers are responding so strongly and passionately to what lies therein. The author has done a good job of touching something for all of us.For a richer understanding of the life of a woman in the Middle East, read Ahdaf Souief's books. She is phenomenal."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"One of the frustrations [and benefits] of going to live in a foreign culture is that the standards and norms used, usually unconscientiously, for \\"sizing up\\" people no longer valid. So how do you determine who is your friend and who is using you? How do you determine what is friendship ad what is mere politeness? How do you determine what you \\"believe\\" is truly your belief and what is your cultural conditioning? How do you determine what is virtue? How do you determine which \\"cultural traditions\\" should be observed out of politeness and which should not? LIving in a foreign culture is challenging, not only because of external adaptations you may be asked to make, but because of the internal self-examinations you will require of yourself.Hilary Mantel is a keen observer of human character, human fraility, human environments, and she describes the environment, emotions and atmospheres with a crystal clarity.Frances and her husband Andrew go to Saudi Arabia, where Andrew, an engineer, has signed a contract to construct a building. They live in an apartment building on Ghazzah Street, where Frances makes friends with the wives there [a Saudi and a Pakistani], and encounters some mystery, as there are sounds coming from a supposedly empty apartment.Mantel carefully builds up the story, horror replacing the stifling boredom of the place as she progresses. Excerpts from Frances' diary are effectively interspersed in the text. The tension slowly rises, to the mysterious end.Mantel paints the varied expat communities (and the ugly corporations that do business there) very well, her opprobrium doled out equally to natives and foreigners alike.The novel is written as an \\"entertaining read\\", in a page-turning style -- you are interested in the characters and events. Yet it is a substantial work, addressing important themes: good versus evil, do our choices make a difference, the cost of cultural misunderrstandings, the loss of faith, how any sense of security is an illusion. While entertaining, Mantel is not afraid of the artist's obligation to tell us unpalatable truths about ourselves.My one complaint is that the ending was unclear and unsettled."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Frances Shore is a young English bride joining her prototypical bland English engineer husband as expats living in Saudi Arabia. She's been fully warned that life for w woman in Saudi Arabia is \\"unpleasant\\", but she quickly learns that \\"unpleasant\\" is truly an understatement. The repressive and authoritarian aspects of fundamentalist Muslim society, and the cynicism it breeds among the educated middle classes within it, are on full display here.Moreover, though the day-to-day grind of Saudi life is stressful enough, Frances begins to suspect that something truly ugly is occurring in their apartment building. She is alone in her concern about this though--her husband is a fairly crass and indifferent sort can't be bothered and, as a woman, she has no standing whatsoever to engage anyone else into looking into things.This book has been much criticized as \\"negative\\" and \\"exaggerated\\" but as recent events illuminate the realities of life for women in the Muslim world in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, one has the sense that the book renders a much more realistic picture than many would like to believe.This is a low key suspense novel. There are no \\"grand\\" moments and it does not build to any sort of crescendo. The ending is open and quite ambiguous. However, I see this not as the flaw many proclaim it to be but as a part of the whole. When I finished the book I felt weighted down and oppressed--yet disappointed the story was over. I realized that the books real accomplishment was to render for me in as much a physical as an intellectual way the weight and anxiety that simple day to day life imposes on women in the Muslim world.And that is no small accomplishment."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Like certain pieces of music, this book was strong on creating a vivid atmosphere, while being almost entirely free of &quot;hooks&quot; -- i.e., the momentum of a plot. Yes, something does happen at the end, but we don't know quite what, and in a wierd way it doesn't really matter. I don't have such a problem with the lack of plot that other reviewers did, but what did bother me was that Frances was such a blank. Why did she leave England? Why did she fall in love with her husband? What makes her tick? We don't know, it's almost as if the author wanted to put a blank, generic, white educated middle class Englishwoman down and just watch her interact in this excellently rendered alien environment. Sorry, but I want a three dimensional protagonist. It would have helped if she'd had some kind of back story, after all, no one is a complete blank. While I can understand that one might feel like a blank after several months of nearly solitary confinement, such as Frances experienced, she began the novel seeming that way to me. That was the only weakness of the book. The strength was the excellence of the writing,and the detailed eye that summoned up the locale to perfection.While I was rather disappointed with this as a novel (I gave it four stars instead of three, because the writing style is so much more intelligent and superior to almost any American writer's)I highly value it as a cultural study. When a friend of mine was considering moving to Saudi Arabia for a year, I said, Don't make your decision until you read this book!"},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"This book isn't about Saudi Arabia; it's about the psychological impact of living in an informational vacuum. Jeddah is a place to experience extraordinary cultural diversity, to delve deeply into Islam, to immerse oneself in history and architecture, to have mindless fun, or to withdraw into the shadows as Frances Shore did in Mantel's novel. But however you as a Western expatriate \\"see\\" the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you can be certain that your view is highly superficial, that all of the important decisions that affect your life in The Kingdom are made by people behind closed doors, speaking Arabic, thinking of you as a non-Moslem non-person. You may be useful to them for 1 year or 18, but ultimately you - and all of the other expats who work there from around the world - are expendable. You have no right to know anything, no right to appeal decisions with which you disagree, severely limited freedom of movement within the country, no right to leave the country until the faceless organization that took your passport the moment you arrived chooses to return it to you. You have no control over your own life except in the most superficial sense. Some people cope with these constraints better than others; Frances Shore is one of many who can't cope with them at all, and becomes increasingly terrified and paranoid as she realizes the depth of her ignorance and powerlessness. Those who read the novel in search of a clear resolution to the mystery simply miss the point. Clear resolution presupposes access to information, and power to use it. Western expats in Saudi Arabia have neither."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"I base my opinion on Mantel's novel from 18 years of living in Saudi Arabia. In defence of this book it is obvious she writes from first hand experience of Jeddah and she suceeds in creating an uneasy atmosphere from the start. However, the characters are, without exception, somewhat bland, empty people, lacking strength or depth. This may well be Mantel's intention together with the lack of substantial conclusion to the plot. Mantel dwells entirely on the negatives in Saudi and very little on the positives, such as the genuine friendships one acquires by getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures.The success of this novel must surely lie in its negative sensationalism rather than its literary credibility. It would be tragic if readers were put off visiting Saudi Arabia on the strength of this book which portrays bigotry and ignorance."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"I am a big Mantel fan, having enjoyed her other books tremendously. The writing in Eight Months on Ghazzah Street, as always, was good. But this novel was deeply flawed for several other reasons.First, the plot was very thin. Admittedly, Mantel often has sketchy, meandering plots, but this one was just didn't carry water. I'll sum it up for you: British woman moves to Saudi Arabia to join her husband and doesn't like it there. All the other window dressing - an upstairs apartment that is supposedly used for a love tryst, the various punishments meted out to adulterers, the main character's own feelings of isolation - really didn't amount to much, mostly because Mantel did so little to make these plot points interesting. The ending, if you can make it that far, was like pulling an invisible rabbit out of a hat. (If anybody out there can tell me what actually happened in the end, I'd appreciate an explanation.)Second, the main character, Frances, was surprisingly shallow. She is supposed to be a professional woman who spent many years in Africa, so you would expect more interesting social and cultural commentary than was offered up in her \\"diary.\\" Instead, she simply wallows in self-pity and largely self-imposed isolation from her first day in Saudi Arabia. Literally, the first day. This not only prevents character development, it is simply not logical. Why would she feel isolated after only a few hours?Third, this novel seemed written to make a point - always a bad idea for a novelist, especially when the point is so meaningless. Mantel's point is directly stated on page 234 when Frances tells the very tall Fairfax, \\"This is no place for men who like women.\\" Yet, almost immediately following this exchange, Fairfax shows Frances a photo of his wife, who he describes as a \\"giantess,\\" a woman who married him only because she could walk down the aisle in high heels rather than \\"shuffling up the aisle in gym shoes and bending her knees.\\" Apparently a culture in which women can't stand up straight for fear of being taller than a man is less objectionable than one in which women cover their faces. Further discussion reveals that one of their female British expat friends who is being divorced by her British husband (for having an affair) is now living in poverty with her children. Punishing adultery by reducing one's own children to poverty didn't even raise an eyebrow. The double standard that permeates this book, and which Mantel seems unwilling to discuss, spoils any observation she might make about Saudi Arabian attitudes towards women.I have lived in countries in which strict sex segregation is practiced, and, frankly, I did not find it to be a problem. Adopting a new style of dress was hardly something to complain about, and the fact that men could not speak to me was something of a relief. I had a very good time talking with the women, and learned a great deal from them (without having to deal with flirting, football scores, or dirty jokes). After all, the whole point of living abroad is to experience a new way of seeing the world. I will never in a million years understand why so many American and other Western travelers insist that every country they go to - temporarily mind you - needs to adjust to THEM. The only thing that ever results from this childish, arrogant attitude is animosity and, sometimes, real harm. I was sorry to see that Mantel was unwilling to critique this attitude in any meaningful way. Instead her central character self-righteously clung to her right to wear short skirts, drink booze, and make her hosts uncomfortable. The characters who didn't follow her example were portrayed as being somewhat stupid. I don't know why Mantel devised a central character who was so unsympathetic, and I hesitate to think that Mantel herself saw anything admirable in Frances Shore. As for her description of Saudi Arabia, I came away with very little, other than the impression that it was dusty, bureaucratic, and a nightmare to drive in."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"It took me some time to read this horrifying novel by Hilary Mantel, not because it isn't well-written or compelling, but because often it's simply so painful to read. There is a mystery, a shadowy bit of skulduggery that gathers force toward the end, but the impact of the book is not in this artifice but in the portrayal of life in Saudi Arabia based on the author's own experience of living there.We all know this backward desert of Wahabism is terrible, but just how offensive it is to Western sensibilities, how hypocritical the royal family is to commit every sin in the Koran while inflicting this puritanical code on its citizens, and how corrupt this combination of hypocrisy and wealth can be is -- painfully -- drawn with Mantel's gifts of description and characterization.I visited Riyadh briefly on a reporting trip at about the same period Mantel describes -- when the bloom of the oil gold rush was fading and the Kingdom was forced into budget cuts that led to many grand building projects being abandoned. The place gave me the willies, but I was there and gone in a few days. More telling is the experience of a reporter colleague of mine who had spent much more time there and knew it well. He had the bad luck to be in the country when a story of his appeared in the West that was more than a little critical of the regime. Some Ministry called him at his hotel and said he should come around to discuss the article with them. Because he knew the country so well, he said, sure, I'm staying for several days so why don't I come by day after tomorrow. He hung up the phone and called a cab to the airport to take the first flight out of the country. I don't think he ever returned.Mantel's depiction of the mortal threat of living in a country that has no rule of law is devastatingly realistic. Her biting and brutal humor seems at time like satire -- except there's no exaggeration involved. The Pakistani neighbor of the protagonist, Frances Shore, tries to reassure her by explaining that they don't really stone adulteresses any more -- they throw a few token stones then shoot her. \\"I was so relieved,\\" Frances wrote mordantly in her diary. The British expats discuss some of the more famous customs of the country, like cutting off the hands of thieves, by noting in passing that they use anesthetic and have doctors standing by to bind up the wound.The expats tell each other, as they are told, that they must respect the cultural differences of the host country. You might as well say you should respect the customs of cannibals or acknowledge that slavery is legitimate if it's part of the local culture, because the Wahabi perversion of Islam is as benighted and savage. The portrayal of this culture in Mantel's novel is enough to turn the biggest fan of multiculturalism into a raving advocate for the mission civilatrice of the West.The novel works at many levels, however, and is also a crushing indictment of Western materialism and greed. Frances -- who, irrelevantly for the novel, is described as a cartographer -- and her architect husband go to Saudi Arabia, with all its known hardships, because the money is so good. They are willing to take on the deprivation (no alcohol is the least of it) to make a pile that will enable them to buy a flat in central London. Their colleagues are other expats similarly motivated by greed, who are willing to put up with a little hell to get ahead. So imagine their dismay when the checks don't arrive and they're still stuck in hell.Frances and her husband, Andrew, are not able to get into one of the foreigners' compounds when he goes to work on a new ministry building in Jeddah and instead are installed in a company flat in an apartment block along one of the main roads. The reader sees immediately that this will not be a good situation for Frances when her husband, who had arrived earlier, locks her into the apartment her first day there, for her own protection. Her sense of isolation and alienation become palpable with the description of her endless days of nothingness, with the choice of staying in a blank apartment breathing the stale air-conditioned atmosphere or venturing outside into the blazing, fly-bitten heat and hazarding the leers and catcalls of Saudi men who consider unveiled Western women to be whores.Out of desperation, Frances becomes friends of sorts with the Pakistani woman across the hall and the Arab woman living upstairs, each of whom explains her dismaying rationalization for the role of women in this puritanical society. The flat directly above Frances and Andrew is supposedly empty, but Frances hears sounds of life there. She is then told that in fact the flat is used by a junior member of the royal family for illicit trysts, but she comes to suspect that is simply a tale put out to satisfy a foreigner's curiosity.The development of this mystery and its denouement are not the most effective pieces of the novel. The frustration and futility of trying to find out exactly how the tragedy unfolds is more poignant than the actual events. In fact, this gothic part of the story is almost a subplot, or a symbol for the much more mundane corruption that is portrayed throughout the novel.Mantel spent four years in Saudi Arabia with her real-life geologist husband, and she says in a Q&A; in the back of this edition that the day she left Jeddah was the happiest moment in her life. She brings her considerable literary gifts to bear in a fictional account of her stay that makes you understand why. Frances is still in the country when the novel ends, now settled in a sparsely inhabited compound surrounded by freeways, but the reader is oh so happy to get an exit visa and leave this oppressive world.Mantel is now famous as the author of Wolf Hall. This earlier novel makes it clear that she is anything but an overnight success. The terrific empathy and the skillful craftsmanship that distinguish the winner of the Man Booker Prize are already abundantly evident in this book."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"I, too, am a woman who lived in Saudi Arabia, although for a longer time than Mantel. While I found her book riveting, I also found it unduly negative. Certainly restrictions were irritating and, initially, disconcerting; however, I quickly learned to adapt. My husband and I, after all, were guests in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government was paying his salary and giving him a good job--which was more than he was able to attain in the U.S. What Mantel leaves out are the breathtakingly beautiful moments of living in the Middle East--the morning prayer call; the nights in the desert under a brilliant sky; the thrilling juxtaposition of tradition and modernism; the stunningly beautiful buildings in Riyadh. Mantel has allowed her paranoia to take over. Did she make an effort, for example, to meet Saudi women? Those I met were unfailingly pleasant and polite and, interestingly, content with their lives. There is no point going to another country and criticizing everything you find there. Mantel would have us believe that her protagonist tries to be positive about Saudi Arabia and tries to dismiss the ever-prevalent gossip; however, in the end Frances Shore falls prey to the paranoia of the ignorant which she criticizes in other characters. My life there was exotic and exciting. I read children's stories on Radio Riyadh; I was able to use the (men's) university library to work on my Ph.D.; I camped far out in the desert; I traveled to Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Turkey, Greece and England. These were all things I could never have afforded to do back here and I am grateful I had the opportunity. Mantel leaves out of her novel the beauty of Saudi Arabia--the lift of the heart that comes with the crisp, clear air of early morning winter sunlight. I remember Riyadh with delight and am saddened by the negative emphases of Mantel's book."},{"Title":"Eight Months on Ghazzah Street","review":"Mantel's book brings to mind the films \\"Blow-Up\\" and \\"The Conversation,\\" in which evidence of some kind of malfeasance is discovered by an otherwise innocent observer, then takes on a life of its own, while the observer is swept up in a growing tide of paranoia. The narrator in this chilling novel is a woman whose husband has taken a job in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, in the 1980s. Husband and wife are immediately submerged in a culture far different from any they've known, where appearance and reality are seldom clear and fear and rumor dominate their lives.Trapped in the claustrophobic flat provided by her husband's employer, the narrator comes to suspect that the empty flat above her is not empty at all. Looking for clues to the real nature of its use, she comes to know the wives of two other men who live in the building, who try to dismiss her concerns while reassuring her that the restrictive role of women in this Muslim country is quite reasonable, and repeating to her firmly held beliefs about the West that are wild exaggerations and outright myths. As suspicion points in every direction, the reader begins to doubt the veracity of everyone, including the other western expatriates who make up the central character's social circle.Finally, the novel is a discourse on the impossibility of discovering the truth, especially when covering it up or ignoring it serves the interests of enough people. Meanwhile, it finds much to say about gender politics, whether under the dictates of Islam or the double standards still to be found in the democratic West. This is a page-turner that is also sharply written. Its characters are vividly created and the dialogue among them is often withering. Not likely to be embraced by Saudi readers, it portrays the Kingdom in ways that are far from flattering.

No bent corners or anything. Pretty much mint condition. Unfortunately, its still for a class."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"Several years ago, i had to deal with a mainframe system. My attitudethen was to minimize my exposure as much as possible, as if it were adisease. I figured that mainframes were obsolete and any time i spentlearning about them would be time wasted. Well, they are still around,and i recently found myself having to advise some mainframetesters. Mainframes are still around. It was time for me to learn moreabout them.I picked up Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL, and it does an excellent jobof describing the architecture and nomenclature of mainframesystems. It presumes that you nothing about mainframe systems. To getstarted, you should know that MVS, OS/390 and z/OS are all basicallyinterchangeable terms for the mainframe operating system (quibblingover these terms would be like quibbling over whether Linux were aUnix operating system). JCL is &quot;job control language&quot; and is theoriginal front end for mainframe systems when punch cards were theirprimary external interface. There are now a number of easierinterfaces that allow you submit JCL to a mainframe.Anyhow, this book has been a very valuable guide to me forunderstanding the basics of mainframe systems and giving me theinformation i need in order to analogies between it and other systemsthat i know better. For example, i now know that a data set is kind oflike a file, a directory, or a filesystem, depending on how you lookat it. And i have some sense of what CICS and VSAM are.I was also surprised to see such a modern book format on a topic thati'm prone to consider dated. It's a large format with the text runningon the left hand pages and examples, diagrams and summaries on theright. The main ideas of each spread are covered three times: in thenarrative on the left, and in the examples and summary (&quot;description&quot;)on the right. On many pages, i found myself not turning the page untili understood the material before me. It's a great format, and on thestrength of it alone, i've already picked up Murach's book on Java formy technical library."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"Murach's next entry in their upgraded OS/390 titles has arrived and you won't be disappointed. Raul Menendez updates the prior (1980) edition of their MVS JCL text. The result is a JCL training and reference book that should be the first book anyone aspiring to work on the OS/390 or z/OS platforms should acquire.The first two chapters give a very condensed, but extremely thorough introduction and overview of IBM's mainframe environment from a hardware and operating system perspective. Since we continue to see forecasts that there will be a growing shortage of programmers for this environment, this is exactly the type of \\"quick start\\" introduction that will help bring new programmers up to speed. Chapter three gives a very quick overview of ISPF, enough to get started using ISPF to accomplish basic editing, submit jobs, and review job output.Following the introductory section, Job Control Language is covered from the basics of statement format to how to accomplish more complex tasks - managing program execution, allocating disk and tape datasets, handling special circumstances of SYSOUT datasets, and using procedures. More advanced JCL skills, including conditional processing, job restart/recovery, creating and using generation data groups, and using the Storage Management Subsystem to allocate datasets is covered in the next section.But this is much more than a simple text on Job Control Language. It includes a section on the basics of Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM), along with JCL required to create and use VSAM datasets. The chapter covering Access Method Services (IDCAMS) includes just about everything an application programmer will need to know to create and manage VSAM objects. The most commonly used IBM utility programs, such as IEHMOVE, IEBCOPY, and IEBDG are explained with examples for their use. And the chapter devoted to the Sort/Merge utility covers both stand alone and internal sorts along with the most common sort control statements.The book concludes with a couple of chapters that will provide the reader with a working knowledge of CLISTS, REXX, and UNIX System Services. With the inclusion of the information about SMS and UNIX System Services, the text is desk ready for programmers working in a z/OS environment, IBM's current version of their flagship operating system. But this book will be equally usable by programmers working on earlier versions of OS/390 and MVS. Murach's \\"paired page\\" format is easy to read for those using the text in training mode and also makes this a great choice for use as a reference tool."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"I got more than I expected from &quot;OS/390 and z/OS JCL&quot;. Not only were the chapters on JCL itself very clear and complete, but this was really a collection of small reference books. For example, there is a section on IDCAMS, which is going to be very useful, because it has all those parameters that I can never remember. There's another section on batch utilities, which shows you how to use them with HFS directories.I would very much recommend this book to anyone new to z/OS -- or anyone like myself who gets annoyed at how difficult it is to find out some detail that they have just forgotten."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"Collaboratively written by experienced professional programmers Raul Menendez and Doug Lowe, Murach's OS/390 And z/OS JCL is a comprehensive, and exhaustive tutorial, reference, in the form and formate of a complete and effective guide to understanding the JCL used to run programs on an IBM system. From the basics of JCL operating system code, to writing code in JCL yourself, to mastering time-saving features, tape data sets, and much more, Murach's OS/390 And z/OS JCL is a thorough, step-by-step book that guides anyone with even the most cursory experience in operating systems down the most effortless path. Sample programs and meticulously presented ideas help clarify the solid computer science foundation of this essential, core reference for anyone who needs to concern themselves with the ins and outs of JCL.

That must be why everything is clearly explained, rather than just giving the syntax and leaving it at that. In addition to the chapters on JCL, there are sections on ISPF, SMS, VSAM, IDCAMS, IBM utilities (IEBCOPY etc.), SORT, REXX and UNIX system services.In other words, this is a very handy general purpose mainframe reference book, that will earn its place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"My job requires me to write scripts on Windows and Unix platforms. I have no problem writing Windows batch files or Unix shell scripts to copy or move files, change permissions, create and delete directories, write results to log files, etc.Recently, I was asked to write a mainframe script. I was told to write this script in Rexx. When I looked into Rexx, it was just another scripting language. It was not hard to understand how it worked. However, unlike Windows batch files or Unix shell scripts, there was more to writing a Rexx program than just knowing the Rexx language - I needed JCL to run it!! I had seen JCL before. I knew each job started with a JOB card and that it executed PROCs and PGMs. I also knew that I did not know nearly enough about JCL to write JCL to do what I wanted it to do. That's when I went to Amazon and found this book.Not only did this book confirm what little I did know and correct some misundertandings I had, it went far more deeply into JCL to describe how to use many features that I did not know existed. One of the best features of this book is that it provides some background information on how mainframes work and the naming conventions used. This information is useful when JCL coding is introduced because the reader has a better idea of what the JCL is used for and what it happening with the various statements. JCL coding is not even introduced until Chapter 4!!After the background information, this book then goes through the various aspects of JCL coding. The basics of what I needed to know to run my Rexx program were addressed as were many concepts that I can now put in my \\"bag of tricks\\" for future projects. I am sure most of our mainframe programmers do not know most of this material.This book is not limited to JCL. It also describes how to compile Cobol programs, how to copy, move, sort, delete and print datasets using common mainframe utilities. It even has a chapter on Unix System Services. Prior to reading these chapters, I had no idea how to copy a dataset to a new dataset on the mainframe using a batch program. For me, this was a trivial issue on a Windows or Unix platform. I now know how to do it on the mainframe. This book clearly explains the process. It also provides coding examples for all concepts described throughout the book.If you are new to computing, I don't think you want to start with the mainframe as the first platform you learn. However, if you have some computing background from working with Windows and Unix, then I highly recommend this book to get a solid foundation on how to run batch programs on the mainframe.In the past, I had to ask a coworker to help me when I needed to work with JCL. I purchased this book so that I could code some JCL for myself to run my Rexx program. Now, not only does my Rexx program execute flawlessly, I also have a thorough understanding of how to write mainframe batch programs for future projects. Who knows, maybe my coworkers will start coming to me with their complex JCL coding problems!!"},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"This book is a tremendous reference resource for anyone who works in the IBM mainframe environment, especially for those who don't work with JCL on a daily basis or for those seldom-used tasks for which you may not have any \\"canned\\" JCL readily available. I strongly recommend this book as an invaluable JCL reference document."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"I am a mainframe programmer for 8 years and never had a good book like this one. I wanted to have a good book that will give me all the information I need so I selected this book after reading the review comments of this book.When I received this book and checked the contents I was disappointed so I thought I should return this book.But after started reading this book I was so surprised to see a book that was so organized and well explained.It was like when we study we make important notes of the concept which will be useful to refresh for interviews.But we don't need to do this if we have this book as after a detailed explanation , there is a picture and description .So I recommend this book who wants to train/learn/refer in their job and I couldn't wait to write this comment after reading for 3 days."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"I was recently assigned to a JCL-related software project, so I was in urgent need of an excellent JCL Reference. Murach's JCL book fit the bill. The introductory chapters give beginners an excellent guide to the Mainframe environment, and there are comprehensive chapters on everything from basic JCL syntax to restarting JCL jobs. The exlanations of JCL concepts are clear, concise and easy to read and understand.This book is an excellent introduction to JCL for beginners, and I'd recommend it to anyone as a perfect introduction to the world of JCL and Z/OS."},{"Title":"Murach's OS/390 and z/OS JCL","review":"We still use Mainframes where I work, and are always trying to find a new way to \\"skin a cat\\". This book has helped me a number of times to do just that. Murach is always informative, though at times wordy, but the examples are good, and you can't beat it when you need to pick up the pace. I wish they put out more of those mini desk references,like they used to, as they were even more help, but this is a great book on JCL."},{"Title":"Warrior of Scorpio (Dray Prescot #3)","review":"This is the 3rd book of a 53 book series. The first is Transit to Scorpio. This book IS currently in print by Savanti Press. My detailed rating is 4.0. Dray meets his lifelong buddy Seg in this book. Delia has found Dray on the Inner Sea, and now they are proceeding toward Vallia. Boy, traveling on Kregen is hard! If it's not swifters, then it's impiters or Queens of Pain slowing you down! (Those queens are kinda cute, though!) As the conversations are the best part of the series, the conversations between Dray and Seg are the best of that. And some of those happen in this book. The author &quot;loses&quot; a tape - and part of the story - in this book again. It is an irritating technique to speed up the storyline (not used after book 4). If you need help finding books from this series, please contact me."},{"Title":"Warrior of Scorpio (Dray Prescot #3)","review":"Adventurer Dray Prescot, in the company of his princess and two companions, braves the bizarre civilizations of a desolate continent as he tries to reach civilization.These books are a lot of fun. Author Keith Bulmer, writing as Alan Burt Akers, has an amusing voice, and he doesn't take himself too seriously. The interactions between the characters are entertaining and there are plenty of monsters and lost empires to keep things from slowing down. Just about the time it starts to get old, it's over. I love weighty literary fare, but there is a special place in my heart for a writer who is utterly without pretensions and just tells a good story."},{"Title":"Warrior of Scorpio (Dray Prescot #3)","review":"This is the third book in the sword adventure series by Ken Bulmer writing as Alan Burt Akers. This book is an adventure to adventure romp through the lost lands of the continent of Turismond on the planet Kregen. Dray Prescot accompanied by his love, Delia of the Blue Mountains, her maid, Thelda, and his Bowman of Loh companion Seg Segutorio venture through lands last known to the almost mythical Empire of Walfarg. Using their wits and weapon skills they must travel through to the coast lands to find passage to Delia's homeland the Empire of Vallia. They encounter wild flying beasts partially tamed and flown by beastmen and numerous other obastacles. We find that Dray Prescot is the consumate champion, Delia the exquisite female companion, Thelda the bungling, bubbly servant and Seg the steady indegatigable true friend. This book is reprinted with Transit to Scorpio, Suns of Scorpio, Swordships of Scorpio and Prince of Scorpio in the omnibus, The Saga of Dray Prescot: The Delian Cycle by Kenneth Bulmer written by Alan Burt Akers and available at Amazon.com in softback and Hardback.

And they send him on mission after mission. He goes through mountains, jungles, and fantasic challenges. And has the love of Delia to keep him going. In the hope that some day he will be let lose from the Star Lords.The writing is very good. The story is original. But the book is hard to read. You don't fall in love with the hero.

Frita Wilson decides that she needs to liberate her best friend, Gabriel King, from his fears.A disastrous end-of-fourth grade Moving Up Day ceremony where Gabe is bullied by some classmates is the catalyst for Frita's brilliant plan. She decides that she and Gabe need to list all of their fears and spend their summer methodically trying to overcome each one of them. Gabe's list of fears is long and includes spiders, loose cows, Frita's basement, and most of all, fifth grade. Frita's list is shorter, but since she is the only black child attending a white school, she may have the hardest fears to overcome.Ms. Going seamlessly weaves in a subplot about the upcoming Presidential election of Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer from Georgia. When Gabe tells stories of Mr. Carter's peacemaking and non-tolerance for prejudice to Frita's family, it helps cement their friendship even further. This story, told in the first person by Gabe, is about courage and the meaning of true friendship.K. L. Going lives in Beacon, New York. THE LIBERATION OF GABRIEL KING is her second novel. She is also the author of FAT KID RULES THE WORLD, an ALA best book for young adults. Currently she is writing from home and working part-time at Merritt Bookstore in Cold Spring, NY. She likes for her characters to experience a range of emotions, and she tries to capture the good and bad feelings of young people in her novels.Fear is a feeling that all readers, both young and old, can relate to. Readers can connect to Gabriel King and may even learn a thing or two about conquering their own fears by reading THE LIBERATION OF GABRIEL KING.[...]"},{"Title":"The Liberation of Gabriel King","review":"I am a middle school language arts teacher and I read just about every new title that gets any hype. This book did not disappoint! The plot is well developed and the characters are endearing...Frita is so spunky while Gabe is a quirky scardy-cat afraid of his own shadow. Both Frita and Gabe learn a great about life, love, fear, racism and the nature of hate the summer before they enter fifth grade. In the end they realize that fear is a part of life - bravery is feeling the fear and forging ahead despite it. Great read HIGHLY recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Liberation of Gabriel King","review":"On vacation our family read this book out loud for our library's book club. My husband and I (40+ years old) and my two boys- 10 & 6 both adored this book. In the span of 160 pages we all had the opportunity to learn life lessons, grow to be more brave, laugh and most importantly learn about how love will always conquer hate. We do not live in a very diverse area of the country and this book was a wonderful way to introduce to our children the stuggles that African Americans have had to deal with and why civil rights are so important in this country. I had a lump in my throat when the book discussed how the Bicentennial was being celebrated and not all Americans were still being treated as Free. It isn't a book I would have ever had known about without our wonderful librarian and it will be one that none of us will soon forget. Don't be deterred by some of the serious subjects dealt with in this book, there were far more laughs than most books have. It was entertaining and a joy to read. It is a great book for parents and children.(one last thought...I would not have liked my son to read this book without us because he would have never fully understood why there was such hate for a 10 year old black girl and why grown men dress in sheets. As disgusting as it is that people practice such hateful acts it is a reality that exists and children who are old enough to understand should not be sheltered from truth. The sooner we can educate our children about equality the better this world will be. )"},{"Title":"The Liberation of Gabriel King","review":"I bought this book because I loved the front cover and the blurb on back. The cover depicts a jar of something yellowish-green, reminding me of \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\" Perhaps I should not tell this about myself, but I will--I did not \\"see\\" that spider until after I completed the book and looked at the cover again to decide how the picture fit into the story. Then I saw the spider and the green color (grass through the jar). Wow. I decided then that the story really is about fear. Fear of spiders was near the top of Gabriel's list of fears. Frita convinces him to adopt this spider as his pet.The blurb on back summarizes the story as a friendship between two fourth-graders moving up to fifth grade, two unusual fourth-graders, one white boy and one black girl. Then I thought about the book again. Not fear. The book seems to be about fear, and it is, but the real intangible character is integrity. The book is about integrity.Frita Wilson is the only African-American in their small school in Hollowell, GA, not far from Plains, where Jimmy Carter hails. The story takes place during the summer of the campaign for president in 1976, a time when integrating is taking place all over the South and racial strife is evident.Gabriel King misses his Moving Up graduation to fifth grade because some racist bullies physically prevent him. As a result, Gabriel decides he will not go to fifth grade housed in a separate wing, fearing the bullies. He will just stay in fourth. Frita makes it her summer's goal to liberate them of their fears. Even in victory over various levels of fear, Gabriel \\"knows\\" all along that his fear of bullies will not be liberated and he is not going to fifth grade.They defeat some fears on the list and some fears win. The saddest loss occurs near the end and becomes the impetus for winning the big one. Not willing to be a spoiler, I ask you to read this most enjoyable book. Friendship is a big winner. Family love and unity are big winners. But the biggest winner is integrity. So are Gabriel and Frita because they have this integrity all along.Having written all this, I feel I must voice my one misgiving about the book. Although it really is a cool story with racism and specific racists taking hits (in a law-abiding way, not through violence), I cannot help but question this friendship between Gabriel and Frita. No matter how I look at it, I just cannot see it happening. Not because of skin colors, but because of age and sex of the children. Boys and girls in the fourth grade just aren't best friends. They certainly don't spend the night with each other in the same room. Parents just would not allow this closed door thing with a boy and a girl of this age. Having stated these things, I still endorse this book--with four stars, not five."},{"Title":"The Liberation of Gabriel King","review":"The Liberation of Gabriel King is a book about a boy who is filled with many fears. His best friend, Frita, decides that she will help him conquer all his fears by having him make a \\"fear list\\" and then tackling each item one by one.But the book is so much more than that! The story takes place in the 1970s in a small southern town where it soon becomes apparent that the KKK is still alive and kicking. Gabriel, a white boy who is bullied mercilessly by Duke, is best friends with Frita, who is black. Gabriel is so upset about Duke that he decides he will not move on to 5th grade because Duke will be at his new school to torment him every day. As Gabriel and Frita go through the summer conquering fears, it comes out that Duke's dad is a KKK member. He actually threatens Frita one day and that is when the parents of Gabriel and Frita get involved. They model for their kids the principles of peaceful resistance demonstrated by Martin Luther King Jr. and they work together to fight back by holding a town rally against racism. In the end, Gabriel learns a lot about how Frita's family has been affected by racism and he also learns a powerful lesson about courage and friendship.This story is so powerful that I am moved to tears every time I read it. I am a teacher and it is my favorite book to read with my class. The book takes on very difficult themes but does it in a way that is appropriate for my 4th graders.

What a courageous woman to have published this in 1949! I am so glad it was re-issued in 1994!!!! Smith provides insights on, and discusses in depth, things that are basic underpinnings of race relations in this country, but are rarely mentioned. The book is a must for anyone trying to gain insight into the foundations of white privilege and its implications, as well as improving race relations. An absolutely *incredible* book."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"I had a History professor who assigned this book for reading no matter what course he was teaching. I didn't understand why until several years after I finshed college. Ms. Smith describes the &quot;ghosts&quot; of the consciousness of the American south, the mythical fears that separate the races, in a way that is literate, poetic and unflinching. If you want to understand the history of the South, this book will fill in the gaps for you."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"Ms. Smith's honesty and eloquence in telling a profoundly American story about the perfidy of the South of her childhood is a literary tour de force about an immensely important slice of American history. It is a profoundly American tragedy fashioned from the most basic of human materials, human fallibilities, many of which still consume us as Americans--black or white, north or south. This book is the most sombering account of who we Americans are--as opposed to who we wished we were--anyone is likely to ever encounter. Unfortunately, since her death, Ms. Smith's story of about race, sex, religion, politics, economics and deception in the south has become the American way of life, writ large."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"Upon reading the very first page, I knew I had a very special book in my hands. This is one of the most beautifully written and insightful books I have ever read, with an honesty and moral awareness one would find in the writings of Robert Coles.Part One, \\"The Dreamers\\" chronicles Ms. Smith's life, as well as what she observed of the South as a Southerner herself.Part Two, \\"The White Man's Burden,\\" Ms. Smith explains how segregation shuts out not only blacks, but also whites.Part Three, \\"Giants of the Earth,\\" discusses how the powers to be, men in politics and business leaders, created the current situtation of segregation in the South and the reasons they wish to maintain the status quo.Part Four, \\"The Dream and Its Killers,\\" explores how the very future of humanity, \\"the Dream,\\" depends on a willingness to embrace positive change and challenge those aspects of the status quo that aim to keep that from happening."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"The lucid and careful telling of Ms Smith's story is a great contributions to understanding our time and place. The hidden issues of race and injustice continue to plague our country. So much of it seems incomprehensible because it is wrapped in Christian Theology. Ms Smith reveals the secrets that keep the evil and pain alive."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"Lillian Smith's book is amazing considering that it was written in 1947 well before the Civil Rights era and before African American voices were heard by the white community. She starts by telling us the problems children had in separating what they were taught at home and at church with the reality of segregation in which all black people were considered inferior to them. God created us equal but not too equal. I am a Californian who has lived in the South for 16 years; I have been trying all that time to understand the Southern perspective and have found this book to be a real help in understanding a part of our country who. we know, suffered in a way the North never suffered after the Civil War and into the 20th Century,but still could never admit they were wrong about the war or that slavery and later segregation was evil."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"...and we do not know how to rid ourselves of it.\\" I first read this book in the \`60's, while I was in college in Atlanta, and the old order of racial segregation collapsed. The book was a present from a friend at Spellman College, with numerous passages highlighted for my benefit, or perhaps anyone's. Lillian Smith, a white Southerner, performed a most critical analysis of the \\"southern system,\\" following with a far more personal touch what had been completed a decade or so prior, by a foreigner, Gunnar Myrdal, inAn American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy (Black and African-American Studies) Volume 1. She could, since she had the ability to relate how she was socialized into accepting this system as the \\"normal\\" way individuals should relate. She concludes this excellent work with the subject quote.Lo' after even these many years I still vividly recalled one chapter in this book in particular, and it required a revisit, due to recent events in the news, specifically the attacks on Public Service unions by various state governors, which are supported by a certain segment of the population, currently going by the rubric, \\"The Tea Party.\\" The chapter in Smith's book is entitled: \\"Two Men and a Bargain.\\" She tells it in the form of a parable, and the two men are Mr. Poor White and Mr. Rich White. The bargain was summed up by Ms. Smith in the agreement promoted by Mr. Rich White: \\"Suppose now you take over the thing you can do and let me take over the thing I can do. You boss the n-----, and I'll boss the money.\\" The author continues: \\"...we'll give you the pick of what jobs there are, and if things get too tight you can take over his jobs also, for any job's better than no job at all.\\" So, as Ms. Smith continues, though Mr. Poor White's life was not of the plantation home, he was offered something to forget his troubles: \\"To be \`superior,' to be the \`best people on earth' with the best \`system' of making a living, because your sallow skin was white and you were \`Anglo-Saxon,' made you forget that you lived in a shanty and ate pot-likker and corn bread, and worked long hours for nothing.\\" What a \\"bargain\\"! And although the players have changed a bit, and it is not particularly race that is the key ingredient, still you have Mr. Rich, personified now by two multi-billionaire brothers who fund the Tea Party, trying to socialize the vast majority into accepting \\"austerity\\"; that the new \\"normal\\" is to be less, in terms of pensions, health care, education et al., and if you lose your social safety net, and you company no longer offers health care, then target the people who still have it, so they lose theirs also, which certainly keeps the focus off the billionaires, as Thomas Frank so well related inWhat's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America. And forget that \\"American Dream\\" which we wish to kill. It is indeed, the French Revolution run in reverse, and the vast majority are asked to sacrifice for the new Lords and Ladies.There is so much more in this book than this one chapter. Smith's first chapter is entitled \\"When I was a Child,\\" in which she brilliantly describes the acculturation process that each white southern experienced. There was a heavy reliance on \\"God\\" who had established this naturally order of things. Ah, the often quoted \\"there will always be the drawers of water and hewers of wood...\\" And sexual fears also provided a \\"solid foundation\\" to this system. Deference was always do... Overall, it is a searing and devastating portrait of the South in the era of segregation.And what of reading a seminal work that has been marked up by someone who was not a beneficiary of this \\"normal\\" and God-given system? There are the plain vanilla markings on: \\"They did a thorough job of dishonoring curiosity, of making honesty seem a treasonable thing, of leaving in their children an unquenchable need to feel superior to others, to bow easily to authority....\\" Another passage merit a much stronger \\"three lines\\" in the margin: \\"It was not evil but the knowledge of it that injured, these mothers believed.\\" Only one had three lines, and a \\"star\\": \\"And there is a burning blasting scorn of white men growing in the minds not only of upper-class Negro women but of nearly every woman of the colored race, making it a fairly dangerous thing for a white male to approach one of them.\\" Gulp! Fortunately real \\"change\\" came, far before the last election, and within a decade after receiving the book I found that particular sentiment to be mitigated.A 5-star plus read, even without the notations, for how things once were, and how that applies to today's events."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"I remember working at a newspaper here in my city and one of my colleagues recommended this book for me to read. She is white and I am black and at the time I didn't know why she recommeneded it except that I am an avid reader. So I got the book and read it. It was riveting. It gave me a glimpse from another perspective and this woman obviously was saddened by what happened between the whites and blacks of the old South. She said that in order for whites to justify the horrible way blacks were treated they had to have a split personality ---schizophrenic. Otherwise they would not have been able to inflict such atrocities and go to church on Sunday and pretend like they were living a Christian life. It blew me away. Her writing style is easy to read and to the point. I talk about this book to this day. She explains racism in a way that helps you to understand the hatred. Of course, it doesn't help you to forgive the perpetrators because they have not forgiven themselves. Brutal and honest."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"My book group just finished \\"The Help\\" (I know that should be underlined but I could not figure out how to do it) by Kathryn Stockett and someone recommended this as a good companion book to understand the reality of race relations.

It was very interesting and well-written, and I'd recommend it to anyone !"},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"One of the first prominent Southern whites to write about and speak openly against racism and segregation, Lillian Smith (1897-1966) spoke out all her life against injustice. Killers of the Dream, published in 1949 to wide controversy, became the source of much of our thinking about race relations and a catalyst for the civil rights movement. A closeted Lesbian, Smith had a lifelong relationship with Paula Snelling. The two published a literary magazine that critiqued the pre-60s South and gave voice to writers of any color.This book is an analysis of the dynamics of racism that still rings true. Given the evidence that racism is rising again, it is appropriate to read or reread it. Smith also saw the connections between racial and sexual oppression. Her essay on women, black and white, in the South is deeply insightful. Her essay on the bargain between Mr. Poor White and Mr. Rich White clarifies what we see played out yet today. Her story of the New Deal is amazing. What some people felt then is echoed by Tea Partiers today. \\"We'll do these things that will profit us financially and morally but we'll never admit Federal aid has helped us, we'll always call it \`interference'.\\"Literate, poetic and unflinching, this depth study of the history of the South will widen your understanding and fill in the gaps for you."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"It was a revelation to learn of this articulate, brilliant, and beautiful woman who came into the world a generation or two before me.How wonderful it would have been to have a mentor such as Ms. Smith during the difficult days of the Civil Rights Movement! Many of us (women in Memphis)came together to do what we could to support the leaders, few as they were, in our churches and synagogues who actively supported the Movement - but it was extremely difficult. The Voice of Lillian Smith would have been a great help to us all.Nonetheless, reading her at this point in my life is pure gift."},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"I've had this on my keeper shelf for years and re-read it every now and then. Lillian Smith was a brilliant recluse who wrote honestly, poetically and with keen observance about the race, class and gender prejudices that shaped the South, and which are still evident today. This is as important a book as Cash's \\"The Mind of the South\\" but much more accessible (IMO) because it is so moving, with compassion for all. Our present flows out of the past. If you are curious about American history and current politics, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Killers of the dream (Norton library ed)","review":"I was given a copy of &#34;Killers of the Dream&#34; by an aunt, a college professor.

It should be read by ALL Americans so that we understand our in-depth social ills and challenges."},{"Title":"Tongues of Men and Angels","review":"I read Tongues of Men and Angels months ago, and since I still think about it, I decided to write a review. It's an enjoyable and effortless read, especially because of the mystery and mysticism. It's intellectually stimulating in that it's full of puzzles, lots of little ones plus one big one. But the reason that I still think about the book is because it raises a deep question about the nature of language. It's a question that is reasonable yet appealingly mystical, almost spiritual.The book certainly doesn't require knowledge of linguistics, but linguists will find delightful subleties that others wouldn't notice.I should also add that the book has some scary parts and some racy parts.

I hated for it to end - I would have enjoyed continuing my journey with those characters in their evolving world."},{"Title":"Tongues of Men and Angels","review":"The characters are definitely engaging. Although some you might not want to engage with in real life, you enjoy their natural fit in the story. Some are especially likable; one I feel close enough to write and see how she is doing-like she really exists! All build the story chapter by chapter. When reluctant to leave off at one character's scene, you are more than consoled by picking up where you left off with another character, until the interrelations coalesce in the dramatic and creative conclusion. It's imaginative content is affective: arousing curiosity and satisfying your intellect, and repulsing you one moment, making you laugh another."},{"Title":"Tongues of Men and Angels","review":"A wonderfully original book - Pritchett has delivered an interesting, fast-paced and unique book.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Tongues of Men and Angels","review":"Anyone who loved The Da Vinci Code for its mix of thrilling adventure and academic/theological puzzles, or the Harry Potter series for their wonder and appealing characters, or fans of the latest Stephen King novel that frightens you witless -- this is a book you MUST read! I am a college professor and writer, spend hours reading and editing for work, therefore I choose my pleasure-reading with great care and am generally a cranky reader. I meant to read the first few pages of this novel and then set it down to return to work, but I couldn't. I was transfixed!"},{"Title":"Tongues of Men and Angels","review":"This book will appeal to those who enjoy learning as they read their fiction.

After being held as a POW in North Vietnam for six and a half years Colonel Ed. Hubbard brings a unique perspective to life that most of us can benefit from.

As I listened to his testimontial I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The stories of defeat and triumph, discovering the potential within the (his) human spirit to get him through a long and arduous stint as a POW. What a story . . . needless to say I'm in the middle of his book and can't put it down. I would recommend this for anyone who has ever had a bad day and would like to know what that really is - and how you are responsible for the outcome - when you put it in it's proper perspective all that is happening in the world. FANTASTIC BOOK!"},{"Title":"Escape from the Box: The Wonder of Human Potential","review":"I heard Col. Hubbard tell his story a few years ago.

Hubbard and his book."},{"Title":"Escape from the Box: The Wonder of Human Potential","review":"Col. Hubbard is a wonderful speaker and writer. His recollections about his experiences in Vietnam are powerful and moving.

I have read nearly everything the market has to offer on success, and have grown tired of the endless formulas, to do lists, gimmicks and phoney positive thinking concepts that you forget as soon as you put the book down. Colonel Hubbard's philosophy was forged in the hell of a North Vietnamese prison camp and applied, WITH RESULTS, in the real world when he got out and finished his career as an Air Force officer. His simple, no b.s. approach drove the bureaucrats and his superiors crazy, but it worked. To sum it up, Colonel Hubbard believes that regardless of your endeavor, there is something you can do today to improve on yesterday's performance. Human potential is controlled by two things-what you think you can do and how hard you are willing to work to accomplish it-that's it! Why should it be more complicated? He discusses attitude, work ethic, stress and courage with real life examples anyone can relate to. As he puts it, reaching a goal is one percent talent and ninety-nine percent effort.

Many nuggets of wisdom here. It's a small but powerful book, so don't be fooled by it's size."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you aren't familiar with C.S. Lewis, he has an amazing way of turning seemingly complicated topics into understandable truths. In the Great Divorce, the reader gets a short, sweet and spectacular glimpse into what heaven and hell might look like."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I highly recommend this book. It was in good condition, and the book itself is very well written. It's a compelling visualization of heaven and hell, in a somewhat symbolic manner. C.S. Lewis is a genius."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is the perfect vehicle for C.S. Lewis' thoughts on the miseries we all bring upon ourselves and others in the name of love and dignity. The story follows a character who finds himself traveling with and observing a group of people faced with the prospect of choosing between misery and joy, a choice complicated by the fact that joy requires sacrificing grudges and glories. I read the book as a teenager and found it rather on the dull side, but it is short. The plot hasn't changed--it's still on the dull side--but the plot is not the point of the story. It doesn't follow the traditional arc of conflicts leading to conclusion, it is more like a series of vignettes that give a clear picture of the foolishness bound up in our own natural hearts.\\"There is always something they insist on keeping, even at the price of misery. There is always something they prefer to joy--that is, to reality. Ye see it easily enough in a spoiled child that would sooner miss its play and its supper than say it was sorry and be friends. Ye call it the Sulks. But in adult life it has a hundred fine names--Achilles' wrath and Coriolanus' grandeur, Revenge and Injured Merit and Self-Respect and Proper Pride.\\"Each picture is, by virtue of its truth, vivid and uncomfortable. How often do I cut off my nose to spite my face, making excuses to lash out at others rather than admit my fears and failures when a gracious word would not only soothe others but myself as well.And yet there is hope. The self imprisoned, as C.S. Lewis says, are not allowed to blackmail the universe. The name of love might be corrupted and abused, but love itself remains uncontaminated and eventually triumphant for those who embrace it. There is a bridge by which we may get back from exile."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"There's a reason why people win awards for their audiobook presentations. Just an average performance requires one person to act an entire cast of characters using only voice. A good reader does this without resorting to growls for the men and sing-song for the women; somehow he or she will represent characters of all genders and ages so inconspicuously that the listener will never be distracted with irritating thoughts about how terrible that middle aged man sounds as a teenage girl and such. Robert Whitfield is splendid at portraying a range of average and extreme characters with what seems like great ease. I will note that one interpretation that did distract me with its unexpected and in my mind unduly diffident tone. However, considering that by now I've heard him voice well over fifty characters, one doesn't seem much of a tarnish to his track record."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I am an atheist, and I was delighted by \\"The Great Divorce\\".I have a predilection for off-beat fiction, and this is abstruse indeed. But not confusing or difficult. In a fantasy bus-ride from Hell to Heaven, Lewis shows how there is no Heaven or Hell except those we make for ourselves, either before or after death. (The idea that underlies the film \\"What Dreams May Come\\".) I'll probably go to Hell for it, but I couldn't help giggling as I watched the various Ghosts, in their conversations with angels, reveal all the nasty feelings they had held in life (are there seven deadly sins in there somewhere? Pride, Envy, Lust, I noticed for certain), and condemn themselves, Browning-like, out of their own mouths, to go back down because they cannot see Something Bigger.Catholic theology is a very deep mine (after all, the finest minds have been devoted to shoring it up for two thousand years) and it is wonderful what fiction can be dug from it. This book has something in common with Chesterton's \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\", but the theological message is somewhat different.This little (one-hour) book should be compulsory reading in Catholic High Schools; unless of course it has been placed on the Papal Index!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Encourages you to examine your thoughts on heaven and hell. Most of us have hazy pictures at best as to what these places/things look like, and Lewis has a vivid imagination. His thoughts on heaven and hell challenge traditional views, and make you question where your beliefs come from. I found his views contradicting mine quite often, but then studied to find that many of my beliefs were not founded in the Bible as I had previously thought, but were rather other people's interpretation of hell as well."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"While I don't necessarily agree w/ Lewis' ideas of heaven and hell, it was written in an innovative way and was certainly thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read this book 8 years ago. It is part of who I am"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"One reviewer wrote that he felt the book said \\"To enter into Heaven, the only prerequiste was to give up a vice. That was all. Some lust, some apostasty, some selfishness and false love. \\" In all respect, I beg to disagree. I feel Lewis was saying that In order to get the desires of your heart, ( The mother Pam wanted to be with her son Michael for example)The first desire of your heart should be for God. \\"Seek ye FIRST the Kingdom of God, and HIS rightiousness, and (then) all these things will be added. God wants to give us everything, but he is unable to until we give up our nothingness."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is the best book ever written. What else needs to be said? Lewis artfully mixes Platonism, Orthodoxy, and Imagination to the benefit of the reader. A tale full of deep Christian metaphors. Lay mysticism at its best."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Just plain boring, and difficult to read because of that. I just wanted to get it over with. The book just seems to be preaching about all of our human pitfalls. Yeah, no kidding - we see that that every single day on the news and on every so-called reality TV show. I won't be reading any more from this author."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Very disappointed in the audio book, it's like trying to listen to a Theatrical Movie with a British accent that was hard to understand. I feel like it was 10% good and the rest of that 90% just filler."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I myself didn't like THE GREAT DIVORCE much as a story, nor as a picture of Heaven and Hell (and of purgatory, or at least purgation), nor for its characters though in 150 pages with lots of characters one can't expect much, and what we get is OK for what it is (half a paragraph about Napoleon!)."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"On an artistic level I would personally rate this work by C.S. Lewis very poor. Characters are two-dimensional. Plot is developed from the perspective that Christianity is the only truth, Heaven and Hell exist for a certainty, and that there is justification for eternal damnation for those who won't see the light. Due to the heavy moralizing, this is more like a religious pamphlet than a work of fiction. Then, why four stars? Despite what I perceive to be flaws in this book,there are some extremely penetrating representations of rationalizing, manipulative behavior. These little vignettes of lost souls willfully denying joy to themselves and trying to deprive others of it also, leaves a haunting impression that Lewis has truthfully revealed the modus operandi of much of mankind. We are allowed to eavesdrop on some conversations between the saved and the damned in which it is obvious the lost souls actually prefer remaining in the Hell they have created for themselves rather than give up their obsessive behavior. Whether or not we agree this is grounds for eternal damnation, I think there is a good lesson here, illustrated quite effectively, to work toward honest relationships free of game-playing. On further reflection, I think this title more worthy of three stars due to the dreary blend of moralizing and fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Not only does \\"The Great Divorce\\" contain too many abstract allegories, but what makes it worse is these allegories are also inaccurate and in some cases false considering this book is written by a Christian author, who seems to believe in hell as being equivalent to annihilation, as alluded near the end of the book. This book talks about C.S Lewis trying to describe the characteristics of people who are supposedly in heaven and hell, much too-humanized ones to the point that they sound bland and dull; those in hell represented by the characters called \\"the Ghosts\\"; and those in heaven represented by \\"the Spirits\\" by contrasting their joy and misery; happiness and sorrow; love and hatred; charity and malice, respectively. He is trying to put together the secular and biblical views into these characters and the result is ugliness and awkwardness. Even for readers with a great imaginative power to interpret what the true meaning behind the conversations and events surrounding these Ghosts and Spirits is, I still doubt they would be able to resolve the ambiguity. Heaven and hell are the subjects that require more careful and studious efforts to illustrate than what Lewis has done here. For those who are interested in them, I have not read any good fictions about them, but I would suggest Jonathan Edwards' \\"Heaven: A World of Love\\", and \\"The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners\\" or his famous \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\\" that readers could access online free of charge. Among many other books that Lewis wrote, some of which are excellent ones, but this one is to be avoided."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis makes it clear in both the introduction and in the narrative itself that he is not trying to convey a literal protrait of heaven and hell. But the imagery he uses - hell as a dreary, gray town where nothing is worth doing, heaven resonating with natural beauty and awesome fantasy - has the feel of something as close to the reality as we can probably imagine while still here on earth. An incredible book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This may sound very strange, but I do not consider myself an orthodox Christian anymore, being too far drawn into the theology and love of Buddhism. But I still value my Christian heritage and in a strange way I still believe in God.I read almost all of C. S. Lewis's works many years ago and &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is the best. My sister loves it too. We have both read it multiple times and given it as presents.There are so many precious images -- the Great Lady who was an unknown saint was my favorite. I must admit that it is a bit stark and frightening. It is kind of a shock theology, meant to stir you from your spiritual slumber. But what you get is an electrifying glimpse into the divine and the vast worlds upon worlds that span all the horizons beyond our feeble minds and hearts.Reading Lewis did not make me stay an orthodox Christian but in a deeper sense he conveyed some fundamental truths that go beyond Christianity (a sentiment he would have no doubt have found horrifying!)"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If I were alone on a desert island, I would hope to have this book with me!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I've bought and read it many times over the past 30+ years. I do have to keep buying copies though, because I love it so much that I have to share it with others and I keep giving it away. I just added another copy to my shopping cart. I first read it as a young woman and the story's premise that each person creates their own heaven and hell has never left me. Please buy this book so I don't have to buy it for you. It really is a story you won't be able to put down once you start it, then you will think about its theological meanings and reread it for the rest of your life. Talk about getting your money's worth!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not quite sure what I had in mind when I picked this book up, but a full length analogical story definitely was not in my mind when I started. But that really didn't matter, because that's exactly what Lewis wrote in \\"The Great Divorce\\".In it, Lewis used a rather interesting vision of what heaven and hell are (not) like. I say \\"(not) like\\" because Lewis admits in his introduction that this was intended from the first to be a moral story, not an exploration of what might be. He explains his purpose in a clarity that only a writer of his caliber can explain - and I highly recommend reading the introduction, because it is short and simple, but sharply insightful.The great divorce which Lewis is writing about is that great separation between Heaven and Hell. To me, it seems, the primary concern is with personal priorities and values. How much value do you place in your children, your friends, your personal opinions and soapboxes thereof? Lewis deftly and surgically dissects these and exposes their inherent danger.I fear to attempt to explain much more for two simple reasons. I think my explanations will confuse more than intrigue, for I don't quite have the talent of Lewis for simplicity. And secondly, I would rather you approach this book with an open mind and experience an allegorical journey which is even more piercing for yourself than the title character, one which is written by a master of the genre.So yes, I absolutely recommend this book. To everyone. It challenges you to think. I recommend it for teenagers as well as for adults. It would be a great book to read through with your children. Just get your hands on a copy and dive in!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I listened to the audio version and it was superbly done. The book itself is great, and then this reading really adds to it. The reader does a great job with the various British accents, fitting them well to each character. This is a great way to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I've read it several times and I've had to buy new copies because I keep giving it away. The Great Divorce starts off a little slowly, but you have to hang in there through the first couple of chapters. It is NOT a book about marital divorce, but rather about letting go of the things you think you want or need in order to gain that which is of much greater value."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I remember enjoying this book because it opened a door. You must understand that I view religion as an important tool for giving people a since of security and moral foundation. Religion hands people comforting answers to questions that can be difficult to take without support (i.e. What happens when we die? and Why are we here?). It also helps to setup responsibilty over and above the laws of the land. When you are held before your maker you will be more caitous than if you were to break a traffic law and are judged by your next door neighbor. This book shows that there is a wide array of possible scenarios for life after death. My belief is that it doesn't matter what you choose as your answers. It matters that you do believe in your answers to give you the security to live your life. I happen to like C.S. Lewis' view of Heaven and Hell. It makes me wonder if some of the Bible could have been someone's answers put down on paper."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Short and sweet allegory that can be read in a day. I know that it's intended as fiction, but it really said a lot about human nature and hinted at what heaven might be like. It's been a struggle throughout my life to find a description of heaven that makes any sort of sense to my post-modern mind, and I think this comes really, really close. And in the end, I think the question it's asking the reader is, \\"So what character are you going to be like?\\" It's a book I recommend to readers from all kind of backgrounds if they've ever wondered about the afterlife."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Another important work; few put words to print as Lewis is able. Through a dream: The journey to heaven; leaving earth. A fantasy depiction of the after-world. Outstanding--beautiful work--powerful. \\"A solely imaginative supposal\\" of what's to come--the purpose is to deliver a moral message.We follow his journey as first person: We meet travelers on the way; the righteous forms and the lost ghosts. The story is set between worlds (purgatory?): Exquisite, harsh, interesting, hard (literally), and in a way entertaining. We observe the learning of truth through conversation and the choice to make the right changes. We discover what we thought was righteousness and the abandonment of God (apostatism). The lost are caught up with the past world; they are blind.Christ is the only way-there is no other-believe in Him; believe as a child believes. Leave worldly things behind.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It has come as a surprise to me how few people have read \\"the Great Divorce\\" in comparison with \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" Nevertheless, I consider the former to be Lewis' masterpiece, given the obscurity of the subject matter and the sublimity with which he handles it.The Great Divorce is pure conjecture, and Lewis makes it clear that no-one should take his imagery of heaven & hell to be informative. But it is in the way that Lewis grapples with the central tenet of Christianity that stands out above all else.It is one thing to cite the commandments, or paint an image of man beset by temptations and personified evil. It is another to address apologetically the reasons for accepting Christianity and Christ. But Lewis' genius in The Great Divorce is to make it clear what \\"Love of God\\" really means - in its many forms.It is almost impossible in our conceptions of the afterlife to put aside our sole plane of reference - ourselves. The very concept of communion is alien to us. Our linkages with other people, no matter how profound the relationships, are shallow compared with the depth of divine Love. And yet Lewis manages to catch hold of the edge of the beatific vision, perhaps in his metaphor of substantiality.The Great Divorce is thus one of those books that ought to be read once a year - perhaps a few days after Easter Sunday, for a reminder of what we ought to value above all else."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It is almost absurd to write a review about a Lewis book because everything he wrote is worth reading and pondering. But I write this review to encourage the prospective reader. In this book, we are challenged to radical conversion, to turn away from our own comfortable assumptions and wisdom, to \\"get off the bus\\" we have been riding in all our lives and to get off at a new and challenging stop. The surprise is that the new and off-putting stop is heaven. The even greater surprise is how hard it is to get us to accept the gift."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I rarely have the time or attention span to sit and read a book all the way through in one sitting! This book is the exception. I was interested and fascinated from page One till the end. This is probably one of Lewis' best."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I had read Lewis' Mere Christianity and the Screwtape Letters, so when a friend recommended this book, I knew it was probably well-written and thought-provoking. I was not disappointed! The ideas about how to get to heaven are so often muddled and watered down that many people think that they are most certainly heaven bound. However, Lewis skillfully paints a picture of the stumbling blocks that come with our stubborn self-will. He presents a poignant reminder that to truly seek The Lord we must be willing to let go of that same will. This book is among my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The unnamed main character takes a bus ride from hell to the entrance heaven. Upon arrival he sees many of his fellow bus riders choose to go back to hell rather than continue on into the land that promises a great reward. It is both interesting and instructive to watch them choose to keep their pet sins rather than let them go and enter into the perfect world.I highly recommend the book, I enjoyed it thoroughly. However, if you are expecting a Chronicles of Narnia type read, with great character development and exciting adventure, you may be a bit disappointed. Lewis seems to use intentionally vague, nondescript language, especially during the first few chapters. This can make the book a little hard to follow at first. However, just like his description of heaven, if you will endure the reward will certainly be worth it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I am blown away! What a profound story with so much depth and meaning!It is so sad, eye opening, and yet so good it made me smile at the end. :)(A story about heaven and hell), this book has given me a different perspective on eternity, immortality, lost souls, and seeking God and enjoying Him.I thought I wouldn't highlight much of the book being a narrative, but there were so many deep truths you can pull from this book.This book reminds me of one of C.S. Lewis' quotes: \\"...we are far too easily pleased.\\"Read this book. It's beautiful."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Maybe one of my favorite works of Lewis (I've read no less than 30). Lewis brilliantly shines light to the often unexamined events, choices, and thoughts that stream through the conscious and unconscious mind. This work is an easy to read, captivating story and will change how you think about the subtleties of depth that exists in what might otherwise be considered mundane.5 stars is simply not enough!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' story of a bus trip from hell to heaven is one of Lewis' most quotable books, and contains a number of fascinating insights into human nature. The book is perhaps best summed up in the quote, \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \\"Thy will be done,\\" and those to whom God says, in the end, \\"Thy will be done.\\" All that are in Hell, choose it.\\" It is one of those books you can easily read from cover to cover in one night."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A book about Heaven and Hell could be awful. But C.S. Lewis's fresh take on the subject is both entertaining and thought provoking. Written in his inimitable style, Lewis imagines a busful of visitors from Hell, on a day trip to Heaven, and relates their reactions and thoughts as they speak with their hosts, who wish them to stay. Not your usual scenario. The book is short and very readable, as C.S. Lewis always is, and although the ending is a bit abrupt, his point (which I will leave you to discover) is clear and the writing lucid. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"While I am not a great fan of the doctrine of purgatory, this book is a timeless classic of Christian literature. In a way that one only gradually comprehends, Lewis takes the reader along on his version of an \\"after death\\" experience, illuminating along the way what the implications of their choices during mortal existence really look like. He accomplishes this by going to the very doorstep of heaven and eavesdropping on conversations between the deceased and residents of heaven, showing that their choices to go in or turn back have already been made.
