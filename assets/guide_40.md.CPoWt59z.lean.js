Written in clear, illustrative and beguilingly gorgeous prose, Wells manages to paint a truly timeless and ultimately unforgettable portrait of the future that has well stood the test of time. There are problems with the novel - at times Wells seems impatient with necessary narrative elements and in a rush to get on with the greater issues at hand - but there is hardly anything better than his beautifully understated observations on man and his future in the entire canon of English literature.Not just a greatly visualized and highly original piece of Science Fiction, Wells' novel remains timely in this day in age by tackling the disturbing question of man's ultimate fate in light of Charles Dawin's then revolutionary ideas as presented in THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES. Though typically we think of evolution as being linear, and POSITIVELY linear at that, in THE TIME MACHINE Wells addresses his anxiety that evolution may not always result in the positive progression of a species, but may, in fact, present just the opposite possibility - an eventual de-evolution, which Wells foresaw as the unavoidable social future of man, resultant of the extremely striated class structure and sociology of his times. Social politics aside, such is a piquant concept, and an enduring one that man still grapples with today, making this grandfather of Science Fiction worth another look."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"This book was very interesting and fun to read, however I felt that the plot was summerised too much. I enjoyed the plot because it was interesting to realize slowly but surely how life was in the far future.

The working class has developed into the Morlocks, who have become physically repulsive creatures of the night yet retain some knowledge of technology. The aristocrats have become the Eloi, attractive yet utterly useless, living like sheep. Without the constraints of economics to protect the elite class, the Morlocks have begun to feed on them literally, just as the upper-class could have been said to feed on the workers figuratively during the Victorian Era. Besides such social commentary, Wells also treats us to a haunting glimpse of the Earth at the end of time, where great crab-like creatures scuttle beside a drying sea under a dying sun. Superior to the vast majority of the time travel sub-genre that this novel spawned."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"HG Wells describes the effects of time speeding up so vividly.

However, I picked up this book out of curiosity fostered by all of the hype. I was pleasantly surprised by the calm preciseness of the narrative, and the fascinating issues the book raises. I expected more actions or descriptions, but most of the events seemed to be emotional or visceral. (With classics, your level of enjoyment seems to correlate with your level of expectation.)The most fascinating part of the book is when the scientist tells the tale of what he did at the end of his initial journey into the future.This is a must-read for anyone. If you don't like it, it will at least give you some meaty topics to think about in our modern, tumultuous society."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"Recently brought to cinemas again by Well's great-grandson Simon Wells, it's pretty obvious why this landmark science fiction tome has been visioned by Hollywood so much. Wells' story starts off with a man known only as the Time Traveller, who tells a group of friends his extraordinary tale of how he went into the distant future with his time machine. Wells weaves his masterful storytelling traditions brilliantly. You can always tell if a book is superior if you can envision the settings, the landscapes, and, to the Hollywood filmmakers, the camera shots. The story consists of the Time Traveller journeying to a distant earth where beings of the surface are haunted by the creatures of the underground world. H.G Wells created a story that has amazed and fascinated readers for years. And like his other incredible book, War of the Worlds (Also a popular Hollywood dipping well), the Time Machine is a shocking vision of what we are as people and what we, as humans will become. This amazing story holds a deserved place in the library of all-time greats. H.G Wells' talent for storytelling is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"What makes Wells so enjoyable to read is how pessimistic he is about human nature. When the Time Traveler goes into the future, man has not evolved in a Darwinian sense - he has devolved into the Eloi - the stupid surface-dwellers - and the Morlocks - the monsters that live underground and feed off the Eloi. As the traveler goes far into the future, man eventually shrinks into some kind of rabbit-like creature on a barren planet. Say what you will for him, Wells wasn't a humanist."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"In \\"The Time Machine\\" by:H.G. Wells,a respected scientist invents a time machine. He demonstrates a model to several people and insists that traveling through time is possible. Also, he claims, that once he completes his machine, he will attempt to do so. When they meet again at his house, they find a note saying that if he's not there by 8:00 to start eating the food on the table. At about 8:30, they hear someone coming down the stairs who turns out to be, as they call him, the Time Traveller. What worries them is that he's walking with a limp and his clothes are in rags. He insists on eating before he tells them his story, which I won't tell you about.I would recommend this book to people 12 and up. It's quite complicated and at times can be tough to understand. It's also very graphic about his revenge on the Morlocks, which are intelligent, sub-terranian creatures that come out at night.I rate this book with four stars. I give it this rating because it takes forever to get to the point and isn't very descriptive about the way things look. I can hardly get a picture in my mind of what his time machine looked like.I give \\"The Time Machine\\" By:H.G.

Wells, is the story of an adventurous inventor who builds the fantastic device of the book's title. With this marvelous device he travels to the year 802,701 AD, where he discovers a vastly changed humanity.This book is a great classic--it's a science fiction landmark written with both brains and heart. Despite its short length it really has the scope and flavor of an epic--think of it as a miniature epic. Wells achieves a flawless blend of horror, mystery, adventure, and social satire as his traveler explores this strange new world. Wells' superb descriptive language really brings this bizarre future to life.For some stimulating companion texts, try Octavia Butler's &quot;Kindred,&quot; David Gerrold's &quot;The Man Who Folded Himself,&quot; and Edwin Abbott's &quot;Flatland.&quot; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; is one of those great classics which remains both enjoyable and thought-provoking; it's perfect from its evocative opening sentence to its heartbreaking final sentence."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"H.G. Wells (the father of science fiction) has written a masterpiece with this novel. Wells and Jules Verne who I consider to be the best science fiction writers to date are extremely similar in their approach, but both write brilliant novels. The Time Machine is not only a book about science fiction. I do believe that Wells' main purpose for writing this book was to comment on the social picture of London in the 1800s. As you will notice if you read this book, Wells goes into detail (though not commenting directly) on how an aristocracy (Eloi) can destroy themselves by becoming complacent and allowing a working class (Morlocks) to do all of the work. The Time Machine is in addition to being a political dissertation a wonderful science fiction/adventure novel as well that you will not want to put down until the end. Do not rent the movie (version with Guy Pearce) though in place of the book - the plot does not mirror the book at all and it is subpar."},{"Title":"The time machine,: An invention,","review":"The school where I am teaching had this book in the syllabus to do in the beginning of 8th grade but after carefully reading through the book and assessing its advantages and disadvantages it is clear to me that although the book is a fantastic sci-fi novel and intricate portrayl of a futuristic world, it is not a book for adolescents or young adults. The language, although beautiful, is antiquated and the meaning gets convoluted in many ways. The vocabulary is extremely advanced and the theoretical diatribes are way out of a Middle School or early High Schooler's league. Kids would struggle through this book and not get to enjoy it as they might with a less complicated read. H.G.

But lots of bones (when you visualize)(they're probably from the helpless victims of the morlocks) I think this is a very good book because the author was trying to warn people that things might not be as we expected in the future.Near the end he travels in time to bring back proof of what he saw.

Well's hero then travels into the future where he is forced to come to grips with the horrible fate in store for humanity...but I won't tell you what that is... But, even more than the entertaining nature of this book, the author manages to point out some of the flaws that existed (and still do) in society and by showing a future world where those problems destroy the human race he manages to become a crusader for change.

According to local legend (which some question), Simenon wrote his first story involving Maigret, titled The Case of Peter the Lett, in 1929 while residing at Delfzijl aboard the Ostrogoth, a small barge.Regardless, this particular story, Maigret in Holland (published 1931, first published in English in 1940), does indeed take place in Delfzijl. A visiting, pedantic French sociology professor, Jean Duclos, finds himself accused of murder. Inspector Maigret is posted from Paris to oversee the situation.Maigret is in unfamiliar territory, one with sabots - wooden shoes, bargees - barge men, colliers - ships for transporting coal, and bollards - posts around which are fastened moorings. The community is small, close knit, and not especially welcoming to strangers, certainly not French inspectors. Unexpectedly, he almost immediately is commandeered to help with the birth of a purebred Frisian calf. Worse yet, many of the key individuals that Maigret wishes to question do not speak French!But this is classic Maigret; he bides his time, not jumping to conclusions. He builds a case through routine police methods and astute psychological observations. As with most Maigret mysteries, the story is more about characters and psychology than the puzzle itself.My copy of Maigret in Holland is a 1994 Harvest Book edition, translated by Geoffrey Sainsbury. It is larger than a standard paperback, about 8 inches by 5 inches."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"The book opens in a tidy little Dutch town full of serene people. Conrad Popinga, an instructor of cadets, has been unaccountably murdered. Because a Frenchman is being detained as a witness, or perhaps a suspect, Maigret is dispatched to the scene.Maigret slowly but surely sniffs out the passions that have been smoldering beneath the unbelievable calm of this picture-perfect community.Almost everyone has a motive - and there are too many clues!\\"You don't think...?\\" someone says to Maigret.\\"I don't think anything,\\" Maigret replies. It's always reassuring when we encounter this signature phrase, because we know the Chief Superintendent is absorbing impressions, pondering personalities - anything but being rational!No one will thank Maigret for solving the case, but the reader has plenty to be thankful for - full-bodied characters, wry exchanges and amusing descriptions of the locale."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"A prominent French criminologist lecturing in Holland is accussed of murder. As a courtesy, the French Police send Jules Maigret in an unofficial capacity to assist in the investigation. With his usual brilliance, Maigret begins to unravel the mystery.Simenon's Inspector Maigret is a deeply Parisian character. He is at his best, exploring the nooks and crannies of Paris. In this novel, Simenon plucks Maigret out of Paris and places him in rural Holland. Whereas, Paris is rich in seedy atmosphere, tidy Holland is its exact opposite. Maigret fans will enjoy seeng him operate in a foreign context. I would not recommend this book as the first book for Maigret novice. It is better to be first exposed to him in his element."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"I have always loved Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret novels and stories. And as I was going to visit Holland, I decided to read MAIGRET IN HOLLAND for &quot;atmosphere.&quot;Simenon doesn't disappoint. A murder takes place in a small Dutch seaport. Maigret is called in, and instantly everyone's hackles are aroused by this outsider Frenchman asking questions about why a popular resident was found dead. As usual, the more Maigret casts his eyes around, the more suspects and suspicious characters come to light. The darker side of human nature emerges from the outwardly benign residents, who are embroiled in a whole complex of deadly sins involving the victim.Was it the luscious and lubricious milkmaid? The shady character hanging around the docks? The victim's sister? widow? And what part did that hat play?Well, so sorry, I'm not going to spoil this one for you. You'll have to read it yourself, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"As usually, this Simenon's novel is very close to painting !I love Holland, and this novel remind me some Vermeer's (of Delft) paintings.And the story is excellent with a lot of empathy and psychology."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"\\"Maigret in Holland\\" is a spare, neat and small package of naturalist writing that plunks the archtypical Parisian Inspector Maigret down in the heart of northern Holland, where everything is orderly, quiet and well-mannered. Except that a violent murder has been committed in the midst of this ordered tranquility, and a French citizen visiting the locale has been implicated.The strengths of this small novel are the author's unrivaled talent for presenting a credible physical backdrop (the reader can literally see the environment), and for the interactions and conversations between the story's characters, which always dive well beyond the surface.This is a fine crime story by one of the great masters of the genre. It is quite leisurely in its pace compared to contemporary crime/action novels, but ultimately it's an excellent read."},{"Title":"Maigret in Holland","review":"Bottom line is that there's just not much to this story. Weak characters, an uninteresting plot, and a lame mystery just left me flat. This is the first Maigret mystery that I have read, and to be fair maybe I just don't care for his character and that bled into my opinion of everything else. I don't know.

His character is far from the gun-slinging killer we expect from the creed from the beginning. We have been turning him into one by having monsters systematically everything he holds dear, filling him with rage. This book has helped me as a storyteller develop a better sub-plot to accomplish this transformation without going completely overboard and just slaying everything in one go around. As a player, my friend has managed to use this book for insight into how Avengers deal with his role in his group, as well as in society in general. For a character with two kids and a job as a high school Lit teacher, that seems important. This book makes it possible to create an Avenger who is more of a complete person than just a hard-core killing machine. I would suggest any of the Hunter books, but this one and perhaps Martyr and Innocent are the most vital."},{"Title":"Hunter-Book: Avengers","review":"O.K. I like to play Avengers, This book lets me define them as more than a killing machine. New Powers too. You can mix them up so when you have a few Avengers around they aren't all copycats. Also the other ways of playing an Avenger are great to roleplay."},{"Title":"Death and Life of Philosophy","review":"Those of us who place a high value on philosophy but find the modern version often pointlessly swamped in microscopic analytical concerns should read this book by Robert Greene. He analyses why philosophy is dying and what may be done to revive it. Greene's wit and erudition are formidable, while his clear layman's language is refreshing. He diagnoses why modern philosophy is such a frustrating experience for the many who consider it vital to a meaningful life, but now find it dysfunctional by ingrown professional pedantry.The author provisionally prescribes a radical restructuring of the discipline which among other remedies includes the spinning off of logic to mathematics, the history of philosophic ideas to the history department, and cognitive philosophy to the psychology department. Metaphysics, philosophy's core, remains. This cutting diagnosis and surgery comprise approximately the first third of the book. The next part presents a well reasoned remedy by revisiting Aristotle.The middle portion, in one long chapter, reconnects philosophy with its past by reverting to Aristotle's ideas on the psyche (soul) and mind which include his solution to the mind body problem. The modern disconnect, he argues, has caused the severing of philosophy with its past history of profoundly timeless ideas. Greene shows both scientifically and philosophically why Aristotle's position on the substantial unity of the mind and the underlying unity of the soul are a reasonable alternative to the centuries old problems modern philosophy, which separates mind and body and destroys the concept of soul. Thus, he rescues philosophy from the dilemmas posed by the modern schools of epistemology and analytic philosophy.The final third of the book advances another reason for the death of philosophy: academic careerism has mutilated it. The need to publish, to appear original, to puff the present at the expense of the past, to acquire tenure at all costs are all part of the tiresome litany. Also it would seem that academic philosphers are hopelessly fixated on philosphy's problems, while unfortunately the rest of mankind desire her solutions. Thus, Greene calls for sweeping academic reform.In the end, the author dissects the academy well, but the heart of the book is the middle section, and it is the best part. He instructs the plain truth as taught by Aristotle and which was illuminated through the centruies by his scientific and philosophic followers- and now very ably too by Robert Greene, his brilliant student."},{"Title":"Death and Life of Philosophy","review":"To Redeem PhilosophyRobert Greene has written a highly unique and admirably readable book, which accomplishes three main tasks. These are to: 1. give a summary of western philosophy from Plato to the present, 2. describe the sorry state of modern philosophy, particularly in the academic arena, and 3. to show how this situation might be redeemed.The book itself is divided into two parts.

Greene is a very skilled writer and knowledgeable scholar who explains the ideas of major philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, and Hume with insight and humor. While some students may find the text demanding, it should inspire them to delve more deeply into the subject matter than they would otherwise have been inclined.Not all readers will accept Greene's call for a return to a more Aristotelian perspective, but his presentation of his case for Aristotle gives the book an elegant unity.Several of my students have commented favorably on the book.

I read the first two chapters and decided there were better things for me to be reading.I agree with his basic thesis, the contemporary academic philosophy scene has little to do with its supposed historic roots. I am relieved to hear that many contemporary professors of philosophy refer to themselves as &quot;professional philosophers&quot;-apparently both to distinguish themselves from New Age shamanists and to identify their true lineage beginning with those philodoxers once called Sophists.My problem with the work arises from Greene's utilitarian approach to philosophy. In the first chapter he quote's one of his teachers, John Herman Randall Jr., in describing philosophy as a sometimes wh*re to other disciplines and regions of concern, nationalist politics for instance. Greene promptly begins to evaluate the health of &quot;philosophy&quot; during a given historical period by its ability to unify the disciplines and present a coherent world view. I'm afraid Mr. Greene comes off as a lover of paradigm rather than wisdom or truth. He even seems to pity Plato for being unable to develop his &quot;theory&quot; of ideas into a system- as if Plato were some nineteenth century German professor of a field of inquiry called &quot;philosophy&quot;. This approach only serves to, once again, relegate philosophy to the role of, ahem, hand maiden.If the utilitarian/Enlightenment approach to knowledge (Greene even translates love of wisdom into the pursuit of wisdom, or science, completely losing the erotic element of the soul existing in the philosophic form) suits your tastes read Durant's _Story of Philosophy_. Durant has the merit of wit, a vice that excuses all others.PS If you feel I've wrongfully abused Greene without giving him a fair chance please help draw me from error to wisdom, or at least right opinion."},{"Title":"The art of stretching and kicking","review":"This book has absolutely no substance, just pictures.

The book has very little text. It's devided into two sections: the first half is on stretches, and the second half is on kicking (big supprise, huh?). The stretches deal mostly with the legs and torso/back, which is OK, given that this is a book on kicks, and not punches. The section on kicks deals with a variety of kicks, from the basic to advanced, but most of it is high, flashy stuff that looks good in competitions. I'd say that the greatest benifit is that of health, or good form. Some of the kicks might be useful in point fighting.

It was published in six volumes in 1754, 1756, 1759, and 1761. This fourth volume covers the period of Queen Elizabeth from 1558 to 1602. The previous volume wasThe History of England, Volume III (History of England, The), and the next volume isThe History of England: From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688: Volume V.He begins with the statement, \\"In a nation so divided as the English, it could scarcely be expected, that the death of one sovereign, and the accession of another, who was generally believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which prevailed, could be the object of universal satisfaction: Yet so much were men displeased with the present conduct of affairs... that the people, overlooking their theological disputes, expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the scepter had passed into the hands of Elizabeth... compassion towards her situation, and concern for her safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favourite of the nation.\\" (Pg. 3-4)He asserts, \\"Of all the European churches, which shook off the yoke of papal authority, no one proceeded with so much reason and moderation as the church of England; an advantage... partly from the gradual and slow steps, by which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage and animosity against the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be supposed in such a revolution... The splendor of the Romish worship, though removed, had at least given place to order and decency... And the new religion, by mitigating the genius of the ancient superstition... had preserved itself in that happy medium, which wise men have always sought...\\" (Pg. 119-120)He observes, \\"During these years, while Europe was almost every where in great commotion, England enjoyed a profound tranquility; owing chiefly to the prudence and vigour of the queen's administration, and to the wise precautions, which she employed in all her measures.\\" (Pg. 176) He adds, \\"The queen had now brought affairs with Mary [I] to that situation... and had found a plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor... But she was restrained ... She foresaw the invidious colours, in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partizans of Mary, and... all foreign princes, perhaps with all posterity... Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed with the execution of the sentence...\\" (Pg. 236)Of Mary [I, \\"Queen of Scots\\"] he states, \\"a woman of great accomplishments both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one period, very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make her the most amiable of women... she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable, without relinquishing those soft graces, which compose the proper ornament of her sex.\\" (Pg. 251)He summarizes about Elizabeth, \\"The unusual length of her administration, and the strong features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices... Her vigour, her constancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed to merit the highest praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any person that ever filled a throne.... Her heroism was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice, her friendship from partiality, her active temper from turbulency and a vain ambition... but we are also apt to require some more softness of disposition, some greater leniency of temper, some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished... her qualities as a sovereign, though with some considerable exceptions, are the object of undisputed applause and approbation.\\" (Pg. 351-353)While Hume's scholarship has since been superseded, his lively writing style makes this a series well worth reading."},{"Title":"The history of England, from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the revolution in 1688,","review":"This is a review of the Liberty Press edition, which is properly typeset and should be distinguished from the numerous print-on-demand versions currently (2011) advertised.This is the fifth of six volumes of Hume's History of England, though it was the first published, as it is the first of the two volumes of the History of the Stuarts that was the first part to be completed.

Still, readers may wonder why I give this book a 5-star rating. Although its explanations can be very clear, they can also be very dense; and no pictures - what would Alice think of that?Conze had a cranky disposition, often reflected in his writing. Sometimes it seems that he deliberately chooses the abrasive word -- \\"trance\\" for samadhi (J., sanmai, jo), or \\"self-extinction\\" for anatman (J., muga) -- when a more palatable alternative would suffice. In today's sound-bite world the appearance of such words only confirm the misapprehension of Buddhism as some kind of nihilistic \\"mysticism\\" which denies \\"the individual.\\"I stumbled on this book a half-century ago and pencilled comments throughout my copy testify to the impact it made on me. (Fortunately, this was before the advent of the awful-yellow-ink-felt-pen, so the pencilling can easily be removed.) In particular, it introduced me to the concept of the Mahayana Bodhisattva as a being defined by the CONTRADICTORY virtues of wisdom and compassion, and then to the prevalent use of METAPHOR in Buddhist religious language, which led to T.R.V. Murti's Central Philosophy of Buddhism, the Chinese \\"Ten Oxherding Pictures,\\" and The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch [of Ch'an, Zen], Hui Neng (Eno, 638-713)]. \\". . . Since Buddha is made by your own nature, do not look for him outside your own body. If you are deluded in your own nature, Buddha is then a sentient being; if you are awakened in your own nature, sentient beings are then Buddhas. Compassion is Avalokitesvara [Kannon]; joyfully giving is Mahasthamaprapta [Seishi]. . . \\". Yampolsky, p. 158. It all fits together.Conze: \\"(The Diamond Sutra states:) \\"Here. O Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should think thus : \\"As many beings as there are in the universe of beings. . .as far as any conceivable universe of beings is conceived; all these should be led by me into Nirvana, into that realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. And yet, although innumerable beings have thus been led to Nirvana, no being at all has been led to Nirvana. And why? If in a Bodhisattva the perception of a \`being' should take place, he would not be called an \`enlightenment being' (=bodhi sattva).\\"\\"A Bodhisattva is a being compounded of the two contradictory forces of wisdom and compassion. In his wisdom, he sees no persons; in his compassion he is resolved to save them. His ability to combine these contradictory attitudes is the source of his greatness, and his ability to save himself and others.\\" (p. 130)The Buddhism of Faith conceived of Bodhisattvas, embodiments of the virtues of windom and compassion, as concrete individuals, and furnished them with names, legends, and a definite tangible individuality. \\"Akshobhya and Amitabha [Amida], Avalokitesvara (Kuan-yin, Kannon] and Manjusri [Monju], all the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this school are, however, obviously productions of the mind, and without historical or factual basis. It is not easy to understand that the Mahayanists could admit this, as they did, and yet deny that these new saviours were mere creatures, nay figments, of the imagination, subjective and arbitrary inventions. It is impossible to explain their attitude by the absence of an historical sense generally found among Hindus, since we know that the Indian Buddhists of the Hinayana used to argue that they could not believe in the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana because there was no evidence of their actual existence.\\". . . in religion, one type of mind requires an actual historical fact to base its belief on, while another regards the productions of the creative mythological imagination as in no way inferior to the products of human history. . . The mythological school regards the mythological concept as the essential thing. Whether it is embodied, or not, in a person in history appears as a quite incidental and trivial detail. The names of Amitabha, etc., may be invented, but the reality behind them, the Absolute, is there all the time.\\" (pp.150-151)\\". . . The Tantrists agree, however, with the metaphysical assumptions of the Prajnaparamita, according to which only the reality of emptiness is fully real, whereas any kind of multiplicity would be ultimately unreal, and the fictitious product of our diseased imagination. The multiplicity of Gods would be really nothing but a fiction of the imagination, and not one of those deities would be really there. Our free thinking modern mind would whole heartedly agree with that postulate. There is, however, the important difference that, according to our modern assumptions, the multiplicity of things around us is real and the deities a less real fabrication due to the disappointments of our instinctual life when confronted with the hard facts of everyday \`reality'. According to the Tantra, things and Gods alike are equally unreal compared with the one vast emptiness, but on the whole the data of mythology represent a kind of fiction far more worthwhile than the data of our everyday practical experience, and when properly handled, can greatly assist us in winning emancipation from the fetters of existence.\\" (pp. 184 185).Does this speak to you?

I ordered one off of a rare-book site for eight bucks. I have another half to read, but I have been so engrossed. It is a must have for any true crime buff or student of psychology. It isn't the same narrative about David Berkowitz; rather; it tries to explain what caused him to become the famed serial killer that stalked New Yorkers in the late 70's. It explains the rough childhood, his learning he was adopted, the crushing blow of learning his true parents didn't want him and, without a doubt, the most fascinating part: STALKING. It is terrifying. He tells of other people he wounded in attempted murders, people who escaped being murderd, and the crimes that placed him behind bars. I strongly reccomend this book (I ALSO RECCOMEND THAT YOU TRY TO GET TIM CAHILL'S BURIED DREAMS, ABOUT GACY.

I now live in the NYC suburbs and stood marvelling at the Seagram bldg on Park Ave only 2 weeks ago. In the interim, I've been a consumer market researcher and Seagram has been a client off and on for more than 10 years. I'm also more than a bit interested in booze.Given the above, I find this book tremendously interesting with literally hundreds of details that were absolutely new to me... and I probably know more about the Bronfman family & Seagram than the average bear. If you're at all interested in the Bronfmans, Seagram or booze, you'll find this to be a fascinating read.But there are a lot of stylistic problems here as well. First, as other reviewers noted above, Faith's constant references to other authors / biographers is almost annoying. It's like he's personal friends with the other writers for goodness sake.Second, for some reason, Faith treats the Richler book (Solomon Gursky Was Here) as a more important reference source than personal interviews, biographies or other non-fiction sources. I read the Richler book and loved it but not sure why Faith needs to keep coming back to it?Third, the editing in this book is simply a mess - there's just no other word for it. Usually I don't even think about editing but with this book, it was so bad I almost stopped reading after the first 50 pages. In the first 4-5 chapters, Faith not only makes the same point multiple times but sometimes uses the same sentence! It was like deja-vu all over again. It's this last point that is most confusing to me - Faith is a former senior editor of The Economist so if anyone should get the editing right, its him.Anyway, I'll still give it 4 stars.

This is strange, because he has really done a lot of \\"homework\\" so that he could make the material his own. I was slowed down by his long awkward sentences and unending attributions. I guess it's better to acknowledge your sources rather than plagiarizing, but the book reads like a long term paper.Some of his conclusions are just thrown out there, such as this one about Sam's two daughters: \\"The girls were not even given Hebrew lessons--which makes one wonder if Mr. Sam secretly hoped that they would 'marry out.'\\" My experience as a young Jewish girl growing up in mid-century America was that it wasn't de rigeur for girls to attend Hebrew School; the boys went because they were preparing for an eventual bar mitzvah. The author previously discussed Mr. Sam's lack of religiosity (he held business meetings on Saturday and had only a nominally kosher kitchen at home). His son Edgar ignored Jewish ritual for a large part of his life, and \\"married out\\" several times. So much for the value of Hebrew School!An example of the multitude of sentences needing the touch of an editor is this one: \\"In 1971 his mother, Ann--who remained a staunch supporter--had left his father when he was in his teens after a period in which his father had paid little or no attention to his family.\\"Despite my desire to turn the pages a lot faster, I kept with the book and learned a lot about Canadian Jews, bootleggers, Scotch, anti-Semitism, and more.

Pure and simple Sam B et all were thugs and likely murders. Mr. Faith goes to grea great endless endless lengths to explaine how anti-semnitism shaped the Bronfman's. Huh. It never seems to occur to him that the alleged anti- Jewish sentiment could have been whipped up precisely because the Bronfmans made such a big deal of their religion/heritage solely to cover up their ways. That most of the people they dealth with and enriched were also Jewish thugs doesn't help. Mr. Faith's inability to deal with this fact almost ruins the book.Luckily however he is honest enough to move the story along and present many of the dirty facts even if he does always try to gloss over them There is also a little too much info on whiskey blends. A more detaled analysis of the ethnic root of prohibition and a clearler focus on the political bribery that grew the Bronfman fortune might put some of their alleged present day charitable acts in a clearer focus.

Later, Berdyaev moved to Paris, where he died in 1948.Berdyaev was a Russian Orthodox Christian, and I actually bought the Swedish translation of his book in the Orthodox bookstore in Stockholm. However, it's safe to say that Berdyaev's philosophy is very far removed from main-line Russian Orthodoxy. Even Bulgakov was more traditionally Orthodox. \\"The Meaning of History\\" acknowledges B&ouml;hme, Schelling and Baader as influences. Spengler might be another influence, and Berdyaev often sounds \\"Hegelian\\" as well. He also talks in terms of gnosis, esoteric knowledge and theosophy, presumably under the influence of some Hermetic current. Or is it just B&ouml;hme all over again? Finally, there is an existentialist streak in his philosophy.\\"The Meaning of History\\" is thus a highly eclectic work, and a causal reader like myself often feels that there are numerous contradictions as the various elements don't always fit neatly together. Perhaps this is inevitable, since the book is based on a series of lectures, presumably delivered in Berlin. What's conspicuous by its absence are references to the Church Fathers and the Bible. Clearly, Berdyaev was an innovative philosopher, or theologian if you like.Doing Berdyaev justice in a short review is impossible, so here only a few central themes can be pinpointed. To Berdyaev, human freedom is central, by which he seems to mean individual freedom from both ecclesiastical and governmental constrains. God created humans free, since he wants them to love him freely. Indeed, God somehow *needed* to create humanity, to satisfy a longing, an incompleteness within his own nature. Since humans are free, evil and failure are real possibilities. Human history is therefore a tragedy, a tragedy about humanity's attempt to find God, and God's attempt to find man, through a process that involves both evil and suffering.When Berdyaev describes this process, it sounds like thesis-antithesis-synthesis &aacute; la Hegel, and even the present period of secularization is seen as necessary to teach humanity some lessons. In contrast to Hegel, Berdyaev doesn't believe that history can be consummated within earthly limits. Ultimately, humanity will always fail in it's endavours. History is cyclical, rather than progressive. The solution is a solution in \\"time\\", since time is part of God's nature, but heavenly time is very different from our negative, fragmented time, where the future cannibalizes the present and the past. Although Berdyaev talks about the Apocalypse, it's unclear how he believes the heavenly solution should come about. A literal second coming of Christ? Individual immortality? Or is the whole thing some kind of metaphor? At one point, Berdyaev says that everyone who waits for Christ, really waits for the Anti-Christ, which seems to rule out a millennium. But does it also rule out an amillenarian second coming? No idea.Socialism is simply a secularized form of Jewish millennialism, and Berdyaev believes that socialism will never reach its stated goal, anymore than the French revolution did. He also criticizes industrialization and \\"the machine age\\". The high point of human endeavour seems to have been the \\"Christian humanist renaissance\\" of the 14th century (Giotto, Dante etc). However, Berdyaev also criticizes the Middle Ages for their authoritarian attempts to create the kingdom of God on Earth. His emphasis on freedom leaves him ambivalent towards the medieval period, just as his emphasis on Christianity leaves him ambivalent towards the High Renaissance, which he interprets as a large step towards secularization.\\"The Meaning of History\\" also discusses the role of the Greek and Jewish cultures, Hindu monism, Anthroposophy, evolution, the relationship between myth and fact, the meaning of the incarnation, and the difference between \\"culture\\" and \\"civilization\\". Indeed, it discusses pretty much everything...except Russia and the Orthodox Church, which are mentioned mostly in passing.Berdyaev is difficult to classify philosophically, but he seems to stand somewhere in-between traditional Christianity, emerging existentialism, and the German romantics."},{"Title":"The meaning of history","review":"Now with a new introduction by Professor of Russian Maria Nemcova Banerjee, The Meaning Of History is a philosophical treatise by intellectual Nikolai Berdyaev, witness to two world wars, who survived arrest for political suspicion first by Czarist and then by Bolshevik police, who died in exile in France in 1948 doggedly pursuing his studies and analysis to the end. Observing the philosophy of history as a field that formed the foundations of Russian national consciousness, Berdyaev discusses celestial and metaphysical as well as mundane history, the role of Judaism and Jews in Russian history (\\"Semitism has been grafted on to the Christian spirit and is indispensable to its destiny. The theme of dualistic messianism, which first appears in Jewish history, has become that of universal history\\"), the Renaissance and Humanism, and much more.

He wrote in the Foreword to this 1923 book, \\"Russian nineteenth-century thought was mainly preoccupied with problems of the philosophy of history which, indeed, laid the foundations of our national consciousness... the enigma of Russia and of her historical destiny was synonymous with that of the philosophy of history. Thus the elaboration of a philosophy of history would appear to be the specific mission of Russian philosophical thought, which has always had a predilection for the eschatological problem and apocalypticism.\\" (Pg. 11)He explains, \\"my book is concerned not with the problems of sociology but with those of the philosophy and the knowledge of historical destinies. The philosophy of history... is one of the ways to the knowledge of spiritual reality. It is a science of the spirit bringing us into communion with the mysteries of spiritual life.\\" (Pg. 25-26) He adds, \\"I believe that history and the 'historical' are not merely phenomena, that they are---and this is the most radical hypothesis of the philosophy of history---noumena... The 'historical' is by its nature not phenomenal but ontological... The 'historical' is a sort of revelation of the deepest essence of universal reality, of the destiny of the world focused in that of man. It is a revelation of noumenal reality.\\" (Pg. 27)He observes, \\"The tie between Christianity and history is such as exists in no other world religion. Christianity introduced historical dynamism and the extraordinary force of historical movement, and thus made possible a philosophy of history.\\" (Pg. 40) Later, he adds, \\"Christianity is the greatest of religions because it is in the first place the religion of the Resurrection; and because it reconciles itself to neither death nor oblivion, but strives toward the resurrection of all that is truly existent.\\" (Pg. 71)He says, \\"The philosophy of history attempts to define the historical process; it is a sort of reversed prophecy. It reveals no objective hypothesis; nor does it consist in the apprehension of historical facts. It is the prophetic exegesis of both the past and the future...\\" (Pg. 46) He suggests, \\"What is the main theme of universal history?

A consciousness of failure pervades its artistic, political, and economic life.\\" (Pg. 155)Berdyaev's book will be of great interest to students of the philosophy of history, particularly those interested in Christian interpretations."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"If you like knitting in the round or making small portable projects, this is an excellent book. I'm a beginning knitter - I have only been knitting 6 months and am completely self-taught - and I've made several hats from this book, adapting head bands from one, body patterns from another, and shapes from a third, in my own colors. While there may be nine basic shapes, the permutations are much greater than the 45 in the title.The charts are clear and helpful (I gather there are minor problems with some, but I haven't had any trouble deciphering them). Zilboorg gives clear directions for various types of beginnings and finishings. As a neophyte, I found them easy to follow.Each hat took a couple evenings and was quite enjoyable to do. The shapes and colors are uplifting and lots of fun to knit and to wear. I've been recommmending this book to people who have admired my knitting. And wearing one of these hats is a great way to brighten your day and keep you head warm at the same time."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"The hat ideas are wonderful. Too bad there are so many errors in the charts. I contacted Lark books for a copy of their errata (a correction sheet for the errors in this book). What I received was a very poor photocopy of the corrected charts. The corrected charts were so small, and the photocopy was so many generations from the original, that I could absolutely not read it. I counted twenty charts from the book that have corrections! I am an experienced knitter, but I have a hard time getting into a new knitting project, knowing that the charts are wrong. I contacted Lark books repeatedly to get a cleaner, more legible copy of the errata. So far, I have received nothing. I'm very disappointed. Further, the gauge she suggests is too small. More specific instructions with regards to yarns and needle sizes would have been very helpful."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"I have been knitting hats all summer to hone my skills, waiting for the day that Anna Zilboorg's new book was published. Any book that promises &quot;Berets, Toques, Cones, Stars, Pentagons and more...&quot; is my kind of book!After having read through the book several times, I started an Egyptian Hat and ran into the one thing that I found frustrating. The numbers don't always fit. In this particular case, the number of stitches to cast on and the first chart to knit do not match up. It turns out that this is not a particularly overwhelming problem. Zilboorg's approach is so simple and logical that I quickly figured out what was meant to happen and went on to produce a fairly respectible version of that hat pictured in her book. Any minor problems are more than made up for by the striking pictures of hats that seem to be inspired by Zilboorg's beloved Turkish socks with attitude supplied by Dr. Suess.Like her earlier work, Fancy Feet, this book emphasises the basics and avoids esoteric techniques. While some of these hats would seem to be a bit extreme for an average office worker, there is a sense of fun, style and color that draws you in. This book was well worth the price and will keep me busy working on Christmas presents for everyone on my list."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"These are indeed fine and fanciful hats, but I sure couldn't manage to knit one from the given \\"patterns\\" that came out anything like the pictures in the book. Perhaps most annoying to me was the complete lack of gauge indications, which the author dismisses in one paragraph in the \\"General Information\\" with a blithe \\"Fortunately, exact fit is not necessary in a knitted hat.\\" Ha! What few mentions she does give of gauge in the general instructions are inconsistent - in one paragraph, she says that most of the hats are made with worsted weight wool, yet a couple of paragraphs later, she says that for a particularly large head, a hat can be made of worsted weight instead of DK. And it's not as though \\"worsted weight\\" gives you enough indication anyway, as anyone who has tried to compare gauge on mass-market acrylic vs. Wool-Ease vs. expensive alpaca knows.As far as how much yarn to buy for each hat - well, Zilboorg tells us we'll need 2 yards of each color per 2-color round. So, I guess, we are supposed to count the exact number of rounds in the pattern ourselves, noting which colors are in which rounds, then multiply that by 2 yards per color, and then divide that into the number of yards for the brand of yarn we select. Zilboorg doesn't even tell us what brand, weight, or style she uses for her models, nor how many skeins she used for a given model. Would it have been such a bother for her to have put a paragraph with each one that said something like \\"For the model, I used Brand X Shetland, one skein each of the following seven colors...\\" ? That little bit of information alone would help most of us a great deal.In short: buy it for the pretty pictures, if you like, and if you collect fair isle charts, you may want to buy it for those, but don't expect any actual patterns with which to knit hats. A good book of patterns is like a conversation; this one is a monologue by an attractive but totally flaky stranger on a street corner."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"This book does not have 45 hats in it, it has 9 hats (berets, toques, cones, stars, Egyptian hats, onion domes, stacked hats, Angela hats - like toques with long rectangular straps hanging from the crown, and pentagons) interpreted in several different color designs each. Although the cost of this book was many times the price of a single pattern, I bought the book because I couldn't find a single onion dome pattern. Well, the &quot;patterns&quot; are really just color charts for the designs she used. Sample instructions for the onion dome hat (instructions are the same for all 5 onion dome hats): &quot;Cast on the number of stitches indicated on the chart using a 16&quot; circular needle....Work the desired band....Follow the chart for the bottom of the hat. Repeat the band. Work the top chart...when you finish the chart, change to the color you want for the ball [pompom or tassel]...then make the ball as instructed on page 11.&quot; This is not what I consider a knitting pattern and I'm sending it back to Amazon.com in Monday's mail."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"I kept my copy, because the hats are prettty to look at and someday I might try one (maybe not now that I've read about the errors here on Amazon) but I can understand why someone would be frustrated enough to return this. You don't buy a cookbook without recipes. The point of having patterns/recipes is so that you can replicate something you like. It is not a crime, really, no matter what people who read the Zimmerman books might say.Not everybody likes charts. I am sorry, but it's the truth. It would not kill these authors to write things out, at least ONCE and please do not whine that it would add to the cost of the book. It doesn't have to, and hey, we have computers now, it's not like you're scribing these books on parchment with a quill pen by candlelight.There, now that that's out of my system, I would still say to buy the book (though it is somewhat overpriced considering you get such little guidance and that there really are only 9 hats with variations), but it is NOT for beginners, and NOT for those who have better things to do than figure out badly written charts/instructions, even if they DO know how."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"I have knit several of the hats from this book and absolutely LOVE them!

Perhaps this will help the next person seeking to finish a beautiful hat."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"It seems stupid to me to argue if this book has 45 patterns or not. Maybe it shows only 45 hats in 9 basic shapes, but if you allow yourself to be inspired this book is an endless resource for hundreds of hats to knit.Apart from the berets, the cones, and the absolutely smashing toques the presented hats admittedly are quite unusual and may need some courage to wear, at least for adults, children usually are more adventurous. Most patterns can be easily be changed to something simpler, even to a plain stocking cap. You still will end up with a hat for which people will envy you.If you are not an experienced knitter or never have knitted anything without directions for every stitch from cast-on to cast-off, this book may not be the right choice for you as it indeed offers only the most basic directions. But if you are a fearless (even not very experienced) knitter and not opposed to learn from possible failure (don't use some cashmere/silk blend for your first cap) or if you just want to have a cheerful collection of charts for small stranded colorwork at hand (use them for socks or mittens too), this book is for you. If you are lucky you'll find it even at a reasonable price. I paid less than $30 for a used but very clean copy, international shipping already included."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"Well, this isn't a standard hat book. And not every hat will work for everyone (I found the Toque too small, the onion too big, but gauges vary.) The best hat in the book is the pentagonal hat, which seems to look good on everyone. The textural additions to the colorwork are really something. You can develop your own hats from these ideas, and use some of the texture ideas on things like mittens, too. I use the toque pattern,modified, with boucle yarn to make a Dr Zhivago-style hat, for example."},{"Title":"45 Fine & Fanciful Hats to Knit","review":"This is one of my very favorite knitting books! The colors and designs are gorgeous, the format is pleasing, and I just love to look at the pictures for color inspiration. I am a somewhat experienced knitter, I love knitting in the round (no seams to sew after the project is finished!) and I love to make colorful hats, which I sell at crafts fairs, so for me it's a perfect book. All the designs use worsted weight yarn and #7 or 8 needles, so the hats knit up fast.I agree however that it's not ideal for knitting beginners, although with hands-on help from a more experienced knitter it should be possible. I have come across some minor errors - another reason it's more appropriate for non-beginners.But otherwise I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fun, colorful, fast knitting projects. I make them for my friends, who love them.

However, if you are a novice knitter, you should have someone around to help you.Anna gives 3 different bands for you to start from. I loved the braided one, which can also be used on mittens and socks. The designs will keep you intrigued. Yes, some of the hats are a little far-fetched, but I promise that if you make them up, you'll get compliments.I have knit 3 hats from this book. One of them took me 4 days, but it is beautiful, warm, and so unique. Great for a snowy day.

Inevitably, being translated, they lose what was presumably their magic in Russian; and as the joy of Nabokov is language (what he does with it; how he expresses meaning through his manipulation of it, rather than ideas or narrative; how he is its most beautiful exponent of the century), one is left with a feeling of frustration adn dissatisfaction. There is little of the callous burlesque which invade his most delicate artifacts. 'The Aurelian' could almost have been written by Simenon. Others have the nostalgic melancholy of Turgenev. This is all very nice, but it's not Nabokov.And yet, it is. 'Cloud, Castle, Lake', for example, combines the familiar Nabokovian disjunction between elegance of style and content of the most horrific viciousness. There is a definite increase in pleasure when one gets to the English stories - the tone, created through language, in unmistakably Nab - narrators, resembling Nabokov in suavity, taste and intelligence, are actually feckless idiots, with their creator smiling behind them.There is, though, very little to smile about in these stories. Spanning (in composition)the period of Stalinism, Nazism, World War II and McCarthy era USA, they detail the complete derailment of the Enlightenment project in our century. Each time rationality, the power of the intellect or the artist is asserted, it is always denied by exile, totalitarianism, madness, deformity, conformity, self-destructive urges, unknowable terrors, but most importantly, by knowledge of the deception inherent in writing. Each story begins with an assertion, and the confident possibility of giving expression to the world, and ends with these values rigorously distorted, fragmented, smashed and broken by that world.And yet it is only through the mind that we can escape this evil, through nostalgia, recreation, possibility, artistry, transcendence. 'Lance' is an extraordinary, baffling, ambivalent parable highlighting this. Is its vision of the sublime delusive? Does this matter if we can fumble towards imagining it?Almost every character in these stories languishes in some kind of prison, trying to escape, seek epiphany in some way connected with the mind, whether it's a simple, sensual appreciation of beauty (a fluttering butterfly; a reflection of a cloud on a lake), or a quiet kindness to someone else, helping us escape our crushing solipsism. 'Signs and Symbols' is the key story, its deceptive simplicity masking untold anguish.I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the astonishment of watching Nabokov in full flight, but there is so much wealth in these stories, which require untold rereading - not just to extract meaning, but to savour again, and again, their remarkable beauty, their deadpan comedy, their impotent apprehension of terror and brutality (although there is a persistant failure in the portrayal of women) - to remind us why Nabokov is the century's greateat."},{"Title":"Collaborative Inquiry in Practice : Action, Reflection, and Making Meaning","review":"This book takes you through the research behind CI and the practical steps in getting started with your own group.

Great history leaps off the page, and a great writer can make even the dullest subject fascinating. This is not quite the case with Peter Flindell Klaren's solid history of Peru entitled, Peru: Society and Nationhood in the Andes. Klaren, a professor of history and International Affairs at the George Washington University, creates a comprehensive historical, sociological, and economic history of this oft-troubled South American nation, ranging from the pre-Inca natives to the confused politics of the Fujimora era.Though incredibly well researched and detailed, the book is not one designed for light reading. Klaren writes like an academic working on a thesis in the library: churning, expelling fact after fact without pause and not bringing the life behind the stories to the surface. His use of terms and concepts relating to specific eras of Peruvian history are often discussed in context but not explained until pages later, creating confusion. Klaren's intent with this work was to research how economics and sociological issues helped create the troubled history of Peru. By focusing on this aspect, however, he bogs down in the economic numbers, citing statistic after statistic until it all blurs together.In fairness, Klaren notes that it is not possible to completely and elegantly distill 10,000 years of history from a country the size of Spain, England, and France combined, especially one in which academic research has been sorely lacking. Klaren does provide extremely helpful statistical tables and comprehensive source references at the end of the book, and it is quite clear the massive amount of research that went into the writing of this book. Also notable is his focus on the impact of the diversity of the Peruvian populace and how ethnic history shaped the political and social history of the country.If you are a student or someone with an interest in how economies and socio-politics creates history and can affect the development of small nations, then this is a very good book for you. This is also a wonderful reference source for those looking to write or explore in detail Peru's history. If you are looking for a light, fast moving history, you might be better suited elesewhere in the book aisle.A.G.

El prestigio de su autor -Peter F. Klar&eacute;n de la Universidad George Washington- y del sello editorial que la auspicia -Oxford University Press- son razones suficientes para prever la influencia que Peru: Society and Nationhood in the Andes habr&aacute; de tener en los medios peruanistas norteamericanos.Establecer un eje interpretativo con validez en el largo plazo es el mayor reto en un proyecto de esta naturaleza. Ni las &eacute;picas incaica o pizarrista ni menos a&uacute;n la lucha por la independencia funcionan m&aacute;s, advierte el autor, como los eventos fundacionales de una historia nacional. En la supervivencia misma de sus pobladores, en su voluntad e ingenio para levantarse de sucesivas devastaciones -de origen tanto humano como natural-, encuentra el profesor Klar&eacute;n la clave de la larga duraci&oacute;n peruana; una historia, seg&uacute;n &eacute;l, tan rica como dolorosa.Varios siglos de supervivencia comunitaria hicieron del Tawantinsuyo el m&aacute;s efectivo proyecto estatal en la historia de los Andes. Verdadero triunfo sobre la fragmentaci&oacute;n que de la geograf&iacute;a misma pareciera emanar. Su derrumbe, y la cat&aacute;strofe demogr&aacute;fica que prosigui&oacute; supondr&iacute;a para las sociedades andinas una perecedera desestructuraci&oacute;n.Con todo su poder&iacute;o, no obstante, el orden colonial no logra imponer por completo los criterios de casta y segregaci&oacute;n originalmente previstos. A ello, los futuros peruanos ofrecieron una terca resistencia, demostrando asimismo una distintiva capacidad para maximizar las oportunidades que las fisuras del poder colonial ofrec&iacute;an. A lo largo del XVIII, la supervivencia deviene rebeld&iacute;a.Frente a la conciencia criolla forjada en la capital virreinal surge, en la sierra sur, una visi&oacute;n alternativa: recuperar la memoria incaica en la perspectiva de un programa nacional. Como naci&oacute;n, el Per&uacute; terminar&aacute; construy&eacute;ndose a contramano de la historia representada por los rebeldes de 1780: lo criollo como negaci&oacute;n de lo andino.Tomando la iniciativa nuevamente, entre fines del XIX e inicios del XX, emprende la poblaci&oacute;n andina un nuevo ciclo de confrontaci&oacute;n: comunidades contra haciendas una vez m&aacute;s. En lo que queda del siglo la cuesti&oacute;n de la marginalidad ind&iacute;gena aparece como el gran tel&oacute;n de fondo de una historia cuyos cronistas oficiales insistieron en reducir a los avatares estatales y capitalinos: la historia de Lima como sustituto de la historia del Per&uacute;.Una verdadera revoluci&oacute;n historiogr&aacute;fica, en curso desde los a&ntilde;os 70, es lo que permite, subraya Klar&eacute;n, esta dr&aacute;stica ampliaci&oacute;n del marco hist&oacute;rico peruano. Una revoluci&oacute;n basada en los aportes convergentes de investigadores peruanos (Pease, Burga, Flores Galindo, Manrique, Bonilla, entre otros) y extranjeros (Stern, Spalding, Jacobsen, Gootemberg), cuya obra individual hace posible la s&iacute;ntesis interpretativa ahora intentada por Klar&eacute;n.Pero es la historia misma de las &uacute;ltimas d&eacute;cadas la que convalida el esquema interpretativo elegido por Klaren: la emergencia de una sociedad de masas que, del desborde popular (Matos Mar) al otro sendero (De Soto), y de la insurrecci&oacute;n senderista a la contra-isurrecci&oacute;n rondera, decretar&iacute;a la crisis final del pa&iacute;s imaginado por los criollos de inicios del XIX.La evoluci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica contempor&aacute;nea, desde esta perspectiva, aparece como una sucesi&oacute;n de intentos por revertir la desestructuraci&oacute;n y erigir andamiajes institucionales duraderos sobre las arenas movedizas de una historia irresuelta.Si hay una lecci&oacute;n importante a extraer de una historia construida as&iacute; es aquella relativa a las hondas ra&iacute;ces de nuestra fragmentaci&oacute;n, sustrato &uacute;ltimo de nuestra inveterada inestabilidad. Dictamen de la geograf&iacute;a y de la historia, que explica, en buena medida, nuestra tradici&oacute;n de caudillos, refundaciones sucesivas y precarios experimentos democr&aacute;ticos. Ni el pa&iacute;s enfermo o embrujado que se ha querido ver, tampoco el pa&iacute;s con futuro brillante per se. Una lecci&oacute;n de humildad m&aacute;s bien es la que esta lectura sugiere, la apreciaci&oacute;n de un derrotero que lejos de culminar en el pante&oacute;n de los h&eacute;roes encuentra en una milenaria vocaci&oacute;n de supervivencia su clave &uacute;ltima y su promesa. Un pa&iacute;s de sobrevivientes, en suma, a&uacute;n a la espera de una genuina reconciliaci&oacute;n."},{"Title":"Entre Nous","review":"After taking an intense and exceptionally stimulating course in Current Continental Philosophy at Texas A&M; University (under Professor Steve Daniel, who has a published book that goes along with this pioneering undergraduate course), I bought this book to delve more into the highly intriguing thought of the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas -- one of the most important thinkers of the day and of all time for that matter, who is usually associated with the twentieth century enterprise of Deconstruction, as of that of Jacques Derrida who is vocal in his indebtedness to the \\"masterful\\" thought of Levinas. I would very much recommend this book, but only if you have an appropriate background in philosophical context, as to accommodate to the text's highly difficult and complex prose and content.As the back cover of the book indicates, I did find this book to actually be an unexpectedly helpful and engaging guide (in spite of its difficulty) to serve as a proficient introduction to the prolific thought of this outstanding author. The essays contained in the book span over a spectrum of about forty years; so the reader is able to glimpse the progression and difference from Levinas's earlier work to his later essays, of which the book is for the better mainly comprised.For me, these essays are paradigmatic of very technical and complex philosophy mixed with soaring religious insights into the inter-human (and ultimately highly ethical) condition. In Entre-Nous, the reader meets in a face-to-face way why Levinas's work is so vital -- in which ontology is unravelled into ethics, as philosophy is ultimately undone into what is truly religious."},{"Title":"Entre Nous","review":"I don't like to speak ill of persons who have passed on, especially since the picture on the cover makes it appear that the author was a kindly individual, but this book was very disappointing. The author apparently intends to provide insights into the dynamics of human consciousness and relationships, but his writing is so convoluted that I have great difficultly understanding any of the points he is trying to make. His writing is possibly the most obscure I have ever encountered, and I have 3 post graduate degrees. My view is that he didn't put enough effort into expressing himself clearly. Perhaps he felt that the subject matter was so hard to understand that folks reading his books would expect to have difficulty. However, the more difficult the subject matter, the more it is incumbent upon a writer to put effort into expressing his thoughts clearly and succinctly."},{"Title":"The Tao of Motivation: Inspire Yourself and Others","review":"\\"You have the key to motivate yourself and others\\" the opening of 'The Tao of Motivation' by Max Landsberg. The book is one of three in a series about leadership and management. The others are The Tao of Coaching and The Tools of Leadership.The book is presented as a guide and uses the story of Alex and his struggle to become a board member to illustrate the theory behind motivation. (Alex is also the name of the manager in The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, coincidence?)The book follows the learning process of Alex, the theory builds on previous chapters and the VICTORY-circle (Vision, Impetus, Confidence, Taking the Plunge, Outcomes, Responding to feedback, and of course 'You'). As in all things when working with people, just telling isn't enough: Show, don't tell. In order to be able to motivate others you must first learn how motivation works and how to motivate yourself. A number of subjects around motivation (psychology, NLP, Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator, body-language etc.) are briefly mentioned in the book. A reference list encourages you to further exploring.I must say the book had an influence on me because I learned some new things about motivation. Because you want to read the life story of Alex you easily pick up the theory in between (don't skip it!). These kind of business novels are a nice way of learning new things."},{"Title":"The Tao of Motivation: Inspire Yourself and Others","review":"One of three short books by Landsberg on key skills for leaders and managers. The others are The Tao of Coaching and The Tools of Leadership. All three are notable for their directness and brevity and all provide an extremely useful guide to important skills. Each is written around a brief story about 'Alex', on his journey from manager to CEO, with each episode designed to illustrate some aspect of the coaching/motivation/leadership challenge. Each episode is followed by a two page summary of the particular skill needed to meet the challenge. Each book has a useful bibliography to guide the reader to more detail where desired and a suite of Appendices covering further details on key aspects of skill.There is naturally some overlap between the books, but each is valuable in its own right and the set combine to provide a thoughtful, practical and readily referenced guide to the key elements in the human side of management and leadership.The Tao of Motivation is structured around the memnonic VICTORY, standing for Vision, Impetus, Confidence, Taking the Plunge, Outcomes, responding to feedback, and the particular 'You' with whom motivation is concerned. It also introduces aspects of basic psychology and tools such as MBTI and NLP in summary form ,"},{"Title":"The Tao of Motivation: Inspire Yourself and Others","review":"Personally I did find this one book on motivation to be less powerful as his other two books.Although his other two books cover various models, this book focuses on only one model which he calls the VICTORY cycle (Vision, Impetus, Confidence, Taking the plunge, Observing outcomes, Responding to feedback, 'You'), explaining each phase step by step.The book and model is pretty much OK. Still on motivational leadership (or self motivation) there are other works out there. It should not stop you though to read this book together with \\"The Tools of Leadership\\" and \\"The Tao of Coaching\\", especially as the 3 books together give a nice introduction on leadership, coaching and motivation."},{"Title":"The Tao of Motivation: Inspire Yourself and Others","review":"The delibery service was OK considering that is an international delibery, the boock condition just fine, good deal."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"This books stinks.

All examples use Northwind.mdb. The first part introduces Visual Studio .NET environment using many practical MS Access examples I've used in my application systems. The 2nd part deals primarily with VB.NET capabilities. The 3rd part introduces you to ADO.NET using MS Access with many practical examples like add, change, delete, master/detail. The remaining chapters talk about ASP.NET and XML with MS Access. I've read VB.NET books and taken VB.NET course but don't have the confidence converting my applications. With this book, I'm all set to go. A must have for all MS Access developers ready to move to the .NET world."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"The target audience for the book is, quite simply, Access developers who are accustomed to VBA and/or VB 6.This book serves a good purpose, as the .NET materials I have seen to date all refer to SQL Server in their examples; they acknowledge Access, but fail to show its uses. I am not crazy about seeing &quot;old&quot; technology such as ADO used in some of the examples, but for a book of this nature (transitioning between coding languages) I guess that is inevitable that some old/new information would be included at various points.Do not purchase the book if you're intending to use the built-in VBA capabilities of Access or other Office applications -- that's strictly not covered. What you will find, though, is a good sense of how VB.NET operates on its own, and how to create applications that draw upon the data stored in your Access databases.This should be a good base point for someone who's developed in Access, and wants to investigate moving forward; it should be a means to an end, rather than the destination itself. Additional reading on ADO.NET and classes will be helpful, I believe, to continue fleshing out knowledge to be truly effective in your work, but this book does a good job of introducting those concepts."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"Rick Dobson is usually so darn thorough! He takes nothing for granted. And this book is no exception. As a long-time Microsoft Access developer, what I want to learn is not everything about .NET, but about .NET with Access. This book must have been written just for me. Of course, after I have .NET working well with Access, then I would have a head start moving on to .NET with SQL Server and etc. This book covers Windows Forms and Web Forms in .NET. It covers XML. It covers coding techniques. It covers security. What a great head start I now have on .NET!

This book isn't muchdifferent except that I see a shocking amount of emphasis on the \\"old\\" ADO method of data access. In fact, if I read this correctly,there is more written on ADO/ADOX than there is about ADO.NET.This is about the 10th book on .NET that I've purchased and every one so far (especially those from MS Press) spend 2-6 chapters talkingabout .NET, what it is and why is is so bloody terrific. Book authors, PLEASE, lets stop introducing and re-introducing the same stuffin EVERY .NET book! Write a \\"Beginning .NET\\" for all that stuff and save your readers some time!Overall my opinion is that this book is mediocre. What this book is is a general .NET book with anemphasis on database programming (albeit with the \\"old\\" ADO stuff).In short, I'm glad I bought it used for only $10."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"As I read the review that compained about the heavy use of ADO rather than ADO.net in the first part of the book, it seemed to me that the reviewer missed what Dobson was trying to do. This book really teaches two subjects--VS.Net and ADO.Net as it applies to Access. I appreciated that he used the old familiar ADO while discussing the new, unfamiliar VS.Net, and then, when the reader should be comfortable with the first topic, began to teach the second. I think he did a good job of laying the groudwork for using Visual Studio.net before then introducing the complex topic of switching to ADO.net. I would recommend this book for anyone transitioning from VB or VBA to .net using Access databases."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"I have been working in this profession for 30 years and have migrated from COBOL to VB-3, to VB-6, and now to VB.Net. The title of this book is \\"Programming Microsoft Visual Basic.Net for Microsoft Access Databases.\\"When I started reading the book it began with very basic VB for the first 128 pages. Then once you do get into the VB sections of the book, there is a lot of repetition and not all of MS Access/VB programming is covered. Everything is done using embedded SQL commands. No raw access to MS Access.

Any intermediate or higher level programmer will find that this book will tell you once more about how to use Windows controls, program loops, etc. that he/she should already know very well by now. Also, the simple code samples are easy enough to read that they should NOT need to be described in great detail. What's worse, ADO (not ADO.Net) is used extensively so once more this is information I already know. There is no reason to limit yourself to the old ADO whether you are using Access databases or SQL Server databases. It's like driving a brand new car but leaving it in first gear.I think programmers who are just past the beginner level but well before intermediate level will find this book worthwhile because it does go in quite a lot of detail, detail that would be too much for a beginner but old hat for more experienced VB/VBA programmers."},{"Title":"Programming Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; .NET for Microsoft Access Databases (Pro Developer)","review":"The writing style of the author too poor.

I think that there are several things that set this book apart. First, it is very thorough. Each of its 400 plus pages is filled with fact and information. Additionally, it covers some topics in more depth than similar books. For example, this book contains a lot of information about early Hispanic settlers, their history and impact on the state. Other texts seem to focus more on the history of European settlers who came to the state. It also seems that the author spent a lot of time researching this book from original records and documents. He is not just restating information found in other history books. If I had to come up with a negative for this book it's that the writing style leans toward being \\"academic.\\" If you're looking for a \\"fun\\" book on Arizona, full of colorful stories or humorous anecdotes, then this is not the book for you. However, if you really want to learn about the state's history then this book should be part of your collection."},{"Title":"Arizona: A History","review":"I've lived in Arizona most of my life, and had a good general background understanding of information on earlier times in Arizona. This book really helped to fill in a lot of blanks, and explained things in a very sensible, well-thought-out manner. Starting in pre-historic times, leading into the early Native American migrations and settlements in the Southwest, on to Spanish exploration and colonial days, followed by Mexican and then American ownership of this territory - all of this is well laid out, and well researched and explained.I would highly recommend this book for any resident of Arizona, anyone interested in early history, and especially for anyone with interest in how we ended up where we are today."},{"Title":"Arizona: A History","review":"Sheridan makes the history (which I've always found to be boring)of Arizona interesting. His wit in writing keeps my attention. He talks of the people of Arizona like he knew them personally and makes me want to meet them. He gives a thorough review of time from Arizona's earliest known history of the Hohokom peoples, early industries, issues involed with statehood to more recent history including the establishment of national parks and tourism. Sheridan explains how Arizona's politics have been shaped by large industries mainly mining. This in an excellent and enlightening read even if you aren't much interested in history."},{"Title":"Arizona: A History","review":"Dr. Sheridan researched his book and provides an essay form bibliography for his references. He notes which references are the best or most complete. He also comments on missing or incomplete data such as the history of copper mining, one of the most important extractive industries in Arizona. When confronting difficult topics, such as racism, or the obvious cases of collusion or massive cooperation between big business and big government, he examines multiple factors and presents information that allows the reader to form his or her own opinion. In the few instances in which he injects his own opinion, he makes it very clear that it is his perspective but does not require the reader to complicitly follow his beliefs. For example, he espouses the Other Arizona viewpoint; one in which small business, rural ranching, and the beauty of the natural desert are what is most important. He does not diminish his treatment of the benefits of city life, but he tempers it with the knowledge that water is not infinite. To feed the cities, the rural areas must sacrifice their water supplies. By the time I reached the end of the final chapter (the book was published in 1995), I wanted more information about the most recent happenings in Arizona. How has the Central Arizona Project (CAP) affected the Indians? Will it provide enough water to sustain Phoenix and Tucson. Have any drought seasons caused problems in which the quota of mandated water to California negatively affected the other users of CAP?"},{"Title":"Arizona: A History","review":"This is the best single-volume history of Arizona on the market. I use it as the text for my Arizona History Class at Eastern Arizona College and other community college instructors in Arizona also use it. Some have objected to it because it is inclusive and exposes both the best and worst in Arizona history. Sheridan has a widely accepted mega-view of Arizona history and a unique perspective of dividing Arizona history into three processes, incorporation, extraction, and transformation. He calls his theoretical approach \\"political ecology.\\" When Arizona history is examined within this paradigm new insights and a deeper understanding of both his perspective and the relationships among pivotal historic events occurs. I recommend it as a text and as a means of understanding, appreciating, and contextualizing Arizona history."},{"Title":"Arizona: A History","review":"We moved to Arizona recently, and I was curious about the history of the State.

There is a primary grounding in Zen and Daoist practice via standing Zen centering with a focus on Ki collection and projection. The self-defense strategy looks to be strong Hsing-I forward pressure, via a modest variety of Tai Chi tactics and methods, versus opposition. This Art has been tested [and modified] versus various other Arts, such as by Karate, Kenpo and Judo followers in full-contact challenge matches versus Taiki-ken followers -- as well as internal sparring of the Art-followers. So, Taiki-Ken seems to look quite realistic and streamlined as compared to some complex Internal Arts [as presented in public].

Deceptively simple, once programed into the muscle/nerve memory and combined with the still Zen mind and Chi it becomes an awesome martial art that tranforms into the indivdual who is practicing it. If ten people practice Taikiken, you will have ten different expressions of the art, on purpose.

It tells the story of a group of men in a mental institution which is ruled by a sadistic nurse who manipulates the men's emotions at every turn. When a young man with a hard drinking, hard living history is committed to the unit (he doesn't seem to actually have a mental illness, just has a hard time with \\"behaving\\") he sees her for what she is and a battle of wills occurs between the two of them. He becomes the hero of the ward and the power dynamic begins to change.The story is narrated by another patient, a Native American who never speaks and who the rest of the patients and staff thinks is deaf. The Chief, nevertheless, hears everything around him and is very aware of the ramifications of his confinement.The ending is a tragic one, an ending that the reader will despise, but it is effective.The scariest part of this book is that I can easily see a nurse like Ratchet working in a hospital today. In fact, I have been involved in the mental health field for years as a volunteer and peer counselor and I have met at least one or two mental health professionals who were like her- drawn to the field for the power over others it brings, and ready and able to abuse that power.This is a classic novel that is emotionally difficult to read but I still strongly recommend it to any reader."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book. I can say that without qualification. It is one of the few books that I wished was longer, just so I could keep reading.If you've seen the movie, that's all the more reason to read the book. The movie adaptation is to this book as a movie trailer is to a movie.The book takes place in a mental ward, with a wide variety of mental infirmities represented. These inmates are controlled fairly easily by the hospital employees until McMurphy arrives. McMurphy is one of those who feigns insanity to avoid prison time, and so is not nearly as docile as his counterparts.None of this is new to those who have seen the movie, but the book tells this story from the eyes of Chief. Early in the book Chief is silent and uncommunicative. The way he explains what transpires shows the extent to which he is out of touch with reality. He talks about time standing still, fog that overtakes the ward and about wires going from the hospital into the back of the heads of the nurses, etc. These are all signs of psychosis, but they also give insight into the dynamics of the ward.As Chief regains himself, partly through his relation with McMurphy, his descriptions of the ward slowly become more realistic.It's really a fascinating and beautiful.

At first when I read the title of the book, I immediately prejudged that this book would be about insanity and the people inside. While that is just a small part of the book, it becomes an insignificant fact that you forget as you read the novel further. This novel is a fun read that just gets better as you move forward and explores more than the insane. It also explores who they are there, why they are there, and how society perceives them. It is also about freedom, and Randle P. McMurphy is just the person to show the inmates what freedom is about. Misadventure after misadventure, the fun never really stops for this dysfunctional group once McMurphy joins their ranks. Overall, I enjoyed this novel because of it's humor, suspense at every misadventure, and sense of liberation. Most of all, this book turned out to be better than what I anticipated.

Many of us think that insane people should be put in meantal wards as it would help them, but does it really help them?

It is very interesting and it manages to keep the reader hooked. It has all the elements of drama, suspense, and comedy. It makes the reader laugh at times and it makes the reader sad. The book delivers some memorable lines. It's question is &quot;Who is really insane?&quot; The novel looks at human nature and shows the psychology of certain people. In McMurphy, We see a good man, A basic symbol of American entertainment. Someone who believes in having a good time. In Nurse Ratched, We see everything we don't want to be. She is a symbol of the negativity of human society. Someone who enjoys life by making others suffer. The book looks at human society and it really makes you think who is really bad"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"STORY BRIEF:McMurphy was at a work farm prison. He arranged to have himself transferred to the asylum - supposedly because it was easier and had better food than the work farm. Miss Ratched is the nurse who runs the ward. She is powerful like a dictator. She represents the System. She demands conformity and submission from her patients and will use evil and fear if she doesn't get it. The men on her ward are cowed by her - like rabbits. McMurphy is a loud, laughing (sort-of-con-man) who organizes card games and other activities for the men. She wants McMuprhy to conform but he refuses - even when he knows he will suffer at her hand. She has power over McMurphy because she determines when he may be released and what treatments she will give. She can order electric shock treatment and lobotomies if she wants.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is tragedy - there is no happy ending. It is not an entertaining escape. This was assigned reading for my teenage son, and I read it out of curiosity. I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore and forced to read things like this. Unfortunately I regret my curiosity. It was no fun, but I can see value for classroom discussion with topics such as: the all-powerful system - you can't win but you can effect changes for others - although you may suffer or die as a result. All choices represent loss.During the first half of the book my reaction was dreary. The second half was better. There were some interesting characters. There were some interesting events.One interesting scene had a patient observing \\"Never before did I realize that mental illness could have the aspect of power.\\" Gas station workers were making fun of the patients until McMurphy told them (a lie) that these patients were murderers which frightened the gas station workers. The patients then began \\"hard staring\\" at other people in nearby cars which frightened the other people.One line that stayed in my mind (I don't know why) was on page 67. McMurphy says \\"As near as I can tell I'm no loony. Your nurse don't know this; she's not going to be looking out for somebody coming at her with a trigger-quick mind like I obviously got.\\"I wanted to know more about McMurphy's background, why he got arrested, and why he went to the asylum.CAUTION SEMI-SPOILER:For me I couldn't get past the tragic ending. Yes a few good things happen to a few people, but too much bad happens which depressed me. The evil power continues to thrive. There was no justice. Sure the evil one suffered a couple of minor wounds, but evil wins in the end which depresses me.DATA:Story length: 279 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual language: moderate. Two sex scenes were referred to but not shown. Setting: around 1960 Oregon. Copyright: 1962. Genre: mental hospital tragedy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Even though One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a metal institute, it is more an allegory about goodness overcoming oppression and tyranny than it is a story about mental illness.The book contains an interesting assortment of characters:The most noticeable character is Randle McMurphy: a fun loving, gambling, free spirit who went to the asylum to avoid finishing out a sentence at a hard labor camp. He arrived and injected life into a place that had been devoid of it for long. The patients had become complacent by the routine, strict rules, and the ever-present threat of shock treatment or lobotomies if they stepped out of line. The drugs they were constantly administered clouded their consciousness and numbed them emotionally. Bromden called it the fog, and McMurphy was constantly trying to lift them out of the fog.The narrator of the story is Chief Bromden: a seemingly mute half-Indian whose has a case of extreme anxiety. His dad, once a mighty chief, was reduced to a miserable alcoholic once the government took his tribes' land and homes. Gradually, McMurphy teaches him to have courage and believe in himself. Bromdon has an extravagant imagination and describes many of the events that occur with very colorful and creative metaphors. This adds to the richness and enjoyment of the book.The villain in this book, Nurse Ratched (Big nurse), is very controlling and manipulative. A warm and caring faade is always displayed to the patients, but in reality she only wants absolute control of everybody and everything in the asylum. She has carefully selected her staff for that purpose. She constantly has a caring smile on her face, but do not be fooled. Everything she cunningly does or says is to secure control.Throughout the novel, big nurse and McMurphy constantly butt heads. The patients, led by McMurphy, gradually become more defiant, which results in a shocking climax at the end. This novel was an absolute joy to read. I could relate to the fears and insecurities many of the patients struggled with. Most of the acute patients were not crazy just sort of stuck, unable to overcome certain difficulties and were comforted by the security the asylum provided them. A life lesson to take away from this novel is that even though society, government, political pundits etc. say they are doing things for your own benefit, they may actually doing them for more selfish and insidious reasons. Another important message to take away from this novel is that no matter what pain and problems life has thrown your way, have courage to fight on. Oh and don't forget to have fun along the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'm enjoying the novel, but have noticed quite a few typos, missing periods, etc. I don't know if it was just transferred to the electronic version sloppily, or if the print edition had the same errors."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a wonderful read. It tells the story of a sane man committed to an insane asylum and its consequences. If nothing else, it certainly serves to question what is actually meant by insanity. Indeed, at times, the borderline between sanity and insanity is very grey.Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle McMurphy, a small time criminal who has determined that an institution for the insane is a better place than a prison and hard labour. However, his appearance at the asylum serves as the beginning of a series of events whereby the system is stressed but, in the end, grinds down the likes of McMurphy. No matter how hard he tries, McMurphy cannot beat the system. Ultimately, it is the system that wins.Ken Kesey has written a roller coaster of a story. A ride of ups and downs that is really quite compelling. It is told by Chief Bromden, a half caste American Indian who feigns being deaf and dumb but is, nonetheless, a keen observer of events. But Bromden is not deaf and dumb. It is simply that people believe this to be the case. McMurphy is the only person who realizes his secret.Rather than outline the plot here in greater detail, I recommend this book to all readers of modern literature. Yes, the system wins but, along the way, it is vigorously challenged. It is people like McMurphy who are the essence of a free society. They are prepared to sing out if the emperor has no clothes."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book, one of my all time favorites. However, it is a little bothersome that when I look for it my Kindle its filed under Chuck Palahniuk, who is a fine author, but who also had NOTHING to do with this writing of this book.Seriously, what the heck, you should fix that Amazon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey creates a world that should be surprisingly dissimilar to our own, but is not. The setting is located almost completely in a mental hospital. The world that is described might as well be the mirror image of our own society. His style and his relationship with the characters that he picks apart for us is astonishing.Kesey is an amazing writer who digs deep into the character of \\"Chief\\" Bromden. He hints lightly at the experiments of the past and of the future that were performed and would be performed on patients in mental facilities around the world. One of the most common hints is to frontal lobotomies which becomes significant much later in the story. The horrid concept of a lobotomy is also accompanied by general authorial gestures to disorders. Some are obvious like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder while others can only be guessed at. The world outside the mental hospital, which tends not to be much different form the inside, is populated by nature but also a definitive presence of repetition, stagnation, annexation of creativity, and replicas. This theme is represented in the system that the mental hospital is run as.Our narrator, \\"Chief\\" Bromden pretends to be deaf and dumb so that he can secretly acquire information during his stay, which is inexplicably long, on the ward. Unfortunately, what he does with that information is nothing. Even when McMurphy arrives and he begins to drag Bromden out of his shell he continues to stay quiet about the intel he gathers. He is quiet, sensitive to his surroundings when he's not hallucinating, yet unreliable because he cannot, at first, tell what is reality and what isn't. Frankly, I believe that this is never actually resolved since reality is a perspective, like an opinion, that not everybody shares the same truths to. At first he hallucinates repeatedly to escape from the problems of this world, the ward, and says at one point \\"You were safe from the enemy, but you were awfully alone.\\" McMurphy, however, would change that.Before getting into that, however, the system should be reviewed. The system should be run by the doctor but is instead run by the Big Nurse. Three \\"black boy's\\" are like her henchmen in the process. The boy's work like a tripod and can rarely function without the help of the other two. They are sinister but it's made clear that they should not be. The system outside of the mental hospital and the system inside run by Nurse Ratched created them.Nurse Ratched is and should be hated by the reader. There is this love/fear/hate of Nurse Ratched when it comes to the perspective of the incarcerated psychotics on the ward. However, she is, in total, to be hated. She has a false smile slapped on her face constantly, embodies machinery and ice imagery, and encourages betrayal and absolute order on her ward. She digs into the minds of the weak like a needle and wiggles around in there until the world complies to her. However, Bromden and many of the other men on the ward soon realize that she should be pitied. It's a fleeting thought, but she should. She, like the black boys and the actual \\"psychotics\\", is a product of society. A product of the system. One of her main problems is that she tries to hide and subvert her feminism to get by in a masculine world and to hold all the power. She knows no other way of existing and that, in of itself, is sad. In a more obscure fashion, McMurphy attempts to not only help the men on the ward but also Nurse Ratched. She just fails to listen.All this talk about a McMurphy character! He is our cure. He is what we secretly wish to be but can never have the courage or the strength to become. He looks at a system and laughs at it. He can show you who you are and never be wrong about it. He sees past the fogs of life to the point of the matter and drags it to the surface kicking and screaming because true reality is the ability to look at yourself and accept. He, unlike the system, is constantly moving and sociable. He does not stay stagnant and has this zest and rambunctious attitude that makes us wish we were kids again. His smile counteracts and ridicules Nurse Ratched's while reaffirming his stance on life.Kesey does not speak of nature much in this novel. Nature is only painted during a few scenes and it is normally beautiful. McMurphy is the representation of nature throughout all other scenes. He is, literally, a force of nature. He is chaotic, unpredictable, often calm, sometimes storming, and he makes SENSE. In an insane world he is the pivotal point in which truth can be found. Because of this he turns into the father figure on the ward. It would not be a stretch to say he is Jesus-like. The boat scene is where he has 12 members following him, like 12 disciples, and he smiles and laughs watching them come into their own skin and realize their own potential. The men begin to depend on him and only at the last is their self-dependence being seen in the other characters. In truth, he helps them to stand on their own so that his bigness, as Bromden would put it, could be transferred to the others. Then they can make it their own and become who they need to be.The novel is replete with descriptions worth rereading ten times over and a sense of awe and degradation and hope that is rarely combined in such an eloquent fashion. It follows a trend like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and moves at about the same pace. Dystopia moves to Utopia but not without its losses and pain."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Few books have the iconoclastic make up of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" Most of the book was written while he was under influence of LSD which he took with government authorization -- how weird. The story is told through the eyes of a silent Indian who fools the staff into thinking he is deaf and dumb. R.P. McMurphy is put into the asylum after committing criminal acts to be evaluated. What Kesey creates with the asylum is a huge metaphor that works on several levels at once. The narration is solid and moves the story with ease. With a 1960's type of metaphor McMurphy questions authority and fights it with humor. The other 60's metaphor is the head nurse who unreasonable and by the book. She is inflexible and represents the forces that be. The two clash and all those about the asylum are subjected to the good/evil, hippies/establishment forces. The evil force eventually smashes McMurphy, but he is set free. The real metaphor is in the ending. Definitely one of the classics from one of the classic icons of the 60's. It will sit well in any library."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There's some futility in reviewing a classic, canonical, and authoritative work of art. Society has already decided that the novel bears merit, and who are we to write, many years later, anything to the contrary? And if a review is positive, isn't it expected? These concerns are included as the subjects of this book--established and licensed authority and attempts at coup, what are or are not taboo behavior and ideas, all of which eventually leads us to make judgments and draw a line between sane and insane, prudence and folly--and these ideas are part of what makes the novel enduring.The structure of the novel is likewise unique. The first-person, past-tense narrator (Chief Bromden) is in a mental institution pretending to be deaf and dumb. How reliable can we consider this narrator to be, especially when another character (Randle Patrick McMurphy) seems to be the protagonist? It's McMurphy's actions--and the ward nurse's reactions--that truly guide the plot of the book. What can we know of the truth secondhand from such a cagey narrator?Some of the novel's criticism of chronic healthcare is still relative today. I work in a nursing home and rehabilitation center, and I have seen firsthand how difficult it is to care for people with mental and behavior disorders and diseases. Sometimes the decisions we make are not between sane and insane, but between safety and danger, dignity and indignity.The book pokes serious holes in early psychology and psychiatry, especially the brutal history of the latter. But more fundamentally, the book asks us to consider how well one can truly know another person. I cannot recommend the book more."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are books. Then there are books that get into your skull and stay there, their characters and events gnawing away at your understanding and valuation of life like ideological termites. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is one of the latter.I first read Ken Kesey's 1962 masterpiece in high school, where it reduced me to emotional rubble on more than one occasion, somewhat like \\"Cool Hand Luke,\\" which I also first saw in high school. The book has its flaws, I suppose, if a preponderance of archetypal names and images combined with a tendency to let metaphor tread too closely to allegory are flaws (which, for reasons not entirely known to me, I'm more willing to forgive here than in, say, the works of C. S. Lewis). Some would consider its raw images and descriptions a flaw, though having worked myself in a state hospital as a teenage volunteer orderly I can't imagine a more sanitized story ringing true. And any cinephile would have trouble disentangling Jack Nicholson's incarnation of Randle McMurphy in the Milos Foreman film from any of the imagined portraits of Kesey's protagonist produced by reading the book--regardless of which happens first (even now, I can't re-read the final pages of the novel without my head involuntarily playing the Jack Nitzsche score from the final moments of the film, as Chief Bromden smothers his lobotomized hero, then breaks free of the asylum and escapes into the mist).(Spoilers follow) The plot is deceptively simple: a clever, but endearing nonconformist manages to avoid a hard labor sentence by feigning insanity, but consequently finds himself subject to the Orwellian forces of an asylum and its tyrannical and sadistic staff. Locked in an unwinnable war with the machinery of institutional society, reproduced in microcosmic intensity by the controlling Nurse Ratched and a host of sympathetic inmates, McMurphy manages to escape only as does the protagonist of Terry Gillam's \\"Brazil\\"--through protracted resistance that is ultimately as self-destructive as it is self-affirming.The parallels to contemporary society--especially the paranoia-producing social ills and remedies characteristic of cold war America--are as biting as they are banal. The real force of this novel derives from Kesey's keen observation of human character and its tragic response to institutionalized power, both power possessed and power endured. The corrosive ends of enlightenment and capitalist aspirations have never been better (or more frightfully) explored, with more believable and emotionally devastating results (to my mind, the only close contender is Joseph Heller's more subtle and ironic \\"Catch-22\\").Despite its unsanitized descriptions of conditions and behavior in a mental health institution, this is a book every thinking person should read at least once. And if you think you have the courage of an Ubermensch to stare into the abyss, then you should not only read it, but come to philosophical terms with it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this book in my senior year of high school and it really affected me. I was moved by the characters and their struggles in the ward. Randall Patrick McMurphy is one of the most vivid characters ever made. You cheer for these characters all the way and really care about what happens to them. This is a classic and every kid should read this book. I think if your kid doesn't like reading, he'll have more of an appreciation for books after reading Cuckoo's Nest. 5 Stars all the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss HerThis book is about the human spirit. It will affect you in such a way that you may never see things quite the same again. That's a good thing. Because it forces us to grow in its affect upon us. It forces us to look at things we choose to ignore and by doing so, it can't help but bring compassion out in the reader! Prisoners, the mentally ill, the homeless, (this book kind of is about prisoners and the mentally ill) are brilliant people in there own way who have lost the power to run their own lives and are subserviant to those who could.. enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Yes, we know. Jack did an excellent job in the movie. But the book is an extraordinary and provocative look at how people can overcome their fears and shortcomings with just the right push in the right direction. Told through the character of Chief, we get a new perspective on life in Nurse Ratchet's ward. This incredible work should be required reading for all high schools (as it was in mine!), and anyone who loves the movie. True, the movie differs from the book but in glorious ways. Such as Jaws, The shining and others. They have their differences but each pleases=the book and the movie."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a brilliantly narrated book that describes an era in our history with a magnificent truthfulness. It is a very deep story riddled with symbolism and double meanings. The characters are beautifully portrayed by showing both their weaknesses and stregnths. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is not only the tale of a group of mental patients, but also describes human nature and what lies in all of us. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have to admit, I saw the movie first before I read this novel, Im just a really big Jack Nicholson fan. But then I found that it was originally a novel, so I decided 'What the hell?' and I gave it a read. The book just blew me away. Not that the movie is any better or worse than the book, but the book gives so much more, like the Chief's visions in the night, and more of his background. They're like two versions of the same story, and they're both impeccable...."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Has to be considered one of the best American novels ever. Has there ever been a character like RP McMurphy. A Christ like figure who leads a the patients against the tyrannical rule of Big Nurse. This should be one every high school reading list. I just wish Ken Kesey would have or will write more."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is probably one of my favorite books, and it didn't take me long to read. I like the set-up of the characters and the way the Indian changes at the end. It was a very wonderful book that I recommend for everyone. I gave it 4 stars because there were some long, breezy parts."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book had some disturbing images and portrayed accurately the primitive psychological treatments available at that time. I got the impression, however, that Kesey underestimated the horrors of mental illness. His point is you have to be able to laugh at the world but mental illness is not that funny and at times the jokes were in bad taste. Medicine today is improving treatment for people with schizophrenia but we must always remember to not pigeon hole people into categories and treat them as human beings. Thats the beauty of Kesey's story: we are all human beings no more no less."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is rich in symbolism. On one level, we see through Big Chief's narrative, a clouded view of the world, and try to interpret his observations with the view point of a more sane person. On the other hand, we too should realize and appreciate that our viewpoint is never perfectly clear, and as a &quot;crazy&quot; person sees things differently than a &quot;normal&quot; person does, so too might two supposed normal people. McMurphy is also a goldmine for a symbolism. I don't think there is any ambiguity that he is the hero of the novel. He rescues the inmates. But we can also consider what else he is the hero of. As stated above, no one sees all things as they are, and so everyone can be viewed as insane. McMurphy is a hero of clarity. He makes his fellow inmates break the boundaries of our thinking. Ken Kesey does the same for his fellow humans."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I saw the movie version on this book first and thought it was good so then I read the book. The book is SO much better than the movie. Telling it through Chief's eyes adds so much atmosphere to the story that is COMPLETELY lost in the movie. And, while Jack Nicholson did the best he could, he really just didn't look the part. When I read the book I always pictured a big, red-headed Irishman, sorta like a lumberjack. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is one of both depth and understanding,it offers the reader an inner look at the workings of human society showing not only the catogaries society creates and imposes on us, but also the workings behind those catogories. It shows one mans plight against the machine, a machine which we created and fed, that on the wrong side of is both deadly and unstoppable. A very good read!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I was forced to read this novel a few days ago while knowing nothing about it (I have not seen the film version). I have to say that this is one of favorite novels of all time. It is extremely deep with many meanings and viewpoints on society. Kesey is a master writer here, I just pray that this was not a one hit wonder, which I feel it may be. Anyone who hasn't read this book is really missing out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Here we go: Society is a bunch of &quot;bull goose loonies&quot; in a mental institution. This is the statement Ken Kesey states in this well-written novel. The author perfectly lets you see his world, and the ward, of course, out of the view of a paranoid Native American. Not just that you really believe the things &quot;Big Chief&quot; sees, but you can understand the other inmates, too. Matt S."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I really enjoyed my flight over the cuckoo's nest! Ken Kesey has one of the most unique and thought provoking styles of writing I have had the pleasure of reading. His descriptions and deplictions of the characters and situations are amazing in the sense that he sees things as no one else would, and writes things like no one else would think to. By writing the story in Big Chief's prospective, he allows the reader to dwell in the mind of a &quot;deaf and dumb&quot; man who hears everything. I loved this novel not only because of the expressive and original text, but because it completely took over my life!! I read this book with my Modern Novel class, and we all agreed that after we started reading it, we began to look for connections in our life. Personally, I STILL look for ways &quot;the combine&quot; is trying to control my life!! Reading about the progress of Big Chief and the others, and the way even a nontraditional hero, like McMurphy can change the lives of &quot;loonies&quot; gives hope that even rebels can change the bad into better."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was such an awesome book!!! I absolutely loved Billy Bibbit and McMurphy. The story was so deep when you think about it. The way McMurphy drew the men in the ward out of their shells, and helped them was honorable. He was a suprise hero; no one could have expected him to be so honorable. Ken Kesey is an amazing writer, and I only wish I could compare. The book was so poetic and flowed so well. Somehow he even managed to put a ray of joy under the saddness."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. It took over my life. Everywhere I went I found things that reminded me of this book. It was quite difficult to understand at first because much of the dialogue and thoughts of Big Chief were uncomprehendable. But once you got used to it, it was very exciting and fun to read. I recommend this book to everyone!!!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I just finished reading this book for a modern Novel class I'm taking. I LOVED EVERY WORD OF IT!!! After reading it every night, I reacted in a different way. Some nights I was laughing, some I cried, and some I was so mad at what was happening, I had to put the book down for a while. I would DEFINATELY recommend this book to anyone who has a great imagination, and a strong stomach."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Written in the 1960's, Cuckoo's Nest takes us into the dark halls of a mental hospital dominated by an imperative matron referred to as the Big Nurse. One day, a new inmate arrives at the asylum and soon wreaks havoc upon the suppressed lifestyle issued by the nurse.The mere tumultuous arrival of Randle McMurphy spurts a global animation among the docile patients. Using his charismatic talents, McMurphy incites them to active demonstration against the Big Nurse, who finds herself at a loss for resources to curb her patients' unexpected commotion.Himself being convicted for drug possession, Ken Kesey has managed to capture both the gloomy asylum-atmosphere and the mental patients' demented attitudes in his surrealistic lifework. A contemporary classic, Cuckoo's Nest stands as a tongue-in-cheek symbol of uprising against opression."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. It's not the book for you if you are looking for a lite read, but I would absolutely recommend it if your in the mood to do some serious reflecting. The imagery is incredible! It's an outsiders look at sanity that will turn you in circles."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you have an interest in psychology, you will most likely enjoy this book. Like most books, it drug on at the beginning, but towards the end, I could not stop."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Iwon't lie. The first exposure I ever had to this book was my freshman year in high school. A friend of mine found it in the library and thought it had a cool title, so he did his freshman paper on it. I teased him, saying that the title was childish and dumb. But, that was six years ago. Since then, I fell away from the &quot;essential classics&quot; that jr. and sr. high had taught me, books like Moby Dick, which, are good, but no 16 year old will ever admit to and I picked up Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot;. This one novel was what turned me on to Kessey. I looked at Kerouac websites and there were Kessey links, and after a year's worth of teasing my pal about the book he'd chosen for a report, there was no way I could've forgotten the title. I read about Kessey, and of coarse, his bus, Furthur, and the Acid Tests, and Neal Cassidy and all that fun stuff. I wondered about the book and bought it and read it. It was no mistake. With colorful characters like McMurphy and the Chief, a world of chronics and acutes, Kessey unfolds a surrealistic world that mirrors modern socioeconomic hierarchies. You have the haves, the staff, and the have nots, the patients. The staff rules over the patients like a regime, and within this hierarchy lies another like a set of Chinese toy boxes. The Chief's got no money, McMurphy's a gambler, the other patients don't know that McMurphy is swindling them, and so on and so forth. I began thinking that you really can't judge a book by it's cover, or, in this case, title, the more I read it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable stories I've ever read. The characters are so full of life, and the narration is exceptional. Kesey does an incredible job of fleshing out RPM; it's one of the few times where I've felt that I had a full view of a literary character. I recommend not even seeing the movie. I watched it after reading this and was quite annoyed, especially with the emphasis the film put on the boating trip - zzzzz..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#65533;s Nest is about a man named Randle McMurphy. He is a mentally sane person, but he fakes insanity in order to escape a short jail sentence he is serving on a work farm. The person who runs the place, Big Nurse, hates McMurphy for weakening control, for he said things that made the other patients who usually didn&#65533;t do anything want to do anything. Because McMurphy did this, Big Nurse wanted to finish off McMurphy by having him lobotomized. This crucifixion inspires an Indian patient; a schitzoid called Chief Broom, to break out of the hospital.I enjoyed this book because it gave me a sort of picture of what it is like inside a mental institution and how it works and what it does to people. Although the book is told in the point of view of Chief broom, the story still is very well written. I do think that if I was the author, I would of written it through the point of view of McMurphy, and tried to explain how he got there in the first place before starting the story of what happened while he was in the institution. I also enjoyed how they described McMurphy and used dialogue to describe his personality.I recommend this book to anybody who is at least in his or her teens, for this book would probably be good for the interest and reading level of a thirteen-year-old. I also recommend that the reader be a fan of a sort of adventure/horror story. The book uses details that give you graphic pictures, and it might not be appropriate for some people or for young children.(...)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School back in 1978 and I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. It concerns a former prison inmate by the name of Randall McMurphy who cons his way into a Mental Institution thinking that his life will be a lot easier there. Then he has to listen endlessly to the complaints and whining of his fellow patients who have the choice to walk out anytime but they choose to stay and be subject Big Nurse's unusual form of Therapy which McMurphy describes as a \\"Pecking Party\\".Gee. These guys all look pretty normal to me compared to some of my old teachers!!!I give this book 5 stars because for some reason my English Teacher decided it was worth reading then 60 students all had to go out and buy a copy which no doubt would have made the author very happy!!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While Kesey's Nest is imaginative, it hardly seems the world-bending peyote-inspired trip that Kesey and reviewers claim. The novel is solidly constructed, but tends to run shallow at times. The Freudian reduction of all psychology to sex is perhaps titillating (see climax), but is banally anachronistic (hopefully). Kesey's McMurphy, like Kerouac's Moriarty, is a character of astounding vitality and transcendant humanity; and it is Kesey's portrayal of McMurphy's tragically madcap antics that makes this book worth reading. The episode of the \\"psycho-ceramic\\" salmon-fishing expedition is particularly hilarious. Some of the details of the psychiatric ward are haunting, but Kesey doesn't depict the fragility of sanity or the horror of power as poignantly as others have. Kesey's absurdity is too entertaining to be that disturbing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"did you see the movie?no?well ok then ill tell you.this is the book that made ken kesey[hippie extrordinairre] famous and funded his acid tests.anyhow,the movie follows the book quite well which is good.its all about this guy who fakes insanity in order to be released from a work farm and put into the funny farm.only its not so funny there and he decides to rebel.it will take you through a range of emotions from hysteria to balling your eyes out.its a great book everbody should read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a very good book. I read it because my dad told me that the movie was very good. So I read the book. This book is very detailed. I recommend this book anyone who enjoys reading and loves to read new and interesting books. This book was real interesting to me because it pulled me in. I was into this book very much. I was like one of the characters in the book. The author was real cool about this story. I recommend this book to family, friends, and strangers. This book got me interested again in reading. Now I would like to go pick up another book like this and read it because it pulled me in. The understanding of this book was easy. I just kept on reading and reading this book. I think that the movie is going to be much better because it gives a visual presentation of the book. But if you already have a good imagination then you don't need the movie. If you visualize this book as you are reading it then you are in good shape because it becomes more fun and more interesting to you. Believe me, I really hate reading but this book changed that. Now I would like to start reading again and read books like this one."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I thought this was a very good book when I first read it and I enjoyed it a lot but then I started wondering about some things. Like why are all the hospital staff either women or black and the patients all white males? What was he trying to say with that? The doctors a white male but you get the feeling that there are similarities between him and the patients and that he can sympasize with them. I suppose I'll just have to read it again though."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It's your typical drug induced, anti-establishment 1960's paranoid novel.

Every part was great but the end just moved me to tears (I hope I'm not giving too much away). I was made to read it at school, and at first I had my doubts, but how I regret that now!! It's too good!! If you haven't read it already, do so now!!!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"After reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I must say that I am a little dissapointed. The story was well written and the plot consistent, but I often found myself wanting to throw the book away. It starts off promising, explaining a mental ward and a new guy starts a stir. I read farther though, and started to realize this was not what I expected. There are constant halucinations by the narrator Chief Bromden, and the new patient McMurphy does not cause as much trouble as the start of the novel makes it seem he would. Often, I would crave some action or atleast good drama, and I would end up falling asleep cradling the book. I am not saying there is no plot development or scenes of action, people die and events occur, but I was not very impressed with the book as a whole. Ken Kesey needs a little more action and a lot less filler in this book. For me, he barely kept my attention and interest. Unless you like to read a muddle of strewn thoughts and little action, I don't recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Chief Bromden main character and has been a patient in the Oregon psychiatric hospital for ten years. He suffers from paranoia, hallucinations and delusions. Bromden spends his life and hospital time in fear of an imaginary force called the combine. The combine is force that attempts to control society and pushes people into fall into conformity. The reason that he makes such a good narrator is that he pretends to be deaf and dumb and sits and listens and is able to hear things that are not supposed to heard. The hospital patients are separated into two groups the Acute's, who can be cured, and Chronics, who cannot be cured, they are all male. The hospital is controlled by Nurse Ratched, an extremely strict woman. She encourages people to stay sick by creating traps that the patients fall in to thus causing patients to stay sicker longer. There are treatments for patients that do not follow the rules, they are sent in to receive electroshock treatments and lobotomy, even though these treatments are no longer favored by the medical community the hospital still uses them, because Nurse Ratched uses them to stay in control, she uses them to create fear in her ward. Randle McMurphy arrives from the Pendleton Work Farm he seems to be \\"normal\\" he is calm and cool and introduces himself as a man who loves women, cards and drugs. Although it does not seem like McMurphy and Bromden would have anything in common but it turns out that Bromden lets McMurphy in on the fact that he is neither deaf nor dumb and when McMurphy was a child he did the same thing. Although other patients tell McMurphy that there is no defying Nurse Ratched he attempts to deceive her and question her power. Other patients follow his lead and begin to work with McMurphy with things such as refusing to clean. McMurphy eventually learns that involuntarily committed patients are stuck in the hospital until the staff decides they are cured. When McMurphy realizes that he is at Nurse Ratched's mercy, he starts to follow the rules. He sees the power of the electroshock treatments 1st hand and becomes genuinely frightened of the hospital staff. McMurphy arranges a fishing trip for himself and ten other patients, he shows the patients that the outside world is not as scary as it seems and he shows them how to be \\"men\\" by teaching them to catch big fish on their own. McMurphy and Bromden get into a fistfight with the hospital aides when they are attempting to defend George Sorenson. After this incident they are both sent in for electroshock therapy. The patients try to get McMurphy to escape, but he has arranged a date for Billy with a prostitute named Candy, and he refuses to let Billy down. McMurphy bribes Mr. Turkle, the night aide, to sneak Candy into the hospital and they have a party on the ward. Billy has sex with Candy while McMurphy and the other patients smoke marijuana and drink. The aides discover the mess the next morning and suddenly the hospital is crazy, when Nurse Ratched finds Billy with Candy, she threatens to tell Billy's mother. Billy freaks out commits suicide by cutting his throat. McMurphy tries to strangle Nurse Ratched and for revenge she has him lobotomized, and he returns to the ward incompetent. After this they no longer find Nurse Ratched powerful and the patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out of the hospital. Bromden murders McMurphy in his bed and since he has recovered he leaves the mental hospital by breaking through a window."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Seeing this book on the shelf for many years, I had a preconceived idea of what it may be like. I thought it was going to be detailed, dry reading about those living in a mental institution. I couldn't be more wrong. This story was told as a first person narrative and gave the reader the opportunity to drop any stereotypes he or she may have concerning mental illness. The characterization was fantastic. The ending, for me, was quite a surprise. The characters and story will stay with me for quite some time."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a cruelly brilliant novel. And that jarring juxtaposition between cruelty and brilliance is what makes the whole thing tick.Cruelty is personified in the book's antagonist, an Army nurse who uses her position and her bureaucratic influence to sustain a reign of quiet terror on her inmates. Brilliance is embodied by the protagonist, an irascible rebel who uses his wit and sheer zest for life to instil courage and a sense of self worth in those same inmates. The contest between them is a struggle for souls. It mirrors the larger struggle we face between the spiritual death of slavish conformity and the spiritual vitality of chaotic abandon. Sometimes, to live at all, one must live madly.And it is all shown to us so naturally that we never know we are learning it until we pause for reflection and thought. This is the sign of a great writer.The book also has faults. For one thing, it is sexist. The women are either emotional fascists, like Ratched; or spineless, like the other nurses and Bromden's mother; or tarts, like Candy. It would have been nice to see a woman with substance and backbone as a counterpoint to the depressing figures cut by the female characters. Moreover, there is a rather misogynistic subplot hinting at Ratched's repressed sexuality and old maid syndrome as the reason for her sadism. The women are placed in positions where they lord it over the men, from the obvious to the barely perceptible, and we are vaguely made to feel that this is against the natural order of things. Kinda cheesy, and frankly, a cheap shot by the author.But the book was written in 1962, before writing had become stilted and sanitized by political correctness. Perhaps it is the more honest for being what it is: a story set in a men's mental institution being run by women.This book isn't really about mental institutions or old maids or the politics of the sixties or even the virtues of rebellion. It's really about power. Power to live, power of control, power to transform and, in the end, power to escape from whatever makes us small. This theme is the skeleton. The story fleshes out the bones. In its way, it is Orwell's 1984, brought down to the level of a single institution, Big Brother replaced by Big Nurse, Winston replaced by McMurphy, and the totalitarian state replaced by the totalitarian cuckoo's nest.It isn't a cheerful read. There is tragedy and loss. Some may find the book depressing. I found it inspiring. If you can step back from the characters, the setting and the plot, and look at the author's world as a coherent whole, Kesey is telling us that the Ratched's don't prevail. The cost may be painfully high, but if we are willing to pay it, we can triumph over the spiritual strangulation that Big Nurse wishes on us all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you like to laugh and enjoy stories of rebellion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the book for you. A rowdy gambler and brawler fakes his insanity to escape the toil of a work farm. He arrives at the state hospital to find himself, along with everyone else in the ward, under the control of the Big Nurse. Immediately, he makes friends with the other patients there and conceives a plot to overthrow her. Ken Kesey does a great job of painting an interesting picture of humanity and teaching you lessons about individualism in this masterpiece. Full of suspense, humor, and emotion, this book will keep any reader excited about the next page. As a high school student, I recommend this classic to anyone. Understanding the vulnerability of those who are mentally handicapped and the inhumanity that caretakers are capable of is something we all need to be aware of. Even if you are not an avid reader, I assure you that you'll love this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I saw the movie before I was ever aware that &quot;Cuckoo's Nest..&quot; was ever a novel. And I've recently read the book and I couldn't put it down! Literally! I would read for hours at a time and I completed the 272 page book in a matter of three days. And with little wonder; Ken Kesey does a brilliant job making setting and characters very vivid. Yet he doesn't take pages at a time (see Charles Dickens) to do so. In order to appreciate this novel, you must read every word... if you think you missed something, go back and read it again. I've never felt so alive after reading as I have when I completed &quot;Chuckoo's Nest..&quot;. And I hope you feel the same fulfillment that I did."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a wonderfully engaging novel told from the perspectiveof a mental patient. Read it!Now on to the subject I wanted totalk about. There is a customer review by a 6 year old girl (from 1997) telling the story in her own words. I would like to inform anyone who cares that the events the little girl spoke of were not true to the book. They were scenes from the movie with Jack Nicholson. The movie and the book are very similar, but there are very huge differences, one being the fishing trip. The &quot;little girl&quot; told the movie version. In the book version, the patients have permission to go on the trip, and Doctor Spivey accompanies them on the trip...This really is a wonderful novel and I hope everyone will read it AND see the movie to see the differences. The movie is classic, so if you really don't want to read the book, see the movie, but don't play it off like you read the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey grabs you, and puts you up to a horrifying peephole with this book. You see through the eyes of each character, and become addicted to their world. You will not be able to put this book down, nor should you.This novel is a life-changing account of American Society. These tormented souls reveal a world that we would never wish upon any one; yet it is the world we live in..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this in school and I have to say it was fairly good book. It was filled with comedy, adventure, and action! It showed how people can get under each other's skin over petty things such as the &quot;World Series Battle&quot;. The best characters are the inmates with their looney charm and witt. Also McMurphy is exceptional!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a brilliant book, no doubt. And it does reflect how primitive some psychiatric practices were 40+ years ago. But it is really not a story about psychiatry as it is a political, and possibly even religious allegory. It is the struggle between good (freedon) and evil (repression.) If anything, the setting is similar to the Gulag in Solzenhitsen's (sp) works. And if you want to read the book that could have been the great american novel, read Kesey's Sometimes a Great Notion. In many ways, it surpasses Cukoos Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is about a group of mentally demented men that encounter a total change in routine when a man named McMurphy enters their ward. The ward is run by a nurse who can't stand to see disorder and disagreement from the patients. She is refereed to as the \\"big nurse.\\" Everyone of the patients is scared to question her authority, except McMurphy. Through-out the story he is trying to buck the system and create a more comfortable situation for the other patients who would never attempt to do the same. There's an assortment of hilarious confrontations between the patients and the staff that will surely put a smile on your face.The style of writing that Ken Kesey demonstrates in this novel is magnificent. The story is told from the view of an Indian man on the ward who is considered to be deaf and mute but actually is not. It's amazing how Kesey showed the corruptness about the ward through the eyes of this particular individual. It will make the reader feel disgusted at times and warm-hearted at others. Kesey's novel will enlighten readers with a hidden and unexplored part of the American culture."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey offers an excellent portrayal of what it would be like to be in a mental ward only a few years ago. He doesn't try to make it seem like a nice place; he writes about what might be the harsh and awful truth. The plot of this book is always going up and down, keeping you interested and wanting to read more. The plot involves the conflict between the inmates and the ward staff, particularly &quot;Big Nurse&quot;. This conflict is seen through the eyes of many characters, especially &quot;Chief&quot; and &quot;R.P. McMurphy&quot;. R.P. is a small-time criminal who thinks life in a mental ward will be easier than hard labor in prison. He learns that life in the mental ward isn't close to what he anticipated; it's a lot more nerve-wracking. The characters Kesey creates are full of personality and each one is very distinct. Chief seems quiet and subdued because he pretends to be deaf and dumb, but we eventually learn how deeply the ward has altered him. R.P. McMurphy is loud, abrupt, and commanding. He has silent battles with the nurse to see who is really in charge of the ward. With the amazing plot and outrageous cast of characters this book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This review is for the Penguin Books paperback edition, 2003, with illustrations by Ken Kesey and introduction by Robert Faggen. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, first published in 1962, was Ken Kesey's debut novel.The setting is a ward at a hospital for the mentally ill, probably in the late fifty's. Chief Nurse Ratched has absolute control over her ward. Through insinuation and intimidation, she has oppressed the patients, aides, junior nurses and even the ward doctor into wimps. We see this through the eyes of the narrator, Big Chief Bromden Jr., a half-Indian who pretends he is a deaf-mute. The staff ignores him, and allows him to clean the staff room during their meetings. He's the all knowing fly on the wall.Enter the new admission, Randal Patrick McMurphy, the roughneck gambler who got himself transferred to a mental hospital to escape the rigors of a prison work farm. McMurphy considers most of the patients essentially sane, and cannot understand why they have allowed Nurse Ratched to dominate and humiliate them. McMurphy rallies his fellow inmates towards mutiny in a long battle to undermine Nurse Ratched's authority.Weaved into ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a social commentary on the mid-century ideas for treatment of those who could not or would not conform to normality. The novel, and the subsequent movie and play, undoubtedly helped popularize the need for change. Although that is behind us, this entertaining and often hilarious read remains."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Having read Cockoos Nest as least three times since the 1970's I want to look at Cuckoos Nest from another angle. Popularly seen as a struggle against the Establishment this novel was the darling of the 60s generation. I have to admit, after my first reading I saw Nurse Ratched as the Establishment and Murphy as the Free Spirit who comes against it. But older and wiser now, I see it differently.This is not a novel against the establishment but against tyranny. The Establishment is presented benignly- it is the county police who arrested McMurphy, it is the jails across the Pacific Northwest that McMurphy was a frequent visitor, it is the doctors who are intimidated by Nurse Ratched it is the nurses who just try to do their jobs. These are not evil people; rather they are people who are trying to make the world we live in a good place to live. McMurphy, for the most part, is getting just what he deserves- he is a con-man who gets caught. Only in trying to manipulate the system for his own ends, does he find himself in the domain of Nurse Ratched and begins his epic struggle against tyranny. As we read this novel it is clear that Nurse Ratched is the anomaly. She misses the bad old days of the mental hospital when she ruled with an iron hand- she intimidates the doctors, nurses, staff and patients for her own ends. It is only in his encounter with Nurse Ratched that McMurphy becomes a hero.But McMurphy is a tragic hero. He does not understand the power that Big Nurse wields. The object of war is victory, not making a statement. He makes a statement and loses the war- Billy commits suicide, McMurphy is lobotomized, and the rest of the acutes are traumatized. Throughout the book, McMurphy is warned by others than Big Nurse of the consequences of his behavior; yet, he persists until, in the end, he loses.One more observation, the language of this book is beautiful. It grabs you by the throat and drags you into McMurphys world. Not an easy book to read, but well worth the effort. Speaking about language, one sentence had over 170 words in it. Wow! It takes a master at the English language to pull off a feat like that and keep the readers interest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you haven't read this book - DO NOT see the movie, just read this book.

It will make you feel confused. It will make you feel smart. It will do whatever it is a book has to do to keep the reader's fullest attention. Not only will you enjoy reading this book it will move you emotionally.In this book I believe Kesey is trying to make two points:The first one is that being a leader not only allows yourself to be great but also brings out the best in others. Secondily, never try too hard to beat or defeat something or someone who has a higher power of authority than you do. You may win some battles but never will win the war.Kesey demonstrates these points in an enjoyable way in an incredible book. That you must read to believe!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's anti-establishment novel has proven itself through numerous printings and cover art changes. The truth is that this is a work that should be recommended reading at every college campus. Using a classic formula of good vs. evil, overlord vs. underdog, and man vs. society, Kesey takes readers through life in a now outdated, but largely stereotypical model of a mental institution. His humor is wicked and the characters are unforgettable. You will find yourself wondering if you are merely a cog in the wheel or if you, too, have been persecuted for being an individual. Find out where many modern cultural references originated and read this book. Questioning authority is necessary today--possibly more than ever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an American original, and a true classic of the literature. It is a book that is at once disturbing, tragic, vibrant, hopeful, and poignant. It is a rather complex work, and exists on several levels: brilliant allegory, biting satirical fable, or social, anarchistic, or nihilistic literary masterpiece. The book does not seem to have much in the way of an actual meaty plot - suffice it to say, it is probably more than you expect; it certainly was in my case. I recommend the book to the general reader - although it is not really an easy read (it contains some dialogue which takes some time to get into the flow of), you will probably get through it pretty quickly. This is one of those books, though, that has a deeper and more far-reaching resonance than its mere surface meaning. It has a mood and a mode of foreboding that will stick with you long after you have turned the last page. Although I have not seen the rather renowned movie which is based on this work - and although Jack Nicholson seems like the perfect actor to play McMurphy - I doubt that it contains the wealth and depth of vitality and resonance that this book does. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a true classic of 20th century American literature, and comes as a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Wow. This book will fill your heart with laughter and then shatter it into a thousand pieces. Kesey's command of descriptive writing, and of getting a person emotionally involved with the characters, has few equals. This book will suck you into the hearts and minds of a group of men in an insane asylum, their &quot;Bull Goose Loony&quot; Savior, and their perpetually enemy, Nurse Ratched. It is told from the position of one of the patients of the asylum, and the deep philosophical introspection is interspersed, or combined with I guess, his manic hallucinations. The patients fishing trip is some of the finist writing I've ever seen, and the conclusion will leave you with a broken heart as well as hope for the future. You will fall in love with Big Chief and McMurphey and Harding, and hate the Big Nurse and the other members of the Combine. Who is really more insane? The broken men or the woman who wishes to keep them broken? Breathtaking writing. This one'll get inside your head. Absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"...the book is better.I had to read _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ for my Literature and Film class, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a book &quot;for school&quot; as much as I enjoyed this one. I'd never seen the film before I read it, and not knowing the plot presented in the movie was definitely worth it.If you've seen the movie (and even if you haven't), read the book for Dale Harding. Those who've seen the film will remember him as.. a rather dislikable character at odds with McMurphy throughout. He was done a -great- disservice in the film, and was by far my favorite character - I read it mostly to experience scenes with him.Ken Kesey's prose is quirky and elegant - with such descriptions of physical idiosyncracies that I've never seen so accurately written - such as the way he describes Harding as trapping his pretty hands between his knees and folding his thin shoulders about his chest like green wings. It's difficult to understand at times, since the narrator, Chief Bromden, is also a mental patient on the ward and sees things differently than a sane person would - but anything he says that's hard to grasp at the beginning slowly becomes clear as the narrative goes on._One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ is made brilliant by a number of things: the beauty and eccentricity of the prose, the development of character, the layers of plot and subtext, and the subtle messages, meanings, and morals scattered throughout the pages in such a way that you learn them but don't realize they're there. I highly recommend this book - it's one that will stay with you again and again, and is warranted a second and third time reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although it often makes critical short lists, I find it difficult to get worked up about Ken Kesey's 1962 ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, mainly because it so deeply rooted in a late 1950s/early 1960s mindset that it fails to transcend its own era. It also has several flaws that tend to undercut its own statement.McMurphy is a rough and tumble gambler, con man, and all around huckster who is serving a short sentence at the county farm. Tired of field work, he feigns insanity in order to gain transfer to the state insane asylum, where the food is better and the work is less--but in doing so he runs afoul of Nurse Ratched, a relentlessly controlling woman who runs her ward with an iron fist. At first McMurphy is amused by the woman and her rules and takes pleasure frustrating her. Too late does he realize that both his treatment and ultimate release are entirely in her hands, and the two embark upon a collision course that will ultimately destroy them both.The great strength here is in Kesey's narrative. The novel is told through the eyes of Bromden, a half-Native American ward patient who has spent many years alternating between his own mental illness and Nurse Ratched's all-encompassing control, and who pretends to be deaf and dumb in order to escape the ward's horrors. Bromden is a fascinating creation and his telling of the clash between McMurphy and Ratched is beautifully wrought. Unfortunately, neither McMurphy or Ratched are greatly engaging or sympathetic characters, and as the novel progresses they become little more than symbols for the emerging clash between the counter-culture and the establishment.CUCKOO'S NEST is frequently described as a comic novel, but in truth there is little humor to the work; there is instead a pervading sense of irony which--like characters and story--becomes less and less subtle as the novel progresses. And Kesey tends to undercut his own allegory by ultimately showing that not all the hospital wards are run in the same way as Ratched runs her ward, a fact that blunts the sharpness of the story's point. My own take: read it, certainly, but bear in mind that you really had to be reading the book in about 1963 or 1964 to get the full juice of it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A very good dramatic fiction that reflects the viscosity of Keasey's non-conformist, open experimental approach to life in the American culture of his era. The Native American narrator who, not by his own intention, was perceived deaf and dumb, therefore ironically is an unhindered witness of all proceedings, is a brilliant choice. The representations of patients in their various stages of immobilization as well as their voluntary status and the artificially consensual and rather staged criticisms and convictions of each other in their so called therapy meetings are also quite effective form of social commentary. The stories of characters flow very smoothly and writing is excellent as well as entertaining without being overly dramatic, or overly autobiographical which is not always common in the books by such huge personalities or icons."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an amazing book; I honestly wish that I would have read it long before I saw the movie. Try as I might, I still cannot help but picture Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher whenever McMurphy or Nurse Ratched were \\"on stage.\\"Much more complex than the movie, the novel works on many levels. The characters are gripping, and the psychological undertones amazing. I read this first in high school, again in college, and twice during adult life, and each time I see something new in it that I hadn't seen before. In short, it is a modern masterpiece.The book is told from the Chief's viewpoint. Chief deeply troubled psychotic, and pulling this off is Kesey's tour-de-force. Every utterance of this schizophrenic character rings true as he moves from the \\"fog\\" of fear into the real world. Not only does this progression make the novel more interesting than the movie, it makes you question certain elements of the movie.For instance, was Mac a savior, or simply a dangerous whacko? The movie points towards savior, but the savior interpretation is merely the interpretation of a troubled mind yearning to be free in the novel. The nurse, too, seems less intimidating when you move back from the Chief's interpretation of her. I imagine that she was more humane than his inner fears and the fog that stands between him and the world would allow him to see. Once this is understood, the characters of Mac and Big Nurse become less \\"cut and dried,\\" and more real, more vital and much more ambiguous. And Kesey's true purpose seems to surface. The actual characters of Mac/ Big Nurse are not important; how they react on the Chief's psyche is.Seen in this way, the novel traces one of Joseph Campbell's grand mythic themes: The liberation of the masculine psyche from the chaotic rubble of the mother dominated chaos (can you tell this interpretation is based on my college paper?). This journey, which Campbell describes in his \\"Hero With a Thousand Faces,\\" is a man's major mission early in life. To be free, a male must liberate himself from the feminine and establish himself in the real world. Mythic literature the world over teems with this theme. A man's inability to liberate himself from this dark, restraining yet safe world is a major cause of many psychoses. Kesey has managed to bring that myth into the modern world, and the effects are just as amazing and relevant as the original myths were.By the way, I received an \\"A+\\" on my college paper, which took the novel apart along these lines. I hope that a student here or there stumbles on this. There is ample room for exploration in this book that seems so simple on the outside, but so deep and complex the deeper you dig. This is, after all, the mark of a truly great work of art.At the same time, don't let all this \\"noodling\\" ruin such a perfectly enjoyable book. [Noodling (v)- The cursed blessing of a liberal arts and science education. :-}]"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found this Kindle version to be unreadable due to very frequent typos.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is so good that I have never seen the movie, because although I'm sure Nicholson did a great job, the crazy red-headed Scottsman and the giant Indian are forever engraved in my head. It's amazing that a book can be so good, it's like you actually new the characters at some point in your life. That's what Kesey was able to accomplish, and I thank him for this rare piece of a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It is repeatedly said that the patients are in their 30's to 50's but when I read this book it sounds as if the caricatures are just teens 17, 18, 19, 20. I think this is a significant fact and shouldn't just be looked over. I think that the style of writing portrays the characters by giving each character similar problems that teens have now.All of the characters are searching for themselves in some way. Something that is common for all teens to do while they are trying to fit into society and become adults. It may be how they feel about sexuality like Billy or Harding, or they feel small like Chief they are searching for a part of themselves that they have lost that they need in order to fit into society and McMurphy is the person who does what he can to help them out.McMurphy plays a surprising and amazing character to me. He is like a friend that everybody whishes they could have. He is smart and funny, but he also has a charisma that draws people to him. He isn't afraid to test the boundaries, and he has a wining attitude that says to everybody things will turn out just like he says. I enjoyed every seen in which McMurphy showed up, his character brought hope and courage to the patients, he worked with them and gave them back what they had lost peace by peace with all of his tricks, and jokes, and laughs, he gave them back the strength and courage they lost. He brought them out of their pacified state of mind allowing them to think for themselves even when they were standing in the face of their enemies. All of these characteristics can be found in teens today, but it is a rare treat to be such a natural leader, the way McMurphy is portrayed.I remember one line in the book over all the rest its when McMurphy is talking to the patients after his first day, and he says, \\"your all just as sane as everybody else out in the world\\" that is an interesting thing to say in his situation being in a mental clinic and all that, but coming from a personality like McMurphy's its something I am able to believe.There was only one seen that I didn't like where McMurphy showed up was at the end and it was not even him who I was mad at, it was the Head Nurse. There were times when I found her character to be pleasant, humorous nonetheless. To go as far as she did in the end, to sentence him to such a life, a life worse then death, to prove that she could just to \\"win\\" and have the last say, that was sickening to me. She knew as well as everybody that McMurphy was as sane as anybody but went against the \\"combine\\" and made his living that way. I think that is justification for what the Chief did. In fact I think that if McMurphy was there he would have told him to put that pillow over his face, I know he would have because after his operation he was no longer McMurphy he had no personality left he was no one at all just a shell with a face.The only thing I would really change with this book to make it more appealing to newer audiences is the characters ages. The characters are much older then they are made to appear. There personalities don't support the ages that they have been given, and it throws me off a bit. I notice the book is much more enjoyable to me if I picture all of the characters are what I believe them to be, based on their personalities. For me they resemble teenagers but for others they could resemble something else. I think that by taking out the ages of the characters it creates a much more personal bond between the characters and the reader because you can believe them to be what ever you want instead of having them be generations older. But that could be part of why they are in the clinic in the first place. If they aren't pertraied as adults to the world, but they are of the same age as sesoned adults then what are they? Other then that I enjoyed reading the book after I got through the first few chapters that made me sick to the point that I couldn't continue to read if the book was going to continue on as it does in chapter one. But when McMurphy is introduced everything changed and I could hardly put the book down. His character adds so much to this book and there is always enough humor to take along with the darker side of what happens in the world."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I personally think that the book was a real interesting book. The way the author put everything into perspective. It began a little slow, however the contents were extremely elaborate.

Only one other time has a film done that-1992, \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" And it is interesting that both of these films differ who tells us the story from his own perspective-on of a very small and unimportant manner from the book in the same way.\\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\" is a book that sustains itself by allowing the reader to be inside the head of one of the characters and it is he, a very large Indian who everyone believes to be mute and deaf, that we learn about life in a mental health institution in the 1950's. The book is a masterpiece, an American Classic. So is the movie. both are remarkable works of art but if you have seen the film you have not read the book. And if you've only read the book, you've not seen the film. The two stories teach different things-or rather approaches different parts of our soul to teach the sam thing. I am not sure which."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The misogyny, the racism, the classism, the discrimation and prejudice against the mentally disturbed. This book has it all. There's a study where a researcher admitted himself to a mental institution to examine the way patients are diagnosed and treated. I wonder if Ken Kesey did the same thing or just wrote a story based on a worst case scenario. The pitch must have been something like &quot;ok let's see, how about a rebel rousing, conniving, tough but sensitive extravert who is placed in a new environment with a bunch of men who are used to bowing to authority and let him tussle with the powers that be to prove himself to the group. Been done before? Ok, how about at a MENTAL INSTITUTION?- Hey, pay dirt!&quot; Historically, mental patients have been treated poorly, heavily medicated and operated on to make them more docile, although that's not even the point of this story. The ideas of freedom and humanity that are portrayed here are interesting because the oppressed patients turn around and oppress others- namely the blacks and other women in this story. Dominance is gained through oppression and this book enforces the idea that only the white male has the ability to control his destiny. Don't agree? You must be a white male."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I was expecting a little more from this book. I found it hard to follow at times but overall I did like it.

When I did finally pick it up, I was not hooked. Admittedly I was a bit confused with the Chief narrating - I was not sure what was real and the pace was a bit slow in the beginning. But as I continued, the book started to grow on me, as did the characters, including Chief and of course McMurphy. I loved McMurphy's antics against the Big Nurse, his sacrifice, and Chief's growing strength - all which I think the author used very well to depict society and conformity.If you have not read this book, DO IT!! I took one star off due to the slow and confusing beginning. But probably when I do a re-read, it will make a lot more sense.Now I am off to watch the movie...!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Julie GuerreroThe novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; by Ken Kessey, was one of the best books I have read ever since my high school years. It was the only novel that kept me interested in what was going to happen next and I couldn't put it down for second. What I enjoyed the most is the way the main character, McMurphy, performed his role and the way the author set up the story. The novel is about a man named McMurphy who goes into the world of the mental hospital and objects and refuse to obey the rules. He then takes over the Big Nurse who had the power of authority and McMurphy leads the other patients around him to experience fun and happiness. McMurphy does this by promoting gambling and he sneaks in women in the ward. His only goal in this novel is to reduce the other patien't fears toward the Big Nurse and to forget about the rules for once and have fun. Overall, this is a very interesting, enjuyable and a funny novel, and I defintely recommend it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When it comes right down to it, it's not that the book was sad, but what it had to say about our society. All along I knew that McMurphy wasn't going to win, but I wanted him to. I rooted for him to get to the nurse; I wanted to see her crack. But it didn't. Instead we spent the whole book watching these people break out of their shells, to revolt against authority, and they don't. After McMurphy disappeares, they all give up and go home. I wanted them to stay and fight."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"And believe me, I really did enjoy it! The book is really something else.Written in 1962 by Ken Kesey, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST establishes what people face day to day, the Establishment! We in our society deal with rules, policies, and laws -- and this book throws those same laws right back in the faces of those enforcers. The hero is Randle Patrick &quot;Mack&quot; McMurphy, a man sent to an Oregon state mental hospital after causing problems in a prison farm; the other is the villain (or should I say villainess) in the guise of the &quot;Big Nurse&quot; Mildred Ratched, who dominates the entire hospital. McMurphy fights against Ratched and her system, and eventually &quot;waking up&quot; the patients on the ward.We meet other patients -- the Acutes: Harding, Martini, Scanlon, Cheswick, Sefelt, Fredrickson, the stuttering Billy Bibbit, and the narrator of the story, the supposed deaf and dumb Indian Chief Bromden, as told through his eyes.The book takes many liberties in defining the realities of a mental hospital. But it actually is much more than that. It's about the freedom of the spirit, the right to make your own choices and not be bullied by the Establishment, or dare I say even the government! McMurphy embodies that spirit, that certain rebel within us all that will not stand by and let other dictate our lives. Of course, in the end, there is a loss felt by everyone including McMurphy, Nurse Ratched, the patients, and the entire staff of the hospital.Needless to say, this book is very different from the 1975 Oscar-winning film that starred Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, both of whom won Best Actor and Actress that year -- and the film winning Best Picture. But the film doesn't haven't the endless description by the Chief as the book has; in fact, the Chief doesn't say a word until half way through the film. Kesey even went on to denounce the film and say that it completely ruined the idea of his book. However, many would disagree that the film ruined book and vice versa. (But to be honest, I did find the film much more accessable than the book.)My one complaint is, as always expected from a book, the endless description from the Chief about the hospital, about McMurphy's nose, about Nurse Ratched's breasts, about his papa and his boyhood in the Dalles. Does it really matter? Quite frankly, does anyone care to know this?Here's a lesson to everyone: UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUT A FACE ON THE CHARACTERS, DO NOT WATCH THE FILM VERSION BEFORE READING THE BOOK! You'll just get bored with description and subplots.But CUCKOO'S NEST is a very good book! I would recommend this to anyone who like that story of the underdog against the system. This book is definitely an interesting read and a good study on both the human spirit and heart."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found tihs book very intriguing especially with the multiple themes that were repeatedly used throughout the book. The most important theme I discovered was the faint line between reality and imagination. Constantly, this line is blurred as the attendants and nurses at the mental institution turn perfectly normal and sane patients into the insane. Particularly Nurse Ratched, she carries reality in her viewpoint and intends to change whatever she imagines in her mind into reality. Furthermore, the overbearing dominance of Nurse Rathched also emphasizes the importance of females in this book. The females in this book tend to carry a very strong presence among the males and belittle them to the point where they become extremely insecure about their sexuality. Constantly, new themes are brought up throughout the book, which is what I find most interesting. Themes lead to more themes, which leads to even more themes and all together the motifs create a fantastic book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"*on my mom's account because I haven't bought anything from my own*I'll admit, when I first started reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I was totally uninterested in the story. Of course, that may be because I was reading it in a camping chair outside of a pre-teen girl's bathroom at 10:00 at night while wearing three pairs of pants and two sweatshirts, drinking tea. Yes, it seriously was that cold outside. For those of you who are wondering what in the world I was up to, I was on night patrol at my camp.Anyways, that night I got to page 60 and then didn't begin reading it again until about a week ago. And, all of a sudden, the story took on a whole new light to me. I found the story at times uproariously amusing; at others, really depressing.What stuck out to me most in the story was Chief's relationship with McMurphy. Before McMurphy's arrival, Chief was a total outcast, not just because people thought he was deaf and dumb, but also because of his Native American heritage. Yet once McMurphy enters the story, Chief is included in everything that goes on the ward. Without McMurphy's fishing trip, Chief never would have shown his fellow inmates that he is not deaf. McMurphy awakens Chief to a whole new way of living and it is Chief's gradual awakening that propels the story forward."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book deserves to be a classic and may remain one for quite a long time. The first reason is that it is an adventure book in a strange country, beyond all frontiers and borders, in a psychic world, that of an asylum. It is full of suspense and typically the fight between two people, an inmate, a man, on one hand, a nurse, a woman, on the other hand. Both white with the rest of the personnel being black and the rest of the inmates being europeans, except for one who is an Indian. Clear cut adventure and action with blood, violence, wit and enough sex to be appealing. The second reason is that it is an extremely detailed trip down into the psychiatric health system, into the institutionalizing of all displeasing people, all disrupting people, all disquieting people, in one word people that cannot live in society without causing some kind of a stir. All types are studied here and all cases are refused as being the results of some repressed personal sexual drive. It may be the case, but most of the time it is just plain repressed individuals, rejected individualities, refused personalities. They are locked up away from society for this society to go on thinking all its members are beautiful, clever and brilliantly aware of what the future will be and what they have to do to make it come faster. But that is not all. The novel is an allegory too, an allegory of what changing a society may be, of what historical change may mean. The allegory follows a pattern. Change can only come from the rebellion of the victims of the dominant social order, the Combine as Chrief Bromden calls it. This is the typical revolutionary pattern. But Kesey adds the fact that this rebellion of the main victims can only come if some particular person arrives among them and wakes up in them the energies they need to become rebellious, to recapture their freedom from the Combine. The pattern of the Savior, the guru, etc. But this pattern is defeated in a way because the Combine's strategy will be to isolate this leader, victimize him in order to reduce his influence, or even destroy him if necessary, in this case with a good old lobotomy that leaves him a vegetable for everyone to admire in fear and awe. And yet things will fail for the Combine, because in any modern democratic society people are individuals and they use their individual rights to vote with their feet against the Combine. In a word the Combine fails because everyone runs away from it and leves it alone in the battlefield which is no longer a battlefield but a plain empty wasteland. That's how the Combine is forced to accept change and to change. This optimistic ending is contained in the symbolic last scene or episode, that of the self-liberation and escape of the Indian Chief. He finds out and we find out with him that nothing was wrong with him, except that his presence was disruptive for the plans of the Combine that required his village to be bought up and its inhabitants to be scattered and taken care of with good old fire-water. And that is the last level of allegory : the repressed past of a country, people, culture, individual will always finds its way to freedom and regeneration, and then the whole world will have to make do with it. The Combine, the establishment of any society, can always sacrifice some people, leaders or not, on the altar of their established power, sooner or later this established power will crumble under the pushing from those it has repressed and exploited since it took over from another establishment before it. Cyclical instating of one establishment against another and of its falling down in front of a third one. Is there any meaning in these historical cycles ? No one knows and no one can know, though quite too many people pretend to know and have a ball of crystal in the back of their eyes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is phenomenal. The way that Ken Kesey has developed the characters drew me in to the book, and made me eager to see what would happen as the plot developed, I could hardly put it down and was always dying to pick it back up. At times the book is sad, at times hilarious, but all the way through it created a real emotional connection for me. This, in my opinion, is one of the keys to excellent fiction. Another of the keys to excellent fiction is when the reader can read it as a metaphor for larger issues and ideas. This book is packed with themes that question what insanity is, in a world that seems to be insane (another one that would tie in pretty well with this is Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\"). The whole book deals with issues of authourity and control, and the efforts of powerless people to regain control in their lives.I believe this book is based on Ken Kesey's experiences working as a janitor in an asylum or mental health institute. His life and personality are fascinating, he seems to have been an absolutely amazing man. Another amazing book, which is based on Ken Kesey, is \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" by Tom Wolfe... it depicts the adventures of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who drove through America taking loads of acid and giving it to people they met along the way. I would highly recommend \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" to anybody and everybody, and I would also highly recommend not to watch the movie. I couldn't even get through it, and it really is a great example of a movie that does injustice to the book it is based on. If you must watch it, read the book first so that you don't know the story and ruin the experience of reading this excellent book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about a psychiatric hospital in which the ward has total control over the patients. All of the patients, in this story, have the same daily routine and never stir up trouble with Nurse Ratched. But soon everything changes when Randle Patrick McMurphy enters the hospital. He knows that the Nurse isn't as strong and powerful as everyone makes her out to be. He then begins to expose some of the policies of the ward and wants the Nurse to just break and lose her temper. Soon enough, the other men start to look up to McMurphy and notice that they are just as strong.I enjoyed reading this novel and highly recommend it for all types of readers. It is not only an easy read, but also gives great detail on Kesey's experiences with mental patients in the institutions.

Throughout the novel McMurphy tries his hardest to get the best of the nurse. While doing this he forms a very strong bond with all the other men on the ward. They start to look up to him and see him as sort of a savior. He supports the other patients by showing them that they are not as crazy as they believe they are.

The whole beginning was boring and it took a long time for things to actually get moving in the story.

It was only for a few hours for about a week and that was it. That made me mad but overall, I guess the book was decent.

Boy, I am glad to read another book that was inspiration for a wonderful movie. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has been one of the most enjoyable summer reading books to date. Like HOD, there are a few changes between the movie and the book. The most noticeable change is the perspective- it completely changes the way the story is told. The movie looks at the asylum from McMurphy's eyes. But the book peers at this bizarre world from Chief Bromden's perspective. And I have to be honest, I like the ways the book lays it out much better. I am almost finished with the novel, and I can't wait to see where it takes me during the last pages. Hands down, I thoroughly enjoyed this read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Above all, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a brilliantly twisted take the struggle of a hero against the world. The villian, Nurse Ratched, is a perfectly honed tool of the social conspiracy; the hero, McMurphy, is an Atlas of a man with the courage and pride to take on an army; and the narrator, Chief Bromden, is a silent, all seeing, giant of a wise man. Each of them have enough chinks in their armor to keep things interesting, but they are each great stylized heroes that, in another setting could be comic-book super-heroes.The book is also an invictive against conformity - against the machine of post-war US culture taken to grotesque extremes. I suspect that a great many of those extremes were real, and there is a sad reality, if not to the characters, than at least to the mental institution that is the dismal, sterile setting for the book.Ultimately, the comic book high gloss sheen of the battle takes some of the sting out of the societal critique, but its still pretty potent. Kesey is a great eloquent writer, and though this book certainly was both a product of and defining factor in its era, it remains even now, a relevant and gorgeous book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Absolutely loved this book, I was surprised that it's so funny and since it's set in such a strange atmosphere out of nowhere I just found myself laughing out loud (which is unusual for me!).There's amazing atmosphere throughout - at different stages I would find myself with a constant smile on my face at some of the things the patients get up to and at others the feelings of helplessness really come to the fore.The characters are amazing, Kesey really has a skill for dialogue and ... well everything!I'm sure the story has been well enough explained already (hopefully not giving away too much) but basically Chief \\"Broom\\" a patient on the ward for almost 20 years is telling the story of the ward since the admission of McMurphy a gambling hard talking workman who apparently chose the asylum over a work farm. Broom is deaf and dumb and so has some insights into places and things he has overheard that people haven't realised.The story is brilliant and I was quite shocked at some of the developments and some very tragic twists.This is a must-read book, don't miss out!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew Over the Cukcoo's nest is my favorite book. It is the only book that I have read twice, and that is something I would definately recomend with this one. Everthing about this book is perfect. The theme(rebellion), the ending(Even if you figured out part of it), and the charachters are all unequaled in any other books.The story of Randle Patric McMurphy and the the other inmates of the institution is something that will stay with you. After I read the book I was moved.After I read the book the second time I watched the movie. I got pissed. The movie left out and changed some parts that I though were great, for instance much of Cheif Bromden and his schizophrenia. His mental illness and his memories help reinforce the idea of rebelling angainst the cold mechinized society that we live in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There isn't much else that I can put here that other reviews haven't already said. This novel is a true treasure, and deserves it's place among the American classics. However, a word about the edition. I found the print too small and the ink was often smudged on many pages. If you want to buy this book (which you should!), I would shop around for a book with pbigger print and better quality. Besides that, bravo Mr. Kesey!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have never read a book so quick as 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'.I just couldn't stop reading .It is filled with great humour and it drags you into the story.The characters are extraordinary and what i liked most is the struggle between the system and the individual.That is something very realistic because we see it in our every day life.I can recommend this book to everybody and I guarantee you won't get disappointed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is phenomenal. The way that Ken Kesey has developed the characters drew me in to the book, and made me eager to see what would happen as the plot developed, I could hardly put it down and was always dying to pick it back up. At times the book is sad, at times hilarious, but all the way through it created a real emotional connection for me. This, in my opinion, is one of the keys to excellent fiction. Another of the keys to excellent fiction is when the reader can read it as a metaphor for larger issues and ideas. This book is packed with themes that question what insanity is, in a world that seems to be insane (another one that would tie in pretty well with this is Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\"). The whole book deals with issues of authourity and control, and the efforts of powerless people to regain control in their lives.I believe this book is based on Ken Kesey's experiences working as a janitor in an asylum or mental health institute. His life and personality are fascinating, he seems to have been an absolutely amazing man. Another amazing book, which is based on Ken Kesey, is \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" by Tom Wolfe... it depicts the adventures of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who drove through America taking loads of acid and giving it to people they met along the way. I would highly recommend \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" to anybody and everybody, and I would also highly recommend not to watch the movie. I couldn't even get through it, and it really is a great example of a movie that does injustice to the book it is based on. If you must watch it, read the book first so that you don't know the story and ruin the experience of reading this excellent book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was an excellent read and comes strongly recommended by me. It is full of confusing yet attention grabbing twists that will keep you entertained throughout the whole book. The book is about a man named Randle McMurphy who is sent to prison, but is then forwarded to a insane asylum for fighting too much. McMurphy has no complaints over his move, feeling that the hospital will be better than any prison yard. Upon his arrival he opens up immediatly and shows his true colors. He comes into contact with other patients at the hospital and gains their trust as a leader, and so he becomes the leader of the men. On his quest for power he encounters a rather large obstacle, the dictator, Nurse Ratched, who is the head of the ward. After spending several weeks at the hospital he decides he needs to escape and also decided to take one of the other patients with him. After various escape attempts --foiled by Nurse Ratched-- and resulting in the death of a fellow patient, by being over electricuted in the punishment chair. He finally finds one that he thinks will finally work, he gets the chief (another patient) to help him get out one of the windows of the hospital. But then the unthinkable happens and this is where i stop summarizing the book and tell you just to read it your self to find out what happens with McMurphy and the chief. So if you want a good read that tricks your mind and gives a sense of inspiration than this is a book for you to read. Ken Kesey is an excellent author and i would have to say that I found this book to be my favorite of his. So for an excellent read, check out this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall I think this book was alright. The beginning was very boring and kind of confusing. It took a while to get used to the whole 'fog' thing but once I was acccustomed to it the reading became much easier. I think it was very interesting that one man, McMurphy, could crack the toughest person in the ward, Nurse Ratched. I really liked the turn around the men made throughtout the book. They were very helpless in the beginning but once McMurphy showed up, he gave them the courage to stand up for themselves. Bromden made the biggest improvement. Most of the men in the novel had a 'weakness' for overpowering women. I also don't think the fact that the author was on drugs when he wrote the book helped him at all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What a way to bring forth the insanity of the 1960's. Back then mental institutions we're more like state of the art torture dungeons, or at least that's how Kesey saw them as. The characters in the book represent certain aspects of society at that time. Most notable is the relationship between McMurphy and Ratched. Ratched is supposed to represent the majority of society, the government, the buisiness class. McMurphy represents the opponent to those, typically hippies and beatnicks who do not want to conform to society and it's rules. He constantly goes against Ratched and rallies the other patients behind him to reassert themselves as human beings and not just little pawns the Nurse can boss around."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"like the Book of Revelations has done to the New Testament, Kesey's tale is just as important to the counter-cultural events that took place following its publication.I have never read a book like it before or since, and though I likewise love Notion, this is Kesey's true masterpiece.*Hands down Randle P. McMurphy is my favorite character in any book I have ever read and though Nicholson is one of my all-time favorites, even he couldn't come close to touching him."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A novel that celebrates the counterculture and the aspects on the fringes of society, \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a novel that mythologizes the individual (even the dishonest or vulgar individual) over the restraints of society. I have mixed feelings about that message.The battle between being true to oneself and giving into societal expectations is identified here as the battle between one's mind and the \\"Combine\\" as personified by the \\"Big Nurse\\" Ratched. The action takes place in a mental institution where most of the patients have voluntarily committed themselves, a key but often overlooked plot point, somewhere in Oregon in the early 1960s. Keeping in mind the time period is an important consideration in enjoying this text, as the book is extremely misogynistic (only 1 minor female character is presented in a halfway decent light) and the ideas of nonconformity were a much bigger deal in 1962 then they are today. To take the novel out of its original context is to loose some of the enjoyment of reading it. Be careful to not judge it by today's standards.Ken Kesey was obviously a gifted writer, and he has some truly unique ways of crafting a text to resemble the scrambled mind of a person enduring electroshock therapy, and he was a clever user of figurative language. He was also gifted at crafting character, as the text has four (to my mind) that stand above and beyond the book they inhabit. The first is the novel's narrator, Chief Bromden, whose dry and insightful narration has the right mix of intelligence and self doubt to keep the reader on the edge of their toes. Another delightful and well rendered character is the mental ward patient Harding whose intelligence and wit serve as a nice foil to McMurphy's vulgarity and broad humor. Harding is a man who loathes what he truly is, and watching him mask that pain and self awareness is one of the most touching aspects of the novel. The \\"hero\\" and the \\"villain\\" of the piece, R. Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are nice personifications of abstract ideas and Kesey endows each with a depth and realism that is instantly recognizable to anyone who has paid even the remotest attention to human nature. The passive aggressive animosity and unhappiness inherent in Nurse Ratched is unnervingly real, and the chaos and self destructive behavior in McMurphy is equally impressive. The reason I think these two characters stand out to readers is because there are bits of both of them in most of us. The war between those two poles comprises not only the major conflict of this text, but also of many of our lives.There is a lot to digest in this book, and it will yield rewards on rereading it years later. Enter Kesey's world. It might not be a fun journey, but it is a worthwhile one!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A lot of things have been said about Ken Kesey's tale of a ward full of mental patients that runs like clockwork under the leadership of the Big Nurse, Ms. Ratched, but I think the most amazing facet of the tale is the voice of his narrator. Chief Broom is one of the disturbed patients in the ward, and it is through his foggy and sometimes completely irrational eyes that we watch this tale unfold.As a former student of psychology myself, I was continually surprised by how real and multi-faceted each of the characters are, both patients and staff. I think a fun game for freshman psych majors would be to diagnose each of them.Kesey's book is important on a sociological level as well. The Chief's theory that the universal Combine keeps mechanizing people until they all act in a regimented manner is cautionary, and quite relevant to the time period in which his work was written. Kesey himself actively fought against this Combine in his own life along with his band of Merry Pranksters and their antics and acid. It is fitting that his protagonists are rebellious against a stifling microcosm.What makes a person mentally ill? What is the cure? I'm not sure anyone really knows, but Kesey begins by asking the right questions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I love books and have a few by \\"Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century.\\" Very durable and last well throughout the years. Mine was brand new and arrived in perfect condition. Definitely happy :)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Last year in English 3 this was one of the books our teacher listed for our silent reading. I didn't get to read it, but now that a new year has started and considering I have more time on my hands I searched for this in the school library expecting a good read. Now that I'm finished with the book It's safe for me to say I really enjoyed reading this.First off I've never seen the movie of One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, but want to after hearing it praised as being one of the greatest movies to be created. After reading this book I'm REALLY curious now.The story is basically about this crazy, messed up mental asylum run by this evil b**** of a nurse known as Nurse Ratched. She runs this place with a smile, but don't be fooled because shes really a wolf in sheeps clothing. Seriously I think she's got bigger mental issues than the supposingly crazy people shes supposed to be \\"fixing\\" for society. Then comes Randle McMurphy! A big, red-headed, man who faked his insanity so he can avoid serving out his sentence in the hospital. I can guarantee you out of all characters he's the one, most likely, only character you'll love beside Chief Bromden. In all her years of working at the ward the \\"Big Nurse\\" is in for a challenge with this guy. He brings a fun and an rebellous, carefree mentallity into a place thats all about control and order.Everything is described in first-person by Chief Bromden, An half Native American man who fakes being death and I think mute as well. I at first found it strange because hes not the true protagonist, but after awhile I got used to it. Plus later on I grew to really like the Chief and felt he became somewhat of a hero in a way. Its not that often I read books with a first-person narrative by someone other than the protagonist. This actually got very confusing at times though, because in some scenes in the book the Chief is experiencing odd hallucinations brought on by a machine in the ward. On other times the story will suddenly bring up a flash back of his life too. This added to my confusion in some areas because the transition into these flashbacks just felt off.What I really love about this story is that it makes you think. How can you tell if someones sane or insane? Are the methods of helping mental patients really ethical? Is society what makes a person what they are? It brought up many curious questions. After this I really want to check out the movie now. It'll be interesting to see how this was put on film."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book for high school students and above. This book takes place in a mental institution and tells you about the things that go on in there. You will be surprised by what goes on in there and how each character is special. This is kind of an emotional book but if you can take it, then it is a book for you. There is also a movie for this, but is kind of different from the book. However, the book provides more details and is what the author (Ken Kesey) envisioned a metal hospital would be like. Strongly recommended for those who like to read a good book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you've ever wondered why more people don't eschew the crowd and think and act for themselves, than this is the story for you. Giving forth its wealth of ideas over repeated readings, it's message is of boundless importance while ever so creatively told. Salient among its presented ideas is the power of fear, and how crippling it can be to our endeavors. But, what happens when that individual comes along impervious to fear? Why aren't there more such folks???Though the movie of the same name is good, it pales next to the actual novel. One of the masterpieces of the 20th century, it should be near the top of every thinker's reading list. Five full stars!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel was unlike anything I have ever read in the past. The narrator gives a different prospective from inside a 1960's mental institution. Chief Boredman is a veteran at the Oregon clinic. He is the silent eyes and ears of the place. Everyone else believes that he is dumb, blind and deaf,yet he watches everything. The ward is run by a very strict Nurse Ratched. Nobody defies her because of fear of electroshock therapy, which is looked down upon society yet still practiced in the ward. The whole dynamic of the ward changes when a gambling man named Randle McMurphy is admitted. The first rebellion takes place when McMurphy rebels against the television schedule. After this, McMurphy encourages others to follow his lead and rebel against Nurse Ratched. The changes McMurphy makes to some paitents allow them freedom and impendence. In another case, McMurphy damages and drives one patient to a more insane state than before.For the most part I really enjoyed this novel. If I were to write this book I probably would have had a happier ending. Positively thinking, it would have been a better ending if McMurphy and the patients rebelled against Nurse Ratched and won. Also, if McMurphy didn't get drunk and fall asleep the whole plan to escape would have worked out a lot better. This is upsetting and I wish this would have worked out better in the end. I would recommend this book to people interested in psychology. A certain maturity age must also be required to enjoy this novel. This being, kids in high school will definitely appreciate One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. - s.rozycki"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Okay, there's no Cocoa Puffs in here. But there's plenty of cuckoos. This was a really great book, lent to me by a friend. I'd heard of it (and seen the parody of it on the Simpsons) and enjoyed it from page one.This is a interesting look in psychiatric/mental hospital care in the sixties. I cannot help but wonder what would have happened to Chief if he had been put in a mental hospital today - nearly fifty years' difference. It's amazing that at one point in time, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were considered acceptable therapy, but it's good that we don't have that anymore, especially lobotomies - look at what happened to poor Rose Kennedy.Anyone who has spent time in a mental hospital in the last decade would be interested to read this book - they might even consider themselves lucky. The characters in here are well-crafted, and it's hard to not like McMurphy, and it was also cool to see the Chief slowly come out of his shell. The ending is sad in one way and satisfying in another, and this is a definite classic book. Heck, both the book AND the movie that came from it need to be read/viewed. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is a poignant and striking reminder of just how blurry the lines between sanity and insanity can become. Few books are able to allow the readers full access into a man's mind in a way that makes them lose themselves, but this one does so in an achingly simple way. It will leave you with little sense of satisfaction, but with that sensation of wonder and regret that you feel after reading a book that you know may well be one of the best you will ever read. I dare you to read this book without letting it gnaw at your understanding of freedom, or sanity, or yourself. But One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel that you must experience, one you must sit with and absorb, before trying, if you must, to make any concrete sense of it. And we, as readers, must allow ourselves, and our sanity, to be lost as we read. You may just find, as I did, that in doing so you begin to see the sanity in a group of men who are, undoubtedly, insane.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a ward of an Oregon mental institution. The book is narrated by Chief Bromden, a half-Native-American who is so used to being ignored that he allows himself to be mistaken for deaf and dumb for years. The novel tells the story of what happens when the ward, run by the brutal and tyrannical Nurse Ratched, is turned upside-down by the arrival of R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy feigns insanity in order to be transferred from a work farm to the mental institution. Though Bromden is the narrator, the protagonist is clearly McMurphy, whose larger-than-life attitude and refusal to accept society's terms make him something of a celebrity on the ward. His battle against Nurse Ratched and her sadistic staff, puppets of society's machine that Chief Bromden calls the \\"Combine,\\" begins to change the other patients, and, if you let it, just may change you, too.This novel takes you on a journey with a group of men who, though labeled insane by the outside world, are insightful, enlightening, and engaging. In reading it, you will discover a world of sadism, cruelty, and an odd sort of beauty, all through a somewhat jarring juxtaposition of poetic language with the cold, concrete atmosphere of the ward. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel in which the lines between reality and the surreal aren't just blurred - they're not there to begin with. \\"But,\\" Bromden says in the beginning of the novel, \\"it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was very well-written. It was interesting for a story to be narrated from a Bromden, a patient in a mental hospital. I have always been captivated by the workings of the human mind. I also enjoyed the struggle between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy. I did not like the Nurse's oppressiveness. It was comforting to see someone oppose her rule over the hospital."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is wonderfull. In abaut 300 hundert pages are putted together all of the people's feelings. \\"One flew over the cucoo's nest\\" is one of these books, which has liked to all of the generations.

And when it is to the End you sorry, because this book is unique.While you are reading it, you cry, you smile and even you laugh.I liked also the film by the Ken Kesey's novel. Of course that two houers are not enough to render everything in the book, but the actors crowded exellent and with great mastery in their role. Nikolas Cage and the producer Milosh Forman have made their work in a very good way.The book and the film leave a mark in my consciousness."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"a book filled with conflict and and cliff hangers...overall i believe this book is one of my favorite books i've read in school..it's up there with to kill a mockingbird, the catcher and they rye, the giver, and the joy luck club. this book allows you to look into many different perspectives while giving great imagery and allowing yourself to create and picture in your mind. it is filled with surprise, fun and devastating occurences. though it is sort of a difficult book to get through..i believe dedication to reading the book..you will learn to like it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I chose to read this book for my summer assignment in my english class. The title is what was appealing for the list I had to choose from. I begin reading the book, and struggled to put it down. I would recommend this book to everyone! It is very easy reading, and a great book. Ken Kesey did a great job! He has this uncanny way of pulling the reader into the story. I usually struggle when I have to read books for this class, and I have to force myself to read it. I read this one with no problem. AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I read this book in high school, I knew it would be \\"important\\" in my life. I couldn't quite put my finger on what made it so compelling. Twenty years down the line, I understand completely what I liked so much.Kesey wrote this book after having participated as a guinea pig in Veterans Administration studies of psychedelic [chemical substances]. He also worked in a mental hospital and even underwent electric shock treatment, just to see what it was like.As I see it, McMurphy and Bromden are alter egos, both aspects of Kesey. The charming, redheaded, muscleman is quite transparently Kesey. He is an old-fashioned Everyman. In the regimented, industrial world such a man is both a legend and a throwback. There is no way for him to regain his former dominance, though, by his strength or his machismo. He has to go inward and find something else.A key passage is the one in which Bromden notes his surprise at McMurphy's \\"feminine side.\\" The side that paints pictures and writes letters. The part that is other than the mythical Everyman, and that must be awakened fully if a man is to escape the Combine.Bromden, with his hallucinations and fog, is the new Ubermensch, call him Psychedelic Man. His visions are not truly out of touch with reality. They are always symbolic of the spiritual and psychological realities that the earthy Mr. McMurphy can't put his finger on. Once Bromden finds his voice, his escape is inevitable, and so is the [end of life], literal and/or symbolic, of McMurphy.What I found jarring, and what I think dates the book, is the reliance on certain ...types as metaphor -- \\"the frigid woman\\" (Ratched), the wise, inscrutable Indian (Bromden, whose mother is a white \\"Ice Queen\\" who emasculates his father), and the black boys carry much of the message via established ...types.Overall, the book is a rich modern version of the ancient myth of awakening."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In Ken Kesey's, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, there are four very important factors that contribute to the developement of the novel.Setting, flashbacks, ominiscient point of view, and the use of Symbolism. Like always, I feel that setting is very important to a novel. In a lot of cases, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the setting almost takes upon the role of a whole new character. The novel is set in the Pacific Northwest, in a mental institution. The mental institution has a great deal of meaning for it is the backbone of the theme. Kesey, who wrote the book in 1962, tied in a lot of his own experiences and uses, in a sense, flashbacks. Kesey grew up in Oregon and worked with patients in a mental institution. A lot of the narrative is developed from experiences in his life. The most obvious literary device, however, is the use of symbolism. Developed from where the book is set, the mental institution, symbolism is abundant. The most important is the meaning in which Kesey tries to get across. Using the setting, many will agree that he uses the mental institution to symbolize the oppression which is present in modern day society. His main idea, it to get us, the reader, to really question the meaning of sane or insane. Kesey uses the problems of today and ties them into problems that Chief, McMurphy, Billy Bibbit and even Nurse Ratched face in their lives. One thing that I thought was brilliant on Kesey's part was choosing chief as the narrator. Pretending to be deaf and dumb, he has access to information that the other patients do not. This makes him a great narrator. This demonstrates somewhat of an ominiscient point of view. I really enjoyed this novel and I love the Movie. I am sure everyone who has read it found it interesting. If you can understand the four literary devices I described, you will enjoy One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey definitely out did himself in this book.

The multi-layered metaphors, such as man vs. machine, and the intense plot confrontations, such as McMurphy vs. Big Nurse, combine in a brilliantly written novel with omniscient prescence. McMurphy, the gregarious, fiery, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; styled cowboy, is the true hero of the American west; he is forced to confront the evil, machine wielding Big Nurse, in a Christ-like act of equal parts benevolence and selfishness that typifies the All-American struggle between the nature we must tame and monsters we create to do so. It is an excellent book that, if read for depth, is thought provoking, and, if read for simple enjoyment, is entertaining."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I liked this book because it was very different from other books that I have read in the past. My favorite part of the book was the fishing trip. They all became good friends and the all trusted McMurphy after the time they spent on the boat.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest illustrates a modernized battle of good and evil. For centuries, there have been stories of peasants and commoners against tyrannical beasts and monsters, but this story offers a twist of plot and persona.Instead of being the usual fairy tale, this book presents a realistic look at life in a hospital, through the eyes of one of the patients, a \\"chronic\\" Indian named Bromden. \\"Chief\\", as he is called by some of the patients on the ward, does little more than mop and clean and listen to conversation. Bromden hears and knows everything that goes on at the hospital, and even many of the things that none of the patients know, mostly because everyone believes him to be deaf, and will pretty much say anything around him. The main conflict exists between the head nurse, Nurse Ratched, whom the patients call the \\"Big Nurse\\", referring to her size and the intimidation she has over them, and the patients themselves, and a new patient named Randle Patrick McMurphy.From the time he first enters the ward, McMurphy butts heads with the Nurse, trying her patience at every chance he gets. Randle begins to represent the most liberating force that the other patients have ever known, and he finally gives them the strength to stand up for themselves. Soon he comes to the realization that to get out of the hospital, he must conform to the rules instead of breaking them, and in the end he is consumed by the \\"Combine\\" of society, to meet an inevitable fate. At the same time, he ultimately becomes a savior to his \\"followers,\\" the patients on the ward whom he befriended during his sentence.Not only is this book a story of triumph against authority, but also an analyzation of what modern society can do to people. The danger of conformity and need for individuality are both revealed in the story, as well as the pain that can be caused by ignorance, shown by the emotions felt by \\"Chief,\\" and McMurphy as well. They both have underlying emotions not seen by anyone except in a small slip of a facial expression or a bad choice of words, and both work hard to cover it up. McMurphy, especially, wants to keep up a strong front in order to keep the trust of the others, but he is slowly being eaten away by the pressure that is now on him to do this as he attempts to get on the good side of the Big Nurse at a last chance of being released. He desperately wants to get out, unlike many of the others who are there by their own admission.Centered mainly around the actions of the \\"acutes,\\" the book gives a funny and interesting look at the lives of people most of us only hear about. Sometimes, it feels better to get away from the mediocre \\"real world\\" and go to a place where nothing at all is what someone would call \\"normal\\", and this is exactly what the book, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest can do. This book is plausible fiction at it's finest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a good read, and its fun to see everything through the eyes of the chief, but Cucoo's nest is one of my favorite movies, and i prefer watching this then reading it.

WHOOO!!!eveybody should read this book. Especially if you're feeling a little mentally unstable. Trust me, after reading this book you're gonna wish you were living your life surrounded by padded walls!Alright back to a serious level, the character descriptions in this book couldn't possibly get any better. After just a few chapters you'll feel like you actually know these people. It has a great underlying theme which reminds you to be careful what you wish for. The relationship that develops between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched keeps you wanting to read more and see what could possibly happen next.THIS BOOKS AWESOME!! READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about an insane asylum in the mid part of this century. It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief Bromden looks out the window for the first time.I have never read a book dealing with mentally handicap, and it was an eye-opening reading. The idea that the handicaps were treated this way is disheartening, and the thought of continuous poor treatment is overwhelming. Ken Kesey did an exquisite job of portraying the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched for the upper hand - an endless game where the power hungry witch eventually came out on top. Despite his selfless and somewhat blind attempts to obtain equality and respect, McMurphy was perhaps responsible for the saving of at least one life - Bromden's.Over all I see why many people have considered this book to be a classic. With the intriguing thoughts on insane people to the intense detail that Kesey shows though out the book sets a good example of what a classic book should be like."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this book for the first time about 2 months back and was absolutely amazed at how great it is.The characters are a treat, the story is amazing and it just begs to be read again and again. For instance theres a part about halfway through the book where the chief looks out of the window at a dog running across a lawn which is just the greatest piece of writing ever,who would have known that just a dog running across a lawn could be so moving? i took every word of this book to be the work of a genius &lt;even the spelling mistakes&gt;. RIP Ken Kesey. A truly great author."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It scares you to think of the 'treatment' deemed 'auxillary' not even 40 years ago. It scared me just to read about the effects, before I actually became empathic and connected to the marvelous characters... each one unique, lively and different. The writing style of this book is incredible- it paints a picture so vivid you can almost step into it, can almost smell the antiseptic of this damnable institution and feel the hated burn of a hypodermic. A book I would recommend everyone (who is able) should read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest is a spetacular book. It's a powerful, emotional experience that takes place in a mental institution and gives you an insight to the awful lives of the patients there when they have to deal with the awful, manipulative &quot;Big Nurse.&quot; I really don't like &quot;Big Nurse&quot;, at all. The author Ken Kesey had great sucess with this book. He has everyone that reads it, have the same emotions about the characters. The style and tone of this book is excellent. I totally recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I cannot stress enough in words how this book has affected me.

It is a timeless Classic that will be easily read multiple times."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Depicted from the fog of a silent but intentive patient, the story of other cases develop and give insight to the world of the mentally ill. The book brings out the classical, but cliche ideas that things are not always what they seem, the grass IS always greener on the other side, and we are all nucking futs. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest challenges readers to form their own opinions whether or not the patients in the book really need the strict rules of their head authority figure, Nurse Ratched or if they're really insane. It lets readers see the different aspects of different thought processes from different characters. From the crazy and brave personality of McMurphy to the timid but opinionated character of Chief Bromden, we get a sense of who these people are from their actions. I found in the beginning, that the novel was tough to get through, with all of Bromden's hallucinations, but it became an easier and more interesting read later on. Honestly, when I first started reading it, I WANTED to put it down, but now, I find how Kesey writes and formatted the novel is unique and interesting. I didn't take liking to the format or thought processes of the narrator. The characters become more and more intriguing as the book continues. I've realized that I've grown to like the structure better. I'm stuck on whether I like the story or the way it is written.In any case, whether you're a basketcase yourself or as \\"normal\\" as they come, I think most would find this book to be interesting and original. You may not like the topic, but the characters and order of the book may reel you in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Aren't we all insane? To me labeling something as \\"sane\\" is a waste of breath. The entire world and every being in it has same crazy truth hidden by layers of \\"normalcy.\\" We judge those who are insane because we do not want to see the human spirit unmasked. Nurse Ratchet has worked tersely to recover those who have removed society's bindings of normal. I really liked this novel but it was more the ideas that it questioned that I enjoyed than the actual writing.I envy Mac Murphy for his bravery and confidence to challenge authority. I wish I had the audacity to do the same, to pull back my veil and reveal my true insanity. Overall I think this novel deserves praise for its own audacity and ability to challenge literary normalcy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"McMurphy is the new guy in Bromden's ward who comes to save the inmates from the Big Nurse. From the moment he steps into the ward McMurphy is trying to lighten the spirits of the inmates. He starts off small by greeting everyone in the room when he first arrives, but he does not stop there. He continues his crusade by sticking up for individuals in group sessions and by gaining privileges such as the tub room and a basketball team. Why does McMurphy go out of his way to give the inmates a sense of freedom? McMurphy has plenty to lose when he invokes the Big Nurse's wrath. Not only can he be sent to the Disturbed Ward, but he can also receive shock therapy or be sentenced to additional time in the mental institution.The novel is told from the perspective of Bromden, a half Indian patient who pretends to be deaf and dumb. The patients of his ward have slipped away from themselves and into routine. When McMurphy is brought to the mental asylum the Big Nurse's ward is turned inside out. After sometime the patients warm up to this interesting Irishman and their lives are changed forever through their escapades.This is a great novel. I love Kesey's portrayal of the metal ward from the \\"Chief's\\" perspective. Kesey's style allowed me to relate to a group of people that I would normally have trouble identifying myself with. I enjoyed this book completely from cover-to-cover. I am extremely glad I read this novel; I just wish I had done it sooner. I enjoyed the novel so much that I would never consider watching the movie. Although I have heard a great deal about the movie I do not think I would ever watch it. I doubt that any performance could ever do my image of the crazy Irishman and the tall \\"Chief\\" justice."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey sees no good end in sight in the battle of the sexes. This novel, set in a mental ward, depicts a group of powerless and despairing men controlled by a feminine society personified in the domineering figure of Big Nurse. The story's hero, a fast-talking manly man named Randle Patrick McMurphy, whose assertiveness is his sanity, enters this world to liberate the mental patients and restore their lost manhood through such activities as deep sea fishing, substance abuse, and sex with prostitutes. Masculinity in the novel is usually defined in terms of sexual prowess, referred to as \\"whambam.\\" A man's maleness is proportional to his whambam.The mental ward is clearly a microcosm depicting the wider world, in which encroaching technology and bureaucracy succeed in elevating women at the price of men's masculinity, so that the men of the story are left without a place, able to find refuge nowhere but in their own psychoses, which ironically play them into the hands of the System, the Establishment, or as Kesey's narrator calls it, \\"the Combine.\\" This notion of a need for wildness and untamability as a core necessity for men's mental health is a prominent theme in American thinking, derived in part from the concept of \\"frontier,\\" a place of untamed wilderness where men can escape the effeminizing effect of civilization. Since the disappearance of the frontier, this sense of masculinity lost has, in some circles, grown more frantic. Kesey injects his modern myth into this situation and succeeds in producing a dynamic and fascinating, if grim, story.There is little hope for a happy ending. This battle of the sexes, as Kesey depicts it, can end only with the complete emasculation and disempowerment of the male or the humiliation and subjugation of the female. A macabre vision indeed. While the face of menacing authority is consistently female, Kesey appears to cringe on occasion from the full import of his work, producing a few likable female characters and one criticism of the negative way a certain character treats his wife. Nonetheless, these brief sections hardly mitigate the novel's forceful theme. No notion is ever suggested of male/female cooperation, let alone equality.It is evident that this book has resonated with a surprising number of readers, given its distinct anti-feminist tone. Undoubtedly this is the result of Kesey's masterful prose, his provocative ideas, his endearing characters, and his superb blend of comedy and tragedy. This is an enduring work, and a thoughtful one, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As many, I learned first of this story thru the excellent Milos Forman movie. My dad had the book at home so I decided to read it. I was on my early teens and I still remember it like it was yesterday. It stirs a lot of emotions and makes you think on the way our society deals with mental illness.I have read it again now twenty years later and the feelings and emotions are still there.Timeless."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As is usually the case when I see a movie before I read the book, I couldn't help but picture Jack Nicholson when I read about Randle Patrick McMurphy. Considering how good the movie is, though, this isn't a bad thing. My only complaint about this book is that I didn't read it sooner. Hilarious, touching, infuriating, and haunting, this is the complete novel. Although the story is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden, a supposedly deaf and dumb half-Native America mental patient at an asylum in Oregon, this is really the story about McMurphy and how he changes the lives of the patients around him as he competes in a game of wit and will with Nurse Ratched. It's a classic clash between authority and rebellion, structure and whimsy, and mindless traditionalism and common sense. What's most amazing is that Kesey has created a handful of unforgettable characters in this one story, but has balanced them so well that they serve as perfect complements for each other's idiosyncrasies, and none of them overshadows the others. I loved every page of this book. It makes my top ten. I'd give it seven stars out of five if I could."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In the beginning, I didn't like this book.It made the work of psychiatrists look like horror, rather than help. However, once I was able to get passed the miscalcuations of what psychiatrists did in the book, I really enjoyed it. I especially liked the end, but I won't give anything away! It is a delightful commentary on some different philosophies of life. It also made me want to make a difference in the world, the way McMurphy made a difference for those men."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of a man, R. P. McMurphy. He has the choice of going to jail, or an asylum. He chooses the asylum. While inside he sees the horror of the institution, and it's leader Nurse Rached.I was originally apprehensive about reading this book, because I had seen the movie before. The reason I made the decision to go forward and read this novel, was due to the change of prospective from the movie to the book. The movie is told from the third person, while the book is told from the perspective of the Indian Chief. This difference adds a great amount of depth to the novel, that the movie doesn't have.While the movie is a classic, so is the book. What makes it worth reading for fans of the movie, is the elements of the plot that Ken Kasey put in the book, that unfortunately are not in the movie. due to these differences, I highly recommend reading this book for the changed perspective that it casts on the movie. It makes the movie so much better."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was a very interesting read. Never giving much thought to the way mental health hospitals worked myself, I found it very eye opening to see just how wrong one could go. Yes I know the book is fiction, but it was very believable. MY favorite character was Randal McMurphy. \\"Is he really insane? Or is he just faking it to get out of the work camp and to make some quick money off these crazies?\\" You won't find out until the end if his intensions are noble or not. I really loved this book. The men on the ward break free from the over powering Nurse Ratchet and McMurphy leads the way. The book is never boring. The Patients are constantly testing the Nurses patients and control."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I chose this book to read as my selection for this section of four weeks around. My Teacher, Mr. Hoest was impressed that I would choose such a strong book as this. If I had not ever seen the movie, I think I too would have gone for something easy. This book was very,... different compared to most books.The Plot was interesting because of how it started off and caught you off guard beginning with the Chief just cleaning. Then, it slowly edged into McMurphy becoming the new patient and what the Cheif thought of him. I originally thought it was in the view of McMurphy (Because the Movie was like that, I believe?), but it was in the view of the Chief and that was different to me. I just assumed it was in the view of him I guess. I figured it was him talking about his experiences with someone but it wasn't. My favorite character was definatly Harding. I didn't think he even belonged in that insitution. He was the odd Acute out to me. The Big Nurse was a good \\"Antagonist\\" because she was the head on the ward and I was glad that eventually McMurphy could teach them to stand up for what they thought was right instead of always backing down in fear of the Shock Shop or getting moved to the Disturbed Ward. I did however have to read some parts over to understand them. But that's not at the fault of Ken Kensey. I am a bit young to be reading something like this. I loved the book, and I'm sure that I read it over again when I'm older."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was one of those books u read every 5 years or so .

It was quite different than the film interpretation, and a vision of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy kept creeping into my head as I read the book! Overall, I felt Kesey's novel had really original take on mental health and institutionalization. I liked that it was told from the point of view of the Chief (one of the patients)...seemed very authentic. Although it was gritty and the ending was hard-to-take, I really was impressed by this novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's classic tale of the last days of archaic mental health care and treatment, is told from the point of view of a patient. The Chief had been confined mostly because he was a mis-unnderstood Native American. Previously he had shown the ability to attend university and do technical work in the service, but now he was pretending to be deaf. Eventually he gets his self confidence back, taking matters into his own hands in the final scene.The chief and 20 others live in a state hospital under the tyranical rule of Nurse Ratched. All is thoroughly controlled and dominated by the nurse and her rules until a ruly Irish laborer named McMurphy shows up. McMurphy's plan of attack is to take on the nurse and liven things up by introducing fishing, fighting, gambling, drinking, and basketball to the ward. The fishing trip is one of the greatest scenes in modern American literature. Everyone contributes to his abilities and the trip is an incredible success for our gang of misfits.Eventually McMurphy realizes that he can not beat the nurse, she has the power to control his destiny. As his violent streak becomes more uncontrollable, McMurphy is subjected to the horrors of 1960's mental health treatment, to his ultimate demise."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"People sometimes pity Kesey for having been a one-hit-wonder. This first book of his is a masterpiece. And the rest? Basically forgettable. I labored throughSometimes a Great Notion (Penguin Classics)and beganSailor Song, but neither really worked for me. But this book is a real work of art--a sensational creation from start to finish. It is undoubtedly one of the best novels of the 20th century. The characters are memorable, the world is vivid, the themes are elegant. Kesey evokes a great struggle between freedom and bureaucracy, between the individual and dogma. You might expect that the treatment is obvious or heavy-handed, but there it is done with skill and care. (And, if anything, it softens the often scandalous treatment of the institutionalized mentally ill.)But there is more: there is Kesey's fantastic penetration of madness itself. He peels back the rational mind that keeps most of us sane and gently lowers us into the confusion of schizophrenia. The powerful interplay of characters, the surprising endings, and the moral struggles give this novel strong engines which carry the reader through the story and continue to motor in the mind, long after the book has been put down."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The author takes you on a journey through psychosis, but the narrative is still coherent to the reader. The tale is told from the perspective of a Native American fellow that is hospitalized. Although his sanity is slightly compromised, he is still real sharp and views things objectively. He witnesses another patient spiral out of control, and that is what the story focuses on. It's absolutely brilliant, and one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A truly rare thing. A much heralded classic of modern literature that lives up to its promise and hype. The plot is outlined in multiple reviews, so, as usual, I will skip that, and focus on what was done right (a lot), what was done wrong (a little), and what it all means.The book was a well-written character study on the part of almost all of the characters. This is one of the widely regarded aspects of the book that holds water. Nurse Ratched, (Nurse Wretched, perhaps?) the totalitarian commander of the insane asylum where R.P. McMurphy finds himself, has widely been portrayed as a figure of evil, or at least one of obedience to the law because it IS the law. Never in the work, suspiciously, are we given the opportunity to question whether Ms. Ratched truly doesn't have the patient's interests at heart. Instead, we are treated to innuendo about her obsessive need for control and order, perhaps leading some to question the sanity of Ms. Ratched. Regardless of the truth, it is a welcome question, offering a depth of thought not common in heralded classics, in my view.McMurphy, naturally, was the most interesting character in the book, by turn pensive or outrageous, obedient or mischievous. Our much beloved anti-hero, who can stand up to the grinding forces of the corrupt mental health institution and remain himself. But is he? At several points, \\"Chief\\" Bromden, our unreliable narrator, points to the haunted and hunted look in the eyes of our protagonist, wondering if, perhaps, he is tiring of the fight.Perhaps. Or perhaps our illustrious mischief-maker, our perpetual Loki, has not the heart for making mischief. Perhaps our dear Mr. McMurphy actually wishes merely to conform. At several points, the statements of the anarchist seem to suggest that he feels himself something of a figure of destiny, like Achilles in the movie version of Troy. Perhaps, just perhaps, his fate is NOT his own to make, nor that of the grinding Combine. Perhaps it is rather in the hands of his fellow inmates. McMurphy gives himself freely in a futile chase to remind them that they are men. In return, they take from him everything that he has. Not to speculate too wildly, but perhaps there is something a bit messianic about the book, where an uncontrolled man comes into the midst of the community, bucks the authority, teaches the people that they are human beings with dignity, and ends up giving everything for the people he has adopted.At the end, one must wonder what would have become of Our Protagonist if, perhaps, he had found himself in a more supportive clime, perhaps under the control of the nurse from Disturbed. Or perhaps even better, if he had found himself in a formless place without outside influence to worsen him. He might have become anything, and he might not have burned himself up, approximating the candle that they needed him to become, leading the way through the darkness, back to humanity, back to manhood, back to grace?The other characters are all interesting as well, including Harding, whose alluded to homosexuality, Billy Bibbit's social avoidance disorder due to his mother's reverse Oedipal complex, and Sefelt and Fredrickson's epilepsy has led to their voluntary commission to the ward. These characters, more than anything discussed in their treatment, tell a sad and compelling tale of the state of mental disease in the 1960's. These people don't need ECT or a lobotomy. They need help, and they certainly don't get it here.There was very little done wrong in this book. Perhaps the most grievous thing was the treatment of \\"Chief\\" Bromden's paranoid schizophrenia. At many times in the novel, it became necessary for me to simply go, \\"All right. We get that Bromden is an unreliable narrator, and that he is hallucinatory. The hallucinations, as a matter of fact, do little but detract from the remainder of the novel. It is fine for the character to be unreliable. He is in a mental institution, so we probably ought not take everything he says or thinks at face value. Nevertheless, the utter lack of realistic symptomology for this character detracts from his otherwise compelling impact.This was a truly good book, and I will return to it again and again. The search for meaning and for leadership here, for a sense of self in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform, and R. P. McMurphy's final act of heroic surrender, all make this a book worth reading for anyone who is interested in what makes us who we are.B+Harkius"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While reading the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest written by Ken Kesey, I was drawn in by the writer's unusual point of view. Through the voice of Chief Bromden, a mental patient in an asylum, the story tells of harsh treatment and the blurred line of what is sane and insane in this life. The character R. P. McMurphy enters the scene, changing and questioning all limits and preconceived notions of how things work in the world. He represents hope, and how it can change any situation, even one of suppression and evil.The story starts off on a usual day in the asylum. The Big Nurse is introduced. She is a harsh, stern woman who sets the clockwork of the unit ticking seamlessly. There is no escape from the dull life of the patients. That is, until R. P. McMurphy enters. He is clearly sane, but in this setting he sticks out, making you question what exactly is sane and insane. Throughout the story he gives and gives to his fellow patients, restoring them with some degree of dignity and respect for themselves. The Big Nurse questions his motives, and along with the scene, she sees him as malicious and conniving. Yet, the patients, ranging from Chief Bromden, the paranoid and hallucinating Native American, to Dale Harding, a former college-graduate, grow to love Randle McMurphy. As the two forces, freedom and restriction, collide with each other over and over again, the story takes a turn for the dramatic, climactic events that harrow your soul and hook you into the story.Personally, I loved this book. It was not an easy, light read by any means, but it is among the classics with its ability to change your view on life. In the beginning, the facts of the patients' lives are so harsh and sobering, it was hard for me to push on and continue reading. But with the help of Randle McMurphy, I was intrigued by the course of events that played out with the new character. Though it has many adult themes, I believe that, as a teenager myself, many other teens would like this book who are interested in reading different books besides the clich&eacute; teen love story. The book questions authority. What is organization and where does the control start to become ultimate power that does not benefit the lowly? Where do scientific procedures and inhumanity separate? This book does have light moments however. The characters are so faulted that they seem seamless. The internal view of their quirks and misgivings makes you realize that they are not so very different from you and with this realization, you stop seeing them as separate individuals from your life, and they start to represent a whole. And with this change of mind, you see them as human and what is being done to them as inhuman and brutal. You start to care for the characters you once saw as \\"freaks.\\"The book is powerful, giving you an intimate look at others and yourself. It is moving in a way that I have not seen before and the connection that develops between you and the characters will surprise you in the end."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"okay ... I haven't read this book since high school, about 5 years ago. I remember enjoying reading the parts where the cheif is having his psychotic breaks. There was one passage where he's cleaning a wall and imagining that he's whiping sludge and slime off of it. I've never tried getting baked and writing down everything that comes into my head ... but if I did, I'm sure it would be interesting to read later. This book was like getting an inside glimpse of what it's like to be insane. I thought it was awsome and would love to read it again. I'm sure it'll bring up bad memories of homework and worksheets but I'll give it a try. Like I said, I haven't read it in a while so I don't remember what the underlying theme is. I do remember relaing to the patients and the way they viewed the staff, like they were otherworldly or something. If you think my review is stupid it's cool ... I'm no intellectual but I did appreciate this particular book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this classic novel. It really opens your eyes to that specific time period and to the world in general. \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" reminded me of \\"Brave New World\\" by Audulous Huxley because of the fact that everyone is different and if you don't fit into that mold, you are taken out of view, so to speak; and made to be better or \\"normal\\".You can't help but fall in love with McMurphy. He is a character who has so much spirit and life. He brought that to the other ward members. This story is one that everyone should read because it makes sad, happy,and angry.Mrs.Ratchard was a horrible person. I watched the movie shortly after reading the book and she's not portrayed the same way. In the book it's easier to envision her. She is an egregious woman, purposefully controlling the men and their masculinity. \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is all about that, women controlling men's masculinity, demeaning them.McMurphy befriends all of the ward patients but he pays attention to one in particular;Chief Bromden, a gigantic Columbia indian man who is thought to be deaf and mute. No one pays any attention to him especially the nurses. Chief really knows what's going on around the ward.Not only do you get to know Chief, you also get to know Harding, a man who voluntarliy committed himself, Billy Bibbitt; a stuttering 30-year-old man who looks like a young boy, Cheswick; a overally sensitive guy, etc.I highly recommend this novel. Its truly enlightning. You enjoy the characters, happy when they are happy, upset when they are upset, and so forth."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The story is told through the eyes of Chief Bromden, (a six foot seven big Indian) who has everyone fooled that he is deaf and dumb. He is trusted by the doctors and nurses, since, he doesn't pose a threat of telling anything he over hears,on them. Bromden tells of the orange-red haired man named Mc Murphy, who comes into the patients world and lifts them out of a fog. He brings hope and laughter back into their worlds of constant routine. Nurse Ratchet, is a menace to the mental ward. She controls everything that you may do and even say. Bromden and the other patients are terrified of her. McMurphy changes the patients views of Nurse Ratchet, they begin to see her as no threat to them. When McMurphy sneaks Candy ( the prostitute) in for his friend Billy, they get caught. Thats when everything hits the fan.She does the most inhuman thing to McMurphy. There is no happy ending to this story. But does leave you with a knot of pain."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest depicts a certain Native American's (Indian's) last months as a patient in a west coast mental hospital, sometime during the late 1950's to early 1960's. Kesey's first person narration and life-size characters highly intensify both the absurdity and the validity of human existence, making this novel a classic.Chief (\\"Broom\\") Bromden's narration permits the reader to view through his eyes the horrors of the ward that the Big Nurse (Ratched) and her black boys control with such precise efficiency. The Chief introduces the reader to the other Acutes and Chronics - and to a new Admission by the name of McMurphy. The reader knows, just when Chief Broom does, that McMurphy is quite different from the other patients on the ward; McMurphy's presumptuous style makes it impossible for him to be classified as either Acute or Chronic - or insane, for that matter. Because Chief Broom has remained silent for so long, everyone considers him deaf and dumb; but it is through him that the conversations of staff personnel are heard and interpreted. The reader quickly acquires an understanding of the patients' fear of the Big Nurse and of those around them. The Chief's perception of McMurphy and his knowledge of this ward are far greater than that of any other, effectively giving the novel a limited and, therefore, ultimately powerful perspective.Kesey's characters are superb conceptions of real living beings. Most of the patients develop from timid \\"rabbits of the rabbit world\\" to stronger, self-assured humans who realize that they can take charge of their own destiny. The most notable of these are the giant Chief \\"Broom\\" Bromden (a Chronic) and the Acutes Harding and Bibbit. Having been huddled within himself for years, Bromden evolves from a fearful, silent broom-pusher into a man who feels as big inside as he is physically. Harding, ashamed of his own feminine mannerisms and sexual preferences, develops into a clear-headed, intelligent individual and eventually leaves the hospital with his wife. Bibbit matures from a stuttering, thirty-something year old child into a happy, giggling adult - or, at least, almost. The exceptions are Big Nurse and McMurphy. Both display an iron-core strength; both manipulate the other characters to their own advantage; both pit themselves against each other; and both are inevitably broken. It is this conflict between the two strong characters that allows the weaker characters to find strength in themselves.Both Chief Broom's interpretations and the characters in the ward magnify the novel's powerful emotional charge. The Chief sees the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched as something bigger - something a man can't ever win, something a man's got to keep fighting - but he doesn't ever state exactly what that something is. However, he realizes that control of one's life lies within the self and that as long as a person keeps laughing, keeps smiling, then just maybe that something can't win either. Bromden realizes that for all its absurdities, life is essentially good. While he finally states he has \\"been away a long time\\" in the context of his childhood home, the reader gains the impression that it is really life he is returning to.Kesey's novel, although dealing by an extreme with the insane, gives all human life a resounding stamp of worth and value. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest keeps the reader on an emotional pendulum: laughing at McMurphy's pranks, recoiling from Nurse Ratched, strengthened by McMurphy's courage, defeated by the patients' helplessness, and cheering for their victories. It appears that for Kesey, a person without a spirit is just a blank, empty shelll. His regard for meaningful life stands strong and clear."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I love this book. I think it is absolutely genius. It just...I can't describe it. There is no other way to explain how I feel about this book.Just to add, the Penguin \\"Great Books of the Century\\" edition is the best to get. Not only does it have a beautiful (shiny) cover with an illustration of Chief Bromden, it is a sturdy and light copy. Plus the text is well spaced (unlike the mass market edition; the text in that edition hurts my eyes, it's so small and cramped). A great edition to keep of a great book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"After being told by one person after another that Ken Kessey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a terrific book, I decided to read it for myself. The first several pages of the novel started off a little slow because I was unsure of where the novel was going, but very shortly after I found myself becoming more interested and attached to the novel. Furthermore, towards the end of the book, I found myself feeling like I knew the characters and felt almost a bond with the character McMurphy, as well as some of the other characters.The novel begins with the main character, McMurphy, who has moved from a prison to a mental hospital. The reasons for him coming to the mental hospital have nothing to do with him being insane, but rather that he is trying to escape the terrible prison work farm that he was in before. Upon arriving to the mental hospital, McMurphy learns about Nurse Ratched who uses force, lobotomy, and \\"electroshock therapy\\" to control the patients. Because Nurse Ratched is an evil lady, the patients of the institution do not speak out against her because they are scared of the power that she carries, the power that she has to hurt them, and the fear that they carry about not being in conformity with all of the other patients. The novel continues to show McMurphy's desire to disobey Nurse Ratched's authoritarian control as there are several incidents that occur while he is staying there that jeopardizes his life, and ultimately ends up jeopardizing his friends life. During his stay at the institution, McMurphy meets many friends, and teaches some of them how to stand up against the evil nurse and how to show their own individuality. Throughout the novel many people, including some of the guards, begin looking up to McMurphy and the way he never becomes submissive to Nurse Ratched's control. The novel keeps the reader intact at all times, with an urge of following McMurphy's every move. The main themes of the novel deal with ones freedom, as well as, the power that conformity has on taking over a person's life.Ken Kessey's style of writing is remarkable. Although the novel is sometimes difficult to read and has many underlying themes and messages about mankind (that can sometimes get confusing), Kessey's writing is beautiful and allows the reader to enjoy the book to its full extent. Also, the book teaches a great deal about human nature and the way that mankind acts in specific situations. I highly recommend this novel to others, for its strong impact that it had on me and in addition, the way that it made me think about the issue of conformity and freedom. In the beginning, I could not seem to understand why many people recommended this novel but after reading it, I just want to tell everyone about it so that they can have the pleasure of reading it, and hopefully have a similar experience to the one I had."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I enjoyed \\"One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" because of its ability to address critical issues in society that deserve to be contemplated. One central idea is freedom vs. confinement. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are the two central characters of the novel. McMurphy represents individuality in the asylum. He does what he pleases no matter what society thinks. Ratched could represent efficiency, order and control at all costs. The fear of Nurse Ratched's control makes the patients easy victims of her rule. These patients chose to give up their freedom to be in the asylum because they are not able to cope with the problems and pressures of society. It turns out that the asylum isn't much better than the outside world. There is an enforcement of strict compliance to accepting authority.Another issue that the novel addresses is power vs. authority. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched choose to display their power on the patients in different ways. McMurphy treats his fellow inmates as equals. He accepts them for what they are and offers chances for them to forget their problems. A McMurphy act on his conscience by doing what he thinks is right. He is a metaphorical 'Jesus character.' Nurse Ratched uses her power in physical discipline and control. The other weapons that she uses are the therapy treatments. They are run like 'medieval torture sessions.' The men break down with the continuous onslaught of questions by their peers. She is able to torment and humiliate the men in this way. McMurphy represents a thorn in Ratched's side. Authority (Ratched) ultimately prevailed in the end. The shock treatments and lobotomy on RPM show the extent of what Ratched will do to maintain her control on the ward. One cannot win when they battle the system.The final issue that the novel addresses is individuality vs. conformity. Most of the men have not lost their minds. They may have lost their way sometime in their lives. Their placement in the asylum worsened their problems. Most of the ward members questioned themselves so much that it caused them to lose confidence. This is a result of their problems and the asylum. RPM is a challenge to the system because he demonstrates individuality, courage and determination. Society has labeled the mental patients as rejects. Ratched's obsession with following the rules can also be considered an illness.If you enjoyed the novel, be sure to check out the Oscar nominated 1975 film adaptation directed by Milos Forman. Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher give Oscar winning performances as Robert Patrick Murphy and Ms. Ratched."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a novel displaying pure linguistic genius reflecting on the thoughts of the author, Ken Kesey. His views portrayed in the novel were a direct result of the era of which it was written. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest was written in a time when the world was questioning the authority of governments and felt quite trapped by the idea that life was so easy to rule and could be thrown around however the forces that be pleased to do. Kesey's crusade for mental and spiritual freedom is metaphorically identified in the novel to his exact lifestyle and views of society. The novel is written in a mental hospital from the view of a mental patient named Chief Bromden. The chief is a veteran of World War II and plays himself off as deaf and dumb. The patients mainly keep to themselves and do not expose their views on society and the ward itself. Nurse Ratchet is the head nurse and symbolizes all authority and government. She is the sole reason that no one in the hospital speaks their mind and are somewhat trapped. One day a stought young buck named R.P. McMurphy walked into the ward off the street looking for an easy way out of a conviction for battery charges. As soon as he walks into the ward everything changes. His charisma and energy transforms the mental ward from what might as well been a graveyard into a ruckus of mixed opinions and outbursts towards the authority of the combine. Before McMurphy came to the ward, the patients were to scarred to speak out in fear that they would be punished. When McMurphy arrived at the ward his ways of defiance and playful conduct baffled the nurse and changed the wards view of authority. As the combine becomes more and more intolerant of McMurphy, Nurse Ratchet gives McMurphy a frontal lobotomy and shows the combine just how in control she is. The novel is a magnificent display of society shrunken into a small example. There are hero's and villains and the general population. The book is a fine display of 20th century literature and in my opinion taught all over the nation. To me One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest symbolized the fight between an under-powered hero and his people against one sole villain and her power of controlling the combine. This novel is quite good but very hard to interpret. It takes a huge amount of analogy and without it would not be close as magnificent. Prior to reading this book set aside some time so that you can fully understand it. I strongly recommend this book for everyone to read and also strongly recommend that everybody see the movie as well. Whatever you do, do not rush read this book. Parts may even have to be read two or three times until fully understood, Even though a bit hard to understand to a younger audience the material is basic just the linguistics complex."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"not only is this book emotionally competent, the compelling storytelling, likable characters and kesey's delightful sense of humor keep this one far from the &quot;typical drug induced, anti-establishment 1960's paranoid novel.&quot; i may also note that it is neither paranoid, nor drug induced! Careful reading will reveal that this book is not centered around male chauvinism! To understand this, you mustn't glance over McMurphy's discovery that it was not solely Nurse Ratched who was responsible for their malcontent, rather the enitire institution and &quot;treatment&quot; of the &quot;mentally ill&quot;! Other tips: When reading, do not focus around petty vibes you may pick up. You don't have to agree with McMurphy's lifestyle or egotistical ways, but empathizing with what he ultimately stands for (which may be difficult for some) is vital for the full comprehension of this book. hopefully, all of the english AP classes in the world will conduct valid discussions on the book for the sake of mistaken students who missed kesey's profound message. Let me rephrase the advice of a previous reviewer: &quot;if you often misinterprete and delude yourself from the themes of novels, don't read it.&quot; it will be two years before i am old enough to take an AP class! heesh. i can definitely imagine Ratched presiding over a vast communist empire!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found this book so intriguing from the moment I picked it up. It held my attention from beginning to end. Although I found some of it hilarious, other parts completely shocked me. The ESt given to Mcmurphy and other patients, the pure hypocrisy of the treatment of the so called &quot;insane&quot;. This book not only tells the plot from the eyes of a so called lunatic, but makes the reader wonder how insanity can possibly be defined. Who's to say that one man is any crazier than the next. The paradox of giving a man EST so he is a brainless vegetable, just so he no longer exemplifies characteristics that society deams &quot;not normal behaivor&quot; was very frightening. The end shocked me, but was very fitting to the novel. Kesey is an amazing writer who has sustained the test of time. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a laugh and needing some intellectual stimulation"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The story is famous--a sociopathic prisoner fakes his way into a psychiatric hospital, and galvanizes the mild, oppressed patients, empowering them against the controlling head nurse. The book is sometimes seen as a stirring fable of human individuality triumphing over over stultifying conformity. But despite the engaging plot, the book relies on its share of cliches. The book almost romanticizes sociopathy and rebellion, casting the non-conforming protagonist McMurphy as a martyr. In real life, when a sociopath like McMurphy does enter a psychiatric unit to avoid a prison term, the results are quite different. These individuals exploit the mild mannered or more dependent patients, disrupt routines, raise the stress level by their manipulations, con the staff for medication, and take enormous resources away from patients who are there to get better rather than there to avoid incarceration in a prison. They can also be quite charming, and others (such as Kesey) may be prone to romanticize the type, and indeed media tends to find a prurient interest in the bad boy. Despite its intellectual problems, the book can be praised as being part of the movement to humanize psychiatry. Read today, though, the underlying ideas seem less sophisticated than that of a TV movie. It is more entertaining than insightful.

The print job is sadly lacking with it's variations in the ink from dark to light, poor paper quality, and tiny jammed together font size. My fingers smeared the ink while I was trying to hold the little book open. Better to find this at a used book sale or yard sale."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am generally a fan of anti-establishment books such as Catcher in the Rye and Catch-22. Despite the fact that I really enjoyed the movie, I did not enjoy the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At times, I felt Kesey's writing was long-winded and verbose.The plot uses a mental hosptial and its megalomanical nurse as a metaphor for an overbearing government and sociey's attempt to control people. I also am curious if the theme of male versus female was premeditated. Is Kesey trying to suggest men are controlled/dominated by women? Unlike the movie, the book is told through the eyes of the Chief. While this perspective gives the story a different perspective, I had to force myself to continue. It seems as though a lot of the book should have ended up on the editing room floor. Pages at a time had nothing to say but continued elaboration.I must admit, my concept of the book is largely influenced by the movie. Despite modest differences in appearance, I could not help but picture Jack Nicholson as McMurphy. It stands as one of Jack's best performances.Kesey Has certainly written an influential and entertaining book. However, this is one case where the movie is better than the book. The pacing and tone difference between the two is like night and day. After reading it, I am surprised that this book is often required high school reading. I seems to be a poor choice to exemplify non-conformist thinking."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is Chief Bromden's journey of self- awareness as he transforms from chronic mental illness to freedom and self-emancipation. His lessons on the psychiatric ward parallel his childhood experiences of having the white man coerce the Columbian Indians out of their land. Chief narrates while Randle McMurphy transcends the hegemony of the combine by introducing outrage, empowerment and purpose to the lives of the mental patients on the ward. McMurphy is a charismatic leader who becomes the \\"bull-goose looney\\" of the ward through his personal magnetism and moxie.One lesson of the book is that behaviors of the oppressed contribute to their own dominance. By wanting to remain safe and anonymous, the inpatients retreat like \\"rabbits\\" into the fog (anonymity). The ward is sterile of humanity with the daily activities specifically regulated to confront the patient with the futility of life. Nurse Rachted demonstrates the power to make things worse, so why risk emancipatory efforts? However, through McMurphy, the inpatients discover that it is not society or even Nurse Ratched that makes them crazy. As Harding states \\"though I used to think at one time, a few years ago, my turtleneck years, that society's chastising was the sole force that drove one along the road to crazy, but you've caused me to re-appraise my theory. There's something else that drives people ... down the road...It is us.\\"Part 4 is largely allegorical. McMurphy is portrayed as a Christ figure, sent to the ward for the sins of others, sent as a man to be slaughtered like a lamb for the sins of all men. According to Chief, \\"McMurphy was a giant come out of the sky to save us from the combine...\\" who \\"...doled out his life for us to live...\\" When going through his shock treatments, he was given the choice (temptation) that if he rebuked himself and he would be set free. However, McMurphy chose to sacrifice himself for the others and set them free.One aspect of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that may be an abomination to the feminist movement was the presentation of the climate on the ward as being a matriarchy of repressed sexual libido. Apparently, for Kesey, emancipation entails full expression of sexuality including socially condemned activities such as pornography, rape and prostitution. Many of the men's mental illnesses were deeply rooted in ineffective relationships with women that were exasperated by Nurse Ratched's castrating group therapy sessions. Apparently, for Kesey, the liberation of society comes at the cost of women's liberation."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of the residents and staff of a mental ward, centered around the power struggle between McMurphy, the new, sane patient, and the dictatorial Big Nurse.The novel is written in the present tense, which is often problematic, but here it works well enough. The use of Chief Bromden as the narrator is problematic at times, and the reader may find himself repeatedly skimming or skipping entire pages of mentally-unbalanced monologues. The end of the novel seems rushed, and as a result the impacts of many of the novel's climactic events are diminished.All in all, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is an interesting read.

I never read the book because, well... I'd already seen the movie. But the book was highly regarded and since I hadn't seen the movie in at least 20 years, I thought it was time to read Kesey's novel.Ironically, reading the novel has ruined the movie for me.After reading the novel, I felt compelled to re-watch the movie and was surprised to find how superficial it seemed to me. Kesey was not happy with the movie version of his novel (despite all those Oscars). I had never understood why, until now. The very essence of Kesey's characters were gutted by the movie (not just their physical appearance but the very core of who the characters are and what they represent). Nicholson's performance, which seemed like a tour de force before, now seems superficial to me.The novel is written from the perspective of one of the patients (the Chief) who everyone on the ward believes is deaf and dumb. The Chief is essentially a \`fly on the wall', observing all that happens, virtually unnoticed (at least initially). His tenacious grasp on reality (his hallucinations and paranoid delusions may be the result of drugs he is forced to take, mental illness, or a combination of both) provides a fascinating perspective and allows Kesey to use the Chief's altered sense of reality as a source for much of symbolism in the novel.The movie may be good (possibly even great), but the novel is much richer, more complex and profoundly tragic. R.P. McMurphy is the ultimate doomed rebel. This is one of the best novels of the 20th Century (despite its inexplicable omission from Modern Library's \`Best 100 Novels of the 20th Century')."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a worthwhile read because the characters and the ending are so terrific. When you read about the conflict between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy, you can just FEEL the tension between them as if you were one of the patients sitting in the dayroom. I think Nurse Ratched is described incorrectly, though. I don't find her cruel so much as ignorant and inhumane. She doesn't go out of the way to torture the patients or anything, but as a nurse (one who helps and tries to cure patients) she doesn't treat the patients, or consider them as human beings at all. To her, they are just walking disease, no personalities or desires, just \\"sick loonies.\\" McMurphy, although clearly a simple hooligan and not a mental patient, may be an instigator, but he sees that these \\"patients\\" are more than their diseases. They are men just as those out in the street, but emasculated by an ogre. He is regarded so highly because he put the \\"men\\" back in the men, which Kesey's definition of manhood is boozing and womanizing. He shows the patients that they aren't as sick as they may be told to think and that they have what it takes to be out in the real world. Even though the book came off, to me, as a tad misogynistic (the women in this book are either soul-suckers, i.e. Nurse Ratched, Harding's wife... or are loose floozys), the David/Goliath struggle in this book is fantastic and the ending is the icing on the cake. Great book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey provides a powerful, humorous, and entertaining tale about life in an insane asylum, circa 1960. Although the inmates certainly have non-trivial mental issues, it is the authoritarian rule of the hospital and its matriarchy that proves the most damaging to their psyche. The ruler of the inmates, per se, is Nurse Ratched (the \\"Big Nurse\\"), who proves herself to be a controlling, conniving figure who uses a divide and conquer technique to assert her authority at all costs. She uses shame, guilt, and unbridled fear to keep her inmates in line, not to mention the antiquated \\"treatments\\" of electroshock and lobotomy.The foil to Nurse Ratched is McMurphy, a scrappy Irishman and con artist who fakes insanity to escape a prison work farm. Little does he know that the insane asylum is far more repressive than his prison work camp. Yet, McMurphy uses humor as a powerful weapon against the forces to be and it is he, not the odious staff, that produces the stunning turnaround in confidence and self-awareness of the inmates. Although he may have his own financial motives, McMurphy proves ultimately to be a martyr, whose own suffering benefits the other inmates in untold ways.The events are told through the perspective of Chief Bromden, a towering 6'7\\" Indian, who pretends to be deaf and mute. It is up to the reader to piece together the puzzle of the Chief's history, as he flashbacks to his days in an Indian village on the Columbian River and the Army. Although suffering from hallucinations, the Chief provides insight into the conditions and state of mind of the other inmates. The Chief perceives society as whole as a Combine, a vast mechanized factory that has dehumanized its victims. Through vivid dreams and his imagination, the Chief depicts the damaging effects of a non-tolerant society on those who dare to be different and non-conformists. It is ultimately McMurphy who lifts Bromden out of his fog of obscurity and back into the realization that he is a mighty man.Repressed sexuality plays a large role throughout, as it is the realization of one's own sexuality that proves to be the most therapeutic element in the treatment. Of course, the Big Nurse attempts to repress all sexual expression and shames those who partake of it. Her shame is so severe that she goads one of her patients into suicide for daring to lose his virginity. However, once this wall is broken down, the patients are able to become men again. Yes, they are still men with mental problems, but their confidence has grown and they are able to assert themselves in a sometimes hostile society.This novel is a true classic. It provides suspense, humor, and a powerful message about society. Superb."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Jack Nickolson played the role of R.P.

Read first and watch second and you won't be disappointed..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This insane sequence of events takes form in the voice of a patient at a mental hospital. Being a giant, half Native American man in the 60's, no one has ever really recognized the narrator, Bromden, as a human being. However, by acting deaf and dumb, he knows everything that goes on in the hospital, since no one finds any need to keep quite when he is around. He knows so much that he can even tell you that the hospital is entirely boring. Everyday is exactly the same at this hospital in Oregon. That is, until a man by the name of R.P McMurphy enters the ward and turns the place upside down. A witty, gambling addict, McMurphy brings the patients to rebellion against the leader of the ward, the Big Nurse.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes you on a journey through the lives of the hospitals patients by way of the mentally ill mind. Except for hallucinations, seizures, and the hospital's constant sanitized smell you would think that the characters were ordinary people, which they are. Kesey brings the reader into a world where few travel; a place where most people would think that no one has a mind. He shows the true side of a mental asylum, not a house for animals, but a place where real people with real problems can go for help. It is a humorous, but tragic story of those in need of a few laughs, friends, and a medical miracle. It is a heart-wrenching story, but with a slight twist to it. You can never tell what will happen next and will be captivated by the exciting adventures of the patients."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" tells the story of a Psychiatric Ward from the point of view of \\"Chief\\" Bromden - a half-Indian schitzophrenic. The book paints a bleak, dark institution, run by the Big Nurse - an emasculating ex-Army nurse who enjoys revelling in the misery of those under her care more than helping them. It introduces a number of characters, all patients - many of whom are probably are not crazier than your average nerd or weirdo. The drudgery and misery permeating the halls of the institution change forever, when a gambling rebel-rouser named McMurphy arrives on the ward, after faking insanity at a work farm. McMurphy turns the tables on the dark totalitarianism of the Nurse - whom he calls a 'ball-cutter'; severely affecting her ability to bully others (especially him).McMurphy's zest for life forever affects those around him. While superficially a selfish gambler, McMurphy time and time again proves to be a great friend and ally; the best therapy that the patients have ever been exposed to. This irks and angers the Nurse to no end - driving her to all sorts of plots to undermine McMurphy's authority and influence.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is not the average run-of-the-mill book, as it attempts to tell the story from the point of view of a mentally ill patient. It does that surprisingly well, however, and the reader is often left trying to figure out whether what the protagonist is seeing/feeling is actually happening, or whether it's a figment of his imagination (which is how schitzophrenics must feel).For those who have not read the book or seen the movie - I cannot recommend this story enough. It's great on film, and it's even better in print. It's difficult to recommend this book enough, without betraying some of its best plot lines, so if you've read this far, do yourself a favor and read the book.For those who have seen the film - think of the book as the 80% of the story that the film never covers. If you like the film, you absolutely must read the book - it contains a significant amount of background that the movie could never cover - in addition, the book has Bromden as the main character - not McMurphy. Whether or not McMurphy is the protagonist in the book - that is probably arguable - as no one affects the setting of the novel as much as he.---In terms of publishing I do not recommend the Signet series paperback, as it contains a number of glaring spelling mistakes. Buy another edition."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What can be said about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that hasn't already been said? All the verbal accolades that have been deservedly heaped upon it still don't seem to be quite enough. How do you express the inexpressible? When Ken Kesey created Randle Patrick McMurphy, Nurse Mildred Ratched aka Big Nurse, Chief Bromden and a slew of other quite memorable characters, Kesey created something unique in the annals of American literature. He made off-kilter characters likable and relatable. Characters who would normally be considered pathetic whack-job losers in the eyes of the wider society become heros of sterling character and brilliance. He created a brotherhood or fraternity out of a grey, dismal and depressing psychiatric ward, overseen by a cold, willful, emasculating, calculating, manipulative, shrewish, dominating and downright nasty woman: Nurse Mildred Ratched, Randle's and the patient's enemy par excel-lance.Wanting to avoid the labors at a work farm, McMurphy chooses to be loony enough to qualify him for a stay at a mental institution, where he will have good food, a comfortable bed and a bunch of easy suckers to con out of their money while gambling. He is a rule breaker in every sense of the word, much to the displeasure of Nurse Rathched, who values consistent and rigid routine. A place for everything and everything in its place. And McMurphy does everything in his power to get under her skin. He tries to inspire the other patients who have been emasculated by her to rise up against her cruelty. He tries to make them men, strong and sharp, as he perceives himself as being. For a while, he breaks through the barrier of their self-imposed exile, the negative impressions they see when they look in a mirror. When the cracks slowly happen, a reversal happens. The patients become strong and Nurse Ratched becomes weak. As a reader, you find yourself cheering for McMurphy and the patients; you want them to win, to succeed, to thrive, and they do have their assorted victories. In a fight of wills, battles are won, but the war is not yet declared. Nurse Ratched sees McMurphy for exactly what he is, a con man who took the easy squeezy lemon easy way out of avoiding jail time. So she has fun with him, watches and analyzes him. She has weapons at her disposal to keep the patients in line, namely electro shock treatment (ECT) or even worse, a lobotomy procedure. And she can make it happen, for the doctors and staff at the institution are either intimidated by her or in some respects, are just like her but to a lesser degree. The patients are trapped, and McMurphy says, I don't think so.After a couple of humorous victories, McMurphy learns that Nurse Ratchet is the one who has the true authority over his freedom, that she is the one who decides who leaves or who stays within the dismal confines of the hospital. With that knowledge, he does a complete turnabout and becomes a stellar patient, behaved, cooperative and non-combative. Nurse Ratchet loves every minute of it, savors her power over people; it is her water, her nourishment. And she will simply not let go of it. She will go to any lengths to protect it, for it is the only thing she has. And while there are many characters that pepper the novel, it is the voice of Chief Bromden who is the narrator in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is perceived as deaf, dumb and hopeless, but he sees more than the other patients, because he is none of the aforementioned. He is the sole \\"coherent\\" witness who gives the testimony to the light that McMurphy brings and is; he has an acute contemplative yet simple insight which McMurphy draws out, and the two become fast friends. As the novel progresses, McMurphy forgoes his good boy behavior and his submissiveness to Nurse Ratched, who would only thrive the weaker he would become. It is then and only then that the true rabble rousing McMurphy rises and retaliates, despite the known punishments that could be inflicted upon him. Receiving warnings from his patient friends, he does not listen and goes on the disobedient warpath, doing any and everything to aggravate his nemesis. Then it hits a climatic peek that can actually drain a reader with hopeful anticipation.One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest was a thoroughly engrossing read, a novel that fully represented the man vs man literary motif, or, in this particular case, the woman. One can obviously go deeper into that analysis. Kesey's novel reminded me so much of Don Carpenter's famous novel Hard Rain Falling, for the two novels are set in the Pacific Northwest, are about prison life or a kind of prison life and have that man vs nature, man vs. man element to it. They are both gritty novels in their own unique way and the traits of the characters are not always easily likable. Yet, you root for them regardless, because you think, Hey, that could easily be me. Besides the book, the movie was absolutely fabulous, and Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson definitely deserved their Academy Awards. But books are always better, so treat yourself to a great and wonderfully loud reading experience."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Everyone longs to be free and accepted for who they are. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is an extraordinary novel that portrays this wonderfully. It all starts with a mental asylum; Chief, the narrator of the story, tells us about the atrocious nurse and the melancholy patients. Everyone just sits around all day, and follows the same schedule day by day until Randle McMurphy shows up. He would be considered the protagonist of the story. He doesn't have the same beliefs as the malicious, ancient nurse Ratched. He tries everything in his power, all day and every day to change her revolting rules. He does succeed some but you can only accomplish so much. She is the head of the asylum and he is just a measly patient. Who do you think would win? There are many themes in this novel. One of the main themes is freedom. It is what some of the patients long for and what others don't think they deserve. You will see the theme of freedom in this novel often. Another core theme would be rebellion. Rebellion is McMurphy's middle name, but in this novel that isn't bad. He is just trying to get everyone to be actual people again by showing them how to be normal. For example, he wants them to laugh, watch the World Series and play cards. Also, the ending was not my favorite, but I do believe it was an outstanding ending that shows us what our world has come to and what society can do to you. Other than that, I truly liked this book. You laughed sometimes, and wanted to cry sometimes, and occasionally you would want to yell at the nurse. Ken Kesey did a great job tugging at your emotions. I believe everyone should read this book. I believe this because it shows you how blessed you are to be free and it tells you to always be yourself; to stand you for what you believe in. Any book by Ken Kesey would be a winner. Furthermore, this book needs to be read and heard."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Such a sad book!

The story is told from the believed to be deaf and mute Indian, Chief Broom. Being that no one believes he can hear he is privy to all the goings on at a mental institution with the patients and the staff. He tells the story from his perceptions, distorted and warped that they are due to his own mental illness. When the storys main figure, Randall McMurphy decides that he has had enough of a prison work camp he feigns insanity to complete the rest of his term at the institution. When McMurphy meets the 'Big Nurse' of the ward the battle begins betweem him and her, it's a battle between their two minds over who will break the other. Kessey writes as well as some of the great writers of our times in this story. The way Chief Broom tells us the story is awesome."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is excellent work. For a short book it is heavy going. The Hallucinations began by being a bit too intense, but plot develops and the character evolution is brilliantly done. The story flows, twists, turns, and leads you down an immensely psychological journey. The main characters where awesome, and the ending is just chilling. Although each strand of the story is cunningly woven and brought to a conclusion, the book asks more questions than it ever hoped to answer, and certainly that is the purpose of art. If not for the wild hallucinations it would have been a five star classic."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"this book is a great example of the conflict man has with others. McMurphey is an outgoing man who bets on anything, and I mean anything. Ms. Ratched is a controlling, calculating, person who loves order. A perfect combination for disaster. This book gives a vivid description of how the two combat in thier own suttle(and not so suttle) ways. Along the way Murphey makes some friends and a little money, it all comes to an end when what needed to be done is done."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is an interesting insight into the minds of people who are, well &quot;different&quot;. People who suffer a mental disease. The most interesting thing about this book, is how it expresses what might happen when their all so fragile world of &quot;right&quot; &amp; &quot;wrong&quot; is polluted by a man who represents the rebellious society. This book is littered with people who represent all different aspects of society. This book is brilliantly written and worded, it is delivered with skill and beauty. This book is often compared to the Catcher and the Rye, I peronally believe that there is NO comparison. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ALL!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Cuckoo's nest was a very fasinating insight into the world of a mental hospital.

The experiences of Big Chief, McMurphy, and Big Nurse changed my perspective on a lot of things as I was reading it. It was the type of book that was hard to quit reading. I think that Ken Kesey used wonderful language and descriptions that completely captured the feelings of the patients at the mental hospital. I didn't like the ending at first, but I realize that the book wouldn't have been complete unless that was the way it was; it was inevitable."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was one of the greatest books that I have ever read. &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; showed me what the inside of an asylum could be like.

As I got into the book more and more, I liked it more and more. I got into the story and felt as if I was good friends with chief and the gang. I felt sad when the nurse was mean, and happy when mcmurphy was goofy. Overall, I liked the book. I can understand why it is a classic and would recommend it to anyone who has any brains and could make sense of the book. Even if they didn't have a brain I would still recommend it to anyone if they didn't have a brain (although they would probably be a patient in the book). Mcmurphy reminded me of Patch Adams (which was a GREAT movie) in the way that he tried to help everyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I loved this book.

I don't recommend watching the movie along with it because it takes away the best parts from the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It has been a while since I've read a book like this. I should phrase that differently; it's been awhile since I've had a good read. Ken Kesey's book had an interesting setting-it was unlike any other book I've read before.I have to admit that this book caught me off guard. I honestly was not too intrigued at the beginning, especially with the thought of reading through the eyes of a hallucinating narrator. But as I continued to read the novel, I found myself enjoying Bromden's hallucinations. The symbolism was mind-boggling. Also, the Kesey's intelligent choice of using Bromden, a man pretending to be deaf and dumb, as a narrator allowed the reader to read conversations that would have been otherwise kept from other characters.Kesey did an excellent job with his characters. McMurphy has got to be one of the most peculiar characters I've read about. Yet, he's one of my favorite characters of all time. I've never read about a character who could challenge authority like McMurphy did. Kesey was a genius-his characters are all so original. I mean, who could come up with characters like the Big Nurse and Harding? They're all so real in a sense. And even despite Bromden's description, the Big Nurse has very realistic qualities.The ultimate question that I asked myself at the end of the novel was: what really is sanity? In Kesey's novel, it seemed that society set the standards for sanity, and everyone had to conform to them. So basically, those who are unusual, or not normal, are insane. Those who cannot fit into society are simply labeled as insane. However, how does this truly constitute sanity? Society has ever changing standards, so what really determines who is sane and who isn't? Kesey's novel causes the reader to ask such questions. It all boils down to, were the characters in fact insane? I think what Kesey was trying to get at with his unorthodox novel.Despite the fact that I was not very interested in Kesey's novel at first, it proved to be a very worthwhile read. The time spent reading it was not a wasted amount of time-I actually enjoyed reading it. I advise everyone to read this classic novel-it just may be one of the most interesting books you read your entire life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best books I've ever read. And I don't use that statement lightly, because I have read some excellent books. I loved this book for so many reasons...Kesey breaks all kinds of barriers in a reader's mind. I was literally pacing around as I finished the book. I was so involved in the character's lives, I cared so desperately about what happened to McMurphy, it was as if I was in the mental ward, watching all of this happen. I felt like an Acute, sitting with my deck of cards watching the lives unfold around me.The other thing that this book left with me was the desire to question. From day 1, McMurphy questioned. He questioned the rules, questioned Big Nurse, questioned the Black Boys, questioned the system. His desire for dignity in the ward inspired the other inmates to question the system, and ultimately question the value of their lives. I loved getting to know Randal Patrick McMurphy, and I can't wait to read something else by Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel tells the story of an asylum. Buts its much more than that- its a commentary on Society in general (personified by Nurse Ratched and the attendants who work for her). At the center of the story is Randall Patrick McMurphy, seen through the eyes of Chief Broom. McMurphy brings new life to the mental institution, opening the eys of its inmates to a wider world. Through challenging the iron will of Nurse Ratched, McMurphy allows the men to see that it is not them who are crazy; that, rather, it is Society (the machine) which has put them there against their wills. It is a powerful, tragic story, one the ends with a death, but at the same time a promise of something good. I highly reccomend this one."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The novel is told in the first-person from the POV of Chief Broom. Early on, it becomes clear that he is the \\"unreliable narrator\\" in the Edgar Allen Poe sense. The Chief may be faking deafness, but it is obvious through his descriptions that he is a schizophrenic who suffers from hallucinations. It is up to the reader to sort out the \\"real\\" from the \\"imaginary.\\"Although Broom and his fellow inmates are insane, they are still good people and they do not deserve the treatment they receive at the hands of the evil Nurse Ratched. She is one of the most memorably evil villains in all literature. Even though she is only a nurse, she is in complete control of the entire hospital. What she wants is for everything to run like clockwork. She does not want anyone to ever \\"get better.\\" In walks Randall Patrick MacMurphy. Like Hamlet, MacMurphy fakes madness (in order to get out of a labor camp). He soon sets himself up as the ward's personal savior (there is a lot of Christ imagery) and engages in a war with Nurse Ratched.This is a great book that is really about non-conformity; the tyranny of people who dictate what is \\"normal\\" and what is not. The only flaw is a strain of misogyny that runs through the subtext. There is a lot of talk of how men shouldn't be bossed around by women and how they should be kept in their place. Granted, this is the characters speaking and not Ken Kesey, but the message is there. After all, this is a book that culminates in an act of violence against a woman. It's a shame because it is a great book and just because Nurse Ratched is evil, there is no need to extend the message towards women in general."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I guess that I did ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST in reverse. I saw the movie about four years ago, and then I saw the play last year. I have just now gotten around to reading the novel.For those of you who saw and enjoyed the movie version with Jack Nicholson, I would recommend reading this book. The book tells the story of his committal and experiences in the insane asylum from a completely different perspective -- that of Chief Bromden, the deaf-mute Indian. Having the story told not from the point of view of the main character, but from that of a person committed by the state for the same mental instability that R.P. McMurphy is faking, puts the entire story into a new, and very interesting, perspective.Even though I had already experienced this story more than once, I was still captivated through the entire book. Even though I knew before I opened the book how it was going to end, I was on the end of my seat until the very last sentence. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. However, this book is not intended to be flipped through at the dentist's office. Although the reading itself is not at all difficult, the content must be read together and savored."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a novel written by Ken Kesey regarding a mental instituion. The story is told from the point of view of one of the patients named Chief. Chief is a Chronic, meaning he is in the ward for life. Chief, along with the other patients, live out their days at the hospital under the close watch of Nurse Rached. Everyday was routine; nothing changed. Things were so montonous that the patients had even forgot how to laugh and be happy.Things all changed one day though when McMurphy came to the ward. People say he wasn't really crazy; he just thought that a mental instution would be a good place to relax for a few months. A bed to sleep, free food to eat. Right from the start, he began to challenge the nurse and the rules of the institution. McMurphy fought back againist their way of life and their restrictions. Pretty soon, a power struggle erupts between McMurphy and the Big Nurse.At first it started just as a game, but as McMurphy slowly realized the more horrific side of the hospital, things began to get rough. The other patients don't know what to do. They like the way McMurphy makes them feel about themselves, but they are scared too. They are scared of the power that the Big Nurse possesses. More importantly, they are scared of what will happen if McMurphy wins."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the greatest novels written. Certainly Kesey's best and the best to come out of the counterculture movement of the 60s. The book is told from the point of view of Chief, who has schizophrenia. This causes the pov to be skewed, and a certain amount of distrust in the narrator (is Big Nurse really that bad, or is it Chief's illness?) It's a heroic story, McMurphy being our (anti)hero. There's so much going on in the book, you could write a book analyizing it. I will say that if you liked the fiction of the Beats or Hunter Thompson, you'll definitely like this novel. It is also told in one of the most intersting voices - along with novels like Huck Finn, Great Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye. This i definitely one of the best novels written.I have the Viking Critical Edition of the book. Besides a great introduction, a chronology of Kesey's life, and the text, there are also three other sections, topics for discussion and paper, and a selected bibliography.Section 2 contains letters from Kesey, and selections concerning Cuckoo's Nest from Kesey's Garage Sale. There are Kesey's sketches of what he visualized the characters to look like and an early draft of the opening sequence of the story. There's also an excerpt from Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.Section 3 contains literary criticism of the the novel, and these are some great selections of the work done on Kesey's novel.Section 4 is called analogies and perspectives. It contains scientific articles on lobotomy and shock treatment. It's a great addition to a critical edition, and one that you don't see done elsewhere. There are also excerpts from Dale Wasserman's play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ellison's Invisible Man (chapter 11), Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, and Jack Kerouac's On the Road (where Sal and Dean meet). And there is a sketch of Neal Cassady written by Kesey (taken from Kesey's Garage Sale), which is great to compare with Kerouac's Dean Moriaty.Cuckoo's Nest is one of the masterpieces of American literature, one everyone should read. And the Viking Critical Edition is a great edition to have. I'd recommend getting this edition of the book, but if not, at least pick up another edition. This is great stuff."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I thought the movie was interesting, so I read the book.Then I read it again, and again. I just can't get over howgood it is. The book and the movie are very similar, but thebook is so much better. The most compelling difference is thatthe book is told in first person by the Chief, who isdelusional.The character development is amazing. It's like I know each one personally. This is the best and worst that humanity has tooffer. I can't recommend this one enough."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey brings the goods with this delightful and intense masterpiece. I read it in 2 days and will never forget it! This book has the power to change your life as it has mine. You must go into the book with an open mind and be willing to read between the lines as there is much depth and symbolism within the humor and drama.Kesey, before he began his acid road trip as detailed in Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, wrote this gem which focuses on the classic struggle between conformity and individuality, between good and evil, and tests the limits of sanity and insanity. Anyone who needs a shove telling them to stand up for themselves and what they believe in despite the overwhelming invisible forces of conformist society should read this ASAP. 1st person narration from the rather unique perspective of a dillusional 6 foot 8 Columbian-Indian, Chief Bromden, or Chief Broom as the orderlies refer to him as, who pretends to be deaf and dumb, makes the read flow smoothly.Although not for the politically correct or faint of heart, this esoteric novella enlightens and entertains throughout the whole ride and shows why it's a timeless classic. It's in my top 5 best books of all time - period. Check it out - it will leave an indelible impression."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel came out around the time the original Beat Generation was somewhat dwindling. Some consider (and I think rightly so) that it mutated into the hippie counterculture, but I'll leave that up to cultural historians. Any way you take it this is a monumental book. It certainly was an inspiration to me, a little lost &quot;weirdo oustider&quot; wandering the vacant shallow halls of high school, watching how it seemed everyone else &quot;fit in.&quot; Then, after reading CUCKOO'S NEST, it became clear to me how much more important it was to be myself, even if that meant not being part of the &quot;in crowd.&quot; Of course, there is literature out there that denounces being individuals, such as Eugene Ionesco's RHINOCEROS, but hey...I'd rather be alone than feel phony. Anyhow, as I'm sure other reviews have noted, you HAVE to read the book first or else all you will see when you read the name &quot;RP MacMurphy&quot; is Jack Nicholson's face. Also, a funny symbol I noticed: in the part of the book when the patients are all on the bus which MacMurphy drives off, I thought it was symbolic of Kesey (I think it was him anyway) and his bus of &quot;merry pranksters.&quot; I'm not sure what they were all about or what they did, but I remember hearing about them. A fine book that challenges so many thing: individuality vs. conformity, what is insane/sane, who decides? This is one powerful story you won't forget anytime soon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is about a group of men in an asylum. Everything on the ward is run tight and strict by Mrs. Ratched, until a man named McMurphy shows up to show the men how to laugh and live again. Kesey's story of friendship and loyalty is easily related to everyday life. It was a fun and interesting book to read, and it definitely kept you awake with all of McMurphy's games and hysterical fiascoes to upset Mrs. Ratched, and amuse the other members of the ward. Through all of this he touches each member differently, personally, and in their own way. Mrs. Ratched tried to blame the death of Billy on him, but nobody believed any of it. They trusted McMurphy because he had helped each of them grow so tremendously, especially Chief. He was a completely different person at the end of the book. He started out so shy that people thought he was deaf but throughout the book he opens up more and more, first to McMurphy, who knew better than to doubt his mental or physical strength. Inside his rough exterior was someone with more feelings than any of the other men, and he proves that in the book, without losing his trouble-making image. Kesey tells a great story about standing up for yourself, while still being able to keep things funny at the same time. He also tells a story with a sad, yet understandable end. Even though it may have been difficult to follow while trying to translate the words and meaning of a man from an asylum, that is what keeps the reader interested. It was unique to see it through the eyes of Chief, rather than knowing the whole truth from the narrator. Sometimes the truth symbols, and hidden meanings were complicated to find, but the story is understandable on many levels, so the message is still revealed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Few books as radical as Cuckoo's Nest can stand the passage of time with such resonance. Kesey weaves intricate symbols together with a mastery that I have seen rarely duplicated. Unless one really pays attention, it's quite easy to get lost. Some symbols, the McMurphy/Christ associations, are rather easy to identify whereas other will fly right over your head if you're not careful.Bromden's schizophrenic fog, Billy's emasculated studder, Harding's irrational fears, Nurse Ratched's starched ball-cutting uniform - all ripped to shreds by Mac's calloused hands and his insistance on self-reliance and non-conformity. A truly brilliant work that will change the way you think about your relationship to a cold and mechanistic society that lumbers forward at your expense."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As I commented on one young reviewer's post...there should be a rule stating that if you have not read the book then you should not be allowed to write a review for it or even rate it. Most of the poor reviews and low ratings for this novel are from ignorant teenagers whose reviews are barely coherent and furthermore who have not even actually read the book beyond a few pages. Rant over, thanks.Moving on, I have owned this book for several years but simply never got around to reading it until now. Things to keep in mind: I did see a stage production of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I have never seen the movie. I am not going to summarize the book, I will just get to my point. I will say that Cuckoo's Nest is not by any means a breezy read, and I also had a little bit of difficulty in the beginning fully comprehending some of what was going on mainly because it is not written in any typical fashion and yes, it is written from the perspective of a mental patient whose perception is not always clear...or is it? Not only that but Kesey was volunteering to take part in LSD testing during the time he wrote the book, which he wrote from his experience working in a Veteran's hospital. The first portion of the book is a bit slow, but once you get past the introductions, so to speak, and adjust to the style of the narrator's prose it takes a turn and you can't help but care for these characters and feel what they feel and go through and how they change and evolve. You might even see some of your own experiences or selves in the situations in Cuckoo's Nest, mental patients or not.I finished what started as a difficult read within two days and it turned out to be one of the most rewarding novels I have read in a long time. I actually cried; this is now one of only three books that has ever hit me in such a way! It's an inspiring and sad story about the power of ideas, spirit, conformity and freedom. Although it may be a little rough at the start, I highly recommend getting through that part and finishing the story...you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a masterpiece of desperation. It flows from cover to cover. Everyone can relate with the great McMurphy as he tries to figure out oppressive authority. He wages war, not just against Nurse Ratched, but against all of societies ideas that have kept these people from venturing out. The people society deems as insane are really those who are sane who understand the insaneness of society. Sit back and be prepared to laugh and cry and dig every line as McMurphy throws his big shovel into the very dirt society has tossed over these characters, as well as you and I."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is more than a social commentary: it is an allegory-like hyperbole of the psychopathic obsession of the 1960s. The decade marked a drastic proliferation of books that looked at psychiatry and mental illness but garnered little diagnostic or therapeutic value. Despite the prestige of these publications that usually attuned to academic standard in intellectual circles, none of such literature had the widespread impact of this novel written by Kesey who worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital in Menlo Park, California. He participated in government-sponsored drug experiments during his employment with this hospital and became sympathetic to the patients and began to seriously question the boundaries that had been created between the sane and the insane.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is an unforgettable story of a mental ward in which the despotic Nurse Ratched reigns over the doctor and all the inhabitants. She exercises a somewhat cultic tactics to render her patients completely submissive. In what she embellishes a Therapeutic Community, an outwardly democratic entity run by patients, she imperceptibly manipulates them into grilling each other as if they are criminals. She has over the years has welded an insurmountable power over the ward that even the doctor is rendered frightened, desperate and ineffectual. She has no need to accuse or to enforce obedience because all it takes to maintain that tight grip of power is insinuation, which allows her to force the trembling libido out of everyone without an effort.The Nurse's unchallenged tyranny begins to whittle as McMurphy, a 35-year-old Korean veteran who has history of insubordination and street brawls, resolves to oppose her every step of the way and raises the racket in her ward. His defiance is justifiable: he is surprised at how sane everyone is in the ward. Nobody and nothing in life have got much of a hold on this boisterous personality, who knows that there is no better way in the world to aggravate somebody (like the Nurse) who is trying to make it difficult for him than by acting like he is not bothered. McMurphy's fun-loving arrival at the ward brings about a different shade of opinion among the staff and the patients. The latter come following him as if he is their Savior, for he is utterly different and has not let what he looks like run his life one way or the other.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is narrated by a patient in the ward, a Columbia Indian whom everyone thinks deaf, mute, and unintelligible, but who throughout the years of his commitment has overheard all the trickery of staff meetings. He epitomizes the mishap of the erroneous boundary with which the sane separates them from the insane. McMurphy's arrival and his friendship with the Indian Chief spur him on to recover his own identity and rebuild his self-esteem. The novel examines the notion of madness in the sense of its own and in the sense of the term being patronized by mental institution. The narrator's seamless observation and eagle-eyed description of the ward illustrate salient flaws of such a mindless system that targets only at reducing patients' mental capability. Kesey considers whether madness really means the common practice that confines to a mindless system or the attempt to escape from such a system altogether. Like its audacious protagonist, the novel itself is a literary outlaw."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I knew this book as one of the anthems of the sixties, bringing to the fore the themes of rebellion against arbitrary authority and the rejection of conformity. But I did not actually read the book till recently.I found that Kesey's \\"sixties\\" novel passes the test of great literature. It transcends its moment in time and gains universality. The struggle between the individual and the demands of society is nowhere portrayed as sharply and brilliantly as in this novel. McMurphy is a bit extreme, as is Nurse Ratched, but the interplay of extremes is fascinating.Do not ignore the fact that Bromden, the narrator, actually shows serious signs of mental illness. His constant references to the \\"Combine\\" and his fear of the \\"fog\\" are paranoid delusions. It's an amazing tribute to Kesey's skill that he chose to tell the story this way rather than in a more conventional mode of narration, and that he succeeded."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a modern classic and an excellent novel. Cuckoo's Nest follows the life of Chief Bromden as he silently observes the antics of the patients and staff of Big Nurse's ward in an insane asylum. Cuckoo's Nest is well written and after the first 50 or so pages I was hooked.This is the type of book that raises a large number of questions about our society. On one level it treats the issue of man vs. machine as the inmates square off with the emotionless staff at the asylum. On another it will cause you to question who really is insane and are those people insane because they are truly mentally challenged or do they simply see the world differently than the majority? Kesey shows how even the insane remain human and desire freedom and emotion and thus follows the tale.While very different in approach, this novel shares some central themes with the modern &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. This connection is revealed in perhaps one of the most thought provoking statements of the novel &quot;It's the truth even if it didn't happen&quot;I would recommend this book to all who can stand a serious, thoughtprovoking read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You don't need me to tell you how great this book is. It is a nice easy read, entertaining, but also a bold display of technical mastery of the novelistic form. I shouldn't like it actually. I spend a lot of time dispelling myths about the practice of psychiatry, myths promulgated in part by the popularity of both the novel and movie. They might not have been complete myths at the time, I suppose. We are told that Ken Kesey wrote the book while working at a psychiatric hospital, and in fact gave himself a treatment of ECT in order to write accurately about it. What a sport. I don't want to waste time on this side-issue or sound defensive, but do feel obligated to say that ECT, as used today, is an extremely humane and effective treatment for certain patients, particularly those that do not respond well to medications. It is not used punitively. Okay, that's out of the way.It is hard not to get swept up by the charisma of the Randle Patrick McMurphy, the protagonist who resists the bureaucratic order, who draws out and rejects hypocrisy, who demonstrates that laughter and joy are not only therapeutic but necessary for emotional survival.Nurse Ratched's power derives from the institutional ammunition dump. Tranquilizers, stifling psychiatric argot, seclusion, and sadistic orderlies, all creating the illusion of harmony (sterile harmony, but harmony of a sort). RPM's power comes from vitality, humor, impulsiveness, aggression, and brusque candor, amid the other libidinal trappings. In the end, though Nurse Ratched has proved McMurphy to be \\"simply a man and no more,\\" though she is able to reduce him to vegetative wilt, she has not won the battle. McMurphy's spirit was never broken. He was just a person, not a deity, not a superpower. He had all the weaknesses and limitations as anyone else, but he refused to be governed by those limitations. His humor and courage remained intact and had infiltrated the culture of the unit.The legendary circumstances in which this novel was written, well-known and well-characterized in multiple other forums, only add to the thrill of this book. We have a novel mythologizing a guerrilla attack on societal conformity and hypocrisy, and this novel in and of itself was part of the leading edge of a culture attack. And the novelist himself becomes a McMurphy in the merry prankster assault. Nice foreshadowing, both internal and external to the binding.Also, by the way, I owe a personal debt, though a remorseful one, to this book. Back in a day when I indulged in more vices, I used to keep novices in the poker game- long after they were exposed and disheartened- with a paraphrase: you can't quit now, \\"if you quit now, how are you gonna win your money back?\\"Great book. Buy it, read it. If you haven't re-read it recently, what are you waiting for? Marc Libman told you."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Be prepared to change mentally, emotionally, as well as physically, after losing sleep to read this book. As readers, we enter a world with which many of us are unfamiliar with: a mental institution. The story is told by one of the patients, Chief Bromden, who has schizophrenia. As a result, one gets a sense of what the disease really does to its victims. For the entire ten years the Chief has been there, he has been making everyone believe that he is deaf and gives way for an insightful and understandable read. We are drawn into the imaginative, uncertain, and unfortunately scared minds of the patients as a consequence of fear and hatred set in by the Big Nurse, Miss Ratched.Soon, a new patient, Randle McMurphy, is brought into the ward. The institution and its patients would never be the same. From him, the other patients are introduced to his world of gambling, breaking rules, drinking and many more surprises. For the first time in the Big Nurse's dictatorship-like care a patient has challenged her authority. Inevitably, McMurphy's touch of the real world gives the other patients laughter, something to stand up for, courage, a sense of purpose, and hope.I could not recommend a single book more. On the few times I put the book down, I would fall asleep guessing what would come. The definition of freedom is reiterated when reading about the physical, mental, and emotional state the patients are in, as well as bravery when they attempt to win their freedom back. This book will find a spot close to your heart. Be prepared to find yourself shocked, laughing, and crying with the patients. After reading this book, you will not be the same."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"For a book written by a paid volunteer to use hallucinogenic drugs, a book written by a man who at some points while writing was under the influence of LSD and peyote, and a book that funded the writer's San Francisco to New York road trip on psychedelically painted bus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest turned out perfectly normal, in fact even clever and stimulating. Considered a masterpiece by many, this novel is an extremely insightful satire of the society of the 1950's. Just as the drugs and psychedelic bus may suggest, Kesey could in fact be considered a founding-father of hippie-ism. His \\"hippie\\" attitudes shine through with this book, which in many ways challenges numerable aspects of authority and society. The setting is inspired by Kesey's work at the Menlo Park, Virginia hospital, where he was introduced to LSD by a government-sponsored program researching the effects of hallucinogenic drugs. This experience led him to continue his drug use, and further developed his opinions of society, which we can read about in this excellent book. The story starts when R.P. McMurphy is admitted into the mental ward, transferred from a work farm. He's a self-proclaimed gambling champion and womanizing sex machine, a rough-around-the-edges cowboy of a jokester. McMurphy is the one person who stands up to Nurse Ratched, the symbol of the cold oppression and conformity in society. The book is the story of the patients' struggle against the strict policy and rules of the ward. Under the leadership of McMurphy, who sings, laughs, walks around wearing only a towel, and does anything that he can think of which will disrupt the cold order that Nurse Ratched has on the ward, their adventures include everything from rowdy poker games, to a fishing trip, to a completely against policy late night party in the ward, complete with alcohol, marijuana, and prostitutes. The books end is sad, but realistic and a reminder of the control society ultimately has The narrator of the book is the paranoid Chief Bromden, a 7 foot something giant of an Indian who fakes deaf and dumb in order to hear everything and yet remain safe. It is his narration that keeps the book interesting. Bromden, always standing in the corner with a broom, is able to see and hear everything that goes on in the ward. He is extremely insightful and the style that Kesey uses to portray Bromden as a character is very entertaining to read. Bromden, a paranoid schizophrenic, at some points in the story, hallucinates. The imagery that he provides is usually mechanical and he often talks about seeing fog from a machine that the nurse controls. His hallucinations are metaphors, he describes the ward as having hidden mechanical components, and frequently he sees fog that represents confusion and fear. He depicts society as a combine, a giant machine, and all of the patients at the hospital are broken parts needing repair. They are parts that didn't fit into their place in the machine, didn't fit into the conformity of society. Not only is it an entertaining read, but also a compelling cautionary story. Kesey is giving a warning about a society centered around conformity. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is Kesey's investigation of the control of the 1950's society over the individual, bringing into play themes ranging from the importance of laughter and sexuality to the definition of insanity. The book's ending gets mixed reactions, but it is realistic, and a reminder of the control society ultimately has. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a fantastic book, a highly recommended read, both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Because this book is discriptive it can seem slow moving, but when it gets to the action parts, it becomes more interesting. the second half of the book is the most interesting, it has a lot of unexpected twists near the end. so try not to fall asleep before you get to them!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was not a page turner for me.

From now on I will not start reading any book that was wrote by an auther on drugs. The beginning of the book was very hard to understand and it couldn't keep my attention. I started liking the book when McMurphy was trying to get the nurse to let them watch the world series and she wouldn't, so then he punched a window out. Its really hard to understand why some of the patients are actually in the institution, because they don't have to be. Like Harding he has succeded on the outside life, because he has a good looking wife, even though she might have been the reason he is in there. I just mean that he can live out there by himself, and not be in the institution. I don't recommed this book because it is hard to follow, and wasnt that interesting."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found that I could not really ever get into this book.

I really couldn't get into it or find a pattern or relate with any of the concepts that went on in this book. The title describes this book very well. It is crazy, hard to follow and written in a way that puts all of what we were taught in English classes to shame. I feel the simplistic writing it how it actually would have happened is a mockery of writing. The plot was hard to get into and a complete dissappointment in the end. I really feel that this book is a shame and really dont think it should have been published. It got the point through but you could only find it after you corrected the language and grammatical errors in the book. To me that is not how i want to read a book. I understand and can comprehend hard books and books that leave stuff to the imagination, with no problem. But i absolutely could not get into this book. I do not recommend it for any type of reading. Not relaxation, leisure or school reading.

I would like to have a book burning."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This wasn't a very easy book to read. It was kind of difficult to understand. Although, I was able to manage with reading about half of the book. It's hard to understand because the story is being told from the view of a mental patient. Bromden is often hallucinating and it's hard to know at times whether he's talking about the real world or if he's in his own world. Then there's McMurphy. Sometimes I wonder about him. He doesn't seem as though he has any mental issues. He just seems like a normal guy, always trying to get what he wants, when he wants. He often messes around with the other patients and takes advantage of their disabilities. Not only does he mess with the patients, though, he also tries to play games with Nurse Ratched as well. All I know is that if the book was a little easier to understand, and things were a little more clear I would have finished reading it because I did think the plot was rather interesting, but it just wasn't easy to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book broke the mold. But it appeals to a different type of reader; the taste buds required to enjoy this novel are absent in our reading pallets. When we started reading this book I thought that it would be good because it was is a classic but I was wrong, it had a horribly slow start and was predictable. However, once the book got going it was all right, some passages are captivating, but then the next couple droll on so we lost interest. The story starts out in a mental hospital where the staff has everything under control when a new patient is introduced into the hospital. It's about then when things began to go haywire. At first nobody listens to him but as the book goes on he begins to rally support and one by one he wins over the acute patents and eventually the narrator of the book. When the new patient whose name is McMurphy finds out what the Big Nurse is trying to do to him he decides to play the game her way so for the rest of the book he tries to push her buttons, get her goat, and she doesn't ever take the bait. Then McMurphy organizes a deep sea-fishing trip with his aunts, which are really prostitutes only one shows up and the Dr. goes with them, once they return things are different... If this kind of stuff I guess it would be a good book, however like I said we don't like this kind of book. However I must say that I kind of like the style, how the narrator compares everything around him to a metaphor or a simile. It makes you think a little more, I think it would be cool to be able to talk like, I don't know why I just do. Now that I've reflected back on the book I realize its not as bad as I thought it was but I still would have rather not have read this book, I would have read a better book, but I guess that's the beauty of reading books, you don't know which ones you will like until you read them. For those of you out there wanting to read this book I suggest that you think back on the books that you have read and have liked, and compare it to other reviews as well as what mine says about the book then if it sounds like it would be something that you would like go for it. I gave this book 2 out of 5 stars because it had a slow start and in my opinion that is what makes a book or brakes a book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Yes, there's plenty of Christ imagery in this book, but people have been doing that since Elisha.Yes, Broom Bromden's narrative was conceived during a rather intense LSD session, but that doesn't make this book any less inventive.In the end, read this book not just because it's one of the few that not only further broke down our preconceived notions of what a novel should be and one that forces you to think, but mostly because it's a great read.Ryan Brenizer"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One more quick note: if you plan to read this novel, keep your eyes open for Christ imagery.

I visited mental hospitals and talked with the Head Nurses in my area, and it was really quite interesting that they often did not find the character of the Big Nurse out of line at all, that her actions were completly justifiable and McMurphy was, indeed, nothing but a trouble-maker.

PC-ness aside, actually it is hard to believe that such a book would be written in the 90's. It smells counterculture; it smells like the sixties. This story wouldn't come from a mind of a contemporary writer, because by our time the issues have change. Have they?Ken Kesey's \`One Flew...' is usually read as an allegory of the individualist. Free-spirited McMurphy is the rage against the machine --personified as the nurse Mrs. Ratched. After the new patient is admitted into the hospital the \`fatal attraction' is instant and mutual. They both represent different things, and fight for different sides.The story is told by Chief Broom an Indian --or a Native American, pick which one you prefer-- that pretends to be deaf and dumb, just to be left a lot and not be bothered by the other inmates. As he is an almost invisible presence --at least before McMurphy arrives-- he is allowed to some \`privileges' that the other ones are not. He can clean the meeting room white a meeting is taking place, and he can hear --although the staff thinks he cannot-- what is being discussed. Having this character as a narrator gives the reader the chance of knowing the inside side of the story; at the same time one can have the required distance with the Chief's observations and comments.Sarcasm is one of the Chief's chief use of language. He has a unique mind to comment the events around. For instance, at some point, talking about the hospital he says that \`there is something strange about a place where the men won't let themselves loose and laugh'. Besides, even being considered a lunatic, he has a very down-to-earth view of reality. When thinking about the nurse after she has another big fight with McMurphy, the Chief tells to his readers: \`to beat her you don't have to whip her two out of three or three out of five, but every time you meet'.This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it. But it is not impossible either. This was the purely 60s way of thinking --and one must be grateful to that, otherwise the world would be even worse.There is a movie version, directed by Milos Forman and staring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. The author Kesey abominated the movie --and reportedly never watched it-- because the Chief is not as important in the film. However, it is still a good and interesting movie.A contemporary writer would probably tackle the issues in another way, not so plain and sincere as Kesey did, creating a metaphor that will last until the day we have master and slaves. And, the last time I checked, it is not going to end very soon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The item was listed as the Spanish edition, but the book is in English.

I would recommend this book to just about anyone it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Initially, this book was very difficult to grasp. That was because Chief Bromden hallicinates using an image of fog, and you can't tell if he's telling the truth or not. Once Bromden becomes more comfortable around the hospital, with the help of McMurphy, he stops his hallicinatory acts. McMurphy is a hero to all the patients on the ward. He made them realize that they do not have to follow the norms and can speak their minds. McMurphy's rebel against Nurse Ratched is classic. Rebellion is a huge part of his personality, and considering that he is not insane, McMurphy doesn't feel that he needs to follow her rules.It's a tough book to get into, but once you move past the fog, it is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"To begin with, this book was fairly hard to follow. The narrator, a deaf/mute Native American, goes through hallucinatory episodes in which everything is surrounded by a foggy mist. This is in reference to his time in Vietnam, where he was so mentally affected by the horridness of the war, whenever he feels threatened or in danger, the fog takes over. As the book progresses, it becomes easier to distinguish between reality and his hallucinations. As in every book, there is an antagonist and a protagonist. Nurse Ratched, who plays the part of the antagonist, is a controlling factor in the book. She has the upper hand for everything that has to do in the ward. McMurphy, obviously, would be the protagonist. He is fighting for the rights of the patients in the ward, along with his own freedom. It is a little unrealistic that anyone would be able to get away with the stuff that McMurphy gets away with, but it makes the book just that much more interesting to read, and the whole time you are rooting for the rabbits, and against the wolf!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew over the cuckoo's nest, written by Ken Kesey, is an in-depth look at the disturbing and controlling world of a certain psyciatric hospital. The Book is written from the perspective of a patient on the psychiatric ward, Chief Bromden, a large Indian who is smarter then he lets on.The theme of the story is that the system (or the \\"combine\\" as it is called in the book) is not always just, but questioning it can be hazardous to your health. The patients on the ward suffer under the rule of the tyrant, \\"The Big Nurse\\". She is the protagonist of the story, while the antagonist is a much more likeable charachter. Randle Patrick McMurphy is a gambling man who likes to laugh. He is redheaded, Irish, and doesn't conform to rules.Of coarse this stirs up some... comfrontations, you could say. You could also say that he blatently disreguards the overly established rules of the ward simply to get a rise out of the strict enforcer. What ever you call it, the confrontations provide the basis of the book and the most entertaining moments. In the end the other patients on the ward learn a lot from McMurphy's antics. They learn to live again after their long solstice from anything the least but stimulating.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. On a scale from one to ten I would rate it an 8. It lost points because of the ending that I thought could have been better. My favorite aspect of the book was McMurphy. He was clever and funny, but knew what his limits were on the ward. He seems like the type of aggressive person that I could get along with well in real life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is simply breathtaking. It will leave you stunned at how good it is. I cannot recommend it enough. Five stars does not come close to doing its brilliance justice. Read this book and be amazed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a good book but the end seemed rushed. It was neat how the Chief narrated, and because he was a permanent inmate in the hospital, he was very insane. It's written in a phycadelic manner because he has so many hallucinations. The part about Santa Claus made no sense though."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read Cuckoo's Nest as an assignment for my english class. Though the book has a relatively slow start, it's end is unexpected. And it's effects are something that will remain in your head for years."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What is the world you see when you read this book? It may not be real, but that doesn't make it any less true. Here is a place where feelings become sensations and overpower the &quot;real world&quot;. On the face of it, the action takes place in a lunatic asylum. It could just as well be our world. It's populated by a lot of characters that feel more sane than the keepers of the place. The maker of all the rules - the Big Nurse - is the scariest of all, in her confidence that this is entirely her world, run as she likes. Enter Randall Patrick Macmurphy. Rules? What rules? They don't exist as far as he's concerned. This world is just another to be moulded to his liking. Within a minute of his entry, he's run up against the Nurse. Every inmate sees something new about life- it's possible not to follow someone else's rules and live to tell the tale. The Nurse's world cracks up, bit by bit. R.P.Mcmurphy too realizes the extent to which it's possible to fall into the games life creates. This is one character you'll remember forever - and the lesson he preaches. All the inmates - you included - learn that the game is a game only as long as you know you're playing it. Get caught up and you're just a token on the board. Ken Kesey talks through Chief Bromden - an indian who plays at being deaf and dumb in an effort to run from the game. Grammar is an easy prey to the Chief's onrushing thoughts as he struggles to keep up with the speed of events around him. The prose sparkles with electricity as he &quot;sees&quot; his feelings and expresses them as events. Hostility in the air becomes a chill, and the sensation of death is falling into a furnace. This is a book that reads like walking through a &quot;hall of crazy mirrors&quot;. You look back on yourself and don't know whether to laugh or cry."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Why does a certain book become a classic? Sometimes being a besteller is the key, sometimes it is awarded prestigious prizes by literary commitees, and sometimes a film adaptation cements its fate. All this is true for \\"One Flew over a Cuckoo's Nest\\"; however, the fact that it has contributed a phrase into the common vernacular means it should definitely be required reading.The story is quite compelling as we follow Chief Bromden's account of what happens in a Midwestern mental institution run by the infamous nurse \\"Ratched\\" when a spunky newcomer enters the scene and attempts to challenge authority. The narrator has pretended to be deaf and dumb for many years, and he has been able to act as \\"a fly on the wall\\" in various situations. The new guy on the block is McMurphy, a flamboyant, boisterous and randy jailbird with a temper to match his red hair. However, even though McMurphy is the delightful protagonist and provides the most fun for the reader, it is Nurse Rathced who remains the most memorable character - not much unlike Big Brother in 1984 (another must-read novel that has provided a whole set of commonly used terminology).The language is cleverly descriptive - the sound of the starched nurse's uniform is \\"like a frozen canvas being folded\\", and the feel of the institution atmosphere is quite haunting. However, I did feel that it often became a bit \\"wordy\\" at times in the sense that most everything was spelled out. There is little subtlety, and even the symbolic attempts are a bit heavy-handed. The notion that McMurphy can be seen as a Christ-like figure who rebels against the establishment and ultimately must pay the ultimate price for his followers seems a little bit contrived when the \\"treatment\\" table is described as a cross and the electric sparks are likened to a crown of thorns. However, the story as a whole, greatly makes up for the occasional overstatements.The other aspect I found quite fascinating was the portrayal of race and the accompanying stereotypes. It has an honest narrative feel unlike many modern novels where it is quite rare to have a sympathtic character such as Chief Bromden matter-of-factly use what must be considered racial slurs. I often found the descriptions uncomfortable; however, I appreciate the unpolished presentation. Like other elements in the story, it seems dated, yet true to the historical context.I recommend the book both as a chilling account of outdated psyciatric \\"treatment\\" ideology, as well as for the chilling, yet sharp descriptions of an unforgettable villain..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I watched the film years ago, it was compelling and memorable - a brilliant story. Then i found the book at an airport - i thought i should read it. The book, (I dread to comment in this way) was as good as the film. It was well written, the characters well formed, the narrative well balanced, in fact as good a book as any. HOWEVER my opinion i think was jilted because i had the images of the actors in the film in my head as i read the book. How could anyone forget the contorted face of Nurse Ratched and the idiot smile of b b b b b billy from the film? I hope everyone will pay their respect to the writer and read the book first. It is a great book and should be enjoyed for itself. That the film was just as good, may mean that One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest will never reach outside a generation of readers, in the same way that Catch 22 will (although that made a great film as well). Buy this book and ENJOY."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think that this book was fairly good book.

It is different from other books and kept very realistic at the same time without getting to fictionous. So get this book or else! My favorite part of the book was the &quot;World Series&quot; Battle. It was a battle of both mental and power strength. And this is the type of &quot;power&quot; that isn't a physical aspect."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I know it's supposed to be a classic. But this book was very challenging for me, a 13-year-old, so I wasn't able to get much out of it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey depicts lives of two very unusual characters who are both living in a state of denial. Although the novel's point of view is by a character named Chief Bromden, whose life is cloaked with mystery and pretends that he's both mute and dumb, making him less and less noticeable. Then we are introduced to a redhead menace who, like Chief Bromden, fakes his madness to avoid paying dues through work. Although he's open with the fact that he fakes his sanity, while the other patients dare not bother questioning his sanity. Not because McMurphy treats the other patients but the fact that they think that McMurphy is their savior, the one that will pull them out of the \`fog'. Through series of events Bromden and McMurphy's interaction grew and became friends when McMurphy's conflict with the evil foe, Nurse Ratched. Their conflict grew to the point where McMurphy rebelled and planned to escape from the institution with Bromden, but rebellion can only go so far and consequences were right behind McMurphy. The author's persuasive voice causes the readers to feel what the narrator's, Chief Bromden, feeling, seeing, and his knowledge about a man who sought freedom from a capitalized world that they lived in. This particular author makes the readers have ease with the pace of the novel without any hesitations. I personally recommend this novel to anyone who adores novels that makes them feel as though they are having a conversation with the narrator (i.e. The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger and The Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers). One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest, is an amazing, compelling novel that makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew over the Cuckoos Nest is a story of the life of Chief Bromden, a Native American patient of an insane asylum. He tells the story of his experience through the eyes of an individual that hides his identity by living a little white lie; pretending to be deaf. The characters treat him naively, being ignorant to the fact that his act of playing dumb is only an escape for him. Not till the day that Mc Murphy checks into the ward and causes a disturbance resulting in the individual characters revealing themselves to the rest of the ward does Chief Bromden learn more about himself, his past, and his potentials. Mc Murphy challenges the boundaries of everyone's personalities and engages with their extremes. The individuals that were once hiding behind their rejection from society now learn who they are and how to achieve their prospective. They make themselves heard, and learn to experience. They learn to engage and interact with another and their surroundings. Mc Murphy, the leader of the pack and cause of disturbance to the ward, takes advantage of his role. His entering upon the asylum is based on attempt to escape from the outside world, and therefore claims to be in need of help as an excuse for his lack in character. He is portrayed as the Hero; he has no inclination of leaving before his job is done and before all limits are tested. Not before it's too late does he realize what his intentions in life really are, but his chance freedom has already passed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a look at the characters in an insane asylum in Oregon. A man named McMurphy comes onto the ward, faking being insane to get out of jail. The books is basically his interactions with the patients and how he rebels against the Big Nurse. It is incredibly detailed and is really a great book to read. In addition to reading this, I also recommend that you watch the movie starring Jack Nicholson. It is good to see two different perspectives on the story."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Expressive style. A sad, horrific story of power and vulnerability. Get it in hardback."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. A fascinating, lurid, and disturbing look at the inner workings of a mental institution, this book had me in its grip right from the first page. This is a seminal work in the history of American counter-culture in the second half of the twentieth century, and is a watershed moment in American literature in general. Along with _Siddhartha_ by Herman Hesse, this is the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and in my expert opinion, the greatest work of fiction ever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have never read a book that has changed the way I think more than this one has. This book truly made me think about the way I think and act, and how society has such a large impact on my life. It is a very personal and insightful book about the way society changes the way we think and act, and how we have to be ourselves and find our own place in society.The story is told through the eyes of an Indian who pretends to be deaf and dumb so that no one will bother him. He tells the story of a new patient who is introduced into the ward. He is nothing like that of the others, and his name is RP McMurphy. He quickly becomes the leader of the patients, always trying one scheme or another to get on Nurse Ratched's nerves. Through these \\"battles\\" of sorts, McMurphy eventually comes up with a showdown with the Nurse.When I first got this book, I started reading it and felt totally lost. My English teacher had recommended the book, and so I chose it as my book for our project. But after reading the first few chapters, I didn't understand anything that was going on. The Chief's viewpoint was so very unique, and I have never read any other book that is like it. I then made the decision to watch the movie first. I know most people are totally against this, but it actually benefited me. I thought the movie was excellent, and already I understood so much more about the portion of the book that I had read already. I quickly zipped through the rest of the book, stumbling much less than I had before.If there was ever a movie that was so similar to its book, it is this one. And because of this fact, it made my reading of the book much more enjoyable. I hope that you will go out and buy this book, and the movie, as both are truly classics."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey uses both shock and humor to express his exasperation with the paranoid and oppressive society we live in. He also brings to our attention the unjust conditions existing in mental institutions at that time. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, is a great classic and still highly regarded book today. The book takes place at an insane asylum, where Randle McMurphy tries to take over Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is a man from a work farm that comes there because he got into to many fights at his farm and thought to be insane. Really, his purpose is to get out of his work duty and relax in a nice building out of the sun. When he gets to the ward right away he gets in a battle with Nurse Ratched challenging her authority. He does not like how she has total control over everyone in the hospital. This book kept me entertained trying to think of what McMurphy was going to do next to the Nurse.The book is told through they eyes of Chief Bromden. It is interesting reading the story from his perspective. He is a really tall and big Native American man. Everyone in the hospital thinks that he is deaf and mute but really, he does it to protect himself. He is considered one of the vegetables on the ward but Randle finds out his secret and takes him out of his mute state. In the end though, it's like the old saying, \\"everything that goes around, comes around.\\"There are many other characters that add a lot to this story including the horrible Nurse Ratched and Billy Bibbit. I would recommend this book for everyone and if you have to read a classic for school, this is the one. It kept my interest all the way through the book, and that is quite odd for me."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one that should be read by any dedicated reader. Although the beginning two chapters are a little difficult to get into, the rest of the book picks up a lot of speed. Parts of the end of the book are a bit confusing, but it adds to the plot. This story of a mental ward and the people that are there gives excellent insight into a whole different world. The characters were very well developed and easily loved or hated. Kesey did a marvelous job delving into the minds of those on a mental ward. He gave a veiw point that is both rare and enjoyable."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had heard so much praise of this book, I just had to read it. I approached it excitedly... yet, I thought, perhaps I would be disappointed, perhaps I wouldn't find it such a good book as everyone else?Guess what, I did.Even though it was written some while ago, it's still pretty modern. Ocurrences, events, memories, they're here, breathinga and alive, in this day and age, in our society. Much has changed, fortunately, but much still needs to reform, to be thought over.Read it. You'll never be the same again"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"An iconoclast who likes a good time ends up in a mental institution. He threatens the status quo, and hence the power structures embodied in the tyrannical head nurse.A struggle develops between the two, as various escapades escalate to the not so pleasant conclusion. Rather well done."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You know the plot. Rebellion against authority. You've seen it re-hashed a hundred times, but never treated this well. In Cuckoos Nest, Kesey has made the authority palpably evil - malicious and vindictive. He's made the innocents perfectly pitiable. He's made the rescuer a brash brawler fueled by testosterone - not admirable, but respected all the same.The Big Nurse embodies the tyranny of small minds who gain power, absolute power, over those who are helplessly subject to them. She rules with cold authority over her ward of mental patients, twisting them inside so that they'll never escape her machinations until Randall McMurphy appears in the ward, having conned his way in to avoid work detail in prison. Thus begins a battle of the wills that is full of high comedy and tragic results.Even told through the perspective of a giant Indian mental patient, McMurphy's acts are not glossed over as the pranks of a fun-loving mischevious kid. The hatred that he and all patients on the ward have for the Big Nurse seeps out of the pages. McMurphy's goal is to make them into men, not cowering rabbits, and his final Pyrrhic victory transforms the men around him.This is a modern classic that you will not be able to forget."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was at first slow, but as I read on, I realized how well written it is. Wanting to see what I was getting myself into, I read a brief summary and decided that it was going to be a tedious read. As I was reading, I thought my assumption to be correct until McMurphy was committed and brought some excitement to the ward. From there on, I could not put this book down. I became intrigued by the behavior of the patients. It was not until I finished the book that I realized what I read could have actually been complete nonsense. The novel is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden, one of the three patients that are actually committed to the asylum. I began to question the accuracy of the observations seeing that he could have been biased towards McMurphy and made him larger-than-life since he was one of the other committed patients. Then, I began to question the entire novel because the situations that seemed so peculiar, even for an asylum, because the narrator may have actually been insane. Not only was he committed, Chief Bromden was also a chronic, considered to be in a more serious state that the acutes, which further discredits his account. Regardless of the accuracy of Chief Bromden's narrative, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was really well written and incited me to really think beyond the surface."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I absolutely loved Ken Kessey's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. While I have to admit that at first I thought the book was boring and slow and would have to force myself to finish it, I was extremely pleased at the turn the novel takes when McMurphy is first introduced. When he arrives and challenges Nurse Ratched's authority, the novel takes a turn and becomes a both exciting and capitvating story. It brought back memories of 8th grade English and mob mentality and the way in which just one individual has the power to make change as well as the recurring theme of one versus the many. In the ward the patients are obviously the many, yet it's Nurse Ratched who controls every last detail of their sad lives. McMurphy's boisterous and determined personality gives Kesey's book the right amount of light hearted fun to balance out the gloomy reality of the patient's lives. While shocking, the gripping end provides the appropriate amount of closure to the novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I first read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest about two years ago and was fascinated and stunned by its story then. In reading it for a second time, it has forcefully nestled itself into place as one of my most favorite books.This novel tackles essentially every single \\"black and white\\" theme that, as an English student, I have ever been told to take note of. The following themes run rampant: feminine vs. masculine, nature vs. nurture, individual vs. public/society, the societial \\"machine\\", reality and perspective -- all that wonderful literature-nougat. But Kesey's novel is not just the ironic setting of these themes in an insane asylum, but rather how the presentation of the themes reflect upon modern society. This makes Kesey's novel not only effective on the level of eerie and palpitating language, but as a tool of modern social commentary.In the 'insane' microsociety of a mental hospital, where the patients are kept on their inability to assimilate into normal society, the rules and paradoxes of normal society persist. This in turn shifts the scrutiny onto modern American society, giving Kesey's novel the combined force of an eloquent and engulfing story and the persuasion of a social/political activist.The movie is also well worth the rental, if not just for a young and crazy Jack Nicholson/Danny DeVito."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I started this book having to work hard to understand what was going on, but as the plot and character development progressed, I found that it was not just because I had my head stuck in summer break- the transitions that the narrator swings through in tense, place and time do wonders for the reader to understand the process that Bromden is going through. They start in a place where his thoughts and analyzations of his surroundings are so removed from reality that the reader has to trudge through pages, maybe even rereading a few, to get at what he is actually seeing. That was overall my favorite aspect of this book, seeing Bromden became more and more aware and interactive with his environment and friends through his own admission of it as well as the literary style involved in his metamorphosis."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest offers a powerful indictment of society's skewed perception and treatment of the mentally ill. The most striking aspect of the novel is that despite the fact that dictatorial Big Nurse renders the patients in the ward powerless as she forces them to accept their rank as weak and inferior members of society, Mc Murphy is able to revolutionize their way of thinking--he transforms them from spineless individuals lacking conviction and self confidence into fearless challengers of hierarchy and conformity. In addition to assessing the psychological effects of social rejection and questioning the validity of society's characterization of insane individuals, the book contains characters and underlying themes which lend it broader political and cultural relevance. Kesey ultimately proves that regardless of how thoroughly establishments seek to wield power and impose conformity upon the populace, the indomitable human will cannot be extinguished."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I rather enjoyed the book, \\"One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" While many parts are somewhat tedious, there are a few humorous scenes and the ending is both surprising and fitting. Ken Kesey's novel is a poignant tale about one man willing to fight against the norm. In an insane asylum, the \\"God\\" of the lunatics' world is Nurse Ratched. Ruling with an iron fist, she goes unchallenged for many years, until a new inmate, Patrick McMurphy comes in. Breaking every rule and for once brining humor and laughter into the patients' lives, McMurphy sets the asylum upside down. Despite attempts to break his spirit, McMurphy goes on trying to change, even though the odds are against him, although he is far from being a hero. Loud, gambling, whoring, and drinking, McMurphy is far from the typical hero. Despite his faults, he still manages to change and touch many people's lives through his infectious laughter, and his unwillingness to give up. While it was a struggle to read the beginning, the ending is worthwhile."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of my favorite books that we have ever had to read for school. Ken Kesey gives the reader a brilliant and personal insight into the lives of those labeled \\"insane\\" by society and their incessant struggles with the Combine, their families, each other, and themselves. Along with this uncensored portrayal of the insane asylum is an underlying and inspirational message of strength through determination. Towards the end of the novel, Chief Bromden writes: \\"If you don't have a reason to wake up you can loaf around in that gray zone for a long, fuzzy time, or if you want to bad enough I found you can come fighting right out of it\\" (249). Although these words are written in relation to Bromden's recovery from a shock treatment, they apply to the rest of the novel and life. This book is brilliant and enjoyable- I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I've read that Kesey (a definitive 60's icon) was upset that the popular movie by the same name didn't follow the format of the book: being narrated by Chief Bromden. Even so, I thought it was a great movie with one of Jack Nicholson's best performances. Now about the book.The book contained deeper aspects, such as the Combine and the Fog and vivid descriptions of hallucinations that let the reader into the psychotic mind--if anyone would want to...I think the benefit of the book lies in helping shed light on mental illness, how mentally ill people can be harmed by opressive institutions and on the theraputic value of uplifting the human spirit."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I literally just got finished reading the book about 15 minutes ago and felt obligated to write a review on it. Not on the basis that I felt I had to but more so on the fact that what this book has to offer is tremendously endearing and lasting. I came into the book having all ready watched the movie before hand but trust me, the movie is good but does the book no justice what so ever. The vivid mental images this book aides you in crafting is a testament to how well written and constructed the book is. I personally felt as if I was one of the characters walking alongside Chief and McMurphy as they endured all the day to day struggles of being in a mental ward. Let me just say that as well as the aforementioned claim relating the book and the movie is very true, I would also like to add that they are VERY different and because of this I recommend the book for all 3 reasons I am about to state.1. You want to read the book, and then watch the movie.2. You have watched the movie and in effect would like to read the book.3. You have the slightest notion that you might be interested in reading a book, PERIOD!!!And with this mentioned I would like to leave the rest to you fellow Amazon buyers, I certainly hope that this one will not fly over the cuckoos nest of your book library."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"after seeing the movie of the same name and saw that it was based off of a novel i searched for the novel until now i have found it and i am very happy i found it"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What makes Nurse Ratched one of the most memorable villains in all of literature is that, the further we read, the less clear it is what exactly makes her so evil. When McMurphy shows up at the mental ward, the setup of the battle of good vs. evil couldn't be more obvious: He's big, brash, and rebellious; Nurse Ratched is cold, controlling, and manipulative. Ostensibly she is in charge of the mental ward, but her influence runs deeper than merely setting the patients' schedule and telling them what they can and can't do. Somehow, she has the entire mental ward, including the staff, cowed. McMurphy aims to fix that.He is mostly successful at implementing his agenda. He wins the patients' rights to play cards, watch the World Series, and leave the hospital to go fishing, but none of these victories seem to have any weight. Nurse Ratched maintains control, and she wears McMurphy down with kindness and patience. Over time, he begins to question his own motives. He, along with the reader, loses clarity of purpose.Who is Nurse Ratched, and what is the source of her power? Author Ken Kesey gives us several clues. She's about 50 years old, never married, and, by the inmates' description of her, quite beautiful in her youth. But she is completely asexual. By my read, she possesses but one feminine quality, which she executes with nun-like precision: motherhood.That is key. A woman is not a mother without children. But ask any mother, and she will tell you the hardest thing she ever did was let her children leave the nest. Some mothers, in fact, do not let their children leave. We hear of successful grown men who continue to live with their parents. We condemn those men, and rightly so. But also deserving condemnation are the parents who enable them, specifically the mothers who keep their grown children in perpetual dependency.Whether Nurse Ratched is fulfilling her biological instinct or just relishes power over others is irrelevant. The effect is the same. She keeps the inmates of the mental ward dependent on her care. No doubt this is made easier by the fact that the mental ward is populated by weak and disturbed minds. It works on the staff and, temporarily, McMurphy, because dependency is a seductive state of mind. The success of Europe's post-war socialist politics speak to that fact.But the purpose of a mental ward is to rehabilitate its patients so they can reenter society. Unlike women, who become women naturally, men must learn to become men. By denying her patients the freedom to become men, she is robbing them of any chance at rehabilitation.

I order everytim and make me happy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken KeseyIf you are ever feeling rebellious or confined, this novel a wild unruly man who pretends to be mentally ill to escape jail is for you. Written in 1962, it reflects the strong sense of conformity during the fifties and also the ineffectiveness of drugs during the psychedelic sixties, and the author himself was paid to take LSD in a government-sponsored experiment he volunteered for before writing the book. Narrated from the perspective of Chief Bromden, a half-Indian who fakes his muteness in order to hear the secrets of the ward, the book keeps the reader going the whole way through with some cynicism, but also humor. The movie is also wonderful, winning five Oscars and starring Jack Nicholson."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One of my fondest memories of English class in high school is reading this book. Coupled with a teacher who was passionate about reading and literature, of course. Ken Kesey is a master at creating unique quirky characters that have a purpose and a place in his stories. This is a great inside track into the life of patient in a psychiatric hospital - seeing things from that perspective is interesting and eye opening. But more than that the moral of this story is touching and relevant and really stuck with me. This is a classic and a list topper for all high school book lists!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the only books I've ever called perfect, but it really is. The character development is perfect, the character interaction is spot-on, the metaphors and similes are perfectly chosen. The book is not too long, not too short, never lags, remains interesting even when the author veers of the primary plot into the subplots. There's just enough \\"showing\\" and no \\"telling.\\" This book's metaphor is wonderful as well (to me, I feel as though the hospital symbolizes America, the staff symbolizes its government, and the patients symbolize the people--and more specifically what happens to the people when they try to \\"speak up\\"). Of course, when a book is perfect it can mean many things to many people. There's simply nothing wrong with this book. I've read it four times and haven't found a flaw yet. Probably because it's perfect!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I know this is going to sound weird, but this is one of the most positive, beautiful books I've ever read. I know, it seems to be one tragedy after another, especially ultimately for our hero...well, my hero...one RP McMurphy. But what would you have done? Left those men there like that? What's that one quote from that other book, \\"no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his brother\\" (or something like that). When I have it to give and I see someone is in need, this book comes to mind. It's made me walk around with some kind of glow ever since I read it about 15 years ago. I hope it will help you be more of a \\"just listen to what people have to say, and don't pass judgement\\" kind of person too(if you're not that already).While all this is going on, Ken Kesey doesn't let up! You get the feeling he's as excited about writing the book as it is to read. No detectable style, just real great storytelling. With the emphasis on real. This is my favorite book of all time. Oh, I liked the movie and am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, but even he's not the material's equal. Get a copy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I have two versions of this book - english and german.I think the movie is a good adaptation, but the book is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Very intense, well written novel depicting the type of care used in the treatment of mental illnesses.At this date, it seems almost implausible that such a cold, calculated and cruel approach was considered therapeutic.But if one looks over the history of treatment of mental illness through many years, it was just another step towards a more humane approach, even though what is being used at the present day is still far from perfect."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Set in a mental hospital, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a fiction novel by Ken Kesey, describes how R.P. McMurphy, a very spirited patient, takes over not only his ward, but the Head Nurse and other patients as well. He takes extreme measures to make the other patients basically come out of their shells and stand up to Nurse Ratched. The story is told by a schizophrenic patient called Chief Bromden, who all of the other patients and authoritative figures believe to be both deaf and dumb. The battles between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are what bring the story its most interesting points.I found this book to be quite hard to read. The words got kind of confusing at times, and the descriptions of different things seemed drawn out. Most people find this book fun to read, and I think I would have too if I wouldn't had had to read it for school. That always seems to make a difference. I would recommend One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to anyone who enjoys books involving mental hospitals, interesting plots, medical studies, or the main character always fighting for what he believes in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful book that reveals the cold hard truth about life in a mental institution. Seeing the ward through the eyes of the main character, Chief Bromden, gives new prospective to what you think you know. The thing that makes it most interesting is the fact that it is so real you feel as though you are there on the ward, forced to be part of their daily rituals. Ken Kesey paints a picture that makes you want to believe that what Chief Bromden is experiencing is what is actually happening. But at the same time the language Kesey uses makes it hard to decide whether or not things are really happening to Chief. You find yourself thinking, 'This is all a hallucination...isn't it?'You begin to form an almost personal relationship with each of the characters throughout the book. The relationship between the two main characters is powerful and intriguing. The problems each character is experiencing are problems we have all had, just not to the same extent. This familiarity is what makes the book so easy to relate to, it takes what we all experience and expands to an almost unbelievable level."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It's sad to think that so many people have only seen the movie - I think I was lucky in that I read the book first. The book is sooooooooo stirring and heartfelt."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book has all the classical characters that make it interesting...you got the wicked Nurse Ratched whom I couldn't get enough of and cuckoo McMurphy whose antics were fun to read about and all the fun everyone had in the book regardless of them being at a mental hospital....A must read!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Bromden's hallucinations are terrifying, and they are one of the book's central components. The movie fails to vividly depict the Chief as schizophrenic. Overall, the movie couldn't tap the novel's layered, visually stunning look into the dynamics of defining and categorizing insanity. Better then Prozac Nation which is what our generation got-- but I'm interested in Short of a Picnic, the one about all different mental maladies in a collection. Also, Nicholson doesn't have red hair, like Kesey's envisioned, but his performance was a worthy approximation of the character's spirit."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Since reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest recently, it has rapidly become my favourite book. Kesey has managed to tell a story whilst making a complex political allegory, and that is incredibly refreshing. The characters are so vivid, both loveable and sometimes vile, and Kesey finds the balance between making their exploits humorous, and not patronising the patients of the asylum. McMurphy is a classic hero, but far more complex than most so-called Christ-like figures in literature. The Chief however steals the show for me. The writing during the time he tells how alcoholism is destroying his Father is incredibly moving. Using the Chief as the omnipresent narrator is a superb device employed by Kesey, as it allows a unique, personal and sometimes confusing insight into all the proceedings. Like all great literature, it makes you think, but does it with a unique sense of humour and character, and handles its heavy subject matter with ease: this is a simple read but devastatingly effective. The end of the book is both sad and yet also happy. That adjective sums up the book perfectly- happysad."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kessy is a wonderful collection of similes, metaphors and parallels that make all the different characters the unique characters they are. All of the characters bring certain traits to table and that's what makes this book what it is. This book takes place in a mental ward that becomes disrupted when Patrick McMurphy is admitted into it. He turns the usually calm regulated world of the ward upside down and spins it all the way around. He defies the Big Nurse whenever he can and loves it. He turns lots of the other patients against the big nurse and it turns into a full fledged rebellion going fishing illegally with a girl who turns out to be a prostitute, having parties until the wee hours of the morning with prostitutes, and finally killing McMurphy, the leader of the rebellion because he becomes a vegetable. This book is the best one I've read in a long time. Ken Kessy brings the characters to life and makes you feel like your right in alongside Chief Bromden and McMurphy. It's a very good book and I suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is perfect, about a few people in a mental institution, who strive to overthrow the combine of society. It feels real, yet not real at the same time. Happy and sad. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey is a fascinating writer. He draws you in with a unique story with several implications. It kind of makes you wonder who really belongs in the ward. McMurphy provides his peers with encouragement and hope. The horrid Nurse Ratched is a character you'll just love to hate (reminiscent of Rebecca's Mrs. Danvers...or at least I thought so).If you have seen the Academy Award-winning film with Jack Nicholson (and you'll be a bit surprised to see a much younger Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd), you know how great the story is. However, the book is undoubtedly better than this great film. If you haven't seen the film, begin with the book.I only hope Ken Kesey's other books are this good (apparently he died a few months ago)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's first book is widely regarded as his best and is a witty and subtle look at the \\"machinery\\" and \\"fog\\" that is society. Well written and very addictive, this book is ostensibly about mental patients in a ward dominated by an oppressive and evil nurse. Yet it is really an allegory on many levels. It works as a biblical allegory because, although R. P. McMurphy has a shady past and his behavior is by no means perfect, he does indeed try to set the men free by freeing their spirits. Throughout this book Kesey uses imagery and symbolism to drive home his point. The indellible image of McMurphy on a cross-shaped bed about to be shocked into submission further proves this. It works as a societal allegory. Nurse Ratched and Co. are the ruthless enforcers of an invisible code, their power coming from apathy (or ignorance) on higher levels, or it is given willingly because nobody else will get their hands dirty. There is a lot more to this book, it is an engrossing and memorable experience. If you are thinking of renting the movie instead, I actually would recommend seeing the film first. Why? Because, as is always necessary, the film preserves the same themes from the book and has virtuoso acting from everyone, especially Jack. The woman that they got to play Ratched is excellent too. If you watch the movie first, it works as a good intro to the deeper, more complex book. Anyway, this is a book with a message that is still relevant today and imagery that will envelop you as sure as diving into the deep end of a pool. Enjoy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Dear Mr. Kesey, I recently read your book for an English paper.

We see the psychiatric ward through his eyes and cheer him on as he conquers the lonely comfort of the fog. Kesey simultaneously removes the veil of fog from the eyes of his readers.

I think it's not really the subject matter that is so beautiful -- you know, individuality vs. authority, tho that is a good starting point -- it's just that Kesey has such a wonderful grasp on language that it leaps off the page and grabs you by the throat time and time again. By the way, if you like this book, and haven't read Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,&quot; it's got great descriptions of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters going all over the country creating sheer havoc while Kesey was working on this novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"More than any other book I've ever read, Mr. Kesey's book helped me cope with life.

Seen through the eyes of a madman, this book leads us through a whole different world; a world where paranoia runs rampant and chaos is second in command only to The Big Nurse. The book opens with a vivid description of &quot;the fog&quot; that clouds the truth, consciousness, paranoia, and terror which imprison the mind of Chief Bromden, a chronically insane Indian and the first person narrator of the book. Scene by scene, the plot unravels, separating truth and insanity to reveal an extraordinary war of the mind; the power of strict, systematic control, verses the power of rebellion. Any of the acutes that lived on this ward could state in a heartbeat the ultimate source of power; The Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched. That is, until convict Randall Patrick McMurphy convinces the courts that he is a madman, laughing his way from the prison farmyards to the nuthouse dayroom, &quot;bucking the system&quot; at every bump. When Ratched meets McMurphy, it's battle from the start. The Nurse uses her strong intimidation, backed with logic, reason, and &quot;the system&quot;, against Randall's boisterous rebellion, fueled with chaos, brawn, and temptation, both striving to attain the support of the deciding party; the acute insane patients and those chronics who are still enough there to vote the outcome. The magnificent war the follows stretches the mind to comprehend and tickles the imagination. At every turn in the plot, action is pursuing, leaving the reader to contemplate while providing nonstop laugh-out-loud entertainment. Kesey ties together the shoes of character, theme, and conscience, giving them a quick shove from behind to create the shocking climax that will change the book completely."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'm an 11th grader in High school and Im one of those slackers that doesn't like reading at all.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A half-American Native American named Chief Bromden narrates the story. He's been in the mental hospital since the end of World War 2. He deceives everyone by pretending to be deaf and mute, however he is not. He believes society is just like a machine-always being controlled-and calls it \\"The Combine\\". A criminal named Randle McMurphy is sent from prison to the mental hospital for being charged with battery and gambling. He was also charged with statutory rape. He is sent to the mental hospital thinking it is an easy way to complete his time sentenced. Although, he soon realizes it is not as easy as it seems. Nurse Ratched is an unfair and cruel woman. She is the head nurse of the hospital and does not think twice about restricting her patients from their medication or essential needs.The main conflict, or serious argument, that was continuous was the way all of the patients were treated as if they were not real people. The conflict being character vs. machine. The patients are treated as experiments; Nurse Ratched is not in the least bit interested in actually helping them. Shock treatment is used with the patients to help solve a dispute, however it only destroys them.One of the prime plot events that occur in the story is when McMurphy arranges for a boating trip with the other men. He wants them to know that they are true individuals rather than just being seen as a \`patient'. When you're a patient, you're just like everyone else. Nonetheless, he takes them out into the real world so that they can see that they are and can be independent. Another major plot event that took place was when McMurphy found out he was one of the only people from his group that was actually committed to the mental hospital. The other patients were there by choice. They had the freedom to walk out any time they pleased but they chose not to. They were all there in the hospital because they chose to be, which makes an impact on McMurphy. Nurse Ratched has brainwashed them so much they don't even realize what is happening to them or that they have lost their individuality.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! I loved that it was nothing like anything I have ever read before. Something I absolutely enjoyed reading about was the way McMurphy wanted to be independent no matter what, and he wasn't going to let anyone annihilate him. I just loved reading about the way the patients thought of themselves as crazy, but McMurphy was not going to let them think that about themselves. He knew deep inside that they were each a unique individual and tried to bring life back into them. I found it extremely interesting how Nurse Ratched continuously tried to suck the life out of her patients while her job was to try and help them. The patients were so brainwashed by her actions, they began to believe she was nice and trying to assist them. She is an evil woman who wishes malicious things on her patients.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading it! It's so unique, that you have never read a book similar to this before. You get such different perspectives from different people, and how their outlook on life is. If you've ever wondered what goes through the minds of mentally ill people, then this is definitely the book for you. Even if you have never wondered that before, if you read this book you will not be disappointed! Throughout the story you get attached to the characters, and there is such great suspense throughout the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Those looking for an elaborately conceived dominatrix fantasy set in a mental hospital in Oregon can hardly do better than \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" one of the twentieth century's most infamous period pieces, ranking with \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Slaughterhouse-Five,\\" and \\"Naked Lunch\\" in the category of comic violence rendered as artistic expression and social commentary.The events of the ward in which the principal action takes place are narrated by \\"Chief\\" Bromden, a hulking half-Indian who often lapses into anecdotes from his childhood (the novel's title refers to one of his grandmother's rhymes) and whose pretense of deafness allows him to eavesdrop in sensitive administrative discussions while performing his janitorial duties. From Bromden we get a clear picture of the clinical division of the patients--Acutes who are \\"still sick enough to be fixed\\" and Chronics who are \\"in for good\\"--and of the methods used to care for them and keep them in line, which include occasional electro-shock therapy and lobotomies.The ward is in the hands of Nurse Ratched, a strict disciplinarian just short of a tyrant. We learn very little about her background, but it is obvious she has much experience as a psychiatric nurse because she is masterful in the way she browbeats and controls her patients (all of them male) through psychological methods like imposition of guilt and deprivation of privileges, while the orderlies act as a sadistic sort of police force. The only other figure of authority is a meek male doctor named Spivey, who is decent enough to fraternize, if not sympathize, with the patients.One day a new patient enters the ward--a petty criminal named Randle Patrick McMurphy who is apparently sane but is feigning insanity to get out of incarceration at a work farm. Jocose and gregarious, he warmly introduces himself to everybody in the ward and encourages them to have more fun, which to him means card gambling and taking the guys out on a fishing trip. Of course, his measures conflict with Nurse Ratched's rules and result in what is essentially a struggle for power; she tries to diminish his influence on the other patients by hinting to them that he's really only taking advantage of their gullibility and making money off of them.One criticism I have is that the main characters are not as fully developed as they could be; Bromden, the Nurse, and even McMurphy seem somewhat thin for the considerably demanding requirements of their roles. More appealing to me were two other patients--the sententious Harding, who has a knockout for a wife and observes the folly of the ward with a cheerfully ironic sense of humor; and Billy Bibbit, a bashful, suicidal stutterer with an overprotective mother. I would have preferred Harding over Bromden as the narrator, but of course that would have necessitated changing the tone of the entire novel.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is often said to be allegorical in its depiction of the rebel versus the establishment, but that aspect of it doesn't really interest me because Kesey doesn't even try to be subtle about it; no, I think the novel's value is in the sheer momentum of its narrative, which burns like the fuse on a stick of dynamite. Even for those who have never seen Milos Forman's fantastic 1975 film version of the novel, the sense that the story is leading up to something big and explosive is palpable and pulsating."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I must admit that I had seen the movie before I read the book.

I think the real reason, however, is that Ken Kesey's writing and descriptions totally immerse you in his view, HIS characters, that these characters come alive themselves, without my own avatars needed.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in an Insane Asylum through the eyes of \\"Chief\\" Bromden, a half-Indian half-white-man who keeps the appearance of being deaf and dumb. The main character, however, is not the Chief, it is Randal Patrick McMurphy-a wild fun-loving individual that likes his life to be his own. However, the authority, the Big Nurse, will have nothing of him living by his own rules on her ward. This escalates into an all-out war between McMurphy and his love of life against the Nurse with all the power.This stpry is truly one of my favorite stories ever. It weaves such a beautiful tale full of points that make you look at yourself and your own actions and ways differently. This is a life-changing novel, written by a true psychological artist."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Don't watch the movie before you read the book! This book has a little bit of everything in it and it's funny, catchy and crazy all at the same time. I'm not going to describe the plot like everyone else, just read this. It takes hardly any time to read but it's a great book and the author describes things very well. Make sure you know what all the words mean (ie. the diagnoses, etc) before you read though!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest, by Ken Kesey, is a novel about rebellion over power and control. Set in a mental hospital, the novel is told thru the eyes of a Native American named Chief Bromden. One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest is a story about how fear can make you do what others tell you to do and how hope can change things around for you. Two of the central characters of the novel represent these emotions, namely, Nurse Ratched, fear; and McMurphy, hope. By following the interactions of these two personalities, the reader sees how their behavior can change the lives of others.All patients in the psychiatric ward are classified as being Acute, able to be cured, or Chronic, those who behavior leads to electroshock therapy or lobotomies. The staff in the mental hospital is mean and cruel and is led by the Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched. But things change when a new patient, Randle Patrick Mc Murphy arrives. Mc Murphy is different than the other patients as he constantly refuses to do what he is told. He openly dislikes Nurse Ratched and eventually convinces the other men to do the same. This is easily seen when Nurse Ratched turns off the power to the television and Mc Murphy has the patients sit with him and watch the blank screen. When McMurphy learns that Nurse Ratched decides when he can leave the hospital, he begins to follow the rules better. However, the suicide of another patient puts McMurphy back on the rebellious track and he smashes a glass window to get at cigarettes. McMurphy takes some of the patients on a fishing trip despite Nurse Ratched&#65533;s warnings of danger. Ratched becomes furious at McMurphy for defying her power and tries to get the patients suspicious of him. This works for a while but then McMurphy and the Chief get in a fight with hospital aides who are mistreating another patient. McMurphy and the Chief both receive electric shock treatments for this action and are now seen as heroes by the other patients. Some of the Acutes now feel strong and are ready to leave the hospital but they see that McMurphy is becoming weak and plan his escape. But McMurphy is unwilling to leave since he promised a friend, Billy Babbitt, a chance to have sex with a prostitute. When Nurse Ratched finds Billy in bed with the prostitute, Billy kills himself out of fear of punishment. McMurphy becomes furious and tries to strangle Nurse Ratched. He is sent to be lobotomized and when he returns, the Chief suffocates him. The Chief then escapes from the hospital. Chief&#65533;s escape from the mental hospital is a victory for McMurphy. Even though he has died, McMurphy has made Chief free and able to resist authority.Although confusing at times, One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest, is a good story to read. The reader can learn many lessons. Following authority without thinking can be bad to any individual as it leaves one with little individualism. Also, rebellion can be a good thing if it maintains your freedom and your rights."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Truly a literary magnum opus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kessey, is a book one will never forget. The daring novel brings a many subjects and criticisms into light on the world stage. It discusses subjects ranging from the wounds society has inflicted on traditional masculinity, to the treatment and role of women in our twisted civilization. The novel confronts these controversial topics subtly through the footprints of the story, using the setting and characters as a representation backdrop. The mental institution, a micro universe mirroring the crazy world we inhabit today. The story is told through the eyes of \\"Chief,\\" a Native American who willingly enrolls himself into the hospital posing as a deaf-mute. As the story evolves, the chief evolves as a human being, taking the reader along for the ride. And I suggest this ride for anyone with an open mind. This isn't the average novel; therefore I don't recommend it to the average reader. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a psychological masterpiece that pulls you in, takes you through the \\"Shock Shop,\\" locks you in solitary, and throws you right back out. This novel will change the way any reader looks and thinks about life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I read this book it was so confusing in the beginning but, in the end that is what made the book so wonderful. This book really shows you how to expand your way of reading a book. The main character McMurphy gave people hope; he taught others how to not get pushed around and fight back. Letting them know that they have rights. I felt that he was a very strong leader. He set the bar for others.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the real reason about why there are no more \\"Cuckoo's Nests\\". The author showed the whole country about the punishment that these inmates were getting. Just with this simple book he changed the whole counry. I am glad that he wrote this book because not many writers would have the courage to write something so powerful. The real question is \\"Was getting ride of Mental Hospital for the good or bad?\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"when I first picked up this book to read for extra credit in English, I thought &quot;hm, interesting...wonder what it's like.&quot; the girl next to me was also reading it, but she quit after the first three chapters...I finished it...and loved it. no joke. It was like I found myself in the world of someone who, like me, observed rather than acted. The time setting is one of my favorites and the overall plot was great. Another of my favorite 'the struggles of human nature' kinda novels. a great read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I first watched the movie, then read the novel. With respect, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. Milos Forman (The director of &quot;One flew over the cukoo's nest.&quot;) made the movie magical and as entertaining as it can ever get. However, the book is filled with deeper details and themes. In the book, Chief bromden is describing Mcmurphy's behavior and in the movie, we see in perspective of the patience. Either way, it's a masterpiece. I would definitely recommend you with the movie rather than reading the novel in this particular case. I know that some books are far better than the movies but this one is different. Jack Nicholson and the rest of the crue FLIES OVER the CUKOO'S NEST. They are unbelievable. Most importantly, without the book, this movie wouldn't have existed. Thanks to Ken Kessey for his eloquence and passion in bringing this book possible. Wonder lies within you Ken Kessey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"After reading &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,&quot; I was generally satisfied with the story line. The serious novel is told through the eyes of Chief Bromden, an Indian perceived to be deaf and dumb. With the arrival of patient R. P. McMurphy, the mental hospital receives a brutal touch of reality. Loudmouthed, rebellious McMurphy struggles in his attempts to make the hospital's patients assertive. He constantly rebels the authority of the hospital's nurse, Miss Ratched. After hampering Miss Ratched's stolid authority, McMurphy gains the patient's trust. His continuous outbursts are often comedic. Chief Bromden dangerously sheds his cover and communicates with the other patients. During a trip away from the hospital, the patients show a great deal of evolution. Nearing the end of the novel, the plot builds to an unexpected conclusion. In this novel, Kesey relays several adult themes while keeping the novel fun and fast-moving."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The first time that I read this book was in theback of a Grayhound bus from Chicago to San Francisco.I was a sophmore in college and coming out to visitmy brother for the summer. My journey mates includeda teenage runaway couple from Indiana, two drunkenAWOL sailers heading to Vegas and a kindly old fat ladywho fed us beans and tortillas the whole way. As I readthe book I used to imagine that Kesey was on the backof the bus taking notes. Read this book. You willbe moved by it. Kesey is a great writer with a knackfor spinning a tale of enlightment."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Everyone must be familiar with the movie based on this novel by now. It's one of the very few cases where both the novel and the movie (while differing in places) are excellent. I've read this book a number of times, and each time I find it just as enjoyable.It's written from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden, who seems to have a paranoia that given many of the circumstances of his life, have a basis in reality. He's witnessed the crushing subjugation of his people to powers beyond control, his father formerly a strong native American Chief bent and twisted under the weight of it and reduced to alcoholism. Bromden is physically large and powerful, but his beliefs have seen him put away in a mental institution, where he does not speak or give any clues of his intelligence. He appears to be deaf and dumb, but these are his defences against what he calls the Combine.The mental institution however has become a microcosm of his fearful perceptions of the world at large. Presided over by a nurse (Nurse Ratched) who to all appearances is there to help, but whom exercises a dominating control over the inmates and if anything, contributes to their mental health problems.A new inmate comes to the institution, who is everything Bromden is not. McMurphy is loud, gambling, womanising .. a fist-fighting free spirit. He's no hick however, as the Chief sees glimmers of another side to him. McMurphy takes on the nurse, and so directly challenges the Combine.This is tremendous writing. The characters are rendered deeply and convincingly. I would rate this novel as one of the best of all time."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A leadership seminar: power struggle in a mental ward. Alternative wolves fight over rabbit control. The rabbits are sans wham bam, as they sadly concede. (We are all rabbits and we need a good strong wolf to teach us our place.) One of the wolves incites them to grow above themselves. This leads to where it always leads when real power is one-sided and monopolized.What is this novel from 1962, which is included in several \`best books' lists? Is it an allegory on fascistoid systems? Is it Kafka moving into real life? Is it anti-capitalist (as some comments by the narrator, Chief Broom, suggest)? Is it anti-government in general? Or just anti-authoritarian? Is it anti-feminist, as per the attack by our anti-hero McMurphy? (Rape seems to be the only weapon against female wolves? Impotence is women's victory?)Or is it a realistic attack on mental institutions and their practices?Frequently one is disappointed by a film after a book that one liked. Rarely is the film better. In this case here, I had watched the film decades ago and remember that it was one of Jack Nicholson's best performances. I never wanted to watch the movie again though, hence I have no idea if I still like it today. It never occurred to me that I might want to read the book on which the film was based. Good films can do that to me, take away the motivation for the original.For reasons unclear to me, I bought the book now. It is worth while. I just can't figure out if I like it. It must have created a storm when it came out. Its language and subject seem unusual for the time. It seems, according to Wiki, that the novel got adopted by the big movement of the sixties and became something of a movement icon.We enter a micro-cosmos of fascism. The staff in the institution has absolute power and uses it without checks or balances. Inmates are encouraged to spy on each other, as in all proper fascist/communist systems. Inmates have no real chance to be heard, whatever they do proves that whatever is done to them is for the bettering of them.(You have no chance, make sure to use it!)This place even shaves Santa Claus.We watch the world through the eyes and language of Chief Broom, the chronic inmate who pretends to be deaf and mute and is nearly 7 feet tall. He has been the longest \`serving' patient. Only Big Nurse Rat-shed was there before him.The institution's population is structured by status of illness: there are acutes and chronics. The first may come out, the latter never. The treatment that the first receive can make them chronics. But the technicians are learning. There is enough material for learning by doing. The ward is sheer horror.Chronics are either walkers, or wheelers, or vegetables. The words require no explanation.The Chief watches a new admission: \`hero' McMurphy, upbeat, noisy, extrovert, jumping to the top of the patient pecking order, which is no big achievement for a rather sane petty criminal in an environment of harmless people. McM is not really such a nice character, and we side with him against Big Nurse in the course of the developing war only by default. The underdog always wins our sympathies.The book also plays on racist themes. The narrator is a half Indian, which is supposed to absolve him from accusations of racism, maybe. It so happens that the SA team or camp guards are black men, who are on the leash of the she-wolf. There is an undeniable anti-black attitude with plenty of derogative vocabulary. Is a novelist justified in taking real language from real life even if it is offensive? I would think that this language is justified and has its rightful place in a realistic description of society.Chief Broom's world view is rocked by a creature like McMurphy, who fights even when he can't win, and who is sure to know who he is. The Chief takes a look at his own self in the mirror and wonders how it is possible that anybody could manage such an enormous thing as being what he was.In the final reckoning, without wanting to post a spoiler, I concede that the Chief has been set free by McM's heroism.But even more final is that I can't honestly say that I like the novel. Respect, ok, but like? Not really."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of my favorite all-time books. I've read it 5 times.It works on so many levels, and the characters are warm, perverse, individual, violent, confused, insightful, scared, desperate, manipulative... I've found myself laughing out loud at hysterical sequences perfectly described with a truly unique form of writing.It brings a real sense of huaminity to those that are contained within mental hospitals, and brings a new level of understanding inside oneself.The book has changed every time I've read it, and while it's incredibly easy to read, there is so much to see."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Randle Patrick McMurphy is a gambling fool, as he dubs himself in the opening chapters of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Not anyone's standard idea of a hero in the typical novel setting, R.P. McMurphy is easily one of the most original and entertaining characters in all of literature. That may seem like a bold statement but those who read this and don't laugh at least 350 times are utterly devoid of humor. Ken Kesey's bestselling novel takes place on a psychiatric ward in an asylum somewhere in Oregon, a place under the rule of the sadistic Big Nurse, a large-breasted, manipulative woman who oversees the most cunning and precise control of her wing of the hospital with a disturbing and dark devotion. Dedicated to humiliating her patients in group meetings under the veil of therapy, manipulating hospital staff and the doctor of her floor with implications of losing their jobs if they do not comply, and backed by an army of staff aides ready to abuse and subdue any patient who steps out of line, Big Nurse has all the surefire signs of a dictator, until R.P. McMurphy strolls into her ward. A gambling, womanizing, drinking Irish swindler who faked his insanity simply to avoid serving out his full term at an incarcerated workfarm, McMurphy is the cure for the dreary and dark hospital's glooms, instantly invigorating his mentally diminished hospital-mates and even some of the staff with his seemingly unbeatable sense of humor and a will which refuses to be hammered down by the Big Nurse's iron fist.While McMurphy's smooth-talking, fast-paced manner in which he carries himself all begin to show true therapeutic progress in the patients with whom he shares the ward, Big Nurse is none too taken with him and the two soon begin to [...] heads over who holds the throne in her part of the hospital: the tyrannical, control-freak head nurse or the drunken brawler of a life-loving Irishman. Although Big Nurse retains the power to submit any seemingly violent patient to inhumane electric shock-therapy sessions and in the worst cases, lobotomies, she must have just cause for doing so, and McMurphy soon begins to realize there are certain boundaries he must work within if he wants to win the hearts and minds of the ward's patients. Beginning as sport though, the contest soon turns bitter and the two characters begin to develop a true power struggle over who is really running the hospital.Told through the eyes of Big Chief, a committed Columbian Indian who feigns being deaf and dumb to avoid the clutches of the evil hospital's grasp, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is both an exercise in good humor as well as a lesson in life and tragedy. Kesey's command of similes and metaphors are untouchable by just about every writer out there, and his constant ability to use them over and over, yet never letting them get stale, is wholesomely original and impressive. The book has one of the saddest endings I've ever read, and the whole thing might be a metaphor for how the system works to beat down the individual into submitting into the ways of the flock, but most readers will just enjoy the massive amount of characters, all of which are original and developed and contribute an integral amount to the novel's development. It doesn't matter what genre you're into. Just get this and you will not only not be disappointed, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A colorful tale of unexpected oppression and refreshingly unique characters, the psychedelic novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is an entirely singular work. It explores the life of one Chief Bromden, an Indian and White hybrid who, due primarily to the harsh effects of a hypocritical and cruel psychiatric ward, has lost control of his mind and senses.In the novel, Miss Ratched (a name which means to crank up the tension), runs the ward. She employs a strict schedule, has complete control over her patients. The Big nurse can ratchet up the pressure, or bring it to a low. She has the ability to speed up time, in Chief Bromden's state, and to slow it down. This utter control is the goal of the Combine. It represents a society intnet on producing a generation of \\"vegetables,\\" people who are helpless, totally subjugated, and free from any ability to express individual thought or expression.As the novel progresses, and more clues are given, the Combine takes on a more direct meaning. It becomes known as a community or society. It consists of all the poeple who want conformity, want things done in only one way. They do not like change. They do not like individualism. They don't like freedom of expression. So, they surely do not view Randle P. McMurphy from a positive perspective.The Big Nurse's goal of neurotic subjugation, coupled with her brain-scrambling tactics, perpetuates the Chief's state of hallucination. To gain his permanent withdrawal means her simultaneous victory. It is not until Randle P. McMurphy, Ken Kesey's enthusiastically unique character, arrives that the fog shrouding Chief Bromden's eyes begins to recede and he starts to regain his sensory awareness. Thus, this shock-shop veteran lands on a transient vehicle of conciseness, one which treks the darkest, most fear-instilling corners of his mind until, against all odds, the bright light of reality shines through the illusions before him.The story is extremely interesting and powerfully creative. At times, it is difficult to be sure, as a reader, what exactly qualifies as truth or illusion. It is actually more intriguing this way, in that it is up to the reader what they decide to partake as a reality."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a most humorous and disturbing novel and though I can understand why it has been banned, I disagree with the ruling because this book is just too good to ignore. The book deals with themes of control versus freedom and the classic battle between good and evil with a most appalling conclusion and an unusual climax location; the book climaxes only a few pages before the book ends adding only more to the shock and horror one will know upon completion. Miss Ratched, nicknamed Big Nurse, runs a rigid schedule that is compared repetitively throughout the novel to the systematic and never changing operation of a machine. Randle Patrick McMurphy, on the other hand, is a boisterous, red-haired man with a mission of disruption and chaos for the ward and the freedom for the patients to actually be able to make some basic decisions for themselves. The humor in the book is most certainly dark, but nevertheless hilarious and makes the book quite a joy to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In Ken Kesey's debut 1962 novel, con man Randall McMurphy fakes mental illness to avoid serving his time in a prison work camp for a statutory rape charge. (\\"She was fifteen going on thirty-five Doc...\\") The story begins when McMurphy is transferred to an asylum in Oregon. He quickly establishes himself as the \\"Bull goose loony\\" (alpha male...I guess) and introduces gambling, drinking, women and other real life pleasures to the ward. The other timid inmates enjoy these new freedoms, but they go against the harsh rules of Big Nurse Ratchet. The conflict between Nurse Ratchet--backed by the full force of the state--and McMurphy escalates to the very end.This book is funny, well written and at times inspirational. It's definitely could be described as a \\"Modern Classic\\". I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's artistry is spellbinding in its dark humor, dry intellect and over-the-top imagery. The novel is a modern masterpiece whose theme, though outdated, should make any thinking person reconsider the realities, limitations and stereotypes to which we've become accustom as members of society. The characters are rich and engaging. There is both genius and compassion in McMurphy's chaos; beauty in the Chief's dillusions. Never have I read a novel whose daring impressed me so, a novel that instilled such humility in me concerning my perceptions of others and their motivations. Though I am too young to understand much about the politics of the day, I appreciate the opportunity the author has given his readers to catch a glimpse into the minds of an unusual breed of people whom we would otherwise never know or understand."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Extra points for creating an antagonist (Nurse Ratched) who can be beyond evil without giving off the appearance of it.

It gives a fine look at the attitudes that led to the upheaval that occurred in this most turbulant decade.

Personally, I don't care about Chief Bromden's \\"psychotic\\" episodes where he hallucinates into some fog. I was surprised because usually these kind of books interest me. I like to learn about how the human mind works, but McMurphy's constant perversion with the nurse annoyed me a bit. There was sexual tension between them that needed to be released, and wasn't.

The asylum is also broken down into two groups, Acutes and Chronics. Chronics are the hopeless and Acutes are the people that actually think.

This particular book overflows with it. McMurphy might be the main character, but Chief also plays a vital role. He (although mentally ill) views the world as a &quot;machine.&quot; While reading, if you look hard, machine imagery abounds (from the dreaded, prime machine of Nurse Ratched's fingertips to Chief's dream about his friend's machine entrails). The fact that the book is set in a mental institution could not make more sense. Chief views the world through innocent eyes and sees it for what it really is: greedy and control-oriented. After reading this novel, Kesey will have you wondering whether it's the outside world that belongs in a mental institution!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A short summary for those of you who are unaware: In the late 60's a psych ward takes on a new patient by the name of R.P. McMurphy, up until this point the ward has been run with an iron fist by Nurse Ratched aka \\"Big Nurse.\\" When McMurphy enters the ward he instantly befriends the patients and befuddles the staff while making it his personal mission to bring Big Nurse to her knees. What follows is a psychological game of chess between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchet with the stakes being the mental stability of the rest of the ward.This movie has always had a special place in my heart, so it is only natural that eventually I would get around to reading the book. Even though it appears as though the movie was about as faithful to the book as I have ever seen... there are very subtle yet profound differences between the two. The predominant difference is the point of view. The movie, takes the viewpoint of McMurphy where as the book is from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden. Now either the Chief is more disturbed than we are first lead to believe or there is some CRAZY stuff going on in that hospital. I would have to say that a few of the scenes in the book had me puzzled until I realized that good old Chief wasn't exactly playing with a full deck. What we see through his eyes is very disturbing, surreal, and at times the reader finds themselves mentally translating what he is relating into something that we can comprehend as physically possible.There are many themes in this book, the one most people bring up is man vs. the corrupted establishment, but threaded through are also the themes of self reliance, the state of the mental health industry back then, society's blaming anyone who goes against the establishment on mental illness, the power of society in bringing down the individual, then we also touch on the treatment of Native Americans, and a very interesting male vs. female battle. Though I'm not entirely sure what I was supposed to walk away with in regards to all of these themes, this was still a very well written book. The version I read was 278 pages but took me a full week to read. I'm not entirely sure why, but for being so short, it really does read very slowly. I recommend reading this book, it is truly a modern classic, if one still considers the 1970's modern. Either way this is an excellent read and it is extremely engaging, particularly once McMurphy and Big Nurse begin their mental game of chess... each trying to out do the other while maintaining complete composure. It is such a violent and hate filled battle to be fought so subtly. Each play is genius, but the players are never to be out done by one another. Read the book, then watch the movie, both are stellar examples of their craft."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of R.P. McMurphy, a con artist who goes from life on a prison work farm to life inside a mental hospital run by the evil, conniving Nurse Ratched. By refusing to follow \\"ward policy,\\" McMurphy joins forces with the other patients and makes it his sole objective to defy and defeat Nurse Ratched, whatever the cost may be.After purchasing the movie version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I wanted desperately to read the novel because I felt that it too could prove to be a classic. It was. Kesey's book is vivid, alive, and shocking. It provides an insightful look at life on a mental ward in the early 1950's and 1960's. If you are ever in a book store or a library and happen to come across this novel, don't hesitate to pick it up. Every second spent reading will be worth it. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am a true science fiction and fantasy fan.

However, I reluctantly purchased this book for a college literature course (which I put off until my last quarter of my senior year in college, too) and it just surprised me how much it sucked me in.I couldn't stop reading it. There are no discernable chapters, so I kept going and before I knew it, I was 1/3 the way through.This book is definitely worth a read. There is definitely an underlying message, but I'll leave that to you (or your literature teacher) to decide. It's funny, entertaining, exciting, and sad all at the same time.There is also some language in there; be aware this book was written in the 60s. You have to look past the &#34;bad words&#34; of the narrator and see the book in the cultural context in which it was written. That's the only way you'll enjoy the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an amazing book. I just finished it about 15 minutes ago and my head is still spinning--like, I can't word my way into a proper review, I can only wave my arms and jump up and down. It is a RIDICULOUSLY good read. I have read a lot of fiction, psychology, philosophy, and religion in my day, and this takes the cake as probably the greatest piece of writing (fiction-wise, if not of all of literature) that I have ever had the privilege of reading. It is a masterpiece. Do you hear me? *shakes fist in the air* A MASTERPIECE! I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone and everyone for any and every reason. It is that good. Like damn."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was the last book I read before the end of the year, and it definitely makes my \\"Best Of\\" list. I have seen the film several times, but the book differs in a very key way. The narrator of the book is the presumably deaf/mute Chief Bromden, and his running commentary gives the book a different flavor from the film. His status as being supposedly deaf and mute gives him access to the asylum's dirtiest secrets, and it is fascinating to see the action through his eyes. \\"I had to keep on acting deaf if I wanted to hear at all,\\" he states.It is interesting to look at Chief Bromden as a possible unreliable narrator in the novel. We know from page one that he is in a mental hospital, and the Chief has had several rounds of treatment in the \\"shock shop.\\" He even has episodes where he returns to his youth in his mind, filling out his fascinating backstory. Bromden played high school football and is partially driven mad when his father, the first \\"Chief Bromden\\" in the book, is swindled out of his tribe's land on the Columbia River, where they have speared and net fished the salmon going upstream at Celilo Falls for generations. Ultimately the Dalles Dam is built, covering the entire area with water in 1957. Celilo Falls is an interesting bit of history in itself, and it makes for fascinating reading.Bromden tries to give a factual account of what is going on inside the hospital to the best of his ability, but that account is somewhat slanted because we see it only through the lens of his illness. He is paranoid to the point of thinking that there is a \\"Combine\\" that manipulates and controls individuals in subtle ways, such as machinery in the floors and walls. His paranoia is exacerbated by Nurse Ratched's very real iron hand in the running of things on her ward. In a critique of the novel, author Richard Gray explains that Bromden's vision \\"may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote Emily Dickinson... \`Much madness is divinest sense.'\\" Traditionally an unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility has been severely compromised, usually to deceive the reader. Although Chief Bromden is clearly delusional from his schizophrenia (oozing walls, buried machinery, shrinking and growing people), he is at least trying to tell the truth as he sees it, for the greater good of the other patients.Bromden reveals his ability to hear and speak to McMurphy, a free spirit who cons his way into the hospital faking insanity, thinking that time spent there will be easier than the jail sentence he is serving. McMurphy immediately locks horns with Nurse Ratched and bucks the system in a classic clash of the individual against the establishment. Chief Bromden and the other patients take heart at McMurphy's antics, and finally begin to come into their own as people instead of being scared and manipulated by Nurse Ratched, who only seems comfortable when wielding ultimate control over them. After a wild after-hours party on the ward near the end of the novel, one of the patients named Harding says that he is nearly ready to leave on his own, with all \\"the traditional red tape,\\" and that the others are \\"still sick men in lots of ways. But at least there's that: they are sick men now. No more rabbits, Mack.\\"Author Ken Kesey's inspiration for the book came from the time he spent working as an orderly on the night shift at the Menlo Park Veteran's Hospital, a mental health facility in California. He saw how the institution worked and interviewed patients. During his time there he also volunteered for Project MKUltra, a covert research operation by the CIA's Scientific Intelligence division experimenting in the \\"behavioral engineering of humans,\\" which included experimentation on subjects with psychoactive drugs such as Peyote and LSD. Kesey's experimentation and writings eventually went on to influence the counter cultural movement in the United States and elsewhere in the mid to late 1960's.One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest is a great and entertaining read with timeless themes that give you a lot to think about long after finishing the last page. Author Ken Kesey's portrayal of the struggle of the individual against authority holds as much power in today's deeply divided social and political climate as it did upon publication in 1962. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It a great book and I encourage others to read this book it's sad it funny beautiful and it will keep you reading"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"absolutely fabulous book - right up there with &#34;On the Road&#34;!!!!!

If you've only seen the movie, read it. Many little (and one big) detail make it much more engrossing. The book was written from Chief's point of view, which makes makes much more sense of it all, especially if you consider the ending. Totally recommend."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey creates a grand story using literary skills, a good sense of dialogue, and unbeatable characters. The story is told behind the observant and quiet eyes of Chief Bromden, who springs the words to life as if the reader were listening to him speaking around a campfire. The Chief tells of his experiences in a mental institution ruled by the guileful Big Nurse who is challenged by the boisterous and charming newcomer, Randle P. McMurphy. McMurphy fills the ward with life, adventure, and defiance towards meager rules, going against the status quo of not only the Big Nurse, but also the shrouded controllers and manipulators of the world. The battle is packed with ups and downs and many surprises which lead to a realistic and inspiring ending. Though, the novel isn't a complete roller coaster of excitement. In fact, whenever McMurphy isn't in the scene, the pace of the book tends to slow down. The narrator, Chief Bromden, often delves into the description of major themes such as shrouded tyranny, fear, insecurity, and the importance of individuality with great detail and many literary devises. This leads the reader to think over many things while also enjoying the action and comedy throughout the novel.Reading intensely through the novel, I appreciated every aspect it had to offer. The enjoyment of reading and ability to connect it to my life has further inspired me and I hope one day to match the story's natural goodness with experiences to come."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, illustrates the fight for control between two powerful characters. Nurse Ratched is a dominant female in the novel and due to her position and job she requires control over others. She has authority over the patients in the mental institute until McMurphy becomes a patient and poses as a threat to Nurse Ratched's ultimate control. Nurse Ratched's presence in the novel displays her sense of power and dominance over the other characters and McMurphy's attitute and personality go against her traits. Previous to reading the novel, I had already seen the film version and had preconceived ideas of how the characters would be portrayed in text. I feel the power is clearly shown in the movie as well as the novel and the struggle for complete power between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy for ultimate dominance and control is equally represented."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I got this book to read because it was required by a writing conference I was attending.

He suffers from paranoia, hallucinations and delusions. Bromden spends his life and hospital time in fear of an imaginary force called the combine. The combine is force that attempts to control society and pushes people into fall into conformity. The reason that he makes such a good narrator is that he pretends to be deaf and dumb and sits and listens and is able to hear things that are not supposed to heard. The hospital patients are separated into two groups the Acute's, who can be cured, and Chronics, who cannot be cured, they are all male. The hospital is controlled by Nurse Ratched, an extremely strict woman. She encourages people to stay sick by creating traps that the patients fall in to thus causing patients to stay sicker longer. There are treatments for patients that do not follow the rules, they are sent in to receive electroshock treatments and lobotomy, even though these treatments are no longer favored by the medical community the hospital still uses them, because Nurse Ratched uses them to stay in control, she uses them to create fear in her ward. Randle McMurphy arrives from the Pendleton Work Farm he seems to be \\"normal\\" he is calm and cool and introduces himself as a man who loves women, cards and drugs. Although it does not seem like McMurphy and Bromden would have anything in common but it turns out that Bromden lets McMurphy in on the fact that he is neither deaf nor dumb and when McMurphy was a child he did the same thing. Although other patients tell McMurphy that there is no defying Nurse Ratched he attempts to deceive her and question her power. Other patients follow his lead and begin to work with McMurphy with things such as refusing to clean. McMurphy eventually learns that involuntarily committed patients are stuck in the hospital until the staff decides they are cured. When McMurphy realizes that he is at Nurse Ratched's mercy, he starts to follow the rules. He sees the power of the electroshock treatments 1st hand and becomes genuinely frightened of the hospital staff. McMurphy arranges a fishing trip for himself and ten other patients, he shows the patients that the outside world is not as scary as it seems and he shows them how to be \\"men\\" by teaching them to catch big fish on their own. McMurphy and Bromden get into a fistfight with the hospital aides when they are attempting to defend George Sorenson. After this incident they are both sent in for electroshock therapy. The patients try to get McMurphy to escape, but he has arranged a date for Billy with a prostitute named Candy, and he refuses to let Billy down. McMurphy bribes Mr. Turkle, the night aide, to sneak Candy into the hospital and they have a party on the ward. Billy has sex with Candy while McMurphy and the other patients smoke marijuana and drink. The aides discover the mess the next morning and suddenly the hospital is crazy, when Nurse Ratched finds Billy with Candy, she threatens to tell Billy's mother. Billy freaks out.... McMurphy tries to strangle Nurse Ratched and for revenge she has him lobotomized, and he returns to the ward incompetent. After this they no longer find Nurse Ratched powerful and the patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out of the hospital....."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Bob say's this was a good book.Bob liked this book.

It shows through the actions of Nurse Rathet how powerful and controling women want to be. Although a &quot;man&quot; is usually figured to be the dominant sex in life, women clearly show in this story that they are just as powerful as men. Randall Mcmurphy who is the protagonist in the story is the person who takes the role of the male in the story. However, Nurse Ratchet has no intentions of giving up her control over the combine to Mcmurphy. The stories climax is the &quot;dual&quot; betwenn Mcmurphy and Nurse Ratchet. This story clearly shows america's psychiatric society in the mid 1900's and how man and woman often clash for the right of dominance."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You cannot get better than this.

So I gave it EVERY CHANCE in the world. But I have to be honest, I found it an utterly shallow raving about how the \\"modern matriarchy\\" [whatever that is] has \\"cut off men's balls\\". I read a bunch of reviews that hail this book as subtle and insightful and say that it really challenged stereotypes and drew characters fully and sympathetically. I thought it was quite the opposite. The characters were flat, two-dimensional, and predictable. The rambunctious, \\"life-loving\\" hearty male. The repressive, bureaucratic older woman emasculating the poor men in her charge. The sympathies were clear. The \\"good\\" characters, even when they raped teenage girls, were simply expressing their zest for life. The bad character was so bad that no one could even \\"get it up for her\\".The only thing \\"new\\" was the recognition that the mentally ill were human beings worthy of basic dignity. I'm not even sure that that view was (in 1962) quite as radical as everyone is making it out to be. It was more like a mid-century trend to reconceive deviance.And please, those of you snapping up to write a knee-jerk response chiding me for \\"political correctness\\", desist! All I am saying is that I doubt an author purporting to expose stereotypes serves his work well by resorting to yet more stereotypes with such gusto. Kesey could have made the UNSYMPATHETIC characters more human."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are books that are great reads. Then there are books that are great to read and discuss. However \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is more of a great book to discuss.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a story set in an asylum in what appears to be the 1960's. The asylum is run with precessions by the female nurses and their black orderlies. The men in the asylum have all been beaten down by life. Now they are beaten down by a system implemented by their matriarch, Nurse Rachet. Along comes Randall Patrick Macmurphy, a boisterous charismatic convict, who thinks he's outwitting the system by pretending he's crazy. Over time Macmurphy becomes the inmates patriarch and ends up fighting Rachet for control. How the book ultimately ends hints at the author's cynical views on men, women and society.The book's narrator is Chief Bromden, a half-breed Indian, who (unlike Macmurphy) is actually crazy. Understanding his train of thoughts, as he describes what is not only happening to him but to the other characters, is probably one of the more difficult things about this book. It does help to read an abbreviated version (i.e. Cliff notes) or read the book as a group (i.e. high school lit. class).The themes of this book, I feel, are actually more powerful than the writing, female domination, male empowerment, societal systems, etc. In fact, it's likely to provoke a discussion that's far superior to the experience of reading \\"...Cuckoos's Nest\\".(3 and a half stars)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have read this book twice.

I urge anyone who hasn't read this book to give it a try and be captivated by it's astounding writing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is without question one of the great works of American literature. While it offers much food for thought on the nature of mental health therapy and the authoritarianism which imbues many mental health institutions, it is far, far more than that! The hospital where McMurphy raises havoc is a metaphor for our own society. The dreams of the &quot;Chief&quot; are like windows to the outside world, revealing that it is all too similar to the mental hospital which confines the characters. The real joy of reading this novel is not so much in finding criticism with the &quot;nest' of mental health institutions; but instead seeing how all of us are trapped in a restrictive and maddening &quot;nest&quot; of our own making. Truly a novel to be read over and over, at various stages in one's life!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Okay, so it usually takes me about 100 pages to actually get into a book. But, because of the pure genius and imagination of Kesey, I was sucked into the novel during the first paragraph. I stayed up that night from 9 o'clock to somewhere around 5 that next morning, not just reading, but relating to every connotation and metaphor that Ken laid in. I have never been more consumed by a single book in my life. Nor have I ever read a single book more than once. If you are looking for a book about individualism vs. society, don't pass this gem by."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey did a fantastic job with this novel.

It scared me just to read about the effects, before I actually became empathic and connected to the marvelous characters... each one unique, lively and different.

A book I would recommend everyone (who is able) should read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey wrote a deep involving story about life in a mental institution in the 60's. These were days when lobotomies and electro shock treatments were free game. The character of Randall McMurphy brings a new atmosphere to the ward when he arrives and helps the other patients live life to the fullest again.

This book goes into great detail about what life was like in the 60's, what life was like in an asylum, and what life was like with McMurphy. This book does not have one underdeveloped character, or one loose end. This book has a lot of symbolism such as: Christ, the fish, the poem \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", and many more. There are struggles brought up between the men; the fight with themselves, Nurse Ratched, the machinery, and the outside world. The detail and precision in this book would make the reader believe that he in face resided at a Insane Asylum and had electro-shock therapy. It makes you believe that he was a rebel like McMurphy, but on the other hand there is the Chief. Kesey has great skills at writing, and using characters to really make this book a page-turner. But, the best part of Kesey's is that it takes the reader to new levels of fear and hope for McMurphy and the gang."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a well-written book about a man named McMurphy.

Kesey demonstrates great knowledge of how the human mind works and to what extent a man will go to keep his sanity in an insane world.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest is a definate read. It continues to draw readers into its realm of sanity within insanity. Of human perseverence under a dictator's rule. Of man's indomitable will to survive."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The Viking Critical Library edition of Ken Kesey's &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is worth every cent of its price, not that it's a high one anyway. The page count is double that of the novel, and what you get in this excellent edition, is a preface, a short biography, and a plethora of literary criticism, a very exhaustive collection, ranging from forgettable, strained and biased work to brilliant criticism. It's not just a novel, it's a compendium you get for a price of one. I strongly recommend this particular edition of the novel, and would encourage you to keep an eye for other volumes published by the Viking Critical Library.Kesey was not appreciated after his first novel, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;. His later novels and stories received abysmal reviews at the time of publication, his life was widely perceived as wasted. In fact, with &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid&quot; Tom Wolfe summarized Kesey as a one-note, one-novel author. Since when quantity is equivalent with quality? The same statement can be made of Joseph Heller and Harper Lee. The latter didn't even try to write more than one novel he published! I claim that that particular novel of Ken Kesey earned him the place in the timeless literary pantheon, that it immortalized the author, and whether or not his fiction of the latter day is redeemable, is a secondary issue, almost irrelevant, I'd say.&quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is indeed a universal novel. Many circles, political movements, ranging anywhere from anarchist and socialist to conservative and libertarian - tried to assimilate Kesey into their ideology, into their vision, whatever that was. A good piece of literature is universal, timeless, with redeeming features that are always true (or untrue, for that matter), whenever they are read, and if they contribute to the reader's development regardless of their generation. &quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; was one such book - it dealt with universal truths, with the basic premise of life - that we should be free, no matter what, that if once depraved of dignity, we can't regain it back, and then it's not worth continuing afterwards, that it's a once-only gift from heavens. We can also self-depreciate, too - as an aside note.A very strong moral message the novel conveys is the opposition of the individual and the society. In a way, Kesey's book is similar to John Kennedy Toole's &quot;The Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, where a similar point is raised. &quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is an apotheosis of personal freedom, and a warning against the tendencies evident in modern societies. A free individual is disengaged from the society, although coexisting with it on a daily basis. Exactly this point provides a wide arena for interpretation, and if you enjoy analysis of this type, you will definitely appreciate Penguin's critical edition - for there's much material that will satisfy your curiosity, if need be.Abstracting from that usual tendency to stress the individual-system opposition presented in the novel, I think that one of the main threads of interest, for me at least, is the keen observation Kesey makes about the human nature. If given the chance, the animal creeps out from us, and goes wild. No matter how civilized we are, it's always there, lurking. Also, we have oceans of cruelty in us &#65533; maybe not all of us - but a vast majority definitely do. Where we differ - is the degree. Life is not black and white, but grey, all shades of grey. If given the sufficient opportunity, we shall turn against our brethren. I believe in this, and Kesey seems to have at least hinted at that. I won't make a prolonged philosophical digression, although that's the proper playground here, but I do think that we are essentially bad, evil, primitive, with a good side to us, which is like a self-conscious and often automatic chain that holds us in place. Religions superimposed the idea of temptation over that basic premise, and where religions differ is the actual interpretation of symbols. What I find of more value as a lukewarm believer, is the caveman sub-layer of our human nature. Evil and good are not balanced. The former is kept like a genie in a bottle, the more we are civillized, the more so. it is not equilibrium. And from time to time, the evil creeps out, or, rather, bursts out, and then there's trouble. Some people feel right at home with their real nature, and thus are more adept at obtaining the equilibrium. Often devoid of empathy, they execute their wishes if given the chance, and they do so more efficiently than the rest of us - precisely because they are more balanced. I keep coming back to Kesey's Nurse Ratched. If I were to characterize her in one word only, use only one adjective, I'd choose &quot;unemphatic&quot;, if there's such a word.&quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a novel that gives food for thought. It will last you for days, months, or even a lifetime, along with a few other giant works of the XX century. Irrespective of his career of the later day, Kesey is immortal precisely because he conceived that universal novel which gives rise to so many interpretations, is such a fertile work of one man's imagination. And that in addition to the actual excellent storyline! Kesey was a giant for me. May he be blessed with peace forever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Randall McMurphy arrives at a mental institution after serving a stretch on a State Farm.

I would definitely reccommend this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a truly great book and one that you have to be read, whether or not you have seen the (also brilliant) movie. Kesey tells a gripping story in a wonderfully sympathetic, humorous manner. And like so many great works of fiction it is written in a fairly simple manner, without using too many stylistic devices. If you are not gripped by the story of the patients and their suffering under the sadistic nurse, you are probably just not meant to be a reader!The book does have one big advantage over the movie, though. It has the character of the giant Indian, the Chief, as a narrator, and he is much more important to the book than to the movie. His personal battle against debilitating fear would have been enough of a plot to sustain a novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you haven't read this book, you're missing something...The setting is a mental asylum with its staff and the inmates. Through the book, we enter and share the life there - the humor under the tyranny of the head nurse and the &quot;system&quot;... it is touching and disturbing at the same time because you might end up finding the inmates more 'sane' than the people whose care they're under. I watched the movie based on the book. The movie is very good too but the book is better by far."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There is no story quite like Ken Kesey's One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest. It is an incredible tale of a man who single-handedly brings life back to the inmates of an Oregon mental hospital. It is a tale of hope, desire, and of living life to the fullest. Hope is represented by the freewheeling Randle McMurphy who makes it his mission to save his fellow inmates from the terrible rule of Nurse Ratched. The battle of wits between the nurse and McMurphy becomes the essence of this story. It symbolizes something much bigger than the petty poer struggle it appears to be; this is the power-hungry versus the oppressed. Author Ken Kesey has managed to maintain a humorous tone in the gloomiest of settings with a cast of some of the most animated characters I have ever come across. From the POV of a hospital inmate, the story puts the reader right inside the walls of this loony psych ward. Read it and find your way out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A reader from San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 11/2/00A very astonishing and mouth opening fiction literature.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a very exciting fictional work which gives the reader a taste of what it was really like for patients in mental institutions back in the 1960's. Such experiments as electric shock and actual puntures in the head made to analyze the patients reaction, really shocked me to hear. The story is told by a Native-American mental patient, Chief Bromden. His experience, however, is very astonishing to hear, and intriguing to acknowledge that mental experiments such as those were actually thought to improve their mental health instead of making it any worse. Overall the book is phenomenal and I stongly give it a 5."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think the book is outstanding. It manages to keep you laughing most of the way through but is sadly tradgic at the end. It is definetely the best book I have ever read and I must read some more books by Ken Kesey!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I saw the movie before this and I thought it was great. I finished reading the book today. I loved it! It is hilarious, and sometimes sad being told through the eyes of the Chief, like when Billy Bibbit commits suicide. Some funny parts are when McMurphy punches through the glass at the Nurses Station, and politely wipes it off the Big Nurses head. It shows how inhumane Electro Shock Therapy and lobotomies were, especially at the end, which is real sad. One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest is one of the greatest novels ever written!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book was great at but also got kind of slow at times. i loved the part when McMurphy broke the glass in the nurses station. I also loved when they all sat in front of the blank t.v."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"&quot; One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a fantastic novel. Ken Kesey is a deep writer. He goes really deep into the thoughts of the characters. At the beginning I was having a hard time understanding what was going on, but as the story progressed I started to understand. At the beginning of the story I thought that all of the guys were very crazy. As the story went on and the author gave more detailed facts about some of the characters, I started to believe that they weren't really as crazy as I thought that they were. As I started thinking deeper, I thought maybe it wasn't me that was changing my thoughts about them, maybe it was them really changing. I now believe that McMurphey really did change the others, all for the better. When he first arrived and started taking their money and making trouble, I thought that he was just going to make the other patients crazier, but I was very wrong. He got the Chief to start talking, and he got most of the other patients to smile and even stick up for themselves. Overall, the story was excellent. Even though I thought that it started out slow, it ended with a bizarre twist. Just like Steinbeck's &quot; Of Mice and Men&quot;, a friend killed his friend for what he thought would be the best for both of them. We all thought that McMurphey was going to escape, but it ended up that he was killed the night of his great escape and Chief Bromden went ahead and left in his place. The author Ken Kesey obviously put a lot of time and a great deal of thought into this book. It was great and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good, dramatic, book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was pretty good. It was not the best book I have ever read, but it is by far not the worst. I got confused while reading it and found myself rereading almost all of the book. Even though the book was confusing to me, it was still a good book. I would not recomond this book to anyone who does not have a basic high school reading level, and even then by careful and be sure to double check whet you read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A compelling story of a man's search for himself. The book entails many problems that as a lazy world we shove aside saying we'll deal with them later. As the lone ranger comes in the morning to save a lost platoon, we see how we ought to be but aren't. The crazy world outside and the sane world in. Funny how it takes a crazy man to unite the sane.But we all luh-uhvvv that gamblin' man."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I loved the book, b-b-but I felt like it ended too soon. The entire book flowed, there was a balance between the nurse and Mcmurphy, between funny spots and depressing spots. Mcmurphy is winning and then WHAM B-B-Billy's dead and Mcmurphy got a labotomy, Big Cheif kills him and leaves. All I could say was, &quot;It can't be over.&quot; There wasn't any closure. Don't get me wrong, it was one of the greatest books I've read. As much as I hated the ending, that's the way it had to happen, but was it really perfect?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Wow, cuckoo's nest was a great book. I loved every element of the book, if anything was left out the book would be uncomplete. The ending, although tragic, was satisfying and appropriate. In my opinion McMurphy won, he left his impact on the &quot;nest&quot; that can never be undone. The book was written in the perfect perspective, Big Cheif's, without his view of things the book could never be as abstract as it was. Overall an excellent book"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I really liked the way that this book was written, although the whole &quot;plot&quot; of the story made me realize that our world is really corrupted. Our society is against anything different. I liked seeing the world through Big Chief's eyes and knowing what he thought of his own society in which he lives. For me, the whole book was about Big Chief's building himself up enough to make a breakthrough, and then finding the courage to break out of the combine and begin his life once again. I enjoyed the book and would encourage anyone who likes books out of the ordinary to read it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Would definitly reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read. The happenings in the asylum makes you wonder what actually happens in one. The book makes you look at the world differently than before. This book was really interesting and kept my interest the whole time. My favorite character was Big Chief. I still can't believe that no one acted suprised when he started talking. People would just ask him questions like he'd always talked."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Much has been made of the thematic nature of this great novel: the way society relentlessly grinds us into conformity; the way those in power abuse it to bring those under them into submission; the way one who is outspoken is often firmly chastised; etc. These are all valid themes and wonderfully symbolized by the very real characters in this novel.A lot less has been made of the fact that the book in many ways and all by itself is very therapeutic. I read it for the first time in my mid-teens, a period when most of us go through the difficult stage of trying to determine who we are, and worse, whether what we are becoming is acceptable. I'd look around at people my age and wonder how in the world they were so confident, so smart, so sure of themselves. Me? I was not unlike the Chief of this novel, wandering around in a fog half the time, trying to figure out what in the heck I was supposed to do or say or think at any given moment.But I read this book and suddenly--well, not suddenly--it helped to make things easier. What it makes clear is this: it's okay to be yourself. You don't have to hide things. It's okay to talk while your delicate white hands float in the air and form what you say, like Harding. It's okay to write letters and look concerned, even though everyone in the world thinks you're a Neanderthal, like McMurphy. It's okay to feel sad, it's okay to want to be alone, it's okay to be nervous around girls. What a relief it was when this finally sank in: I wasn't some kind of a psychopath, doomed forever to be a figure of ridicule while my back was turned. It's ohhh-kayyy! To me this was the great soothing message of the novel, and why I will forever be grateful to it.But before I go running off to the shrink, I'd better mention that on top of everything else, this book is just a flat-out, crackling great read. Right off the bat the classic confrontation is set up: the brash, untamed, loud McMurphy against the powerful, establishmentarian, icy Big Nurse. Set in an insane asylum, it is literally psychological warfare, with each of them carefully probing and then cutting at the other's weakness. As the novel goes on the stakes become increasingly steeper, until the very souls of the men on the ward are at risk. Fascinatingly, the novel ends with neither party having a clear-cut victory, and fittingly, the casualties are terrible.It is spectacularly written. An inmate, the Chief, is the narrator of the story. In his crazy mind, everything is mechanical and impersonal. Wires, transistors, metal, girds, rust, smoke and oil are what things are made of. He knows the Big Nurse listens to everything with the radio equipment in her purse. He hears the machinery humming in the walls. This functions as a superb literary device, symbolizing his paranoia, but at the same time it creates wonderful imagery. Here is the nurse, early in the novel, angry that disorder--personalized by McMurphy--has come to her ward: &quot;Her nostrils flare open . . . She works the hinges in her elbows and fingers. I hear a small squeak . . . she's already big as a truck, trailing that wicker bag behind in her exhaust like a semi behind a Jimmy Diesel. Her lips are parted, and her smile's going out before her like a radiator grill. I can smell the hot oil and magneto spark when she goes past.&quot; So can we.The novel is loaded with memorable wit, much of which seems to have entered the daily lexicon. &quot;I wash my hands of the whole deal,&quot; says Ruckly, the nutcase in Disturbed. &quot;I'm TIRED,&quot; says Pete, after the nasty bickering he sees his friends engage in. Most memorable of all is the comment uttered by the relentless McMurphy, disgusted by his ward mates' timidity. &quot;But I tried, though. Goddamnit, I sure as hell did that much, now, didn't I?&quot; Is it possible to say that one has had a satisfactory life simply by being able to say that he has tried? I think so.In the end, the lessons to be learned from this novel are exemplified by the two greatest characters, McMurphy and Harding. (No, the Big Nurse is not one of them, being nothing more than a common symbol of ubiquitous societal rigidity). McMurphy goes out in a blaze of glory and despair, destroying himself, and sadly, destroying others. But it is Harding who goes out on his own terms. &quot;I want to do it on my own, by myself, right out that front door, with all the traditional red tape and complications . . . I want them to know that I was able to do it that way.&quot;Certainly among the ten or so best novels of the latter half of the twentieth century. If you haven't yet read this one, do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This edition of Ken Kesey's first novel contains the author's sketches of the book's characters. The large format makes for easier reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Your horses are hungry, that's what she did sayCome sit down beside me, an' feed them some hayMy horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay-ay-aeeSo fare-thee-well darlin', I'm gone on my wayThis is one verse of McMurphy's comically mangled version of that fine old chestnut, The Wagoner's Lad, which he sings in the shower on his first full morning in the laughing academy--a ballad he booms out with such pitch and power that he just about joggles the wiring in all the walls. So sez Chief Broom at any rate and I for one believe him. It still cracks me up that this is the particular song Mister Red-On-The-Head sings as a kind of prelude to his plan to put a burr in the bloomers of Nurse Ratched--a plan that ultimately hinges on man bloomers of his own as a matter of fact, and what hilariously five-alarm man bloomers they are too: \\"coal black satin covered with big white whales with red eyes.\\" Ah, the betsy bug episode--what larfs, eh? I had more or less forgotten how satisfying the reading was in this great big book. And the writing too. Out of sight out of mind I guess but what a joy when it all comes flooding back, wha'? The story is unfolded in this wonderfully sinuous and continuous present tense by Chief Bromden in what amounts in the end to a long and lovely and heartbreaking reminiscence by one of the great undersung characters in all of fiction. Yup, that gentle giant spins a yarn fit for devotees of the nut cutlet everywhere. Look here at this transfixing little word picture from the time when the Chief is up in the middle of one moonlit night getting a faceful of fall through an open window:\\"Something moved on the grounds down beneath my window--cast a long spider of shadow out across the grass as it ran out of sight behind a hedge. When it ran back to where I could get a better look, I saw it was a dog, a young, gangly mongrel slipped off from home to find out about things went on after dark. He was sniffing digger squirrel holes, not with a notion to go digging after one but just to get an idea what they were up to at this hour. He'd run his muzzle down a hole, butt up in the air and tail going, then dash off to another. The moon glistened around him on the wet grass, and when he ran he left tracks like dabs of dark paint spattered across the blue shine of the lawn. Galloping from one particularly interesting hole to the next, he became so took with what was coming off--the moon up there, the night, the breeze full of smells so wild makes a young dog drunk--that he had to lie down on his back and roll. He twisted and thrashed around like a fish, back bowed and belly up, and when he got to his feet and shook himself a spray came off him in the moon like silver scales.\\"Ain't that a sight for sore eyes? If you've seen the flick Milos Forman made it's hard not to picture the big dude they got to play Chief Broom but that's all right I reckon coz the feller they ended up with, Will Sampson, was so good and such a ringer for his fictional counterpart that whoever had the casting here ought to be commended too by God. As a moony yoof I was generally mad for this novel, couldn't get enough of it to be frank, lashed into it on umpteen occasions and swallied it whole and happily each and every time. It tickles me no end now indeed how much of this writing I actually remember with delight--whole paragraphs flash back to me big and bold as life as I re-read them. Don't know about you folks out there but I truly love when that happens with the written word. Reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a lot like living only more so somehow. Plus given the dead man walking atmosphere currently fogging up my dadblanged place of work it is a blessed relief to be locked inside a different loony bin for a spell. Kesey's tale is at the close a melancholy one perhaps but there's a generosity of spirit amid all the yearning and desperation here that I find just impossible to resist."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Let me first explain that I can no longer write a long review for Amazon: time after time I have spent an hour writing one only to be cut off before I can even preview it. It is no doubt the fault of my own system-- I am not blaming Amazon-- but in any case, if anyone wants I the full text of this review, they must refer to my blogspot. I shall try to put it in a nutshell, if that is possible: McMurphy seems to me to be the perfect metaphor for the terrorist suspect facing US interrogators today. The techniques used by Nurse Ratched are similar to those developed by the CIA in collusion with unscrupulous doctors. The cornerstone of this method is ECT. It is used in combination with narco-hypnosis, but the latter would not be effective without the erasure of memory which ECT causes. I must note that this book, famous for its depiction of ECT, greatly underrates the dangers inherent in the treatment. For one thing, it does not mention the long-term effects on memory. Secondly, it leaves the impression that ECT is going out of fashion, when in fact it is experiencing an upsurge. Some 100,000 people a year receive the treatment, according to Dr. Peter Breggin. But the most sinister thing about ECT is that was found very effective in creating \\"Manchurian candidates\\" by the CIA, and may now be being used to create \\"phony terrorists\\".

McMurphy arrives, it begins to move more quickly. Kesey succeeds in describing the scene and the emotions of the characters and the events that take place in the novel. The descriptions are so vivid that it makes the reader feel as if they are there with the other patients looking on. The reader is also able to feel what the characters feel through the descriptions. The Big Nurse's emotions and expressions are especially emphasized. Her coldness, fakeness, and domination over the patients are conveyed throughout the novel and are really brought out when she is provoked by McMurphy.The novel is narrated by one of the patients in the asylum, Chief Bromden. Because he is a patient in the mental institution, it is vital for the reader to realize that and not believe everything he says. Bromden is in the institution for a reason and so reality and his imagination are mixed together to form his reality.The main theme of the novel is the struggle for power between authority and normal people, between woman and men."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The $7.99 Signet edition of \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a terrible printing job. It looks like it was done on an 18th century press that was running low on ink. Spend a couple of bucks more and get a decent copy of this fabulous book. Signet has a lot of nerve producing such a poor quality product."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Okay, so it's difficult to read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest without being stuck with the image of Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy. Sometimes it seems to me that in this day and age novels hardly seem to have any value by their own right; the luckiest of novels, like this one, get good cinematic adaptations. The rest get bad ones. That makes me just a bit sad.Still, try to overlook everything you know about the story and just read this, and you'll find a masterpiece that is very unique and separate from the wonderful movie. Most importantly, the narrator and protagonist here is not McMurphy but \\"Chief Broom\\" Bromden; that in itself gives anyone who saw the film a fascinating new angle on the story. Bromden is a man who pretends to be deaf and dumb to be left alone by the staff in the mental ward in which he's hospitalized. Through this self-imposed solitude Bromden is a highly astute and accurate observer, and he gives the reader a full and personal account of the arrival of the rebellious new inmate R.P. McMurphy and his war against the management and especially the Big Nurse Ratched; through his ominous dreams and hallucinations he illuminates the nature of life in the ward, and the effect McMurphy's presence has on its routines and inhabitants.Nurse Ratched is hardly a secondary player in this story; she's as central and fascinating a character as Bromden and McMurphy, and the tension between her and the uproarious Irishman makes the novel tick. Once again, brilliant casting and acting - Louise Fletcher as the nurse - made Ratched as well as McMurphy a timeless cinematic character in addition to a literary one. Still, Kesey's presentation of Nurse Ratched through Bromden's simplistic eyes tells you everything you need to know about the woman and her motivation; it also tells you from the very beginning what will happen at the ending, an ending that is inevitable as it is shocking and surprising. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful and captivating read from start to finish, and a difficult and harrowing one too; and if there's some comic relief in there - and there is, rest assured; the novel is often remarkably funny, filled with quirky characters and absurd, nonsensical dialogue - it serves only to make the rest of it all the more powerful. It's a book that's often paired up with A Clockwork Orange as two essential and representative novels of the 1960's, and it's not just because they both got terrific cinematic versions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Let me start off by saying this book is absolutely incredible. I had to read it for a college English course and, upon finishing, I was left wondering why the hell I had waited so long to read it. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. I also saw the movie that, while it was good, can never compare to the book. I've kept the book so that I can reread it in the future. I can honestly say I had moments where I was laughing so hard my face turned red but I also had moments where I was crying so much I could no longer read the print on the pages.Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic anti-authority novel and a pretty good read. The story is told by Chief Bromden, a fragile giant who has delusions about the Combine, a conspiracy that runs the economy and keeps the population under control. In the mental hospital where he lives, the Combine is capably represented by Nurse Ratched, a rather tightly wound mother figure. Using a combination of psychological manipulation, drugs, and shock therapy, she and the rest of the staff keep the inmates in a passive state of acquiescence until her system is upset by the arrival of McMurphy, a red-headed drifter and non-conformist. The point of the book, of course, is to show how socialization processes have a homogenizing, leveling effect. Societies work best when people are interchangeable; exceptional people, or people who can't fit in, are usually not welcome."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a great description of the United States' mind in the 60's. The United States' mind in the 60's was to be rebellious and to fight the machine. Ken Kesey put this thought into his novel but switched things around such as: The United States is a Insane Asylum, the rebel Is Randle Patrick McMurphy (aka Mack), and the machine is personified as Miss Ratched.An Indian inmate called Chief Bromden tells this book in the first person. He pretends to be deaf and dumb so he can avoid being annoyed by other inmates, and this makes his appearance almost invisible. This is important to the story and the reader he is then able to go into staff meetings that other patients are not allowed in and is then able to know what is going to happen to the other men or the asylum. He has done this ever since he has arrived to the hospital. This changes though after McMurphy arrives.It is hard however in some parts of the story to know if what he is seeing is actually happening since he is insane and has hallucinations at random parts in the novel. This can be confusing and also weird at times. Such as the fog he sees over and over in the asylum.The story picks up right away in the first five pages of reading. It starts with Chief Broom mopping (he helps out with cleaning around the asylum) and then a new inmate is brought into the hospital and is named Randle Mcmurphy. The instant Randle steps in he is automatically taking charge of the inmates and introducing himself as a gamboling man and would like to play with the inmates sometime. Miss Ratched instantly knows McMurphy will be a problem in the ward. \\"That is exactly is what the new patient is planning: to take over. He is what we call a \`manipulator'\\" (Ken Kesey page 29). It then picks up with McMurphy starting to hang out with the Acutes (patients in the ward that have not been there a better part of their lives) and becomes basically their leader. McMurphy is then introduced to group meetings and does not like how they are done, so he then starts to use him into his and other patients advantages such as turning the bathing room into a gamboling room and starting a basketball team. He also does other big things with this advantage but you will have to read to find out.Something though does not settle right with Mack. He notices that No one in the ward was or has ever laughed sense his arrival and that it seemed no one ever spoke or even asked of something to Miss Ratched. He then spoke to one of his better friends (later becomes his best) in the ward: Harding. Harding then starts to tell Mack about the shock therapy treatment and worse the lobotomy that Miss Ratched is capable of using on patients. This then gives McMurphy another reason to get on the Nurse's bad side. After that Randle starts coming up with more and more outrageous stuff to do in the ward.Chief Broom then reminds us about that Miss Ratched has always got the upper hand on things and that if you wanted to win the war with her you cannot win two out of three or three out of five, but you must win them all, then you have your victory.The thing I loved most about this book was how Chief Broom's literature got better as his state of mind got better, such as: in the beginning it is really weird on what is happening or not and that his words were messed up, and as the story progresses his literature gets a whole lot better and he starts using better and more advanced words in his sentences. This change struck me as very cool. Another great thing about this book was the character development, with your antagonist and your other protagonist. These characters also change as the story progresses. The conversations between inmates in this book (especially McMurphy and Harding's) are hysterical and witty. All of these things give the book a very good realism affect.I would suggest this book to anybody who likes reading comedy, adventure, drama, and conversations. Overall this book is one of the greatest of all classics out there to read and enjoy. It is one of my personal favorites. This book made me laugh, cry, get the true meaning of life (but I'm not going to tell), and maybe a little bit of pee came out. It lives up to its name."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What defines sanity? In Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest this very question is posed. We are immediately introduced to Chief Bromden, a patient at the hospital. He describes the Staff, the Chronics and the Acutes. The Staff is led by Nurse Ratched, a wretched woman with rules for everything, accompanied by all the floors orderlies. The Chronics are all the patients on the floor that remain merely vegetables due to lobotomies and electro-shock therapy. The Acutes are all the patients that are still functional; they play a crucial role in Kesey's novel. Chief Bromden is an acute but thought to be a mute, that is until Randall Patrick McMurphy arrives. McMurphy has been released from a work farm to have his sanity evaluated. McMurphy is loud, outspoken, and vulgar a vast difference from the other patients. McMurphy has brought upon himself the task of destroying Nurse Ratched. McMurphy, who is known for big ballin' and bar brawling' disposition, thinks this to be an easy task and a way to keep himself entertained. What McMurphy discovers are limits and the harsh reality he faces. Kesey uses both McMurphy and Chief to illustrate societies destruction of natural impulses.Kesey worked as an orderly in a Virginia State Mental Hospital while in college. He was also acting as a lab rat for the government at the hospital aiding in the testing of hallucinogens such as LSD. With unlimited supplies of such drugs he spent a lot of his time working in the hospital under the influence. While working one day he hallucinated an Indian sweeping the floors of the hospital and thus we have Chief Bromden. Considering how much time Kesey spent around patients and under the influence as some of the same drugs as them he seemed to have a lot in common with them making it easier to write from that perspective. Some of his most insane moments he admits to have written while greatly influenced by these psychedelic drugs. Kesey's experience in the field allowed his characters to be believable. The question of which of the patients were sane and which were truly gone was omnipresent.McMurphy is a liberating character for the other patients. He teaches them that they have to learn that they alone can control who they are. Society has put a label on them and broken them down to the point they too believe they are crazy and incurable. McMurphy leads them on an outing one day in which they escape on a boat to go fishing with beer and a girl. This newfound freedom for them is one of the best medicines they could have gotten. They realize that they would like to be back in the world and be able to do the normal sorts of things they would like to do.I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it is a great tool to learn not to judge people. It shows such a profound form of personal growth and loss that I wish I could at some point be able to experience something equally eye opening. I give this book five stars and consider it a classic."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read a considerable amount of reviews about this book before deciding to get my hands on it, the whole psychiatric story thing did not really sound like a tale I would enjoy. But surprise - and a pleasant one - this book captures the mundane world view on the mentally handicapped in a beautiful and very thought provoking way. I had never given it much thought that society label's psychiatric patients and society decides when, how and what to cure.The happy gambler and convicted conman, R.P. McMurphy, tricks himself into a psychiatric hospital, because he has found out that these places offers a much more pleasant stay than a jail work camp. He is meet by worn down shells of men, lacking happiness, embarrassed by there sexual desires and without any drive. He quickly discovers that the head nurse and here staff is as much responsible for these weak men's condition as are there psychiatric disease. The rest of the story is a tour de force of McMurphy's one man battle for freeing these men. A battle which he ultimately succeeds in but end up paying the price himself.A grotesque, provoking and ultimately tragic story filled with gripping characters and written in a highly witty language. In short a masterpiece and one I will shurely read again."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Another book that so many people read in high school that I somehow never had to read; I was hesitant, yet excited to read it all at the same time. I am glad I did.The story is told by Chief, the Big Indian. Through his eyes we see the ins and outs of life in the mental ward. The author uses the Chief's own inadequacy to set the tone for the other patients in the hospital; each goes through life with the pace of a crawl. The processes and procedures are in place to help them acclimate themselves to life outside the ward in hopes that some day they may rejoin society. Or that is what the staff tells them anyway.We are introduced to a few figures with relative authority over the goings-on within the hospital walls, though their power is usurped by one woman. The head nurse. Over years she has manipulated the people around her, scaring off doctors and ward staff that she did not feel she would be able to control. As we join the story, her pieces are in place. She has a doctor overseeing the ward that is too timid to deny her control and three hospital attendants that are as immoral as she.She has her way with the patients' minds. In group therapy sessions she asks the men to point out the shortcomings of others thus reinforcing their insecurities. These same insecurities are the reasons that for many of the men are in the mental hospital in the first place.She keeps them weak and afraid, exerting her control until one new patient comes along and begins to question authority. R.P. McMurphy has bucked the system in every environment he has entered. As a result he had seen every form of punishment except one: the mental hospital. He was, maybe for lack of a better excuse, labeled a psychopath and duly committed. Now he has a new set of rules to break.McMurphy may be euphemized as out-going, though others may prefer to call him obnoxious, pushy and loud. He is, in all respects, both the complete opposite of every other patient on the ward and the exact thing the nurse has worked so hard to avoid. With relative ease she has broken the spirits of every man before McMurphy and they both get creative as their rivalry grows.She has control over the men's daily routine and has guided their thoughts as well for so long. McMurphy obtains control over their sense of freedom, but will that be enough?The mental hospital was a great microcosm for society at large. The patients are everyday people. The nurse, more abstractly, is societal expectations and normal, \\"acceptable\\" behavior. The Chief could be you or me. He, more than the other patients, has acted in a way that is in line with what others have assumed about him and not how he wants to act. He conforms to what people tell him he is. McMurphy represents the small portion of the population that thinks outside the box. He is the free thinker who teaches us that it is ok, and should even be encouraged, for us to question authority.Too often we do things because that is...just what you are supposed to do. We get out of bed, get dressed, go to work, go home, have dinner, kiss our spouse and go do bed. We are \\"grown ups\\" now and that is what grown ups DO. But why? Why not shake things up? We have the ability to carry ourselves with the integrity of adults though we live freely from others' expectations of us.McMurphy champions the mentality (to keep with the setting of the book) that we need to maintain some sense of autonomy. You can control where I live and you can control what I do during the day, but I will not let you control how I think and feel. And most importantly the lesson he focuses on is that no matter how tough the going gets, never forget out to laugh. This is an incredibly powerful tool we can use to avoid being swept under the control of societal pressure and expectation. With our laughter we show others that we are still in control, but you have to mean it.This may be completely off base with what Kesey had hoped to portray in his book, and it may mean something else entirely to you. But that is, after all, the beauty of it. I am not head nurse. I am not here to tell you how to think and feel about this book. But I do recommend you read it and find out for yourself. As I got into the book it was good, but not great. By the end I was pleasantly surprised by how much I really enjoyed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story about those who are at the lowest level of society, mental patients. Kesey vividly describes the suffering of these patients and their struggles to deal with themselves, the Nurse and society. A particularly poignant scene is the monologue of Pete Bancini, a worn out man who was never accepted into society. Bancini says:\\"I can't help it. I was born a miscarriage. I had so many insults I died. I was born dead. I can't help it. I'm tired. I'm give out trying. You got chances. I had so many insults I was born dead. You got it easy. I was born dead an' life was hard. I'm tired. I'm tired out talking and standing up. I been dead fifty-five years. \\"Kesey has done what few authors (perhaps Salinger as one of them) have, truly described those who seem to struggle to find their identities in a society that ennervates them. A phenemonal book, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest opens one's eyes to the societal inequalities of those deemed unfit to lead normal lives. Instititutional oppression is the overlying theme of this novel.Despite this, many choose to ban the novel because of its misogyenistic and rascist elements. The tool for the evil society (the Combine) is a woman, her agents are the \\"black boys.\\" Yet I think that these elements should not influence one's decision to read this book. If at all possible, by ignoring these elements of the novel, one is left with a masterpiece.I recommend this book to everyone, although mature themes make it more appropriate for an audience that is sixteen and older."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'd could write for days about all the reasons that this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, about how it flips your perception of others, makes you re-evaluate your life, abolishes all previous assumptions about \\"insanity\\". All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. It will change your life, and it's incredibly entertaining... as a bonus."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I would go on and on and on about this one if I didn't have so much work to do, but listen, it wouldn't benefit me or you, you should just read this book.I love the movie, my favorite movie ever, I saw the movie first, I'm a huge fan of Jack Nicholson in the role of Randall McMurphy....The book is better.The book is different.Read the book.P.S. the book actually takes place in 1953, not the sixties, or seventies like everyone is saying. A lot of things were different in '53 than they were in the late sixties."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest proved itself as one of the most originally written and stylistically executed novels I have ever experienced. Everything perfectly fitted together to make an interesting tale of the occurrences between the walls of a mental institution. The story is told from the point of view of from of an Indian, nicknamed Chief, who has the entire ward convinced he is deaf. By making this situation, the author Ken Kesey used it to narrate the actions of the ward entirely through Chief's observation, which allows him to report and analyze all the characters in the novel. The entire ward is turned into disarray when a new patient, Randle McMurphy, arrived and challenged all rules and authoritative figures, something no one had dared to even think about attempting. Throughout many arguments and actions of rebellion, his innovative style began to rub off on the other patients and all learn how to break out of their monotonous actions. They indirectly learned how to overcome most of their illnesses. Most of Chief's observations were noted underlying themes of the whole book, mostly reflecting views of the real symptoms and affects of mental illnesses. Overall, this book was refreshingly original with themes that if followed can create an interesting and thought provoking life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It truly stands out and stays in your mind long after the final page is turned. -One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest- is told with a graveyard-ish humor and a realistic irony that makes one think of how society treats the mentally ill and how we define normal and sane.It depicts the fight between the Big Nurse and McMurphy, a patient at the mental-ward who may be faking his condition and is set through the eyes of Chief Bromden, a seeming deaf-mute. There isn't really anything I can add that wouldn't cover what was already said about this glorious novel. It is wonderfully crafted, the ambrosia of the literary world, and is the type of book that makes you think, and then think some more. It really snowballs in the end, and you will race through the final pages even if the beginning is slightly long-winded."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was comical, warm, wonderful, and insightful. It covered all the bases. I loved how Kesey wrote about a mental insitution in the in-depth way that he did, instead of writing about the stereotypical mental institutions. I rated this a five out of five stars, as it was well deserving! This is a book that anyone and everyone could and should read. Thank you for taking the time to read my review!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although this is a huge cliche, I must say that this novel works on so many levels. From a character study to humor to power struggles, this novel has many different themes to read and enjoy.Chief Bromden is a 6'8\\" powerfully built Native American on the outside, but inside he's a scared child, paranoid of machinery that runs through the world that only he can see. He is the narrator to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and it is through his eyes that we see the story unfold. Almost all the action takes place in an Oregon Mental Institution, where 40 inmates troll under the autocreatic command of the Big Nurse. But then Randle P. McMurphy is admitted, a loudmouthed con man only there to escape the drudgery of the work farm. He quickly realizes what is happening and begins to challenge the nurse's authority, giving hope and sanity to the inmates at the same time.As long as you're not put off by the constant repitition of mechanical images about the \\"Combine\\" that only the main character can see (bear in mind he is insane) you'll see what a beautiful book this is. You'll see how McMurphy (for once a savior is not a blatant reference to Christ) becomes more than just a source of entertainment to the men, how he enriches their lives and sets them free, how the more he acts against the Big Nurse the less mechanics Chief sees. If you didn't read it in High School, by all means, read it now. 8.5/10"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I ordered this book expecting it to be the Great Penguins Edition, much to my surprise of it being an older edition. I ended having to buy a second book from another seller. Ended up spending more than i saved.

He quite overwhelmingly lost any claim to authenticity or originality with the publication of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" It reads like the jottings and musings of an orderly with an eighth-grade education. Nurse Ratched's paper thin representation of the \\"Man\\" is so entirely hackneyed as to make the reader wish he or she were born absent the gift of sight and not have to read another single book.This is a non-redemptive novel, and deservingly so, given the author's/protagonist's trip through the hollow's of the mind where superficiality reigns supreme.Chris Roberts"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think the book was alright i mean i dont think i would of ever picked the book out my slef.

I can also a very close relationship these days between the symbolism in this book and how it can be applied to politics. The nurse can be viewed as the big business, Tobacco or the NRA. When you enter politics you have good intentions but once they reform you, the way they can when they have the power, your under their control."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was the worst book I have ever received from ordering on-line.

Big mistake."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Initially, the book was very hard to understand. That was probably one of the main reasons why I was never interested in the book. McMurphy is by far one of the best characters in the book. He reminds me of myself at home. At home I try to take over the TV, gamble, and rebel against everything my parents say. When I say McMurphy rebels, he's all against nurse Ratchad. He does everything in his power not to do what he's supposed to do just like walking around in his underwear.If this book was alot more clear in the beginning it would be a very noble book and I think a lot more people could enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am currently reading this book for my H English 10 class, and i find it to be extremely dull. Yes, I understand, it takes everyone a step deeper into the lives of the mentally challenged people of our time. However, it is a difficult book to follow. There is a constant changing of characters, which lead me into great confusion of the importance each one displayed within the text. I was very disappointed when I began reading this book. I always heard great things about it, but i guess, it's just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Two stars for the occasional vividness of Keysey's writing--and no more for the tiresome use to which it's been put. Stanley Kauffmann, mentioning this book in his review of the film version, referred to it was one of those books he \\"needn't read--simply outlive.\\" And perhaps the time will come that this story of a psychopath looking for a cushy ride in a mental hospital and locking horns with the tough nurse in charge is seen as the whinings of a perpetual adolescent and not some epic struggle between freedom and conformity. All Randall MacMurphy wants to be free to do is steal and cheat and toy with women sexually. Subtract the hero-worshipping tone, and we have a denizen of a true-crime magazine story, the sort of lowlife the cops pick up after a string of violent rape-murders or robberies. In the end, you don't have to like Nurse Ratched to wonder if she might have done the world a favor . . ."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book. I had to force myself to finish it and at the same time avoid ripping out my hair due to boredom. The only character I liked was McMurphy. It was interesting to see the way he was able to impact each character in the book with his antics and ideas. Admittedly at some parts of the book I was uncomfortable reading about what went on in the asylum, and I think this was kind of the point, so the book was successful there. To me, the most important aspect of the book was, as Medgar Evers once said, \\"You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea.\\" One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest demonstrates the power an idea can have over people, and how even if you cannot see the idea in action, once it has been introduced it will survive."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I could not concentrate whenever I started to read this book. It is hard to differenciate between what is really happenening and Chief Bromden's hallucinations. The book has yet to capture my interest. There are too many different characters to keep track of. I have a really hard timing remembering which characters are chronics and which characters are acutes. Part 2 is supposed to be more captivating and easier to understand but if I can't make it past page 60, how am I going to get to part 2?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book gives insights into what the definition of insane really means and who belongs in an insane asylum.

I was inspired by a friend of mine to reread it, and after many many viewings of the film based on the same tale, starring Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers, amongst others, I still do not come away disappointed from this brave and outrageous story of mental ill health in the early 1960s. Ken Kesey is one of very few writers with the talent and perspicuity necessary to balance extreme horror, pathos and humour so precariously that his material is never disrespectful and immensely readable. You laugh and cry with the victims, and your heart soars and cascades with the vagaries of their lives. Unputdownable."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had a hard time getting through this book. The writing style was different than I'm used to and while it was good... it wasn't great.

(I love the story - but it is the quality of the \\"Hardcover Book\\" that is very disappointing)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"My husband and I have made it our project to work our way down the AFI's list of the 100 greatest American movies. The 1975 Milos Forman adaptation of this novel appears on the list (#20 on the original list, #33 on the later revised version), and I have a rule about not seeing movies based on books unless I've read the book first, so of course I found myself picking up this novel. I usually enjoy reading books regarded as classics, but I wasn't particularly looking forward to this one. Having spent quite a bit of time in psychiatric facilities between 2000 and 2003, including over a year in a semi-long-term facility when I was around 20, I tend to steer clear of fictional treatments of mental illness, for a multitude of reasons. The idea of a *comic* novel set in a mental institution didn't sit well with me at all.Then I actually read it.There's been enough said already about the plot. You probably already know the core storyline of this novel is the battle of wills between the malicious \\"Big Nurse\\" Ratched and the malingering convict Randle McMurphy. Ratched is a wickedly effective villain, in whom genuine malice is seamlessly commingled with the impersonal force of compulsory conformity. (It can surely be no coincidence that her name so resembles \\"ratchet,\\" a mechanical device that allows movement in only one direction.) McMurphy, the lusty swaggering gambler, is perhaps the least saintly Christ figure in all of literature. Less attention, unfortunately, has been paid to the novel's narrator, \\"Chief\\" Bromden, whose delusions hold more truth than most people's view of reality: the one-man Greek chorus who comes into his own as protagonist and, in so doing, holds out hope for all of us who aspire to something more than just getting by in an insane world.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is, of course, a counter-cultural novel in which the mental ward is symbolic of a conformist society. Although Ken Kesey was inspired to write this novel by the time he spent working on a psych ward, his primary goal wasn't to call attention to the mental health system per se. Still, I found it almost frightening just how perfectly he captures it - and just how little some things changed in the four decades between this novel's publication and my own hospital experiences. There is, of course, plenty of exaggeration in these pages, of both the dramatic and the comedic varieties; as the Chief himself admits, the reader may well \\"think the guy telling this is ranting and raving . . . you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! . . . But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\" No, they don't actually have patients lobotomized for having the audacity to ask what exactly is in those pills that they're taking - but that doesn't mean they encourage that sort of curiosity either.I've seen staff mock and ridicule patients, and even provoke them when they were in crisis. I've had them use their knowledge of my trypanophobia to force me to behave as they wished, even when I wasn't doing anything that would legally justify their so much as laying a hand on me. I've been to the \\"Community Meetings\\" where no one in charge actually gave a damn what the \\"community\\" had to say. When I noticed how often I was given the wrong meds, and brought this to the attention of the higher-ups on behalf of the other patients who might be less diligent in checking the contents of their pill cups before swallowing, some of the nurses labeled me a troublemaker. I remember how many of my fellow patients bought uncritically into the therapeutic model they were offered: \\"If we can't work together as a community in here, we can't do it out there,\\" one of them proclaimed once, to the approval of staff, while I shook my head in puzzlement, wondering what getting along in a closed group of heterogeneous strangers, among whom the only common element was severe psychological illness, had to do with getting along in the outside world. Kesey touches upon all of these things, with such compassion - never stated, but plainly obvious, and never descending into pity - that I was able to empathize completely with the characters, rather than feeling isolated by the memories of my own trauma.As for the comic aspects of the novel, I found myself enjoying Kesey's dry, dry, brutally ironic wit. Never does he go for cheap shots at the expense of the mentally ill; the characters do sometimes behave in humorously absurd ways, but Kesey refuses to mock. Unlike the men on Nurse Ratched's ward, I found myself laughing often during my time in the hospital - but it was a bitter laughter, the kind that comes when you just can't cry anymore. In fact, one of the most triumphant moments of the novel has the men learning to laugh again. McMurphy, according to the Chief, \\"knows you have to laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy. He knows there's a painful side . . . but he won't let the pain blot out the humor no more'n he'll let the humor blot out the pain.\\"Kesey's writing is beautiful and challenging. The characters are rich and complex; I was surprised how much I came to care about even some of the minor figures. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a rare accomplishment: a genuinely tragic comedy, or a genuinely comic tragedy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A book about a mental institution that poses questions about sanity, freedom, human dignity, and the right of individualism. Written from the perspective of one of its inmates, Bromden, whose marginalisation in this microcosm of an oppressive system is accentuated by the his giant stature, his Native Indian roots, and assumed deaf-and-dumbness.Through Bromden's surreal narrative, an otherworldly phantasmagoria is created, where the tyranny of Head Nurse Ratched (\\"wretched\\"?) gives her the power to control time and douse the premises with (literal?) mind-numbing fog, and walls (and patients) are wired, and controlled like clockwork by her control panel. Then in swaggers McMurphy, the quintessential American rebel, who disrupts the system, challenges the authority of Ratched, and basically rouses the inmates from their passive acceptance of their subdued states, to reclaim their lost humanity.Kesey, by delivering the story through Bromden, destablises the authority of the narrative, but as Bromden claims early on, \\"it's the truth even if it didn't happen\\". The reader, in negotiating with the text, establishes an uneasy relationship with that narrative, which is the success of the conceit of this book. What is real, and does it matter?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It's a page turner. I'm not a continuos reader but this book I could not put it down. Check it out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The seemingly oxymoronic title of my review, \\"A good bad book,\\" is intentional. I can sum up this book quickly by saying that it is very well written, that Kesey was a literary genius, and that it is deservedly called a classic. So what's the bad news? Let's just say it's not a book I recommend for a first date! If you want a book that drips cynicism and psychological violence, this is the one. The subject matter is about a man who is in revolt against the very corrupt powers that be in a mental hospital. The problem for me is that he is as much a criminal as they are, but his criminality is glossed over against their greater violence, a common theme in literature. Randle McMurphy, to me, is not a sympathetic figure, but he is made to look that way because his \\"freedom\\" comes through attempts to defy an extremely oppressive power structure. Indeed it is mentioned that he once led an escape from a Chinese prison camp...but his behavior is still very much thieving and unexemplary. Among many other things, his stautory rape of a yong teenage girl is decidedly glossed over; but for me that one act robs his character of much of its sympathy.If you want a book that purports to be an expose' of mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century, without a single redeeming quality, (personally I cannot and will not believe that all of them were such hell-holes) then this book is for you. I'm reading it because, again, it is very well written, and since I am in a production of it on the stage as my very first drama, I want to do my job thoroughly, and that's why I am reading it. Great reading, but for God's sake don't read it when you're depressed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Love the book. Great writing, great reading.I was very transported by his writing into the insane asylum where the Big Chief and eventally McMurphy, live. I could hate the Big Nurse as if she was an enemy of my very own. I couldn't help but feel a slight bit of validation when McMurphy ended up first slamming his fist through her wall of glass at the nurse's station and then choking her in the hallway. Then I realized that I wasn't a crazy person and couldn't agree with his choking her almost to death.It is written so well that you can clearly understand the Big Nurse's hate, cool calculation, manipulation and utter control that she has over her patients. She is a demented sergeant operating under the guise of truly wanting to help her patients.McMurphy is as sane as they come, as sane as any of us except he has vices and in this setting, it is unacceptable. It must be fixed. He seems extremely likable and reminds me of a few people that I know. I root for him throughout the book.Poor McMurphy is brought to a sad semi end by the Big Nurse but thankfully and sinfully, the Big Chief puts him forever out of existence and then is off to start his own new life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book in which it describes the battle between The big Nurse and McUrphy. this beautiful story unfolds on the grounds of an assylum where the Big Nurse rules supreme. As you go along in this story a new titan in this epic battle steps forward, McMurphy. And in the last 100 pages this book shows how a insane mind can muster the brain power of multiple brainiacs. I thouroughly enjoyed this book because of it's writing, tone, and enjoyment factor. The first 60 or 70 pages move slow but after that it is smooth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although a fair novel on its own terms, OFOTCN does a disservice to those who actually endure severe psychiatric illness. &quot;Freeing&quot; many patients would only exacerbate their problems; Kesey's ideas are commendable, his expression of them lacks sympathy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Dear &quot;Amazon&quot; Folks:Here is a book review by Claire Min-Venditti, age 6, dictated to herdad after he read the book to her over a period of 3 weeks:The book was called &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot; It had a guy init named McMurphy, and he was a pretty good trickster and gambler. Hetells lies a lot to people, but the book did not have a happy ending.There were a lot of people in it, but it was a good story. I like it. Itwas written by Ken Kesey, and it's about a mental hospital and a nursethat runs it, and she's mean to the patients.And McMurphy just came in because he's a new patient to come to thehospital. He was trying to get out of the hospital, because he didn'twant to get treated that way anymore, so at recess time he climbed overthe fence because there was this guy, and they called him &quot;Chief,&quot; andhe was big and strong and tall, and he was pretending that he was deafand dumb. So McMurphy got on his shoulders and climbed up the fencebecause he was very tall.And there was a bus there, which he snuck into and drew the otherpatients away and drove them away in the bus. And it picked up one ofhis girlfriends, and he went fishing without permission.When he got to the fishing place, he told the captain that he was goingto go fishing. And he paid to go fishing, and the captain said, &quot;If youwant to go fishing, you have to tell me if anyone will let you gofishing.&quot; So he told the captain to call an old abandoned hotel inCanada, but when the captain was about to tell him that he was alreadyon his way on the boat, fishing. So when he came back, the police werethere, but he didn't get arrested for taking the boat, but he stillpaid.That night, his two girlfriends came over and bought some wine and theyhad a wonderful party and messed up all the things and played tag downthe hall in wheelchairs and sprinkled cough medicine all over people'sheads. And they had a lot of fun, and they told the girls they couldstay there overnight, and the nurse didn't like that.The next morning, the nurse came and saw all that mess, and she was verymad. And she saw a patient named Billy sleeping with one of the girls,because he fell in love with her. And she said that she was going totell his mother, and he didn't want that to happen, so he went into aroom by himself and killed himself with a broken glass.And then one of the younger nurses saw him and came screaming out ofthat room and told the bigger nurse when it happened. And so everyonewas trying to look and see inside of the room, but the big nurse shovedthem out. But later, after that, when they were sleeping, they cut outpart of McMurphy's brain so he was turned into a vegetable, and hecouldn't talk and he couldn't walk.And the Chief, the big strong guy, came over to his bed with his pillowand smothered him. He was so strong and big that he picked up thecontrol panel in the tub room and threw it out the window, and it brokethe glass, and he was free because he didn't like that place at allbecause the big nurse treated him and all the other people so bad.I think only a little bit of people would like this book, because itdoesn't have a happy ending, and the big nurse doesn't treat anybodygood in the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"*spoilers below*I certainly did not like Big Nurse (BN) or her goons or what they did. However, I don't think that justifies 2 things our red haired hero did. In the end he could have escaped, instead he exposes BNs breast and strangles her. It turns the whole book into some kind of sexual struggle with the answer being given that men to be men need free sex, whores, and to physically dominate women. In addition, Chief Broom resorts to euthanasia before he gains his freedom under some flawed concept that quality of life determines whether it is worth living.The 30 something lad who egged on by some sense of nobility and a great quantity of locker room bravado indulges in a night of revelry feels real guilt when BN threatens to expose his actions to his mother. If he had really thought it was OK, he would have been able to stand up to her instead of committing suicide. He is not simply weak.Our hero is a tragic anti-hero. Tragic because he dies. Anti because instead of good morals he gambles, smokes, sleeps around, cusses, and fights when he doesn't have to. The message seems Nietzschean. The only real people are those who make their own rules, supermen. The individual vs all authority. Unfortunately authority is made up of people seeking their own also. No one is worth emulating.It is well written and presents the story from the point of view of an inmate. It also deals with deep themes.

McMurphy is clearly the big hero that cracks you up. He brings life to the ward and gives hope to the patients. The downside to this novel is it is VERY slow moving at the beginning though it does pick up as it goes. It's comical in parts but sometimes there doesn't seem to be much of a plot. Also,on this specific copy, with the house on the cover, the font is sooooo small! It's like 7 pt. or something. It makes the book seem slower.

In doing so, he brings hope and courage to his fellow downtrodden sufferers. Hooray for our hero!I revile the book that gives us, as man's greatest enemy, the archetypal Castrating Bitch. You'd think that the head psychiatrist would make a more realistic symbol of oppressive, all-powerful authority. (Even today, nurses have little power to act independently, and in the era of this novel they were pretty much expected to say \\"Yes, Doctor\\" and fetch the coffee.) But author Ken Kesey was willing to ignore this bit of obvious. I guess he really, really wanted to write a woman in the role of man's oppressor.Of course, not every woman is a Nurse Ratchet. There are good women, too - women who are good for men. Billy found one, after all. The cure to all his ills came in the form of a silent, obedient female who spread her legs at his command. How sweeeet. Nothing feels as good as a girl who knows her place and does what she's told.So, guys, let's review today's lesson. Powerful women are out to cut off your equipment. Submissive women make a man feel like a MAN! Ahhh. You're feeling better already, aren't you?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"book was in very bad shape cant read it, will fall apart in handling. the story is good I learned it by watching the movie of the same title"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I know you're not supposed to say stuff like this, but the movie was way better than the book. In fact, so good is the movie that the book has little to add. And that's saying something, because the book itself is considered a classic.The only thing that was slightly different was the unexpected choice to have the taciturn Chief narrate the entire thing.But that didn't add much. I read this thing cover to cover and didn't get anything out of it that I hadn't already got out of the movie.Just wanted the world to know."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an important book, with unforgettable characters, an interesting setting and an engaging plot, but first a couple of side notes. It seems in-coincidental that the main character's surname, McMurphy, is similar to that of Larry McMurtry, one of Kesey's Standford classmates in the Wallace Stegner writing program in which they were enrolled while Kesey was writing the book--perhaps a nod of fond respect or gratitude. Also consider that Kesey was likely to have been under the influence of LSD-25 while writing the book. It was before LSD had been declared illegal, and he'd volunteered to take it under a school-sponsored program funded by the CIA. The drug could account for some of the book's more hallucinatory scenes.Kesey's been tagged by critics as misogynistic, unfairly in my view. It is no more misogyny when villainous female characters are depicted than it is misandric when badly flawed males are featured. This book is richly endowed with both. When characters exist in society, it's a writer's duty to serve them up with craft and gusto as Kesey does, lifting the veil on Nurse Ratched's cruelty and passive aggression. Female cruelty is also evident in Harding's wife, who flirts openly with other men in the ward to torture him. Nor does Kesey spare the topic of prostitution in the characters of Candy and Sandy, who go about their work with charm and enthusiasm.Lesser villains are the black orderlies, Washington and Warren, who extract a vicious toll of hatred against the virtually all-white inmates.The main character, McMurphy, is well drawn and believable, driven to inevitable combat with Nurse Ratched as the plot moves relentlessly forward.My only real complaints are the choppiness of Kesey's writing style and the hallucinatory mental wanderings of the narrator, Chief Bromden. I also found Bromden's first-person subjective point of view to be distracting in places, too. It is through the Chief that unrealistic insights into the mind of Nurse Ratched are conveyed. Omnicient qualities are more effective when conveyed in third-person.Sheep attract wolves and frogs, snakes. It seems that collections of the vulnerable, such as orphans or mental patients, serve as magnets for abusers. CUCKOO does a masterful job of exposing this social tendency. One hopes that, if nothing else, the book and its related film resulted in some degree of reform among America's mental institutions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"First, this review is not a literary critique of the book. It is a review of the digital download.I'm a little over halfway through reading the book. I'm not sure how the work was actually digitized, but the final product is full of editorial errors. It looks similar to some of the documents that I've run through OCR in the past. I would have expected that before the final product was sold online for $10.99 a copy, someone would have taken the trouble to proofread it. I gave it a 3-star, \\"OK\\" rating because the volume is still readable even with the numerous errors. However, it takes away from my overall satisfaction with the product when I have to stumble over these errors during my reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Even though One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a metal institute, it is more an allegory about goodness overcoming oppression and tyranny than it is a story about mental illness.The book contains an interesting assortment of characters:The most noticeable character is Randle McMurphy: a fun loving, gambling, free spirit who went to the asylum to avoid finishing out a sentence at a hard labor camp. He arrived and injected life into a place that had been devoid of it for long. The patients had become complacent by the routine, strict rules, and the ever-present threat of shock treatment or lobotomies if they stepped out of line. The drugs they were constantly administered clouded their consciousness and numbed them emotionally. Bromden called it the fog, and McMurphy was constantly trying to lift them out of the fog.The narrator of the story is Chief Bromden: a seemingly mute half-Indian whose has a case of extreme anxiety. His dad, once a mighty chief, was reduced to a miserable alcoholic once the government took his tribes' land and homes. Gradually, McMurphy teaches him to have courage and believe in himself. Bromdon has an extravagant imagination and describes many of the events that occur with very colorful and creative metaphors. This adds to the richness and enjoyment of the book.The villain in this book, Nurse Ratched (Big nurse), is very controlling and manipulative. A warm and caring faade is always displayed to the patients, but in reality she only wants absolute control of everybody and everything in the asylum. She has carefully selected her staff for that purpose. She constantly has a caring smile on her face, but do not be fooled. Everything she cunningly does or says is to secure control.Throughout the novel, big nurse and McMurphy constantly butt heads. The patients, led by McMurphy, gradually become more defiant, which results in a shocking climax at the end. This novel was an absolute joy to read. I could relate to the fears and insecurities many of the patients struggled with. Most of the acute patients were not crazy just sort of stuck, unable to overcome certain difficulties and were comforted by the security the asylum provided them. A life lesson to take away from this novel is that even though society, government, political pundits etc. say they are doing things for your own benefit, they may actually doing them for more selfish and insidious reasons. Another important message to take away from this novel is that no matter what pain and problems life has thrown your way, have courage to fight on. Oh and don't forget to have fun along the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think you could make a solid case that this is the best novel written during the 1960s. Differing greatly from the movie, the book is seen through the eyes of the Amerindian character, Chief Broom. McMurphy comes off in a similar, but also different way than the McMurphy in the movie. The biggest difference to me was that in the book McMurphy was the best therapist in the whole hospital, helping various patients get over and deal with their issues. He even makes the head shrink on the ward feel like a real living man again during the fishing trip where the Doctor catches a huge fish. The Chief while showing obvious signs of real mental illness, some of what is used to showcase that, the \\"Combine\\" and the \\"Fog\\" are also obviously symbolic of some very real things. But I don't want to get into a bunch of mental masterbations about what various things and characters in Cuckoos Nest are representative of. I'll leave that to the eggheads of the world. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a great book and I'll leave it at that.But what about Kesey himself? Ken Kesey had LSD experiments done on him at Stanford by the guy that ended up in charge of the CIAs Mkultra mind control program. This really makes me wonder about Kesey. Its more or less accepted history that the first LSD to get out on the street level was what Kesey stole from the medicine chest at his job as a night shift janitor at a mental hospital and distributed it among his elitist friends. So they give out keys to the medicine chest to the nighttime janitor and he knows just what those fancy new fangled drugs that make the crazies act even crazier are called eh? Ha ha! Yeah man give me a break. I believe Kesey was given LSD to dole out by certain people for specific reasons.Kesey went from writing what was probably the best novel written during the 1960's to, while becoming a counterculture hero, never writing another thing worth reading again. Did doing too much LSD scramble his brains and ruin his creativity or was his creativity nullified by Mkultra programming? Its hard to say for sure but I have to wonder if Kesey was not under some sort of mind control or was being used by the CIA in one way or another. There are a lot of unanswered questions in my mind about Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kasey *****One of the most important pieces of literature ever, and not just for American literature. One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest is simply put....perfect. It is the classic tail of good versus evil as told through the eyes of an Indian Cheif as he watches his once comfortable solitude be interupted by a one McMurphy who is just claiming insanity to escape a court ordered work farm. The head nurse, Nurse Racthed is maybe the most hanious villion in all of American literature. The book cronicles the up rising of the insane wards 'inmates' and their struggle to maintain their new found power. Easily one of the five best novels ever written."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has a slow beginning (perhaps an attempt by Kesey to explain to his reader the maddening monotony of a mental ward,) it quickly picks up an intriguing plot centered around the observant Chief Bromden and the boisterous R.P McMurphy. When McMurphy bursts into the lives of his fellow patients, his presence forces the others to reclaim the manhood they have given up upon entering the ward. Though his influence is short when compared with the amount of time the men have spent apart from society, his rebellious ideas change their outlook on their lives and situation in a drastic way. Thick with irony and the traditional themes of literature, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is by no means a common or ordinary read. By employing the escalating presence of power struggles, Kesey reminds his audience of the importance of inner strength and always making an attempt, even when a goal appears impossible and makes his work one to remember."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I first finished reading this book I was left with a deep sense of gratitude that I had stumbled upon this novel and picked it up. I was startled by how good it ended up being, I had thought it would be just any book: good but ordinary. Reading it was like reading a combination of Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger and 1984 by George Orwell: two of my favourite books.The novel is the following of Chief Bromden in a psychiatric ward. Like Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye he only listens, he doesn't exist to others and hardly exists to himself. But he lives in the world of Big Brother, also known as Big Nurse. Put in the light of realistic situations, the same distopian images and themes of 1984 emerge clearly and are vividly frightening.Unlike 1984 a muddy glimpse of hope is given through the canniving and crafty McMurphy. McMurphy is a gambler, a fighter and a ladies man. We are confused to his motives, not sure if they're selfish or selfless, not sure if he's sane or insane. Big Nurse has some of the same questions brought up about her character, is she just a deluded helper or really an evil conspirator. The book walks the line of reality and unreality through the mind of what seems to be a schizophrenic. McMurphy and the Big Nurse become locked in a battle of wits, emotion and force; as the battle goes on, the stakes rise rapidly. This war is paralleled by Chief Bromden's inner battle as he looks at his psychological, emotional and spiritual problems.The novel's realism strikes a chord. All the characters are deeper and more complicated than ever; just as you figure you know, them a little more is revealed. It's like maneuvering in a world of ice bergs (to use one of the most over-used metaphors ever). One of the biggest payoffs is that you discover that you yourself are an iceberg.But not only are the characters lying in a gray zone but the plot is ambiguous. What's happening is always multi-layered. The writing as well is diverse and fresh, at once comedic and then sad. The voice the writer uses is a breath of air for all of us.This was only my original response, my awe at the story's power was expanded upon seeing the movie. A lot of the movie was not at all how I expected it and points I found important were left out. At first I was disappointed but as I watched I began to see what it had offered to these people. I realized how the book continued, after days of reading the last sentence, to show me new perspectives.The movie also helped me just appreciate the book more in general. What the film did well just enriched those parts of the book and what the film missed just expanded my love for those parts.In total the book is one of the richest reading experiences I've had lately and also helped open my eyes to a new part of the world. It is an incredibly worthwhile read and I would say it has something to offer to everybody at every stage of his or her life. If you have not read this book, read it. If you have read this book, read it again. If you're presently in the process of reading it, finish it, wait awhile then read it again."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am dissappointed with the myopic reviews here. This is one of the most clever and meaningful books of its time. If you know anything at all about the mistreatment of mental patients during the sixties, you will understand Kesey's point. He creates a social challenge for all of us to overcome our problems (whatever they might be) and move forward. He tells a story through the eyes of a psychotic schizophrenic and we have to decipher what's real and what's not. McMurphy is clearly a hero who gives up his life for the weak. Thankfully there are people like him who exist. Read it again and open your mind a little. You'll learn something."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"They're out there.\\" The opening line of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey depicts the mindset of the characters: paranoia and confusion. The story is told through the eyes of a mental hospital patient, usually called Chief. Although Chief tells of the happenings in the hospital, he is not the protagonist. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest focuses on a new patient named McMurphy and the effects he leaves on the other patients.The story told from the viewpoint of a patient is very effective because this allows the reader to experience an unbiased depiction of the hospital. Although Chief's seemingly crazed thoughts are sprinkled among true events, Chief offers a childlike view of the hospital. Therefore, the reader can form an opinion of McMurphy without the bias of a narrator. I enjoyed the way Chief describes the hospital before McMurphy; the infirmary appears mellow and mundane. McMurphy's first contribution to the patients is as simple as laughter. Chief describes his laugh as \\"free and loud and it comes out of his wide grinning mouth and spreads in rings bigger and bigger till it's lapping against the walls all over the ward.\\" Even the imagery of the novel becomes more colorful and lively. From this sudden change in tone, the reader can tell the importance of the new patient, McMurphy.McMurphy is also essential of the development of the theme: the harmful effects of an abuse of power on the rehabilitation of patients. McMurphy is the first patient to point out Nurse Ratched's faults; namely, her ill use of authority which actually depletes the sanity of the patients. Kesey's use of such a vile, unlikable antagonist is effective because it helps the reader sympathize with the patients.Also causing sympathy for the patients is their mistreatment. Kesey is effective in describing the unnecessary shock treatments for somewhat sane patients who, because of the treatments, become insane. Kesey's obvious distaste for the manner in which mental hospitals were run is obvious. Much like Chief's description of government authorities as having \\"seams where they're put together,\\" Kesey also believes that those who perform the \\"dirty work\\" for the government are merely machinery. Thus, the author invokes the reader's sympathy for the patients, particularly for Chief, with each word.In addition, Kesey's use of motif makes the novel more enjoyable. For example, McMurphy is constantly paralleled along Jesus. Because of McMurphy's many sacrifices he makes for his new friends and the way he takes the patients to fish on open sea, much like Jesus did with his apostles, McMurphy becomes a Christ-like figure. This comparison causes the reader to subconsciously be drawn toward McMurphy as a type of savior for the patients.Ken Kesey's use of theme, point of view, and motif make One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest an enjoyable read. Many would enjoy this novel because of its theme and its universal appeal: all people are scared to be unjustly punished or mistreated, like the patients of the novel often feel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a coming of age book for me in my teens, and no one who cares about mental illness and the ways in which society suppresses free expression and individualism should miss the experience of reading this amazing tale. Be sure to catch the movie starring Jack Nicholson as well."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel officially ends the 4-book reading that I had set forth to get my teeth into this summer. I must say, that it truly stands out from anything I had read before it, be it this summer or anytime for that matter. Ken Kesey weaves a tale that is smart, witty, sometimes insane and ultimately tragic. Though the setting is mainly in a mental asylum somewhere in Oregon, this story has a universal appeal to it that can be felt by anyone, anwhere in this world.R.P. McMurphy is a sane man that, due to a brush with the law, opts for being committed in a mental asylum rather than be incarcerated with hard labor. Upon his entry in the secluded world of the asylum, he strips all the barriers formed and starts laying his own rules, in his own way. This leads to problems with the head honcho of the place. A big, gruesome, and menacingly evil Nurse Ratched, dubbed Big Nurse for her huge frame and even huger bosom. The rollercoaster, that patient McMurphy takes the inmates through, finally leads them to realize the ultimate goal. That man, no matter the situation, can always hold his destiny in his hands. This knowledge, achieved in the end, does not come without a price.Set in the late 60s, early 70s, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a gem of modern literary works that came out at the time. It brought out a wonderfully-made movie, starring Jack Nicholson as McMurphy. The role defined him as an actor to be reckoned with. Though the mavie is seen through the eyes of McMurphy, the novel's perspective looks at things through the eyes of a big half white, half Native American inmate, that acts deaf and dumb in front of the asylum's staff. The narrative, because it is through the eyes of a mental patient, can at times be truly insane. That's where the fun really lies. Kesey works his magic in making us feel the insanity and despair of the patients. He can be funny, in a laugh out loud kind of fashion. He can also be tragic, when you realize what the inmates go through each passing day. The novel is a definitive treatment of the age old abode of individual versus establishment.This is a very human story, with a lot of suffering and exploration of man's insecurities. It has become a classic that some schools have even recommended as part of their curriculum. Through all the ups and downs of the story, I was, forever inspired and ultimately liberated in mind to finally realize that you can take away a man's life, but never his freedom. The book receives my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Counterculture icon and author Ken Kesey (1935-2001) wrote his first novel, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" in 1960. The book was a response to the author's experiences testing mind-altering drugs for the federal government and his later tenure as a nurse's aide in the same facility. In the introduction to the novel, Robert Faggen places this seminal novel in its proper context, arguing that this book incorporates several themes of the 1950's: the Cold War, the plight of the Native Americans, the reliance on psychiatry as a cure all for social problems, and the vestigial remnants of McCarthyism. Even if you could care less about how Kesey's book fits into American cultural history, you could hardly fail to miss the overarching theme of his novel: the tensions between the individual and the state, between those trapped in an industrial society and those who wish to live in freedom. There is a film version of this book starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher that adequately captures Kesey's stark visions.The author's tale takes place in a mental asylum at an unknown time. Perhaps this is because time has little importance to the inmates in the facility. The people in this particular ward of the hospital fall into categories of \`acute' or \`chronic,' depending on whether they have hope of recovery or are irrevocably ill. The days are full of drudgery, an endless round of medications interspersed with playing cards against the background of canned polka music. Everyday the acute patients meet for group therapy that really doubles as a McCarythyesque tattling session. The name of the game is acquiescence to the myriad rules and regulations of the institution. Those inmates who violate the rules earn a trip to the disturbed ward or a quick trip to the electroshock chamber. Repeated disobedience could lead to a lobotomy. Predictably, fear is the perpetual state in which most of the patients live. But with the appearance of a nonconformist named Randle McMurphy, fear starts to give way to a burgeoning hope that life will become better in this hospital.The narrator of this story is Chief Bromden, a mixed blood Indian who is a patient in the ward. This man spends his days mopping and sweeping the floors while hearing and seeing everything that goes on around him. The Chief fears that something called the \`Combine' controls the world. For him, the \`Combine' is the machinery that fills the walls and floors of the hospital, constantly spying on and controlling the men in the ward. He believes that those who work in the asylum are actually full of cogs and gears, are part of this giant, controlling machine. Moreover, the staff and the patients believe that Bromden is a deaf mute. He isn't, but Kesey's choice of this Indian as the narrator of unfolding events is a stroke of brilliance. Since no one thinks the Chief can hear or speak, he becomes privy to every activity in the institution. The staff speaks freely around him because they feel they have nothing to worry about. His cleaning duties allow him full access to every area of the floor, including the room where the staff meets to discuss other inmates. You cannot help but like Bromden, and you quickly question whether his observations are truly the ramblings of a madman.The central figure in Bromden's \`Combine' theory is Nurse Ratched, sometimes referred to as \`Big Nurse.' This seemingly grandmotherly woman personifies the Chief's fear of control and cold aloofness. Ratched runs the floor from her little glass booth, her hands on the levers of the machinery that controls the lights, the music, the group therapy sessions, and even most of the doctors. Her voice alone controls the destiny of the inmates. Ratched enforces the rules and regulations, and she decides who receives punishment or release. Big Nurse encourages stool pigeons and belittles the patients with implied threats and stony glares, often masked under an ersatz exterior of patience and cheerfulness. With the arrival of McMurphy, Ratched prepares for a battle of wills that by extension is a war between the individual and the state.Randle McMurphy is a boisterous, tattooed, redheaded troublemaker ducking a sentence on a work farm by acting crazy. Right from the start, McMurphy undermines the rules and regulations of the hospital. He gambles for money, wonders the hall wearing nothing but towels, sings, and challenges Ratched's authority by going to the floor doctor to receive rule waivers. But far, far worse is McMurphy's effect on the other inmates in the institution. His breezy spirit and tenaciousness encourages others to demand changes in the daily routine. Randle is a subversive of the worst type, and Ratched will do anything in her power to slap down this upstart to her fascistic rule. The end of the story seems to mark a significant defeat for the concept of individualism, but if one reads closely it is apparent Kesey keeps the dream of freedom alive however ephemeral it may be.Although I disagree strongly with Kesey's career as a counterculture mainstay, I loved this book. Everything about it is brilliant, from the characterization to the tight writing style. The Penguin edition even includes pencil sketches of people Kesey drew during his work as a nurse's aide. These haunting sketches add a special dimension to the text. Ultimately, the novel works because of its messages of freedom versus entrapment and the dangers of both conformity and nonconformity to the human soul. I recommend you run, not walk, to get this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this classic a few months ago after I chose it off a list of books for an english paper. Little did I know that I had made a great choice. I have always enjoyed books that centered on individuality and rebellion's against the rest of the society. This book is no different. It follows the story of Randall McMurphy, who throughout the novel tries in every which way to disobey those with power in order to find a way out of the mental hospital for himself and to help the other members of the ward in escaping as well. He becomes a teacher for the ward, a helper for them. Many characterize him as a Christ like figure, as Kesey does provide enough evidence that he may have been notioning such an idea from the beginning through language, character descriptions, and events that parallel events from the Bible. This novel has become one of my favorites and opened up my heart to other classics such as The Great Gatsby and Catch-22. If it were not for &quot;One Flew Over,&quot; I'd probably still be content with more recent novels. Thank you, Mr. Kesey, for such a fantastic book. It reads rather quickly and leaves you with a satisfied feeling at the end. &quot;One Flew Over&quot; has one of the best endings I've read in a very long time, possibly ever. I did not believe it would end as it did, but it makes complete sense when you sit back and think of the novel as a whole.

The slang that Ken Kesey uses when Chief narrates the story is just great and really brings us back in that period.But what i really loved in the book, is that you get to know why chief is like that. In the movie, you only get a little bit of the story, and that's a shame. I really enjoyed the book and the movie.

Author Ken Kesey weaves both of these essential human components into his masterpiece, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.The setting of this novel is an insane asylum, darkly and fearfully portrayed by Chief Bromden, the book's narrator. For it is within the wall's of this harsh, bleak institution that Authority--coined the \\"Combine\\" by the Chief--controls, directs, and manipulates every aspect of the lives of the patients. Nurse Ratched, who controls the Chief's ward, is the ultimate authority figure--a menacing, cold, callous, larger-than-life authoritarian who will stop at nothing to make sure the \\"Combine\\" stays firmly in power. Kesey, through the Chief's narrative, creates a gloomy, hopeless world, a world where the facility's patients have nothing to look forward to except the inexorable clutches of insanity.Into this world appears Randle Patrick McMurphy. This character isn't insane, he's simply trying to beat a work farm rap. More importantly, McMurphy is a strong, self-willed individual; instantly, the \\"Combine\\" senses a threat to its control. The story subsequently becomes a battle of wills: McMurphy's relentless defiance against Nurse Ratched and the Establishment. Granted, McMurphy achieves a series of victories, but in the end, Authority prevails. Or does it?Kesey's allegorical tribute to the indomitable human spirit is brilliant, fascinating, and timeless. His negative social critique of authority unchecked makes ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST one of the literary masterpieces of the 20th Century, a novel most enthusiastically recommended.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's novel \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a whirlwind of eccentricity and brilliance. In a plot that is completely character-driven, Kesey skillfully manipulates stock characters to reflect on larger ideas regarding the individual and his place in society (both on the ward, and at large). The evolution of character and self - highlighted by the \\"reality\\" of life on their ward - is fascinating; Kesey attempts to prove that insanity is a product of contemporary culture, and that reality is not as fixed as those in power would have the masses believe. I am currently teaching this novel in an introductory-level English class, and it has proved to be through-provoking and inspiring - even to students who otherwise have no interest in reading novels. This is a novel everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is a dark look into the life of an insane asylum, told through the eyes of the committed Chief Bromden, who has faked being deaf and dumb for his entire ten-year stay at the ward. Randle Patrick McMurphy is a newcomer to the asylum, and his self-assured competitive outlook on life upsets the rules and regulations of the ward. He is the first to challenge the ultimate authority, the Big Nurse, and he helps the other men gain the bravery and willpower to stand up for themselves. McMurphy helps Chief Bromden find himself and ultimately break out of his shell. This book presents some ideas and images that are difficult to follow, but this only makes the book more realistic, because it is expected that it would be hard to comprehend the workings of a troubled mind. As the characters evolve and adapt to their changing surroundings, Kesey sheds light on human morals, and the sometimes corrupt short-term solutions to problems that people come up with to make their lives easier. Through the power struggles between the Big Nurse and her patients, Kesey also demonstrates that there is a fine line between sanity and insanity. Many of the narrator's mysterious observations are metaphors for how people act in reality, and it is fascinating to journey through his warped mind and see the world as he sees it. I highly suggest this book to anybody who likes to read books that call for a fair amount of thought and deciphering, but are rewarding in the end."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's great accomplishment here is that he's brought a grand sense of authority to this book. He worked for a spell at a similar mental hospital in Oregon, even going so far as to subject himself to shock treatments. These experiences allowed him to add authentic detail to his world, such as the classification of the patients as Chronics, Acutes, Walkers, Wheelers, and, most ominously, Disturbed. The lucid descriptions he provides of each phylum are heartbreaking. Life in his ward world is made up of mindless repetition and routine, where patients are watched over by hapless staff, and institutionalized racism is never given a second thought. All of these aspects of the hospital work together to provide a nifty little microcosm of a radicalized 1960's America.Much of the novel is internalized. Chief Bromden, our humble narrator, begins life as a deaf and dumb Chronic. Only he's got a secret (I'll never tell). The story, as told from the Chief's point of view, is disjointed and fragmented. This is not an ineffective technique, however. In fact, it helps bring the reader into the mind of the insane, because as the Chief suffers through his hallucinations, we get to suffer along with him. Kesey, to his credit, never goes overboard with the Chief's dreamlike states. He works hard to keep the Chief's meanderings intelligible, always getting back to the story just in time before he lost the reader completely in that mania. He lets the Chief reign himself in if only to provide lucid commentary on the events at the hospital. This duality, this schizophrenia, makes the Chief one of the great unreliable narrators of the postmodern age. He's not consciously covering his tracks to make himself look better. He really believes the things he says, even if the reader can't fully. &quot;[What follows is] the truth,&quot; he says early on. &quot;Even if it didn't happen.&quot;The real strength of &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is that it not only gives us a strong internal narrative, but the external one is pretty strong as well. Otherwise it would have made for a pretty convoluted movie. Most novels do one well but not the other.The reason that the external portions are strong is that they're anchored on the fate of a truly memorable literary character: Randall Patrick McMurphy. McMurphy, a former work farm employee just new to the hospital, is a more complex character than I thought he'd be. I was expecting from him only unbridled, ego-less action. Instead, he was also quite focused, rational, and well thought out (listen to him cut through Harding's bull, with his neat &quot;'peckin' party&quot; analogy). This brings up one of the novel's central questions: whether or not McMurphy really should be in the asylum, or if he's just faking to get off the work farm (in fact, this question can be asked of all the novel's characters, except, of course, for the Chief. We've been inside his head and can surely testify that not only does he have a few loose screws, but also his screwdriver is broken). This question makes the ending all the more tragic. I'll not give the ending away, but be aware that knowing what ultimately happens to McMurphy didn't lessen the experience for me, and it probably won't for you. Kesey manages to hold the suspense until the reader gets there. When he finally lets go, the shock of it hits you like a fist through a window.The novel's central and scariest truth is that the system (i.e., what the Chief calls &quot;the Combine&quot;) can't be beat. That's very much a 1960's attitude, but still relevant in contemporary culture, especially for those of us still trying to make our way in the world. It is personified here by Nurse Ratched, who, no matter how persistent you are as an opponent, will always hold all the cards. And the sad irony is that this fact, once known, makes McMurphy's final punishment seem more like a blessing than a curse."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey himself will be forever associated with the happenings of the 1960s, but &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; (1962), like other great novels, transcends its countercultural origins. Nearly forty years on, with over 8 million copies sold, it has become an essential part of postwar American literature.The setting: a mental hospital in Portland, Oregon, in the 1950s. The terrified, ill-treated inmates cower under the evil Nurse Ratched, who is all-seeing, all-controlling. Enter the hero, Randall Patrick McMurphy, a brawling, gambling womaniser who, as his initials suggest, is there to induce a revolution. The slowly escalating conflict is played out in a simple four-part structure, building towards an inevitable and moving climax. &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is narrated in the first person by Chief Bromden, a half-Indian thought by all to be deaf-mute, and his extended flashback of events allows Kesey to mix reality and hallucinations to brilliant effect. By presenting the mental hospital, explicitly, as a microcosm of broader society, Kesey urges us to consider our own lives in the light of the events he describes.Its simple structure belies the fact that &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a feast of allegory: of good versus evil, man versus machine, sexual freedom versus repression; of McMurphy himself as humorously subversive Christ figure, as bringer of fertility, and many more - and watch out for the white whale shorts and stuttering Billy, &quot;Faulknerian brain burning&quot;, and even some hidden rhymes at the end of part 3!But spare us the half-baked Freudian interpretations which Kesey himself so roundly mocks. And pay no heed to the charges of sexism and racism levelled at Kesey's novel: his playful plotting and comic-strip characters make such criticism futile. Kesey balances it beautifully: amidst the ribald humour, there is just enough realism to keep us engrossed; and this reviewer little doubts that the systematic cruelty and dehumanisation practised by Ratched and her aides is commonplace in our prisons, mental hospitals and wherever else we lock away the &quot;undesirables&quot;.Indeed, it isn't surprising to find that Kesey worked in a mental hospital before writing &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, and his acquaintances there filtered into the novel; some a little too obviously, perhaps, viz. the (originally female) &quot;Public Relations&quot; who sued Kesey in order to get her character changed. Kesey also tried out electric shock treatment firsthand, and was part of a government program testing psychoactive drugs, his experiences with LSD forming the basis of Bromden's electrifying hallucinations. Now, although Kesey himself may be pretty wacky, he has no personal experience of schizophrenia, and his portrayal of mental illness and its causes has been justly criticised as simplistic. But &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is not, primarily, meant as a contribution to psychiatric therapy, and criticism of it on these grounds is somewhat wide of the mark. We should be glad that Kesey successfully attempted a greater task: to write an anti-authoritarian novel of immense power, forcing us to question the &quot;Combine&quot; seeking to control us all.Kesey's next book &quot;Sometimes A Great Notion&quot; (1964) is more subtle: a long, complex, involving tale set in an Oregon logging town. Fans of &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; should perhaps first try &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; by Tom Wolfe, in which Kesey himself challenges 1960s America with some crazy escapades of his own, thumbing his nose at authority in the same spirit, one senses, as his hero Mr McMurphy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this book many years ago, and again recently. I have worked at 3 different mental institutions, over the last 35 years. There were many areas that Mr.Kesey took liberty with, but over all, people that have never been in these instutitions, would be suprised at how accurate most of it is. Fortunately, in the later years, the operation, that RP McMurphy underwent, has been discontinued. All of the staff of these places, are honest, and hard working people, but there are still those nurses, that have a point to prove. Even today! Very amusing, laugh out loud moments, but tragically just as many sad moments."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If u can follow this, and @ times it gets difficult, u can see why its classic.

I hadn't even begun reading \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" Yet, and Already I was enthralled by the captivating story of a Mental Institution and The Colorful Characters Living in it.Chief Bromden, The narrator of the story, is a half-breed Indian who is also a patient at the ward. A patient for many years, he has worn the guise of a deaf-mute, and while this is not actually the case, he has fooled everyone into believing it. He Spends all his days mopping and observing his environment. His Fear Of The \\"Combine\\"-What He Believes are the Machinery That Fills The Walls and floors of the hospital- only serve to make the story more interesting.The Central Figure of the Combine Is Nurse Ratched. Described as being large and intimidating, the Nurse runs the whole floor from a little glass booth.Perhaps the most interesting character of all, Randle McMurphy is an Obnoxious, Tattooed, red-headed Instigator That Causes Problems from the moment he arrives at the institution. He Feigns insanity to duck being sentenced to a work farm. He undermines the rules, gambles for money, and walks through the hallways dressed only in towels. Tensions build between him and Ratched when his spirit encourages the other patients to call for change.All In all, While definitely odd, I believe this was a piece of literature worth reading; I may very well look into reading other pieces by Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book might not seem interesting by the look of it, but once you read it. it grabs you.

The writing is wonderful and the insight into this facet of \\"The Human Condition\\" is unmatched. I feel that this book should be required reading for all medical students and should be part of a required medical ethics class at all medical schools.This work has profound implications far beyond the those related to the medical community. This book raises questions regarding due process, habeas corpus, and American civil rights in general. Proof that this book is truely a classic has already arrived. These problems have returned upon our nation and what is old is now new again. Consider the shocking, current, real-life case of the crusading Harvard Medical School graduate Dr. Stefan Kruszewski, a prominent Harrisburg Pennsylvania psychiatrist, in these articles:the Philadelphia Daily News, Wed, Jul. 07, 2004\\"Lawsuit: State fired shrink for exposing abuse\\"By NICOLE WEISENSEEEGANthe British Medical Journal, July 10, 2004\\"Whistleblower charges medical oversight bureau with corruption\\"Jeanne LenzerThese articles are related to the \\"mental health initiative\\" that was announced by GW Bush and was based heavily on the Texas TMAP guidelines, which were developed and implemented in Texas while Bush was governor. The initiative was announced by Bush's \\"New Freedom Commission on Mental Health\\" and apparently involves wholesale testing of Americans, even school children, for mental illness and the administration of drugs to those found \\"wanting in sanity\\".It appears that corrupt drug companies are currently trying to turn all of America into \\"the Oregon mental hospital\\" written about in this book. With the enormous Vioxx scandal in the news right now, is this really hard to believe? It shouldn't be.In many states now one phone call can result in an innocent person being stripped of their rights, detained, interrogated, and possibly drugged to dangerous levels. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" should concern anyone who believes that \\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\" are more than just words.If you appreciate the book \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", I also recomend the followingBooks:\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf\\"The Pearl\\" by John SteinbeckTV:\\"I Am Furious Yellow\\", Simpsons episodeMovies:\\"Anger Management\\", staring Adam Sandler\\"Chicago\\", staring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger\\"A Perfect Murder\\" staring Michael Douglas"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey does not waste words.

This is truely an amazing book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Chris ArnoldEnglishDaniel SmithBook Review4.3.03One Flew Over the Cuckoo's NestThe novel that I read was \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". This novel is about a man named Randall McMurphy or Mac as some of the patients called him is sent to a psychiatric ward instead of prison for a crime that he was tried for and the outcome was spending time in the hospital. McMurphy figured out that if he acted crazy, he would not have to go to jail and spend time working and he could lounge around and do nothing in a hospital. Here at the institute, he sees that there are quite a few people whom he will have fun by giving them a hard time. McMurphy's main advisary was a woman by the name of Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was a large lady and Randall knew that it would be a task to annoy her but that he was willing to accept. Just within a couple of minutes of entering the hospital, McMurphy notices this one large gentleman whom appears to be Native American. His name is chief and he is supposed to be \\"deaf and dumb\\" yet in reality does not want to converse with anyone. Chief's first impressions of McMurphy are not good, however further on the fantastic voyage, they will have become best of friends. McMurphy eventually changes or at least has a large impact on many of the patients in the hospital and then everyone notices what his purpose that he felt like serving there really was.I would recommend this novel to those readers who enjoy a story about a supposed nut-case whom fools everyone and while noticing that the way people are treated in the hospital is unfair and unjust, then he would attempt to change it. Also if readers are looking for someone to show caring, sympathy, and special bonds being friendships to emerge from this experience, then I would really recommend this novel to anyone. You can really see how the detailed description of different characters view on events, or items that either go on or are in the hospital appear to be. Different patients, different illnesses, different perspectives, and different emotions turn Ken Kesey's novel into a masterpiece. Kesey was able to create two characters that would have the biggest impact on the audience, as well as the novel itself. Those two were McMurphy and Chief; the friendship that once was dislike and then slowly evolved into something passionate and heart warming would melt those whose hearts buckle for two people who care about someone with everything they have. Chief helped McMurphy to escape when he wanted and although he had a chance, he would not allow chief to be taken and abused, so he decided to stay back and endure the agonizing struggle to survive under Nurse Ratched's power."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"its good.

I am currently at a major bookstore and the paperback book is the same price as what amazon is offering it on kindle. I have a membership to this bookstore so actually the book would be cheaper. Its really disappointing that I am not getting a discount or a cheaper book by being \\"green\\" and not buying a paper product of a book that is 50 years old. It is actually quite obnoxious."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"An individual who sees the movie first, and expects to read one of the funniest novels ever, will be sorely disappointed. The movie, is told in some respects, from the viewpoint of R.P. McMurphy(played in the movie, brilliantly by the way, by Jack Nicholson), while the book, is told from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden(played in the movie by Will Sampson). And from Chief Bromden's perspective(that of a virtual mental ward &quot;lifer), some of the things, such as Bancini constantly moaning, &quot;I'm tired, I'm tired&quot;, which McMurphy justs finds hilarious, Bromden finds rather tragic. The viewer of the movie doesn't fully understand that nurse Racthed is &quot;evil&quot;, to some extent, I'm certain viewer's of the movie sympathized for her, but the reader of the book has absolutely no sypathy for Nurse Ratched. The reason the reader of the book has no sypmathy for Nurse Ratched is they know her whole story, she eliminates any one with independent ideas, and falsifies the results of other people's findings(for instance, if the doctor, who viewers of the movie thought would help Jack, were to diagnose MacMurphy as capable of returning to the normal world, Nurse Racthed could simply insinuate he was an alcoholic, and his diagnoses would be thrown in the trash!). Nurse Racthed is sort of the literary world's Joseph Stalin. Purposely omitting other remarkable differences from the movie, I shall end my review. All I can say is, read the book, and of course, watch the movie, it certainly won't change your life for the worse(although I can't say for sure if it will change your life for the better)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about an insane asylum in the mid part of this century. It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief Bromden looks out the window for the first time. The reader is always on the edge of his seat, waiting for something else to happen. Everyone I recommend the book to gets something a little different out of it, which is why this is such a tough review to write. You really have to read the book, because there is no real way I can explain it to you. I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who loves a good story."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am currently teaching out of this book with my 10th graders. The students are using this book as their focus on a unit called Perceptions. So far the students love the book (I can tell because of the chuckles I hear while we read as a class).

You must read this, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The first half of this book is quite slow. It does have its funny and sincere moments though. If the first half of the book was as well written as the last half, it would deem five stars. The protagonist in this tale is a good natured lug who tries to inject the spirit of life into a ward of patients of mental illness. He unveils the hollowness and darkness they live day in, and day out, while striving to weaken the clinical hold over them by the head nurse. It is a touching and heartwarming story. It illuminates the contemptible views we had, and to a large extent still have of \\"mental illness.\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I debated reading this book, assuming that it was a pulpy best seller whose subject matter was already exhausted by a very good movie. But the book has true literary merit and is infinitely better than the movie. The story is told from the viewpoint of the Chief, whose struggles with his own demons and delusions adds a whole new layer of complexity to the story. McMurphy's character is at once more iconic and more subtle than that portrayed by the movie. He struggles with the burdens of being the hero, a bit like \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", to draw on another great movie. But the Christ symbols are also more present in the book. To be sure, it's a strange Christ who strangles Nurse Ratchet. Much as you want her to be strangled, I don't think that particular twist works any better in the book than in the movie. Still, Ratchet's role as the symbol of everything that's wrong with our overly controlled and bloodless social order and McMurphy's humanity are wonderfully conveyed in this book. It's a significant book and is better than a lot of highly ranked novels of the latter half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an incredibly powerful book, especially when you consider that it was at least loosely based on Kesey's own experiences in a mental hospital while participating in government drug experiments. As someone who had watched the movie before reading the book, I was at first surprised that it was from the Chief's perspective; what would that do to the story? Well, it made it very, very intense. Bromden, or \\"Chief\\", is incredibly observant, and even his hallucinations tell the story in a very real way - he sees everything as mechanical and calculating, and believes that not only the hospital but the in fact entire world Outside is a giant \\"Combine,\\" which is set against people. His account of McMurphy's battle against Big Nurse is very insightful, from beginning to end; and of course the end is incredibly powerful and disturbing, and shows a great deal of strength of character in Bromden that has begun to emerge in the course of the book during his friendship with McMurphy. Really an amazing read, and worth it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Ken Kesey does a great job of making you feel connected to his characters. He does such a good job you almost think they are real. Another thing Ken Kesey did a good of was constantly changing the theme which kept you interested. It also had a very emotional and unexpected ending which makes this book great. I would recommend it to any one with a high shcool or higher reading level."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I enjoyed reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey because throughout the novel Randle Patrick McMurphy helps the other men realize they're not as crazy as they thought. He tries to make shortcuts through Nurse Ratched's rules. Also, he tries to get the best of her to prove she isn't as strong and powerful as the men think she is. The other men on the ward start to look up to McMurphy and begin to believe he is their savior."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I believe that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gives a different perspective of what the every day person thinks of a psyciatric ward. I myself did not find this book a real interest grabber. It draged alot in the begining and alot of the humor really wasn't that funny.One creative aspect to this story was the hallucinations that the narrorator Cheif Brodem has. Kesey uses the fog as a get away. But also as a life turner.Many of the characters in the story also did not a appiel to me. Normally there is one person you can some what relate to, but not in this case.Big Nurse to me was over exagerated and non realistic.I guess I give Kesey credit for his thoughts on paper and his imagination but I don't believe that him himself sober and not on LSD would make any type of writer."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall, I think that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a good book. I liked the way McMurphy was constantly trying to break down Nurse Ratched. Before McMurphy came along nobody ever tried to do that to the nurse, and I just thought it was pretty cool how McMurphy just came in and was a complete rebel and didn't believe that the nurse should be so overpowering to the men. McMurphy defenitly acted as the savior to all the men. He was the leader for the men to go against the rules of the ward, he help the Cheif finally regain the courage to talk to other people again and overcome \\"the fog\\", and he also helped Billy Bibbit out with his sexual problems. There were some messed up parts in the book like when the man cut his balls off to commit suicide and in the end when Billy Bibbit slit his throat because he didn't want his mother to know that he had sex with a prostitute. The ending was very superising and I didn't expect that McMurphy was going to have a lobotomy and be taken down both by the nurse. Overall I think that the book was really good and I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What I do not like about this book is the fact that they are living in a dictatorship enviroment. These chronics and acutes are put through a lot. They have no choice of what they want to do. They have to follow Nurse Ratchets every order. I feel that the only thing I like about this book is the fact that McMurphy stands up for himself and that he teachers the other people in this nut house how to stand up for themselves as well. The book has a good story line I am just not into reading about crazy peoples problems. I have enough problems of my own."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a little interesting. The words are very small but it can be very interesting reading about what goes on in mental institutions. The book takes place at a mental institution where the patients are split into Chronics and Acutes. Chronics are worse than the Acutes and need more help. Things get a little rowdy when a man by the name McMurphy comes in as a an Acute and basically tears the place up. Some people do not like him but others are inspired by him. He can be tough and controlling and shows the nurse what he can do. He tries to beat the nurse but at times seems to not be able to. Chief Bromden is the narrator of the story and is classified as a Chronic in the story. He plays off being deaf but really isn't. He later accidentally shows that he is not deaf."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Unfortunetly I have not gotten far enough to write a decent review. But from what I heard and what I have read so far, it is pretty decent. Chief Broom goes through many experiences throught the text. His personality and his character eventually grows from a very shy, \\"deaf\\" man, up to a man that can make his own desicions. The characters go through the institution with an attitude that they will soon get out. They know that they ultimatly know that the Nurse decides when they will leave. They dont tell this to the main character, who is trying ever-so-hard to get by with his 2 month sentence. Through conflicts, the loss of friends, and proving himself, he goes around defying the rules and arrouses the other patients to step up for what they believe and get them to stand up for themselves. I would recommend this book to people who want to read about a person going through his life in an instituion and wants to be free."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall, this is a decent book where all the inmates are affected by a new person by the name of McMurphy. Everyone changes once he enters the ward. Everyone starts to think for themselves and stand up for what they believe. This turns out good for some people, and bad for others. One of the main characters, Chief Bromden, is a large Native American who is thought to be dumb and deaf. Over the course of McMurphy's stay, he comes out of his shell and actually speaks. There are other people who come out in different ways. For example, Billy Bibbit is a shy man who stutters, and McMurphy changes him. He finally gets a woman and then Nurse Ratched, the \\"bad person\\" of the story, finds this out and threatens to tell his mom. He ends up committing suicide. Ratched represents repressed life while McMurphy is very outgoing. I recommend this book to any person in high school or above. This book is complicated to read in the beginning, but over time it gets easier. This is a decent book to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Great characterization and writing style. The characters were well developed and portrayed, the antagonists were destestable, and one really cared for the protagonists. McMurphy, the novel's hero, was wonderfully 3-dimensional. Though not perfectly good, one was able to look past his flaws and see the depth of his character--the good he did in the asylum/hospital greatly outweighed his past wrongs. The people in this novel were realistic, with emotion and feeling. Great book! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Buy it and stick with it until the end.

I can somewhat understand ones initial boredom with the novel, for it is written slightly longwinded, but the prose is so genuinely engaging that its style quickly becomes its biggest drawing point.Many know of \`One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', not as a novel but as an Oscar winning motion picture starring Jack Nicholson. While the film is brilliant on just about every level, it all started here, with this fantastic novel. Ken Kesey had inside knowledge of his subject, having worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital himself, and this knowledge is present on just about every page. He beautifully (albeit tragically) filters through the lives of the patients and the staff, exposing the darkness (masked in humor at times) that permeates the lives of those living in such conditions. The novel pits two very strong willed and independently centered individuals against one another in a game of \`good cop/bad cop' as either one attempts to attain complete control of the ward.First we have the ruthless Nurse Ratched who establishes order through an iron fist. She forces and manipulates and destroys those in front of her, namely the patients as well as fellow staff. She degrades the men in her ward and blackmails the doctors, all the while carrying a sense of duty, as if her actions were for the betterment of those around her.Next we have McMurphy, the rookie patient who is a Vietnam vet with a history of violence and insubordination. He opted out of the work camp and chose to serve his time in the mental ward, hoping for a quick pardon. He uses his time to try and selfishly dethrone the evil Nurse, masking over his actions with the air of sincerity, as if his actions were for the betterment of those around him.The novel is narrated by the Chief, a large patient thought by all to be deaf, dumb and unintelligible. This allows him to watch everyone and judge accurately, for they are open around him, thinking that he cannot understand. He takes us up close and personal, letting us into everyone's circle and exposing their true intentions.What I remember most about the film was that it left me conflicted as to my thoughts on insanity. The film painted so vividly the thin line that runs between the stable and unstable that I found myself wondering if we all weren't just a little insane. The novel does this very same thing, just to an impressively grander degree. Each character is fleshed out in a way that his mental imbalances come across in subtle waves, and then violent crashes, almost hiding them before our eyes only to explode before us. We start to see them as normal human beings, and this scares us because when they do expose their weaknesses we are stunned. The reverse can be said of the seemingly normal ones, like Nurse Ratched and McMurphy. Both characters come across abrasive and childish throughout, only revealing their calm and controlled presence in rare splashes of reality. This allows us to see them as the monsters, as the crazy ones, only to be chilled once again when the fact that they are in fact that \`normal' ones sets in on us.We see them, yet we don't truly see them.Kesey's brilliant novel has been hailed by many, and the film adaptation swept the Oscar (rightfully so). Both are fantastic examples of the supreme style of manipulation, allowing us to see what we want to see only to crush us with the undeniable reality of it all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Multiple people told me before I read this book and while I was reading it that it's a great book and one of the best they've ever read.

About halfway through the book, I could almost say the same thing, I wouldn't be able to summarize what had happened at that point. This book is not hard to read or understand, but in the beginning not very much happens. Mostly beginning introduces us to the characters and allows the reader to get to know them, and it also describes the setting, which is a mental institution. The characters are all well defined and unique; they're very interesting to read about.Ken Kesey writes in a descriptive way, but not to the point that it's boring. Actually this book isn't boring at all; it's the type of book that keeps you turning the pages. For most people, the situations and characters aren't familiar at all, and it's hard not to become intrigued. Of all the classic books that I have read, this is by far the best one."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is easily one of the greatest novels ever written. Chief Bromden is, by far, the most humanizing narrator I've ever read. Though this novel is an unyielding social criticism, it's also a very effective one in that it forces the reader to empathize with confined characters while realizing the authoritarians' actions - particularly those of Nurse Ratched - seem even more villainous due to the demoralization which is felt when one is corrected or otherwise censored without being capable of understanding what it is they've done to deserve such.A beautifully written and timeless novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a very good read. You feel as though you are truly experiencing the hospital through the eyes of the chief and it is refreshing to be in the third person from all the action. Found the book to be extremely refreshing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It would be very difficult for me to say whether the novel or the film is a greater masterpiece, so I guess it would be better to say that the novel is as perfect as could be and the changes made for the film were necessary and added to the perfection of the film. Hearing this story through the eyes of \\"Chief\\" Bromden and witnessing his emergence out of the black is truly a moving experience. Nurse Ratched may be the most terrifying villain in the history of literature mainly due to the fact that her subtle torture of the patients is so believable and frustrating.It is truly an outstanding and timeless work of art."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is the Great American Novel. All other classic American literature pales by comparison. Most classsic American novels fade over time (Catcher in the Rye comes to mind in this category) or they are historical footnotes, of a time and place, like Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck or some of Hemmingway's work. Important, yes, but they read like history and lose some of their relevance.But Cuckoo's Nest reads better today than it did 45 years ago. Who is insane and who isn't? What is the bureaucratic Combine up to in the 21st Century? And who exactly fits in neatly to Society, and what are we going to do with those who refuse?Perhaps most important of all, Cuckoo's Nest is laugh out loud funny, which makes it very American, and makes it stand as tall as Chief Bromden to the other American classics. I mean, outside of Mark Twain, name an American classic novel which tackles a very serious subject and does so with riotous humor? Only one in the 20th Century, and that honor goes to Cuckoo's Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are some books I feel every teen should read.

It's fantastic with strong, memorable characters, lashings of pathos and humour - and it's very thought provoking.Choosing to see the story unfold through the fog-filled eyes of Chief Bromden was a masterstroke, a dimension the movie, for all its greatness, couldn't even hope to capture.I'm glad though this book wasn't in the mainstream when I went through school. Being forced to read it and analyse it to within an inch of its life would have sullied what I find now to be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, written by Ken Kesey, grasped my attention from the very first chapter. The story takes place in a mental hospital, located in Oregon. The patients live a dull, routine, and orderly life, until a man named Mr. McMurphey introduces some life into the hospital with his charismatic and energetic personality. He formerly worked on a farm, but supposedly pretends to be insane in order to avoid all the manual labor. Although his arrival appears to be positive, the head nurse, Nurse Ratchet, has a problem with him trying to take control of her own domain. The novel deals with a power struggle between the two and the challenge that McMurphey faces when trying to get the patients on his side. An additional twist added to this book lies in the narrator, a psychiatric patient named Chief Bromden.The characters are well developed and are interesting to read about. Each patient is given their own defined characteristics and their behaviors are a representation of the harsh and controlling influence of Nurse Ratchet. After being provided with key facts about each of the patients, you begin to question whether or not some of them are actually mentally ill. This ties into the many topics discussed in this book including what makes a person insane, a person's desire for power, man verses man, man verses machine, and many more. The plot thickens as McMurphey realizes that the day he gets released is determined only by nurse Ratchet. He is confronted with the problem of choosing between working toward defeating Nurse Ratchet and saving these men or submitting to her demands in order to leave the hospital as soon as he can. Aside from a creative and intriguing plot, the story includes impeccable writing and entertaining dialogue - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A fantastic page turner from a literary genius. As someone who was at one point (and subsequently kicked out of) a mental hospital, this book proves an all too accurate (and often hilarious) commentary on society's dismissive behavior toward all who don't fit the common definition of a \\"sane\\" human being. More than a story of friendship and self discovery, this book remains an entirely valid commentary on the human mind and social stigmatization as well as the rare, selfless act of martyrdom too often absent in the modern world. Through the hardships and strife, the message of this book is clear: learn to love yourself, learn to love others, and take control of your destiny. Beautifully written and packing a punch only Randle McMurphy could throw, this book will leave a permanent impact on anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am a student at Lindbergh High school and I have just finished reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo\`s Nest which was in my opinion a very good book. I know Ken Kesey has written other books but this one was the only one I have written so far but based off this book I know the others will be well written too. My grandpa showed me the movie which got me interested in it but when I found out Ken Kesey were not satisfied with the way the director filmed it, I wanted to read the book to get a better understanding of the story. In my opinion I liked them both but if I had to pick one I would pick the book.What I liked about the book was how there were a variety of characters with different personalities and even better was that they were put into a mental institute. The character that I enjoyed the most was McMurphy but I enjoyed the Indian just as much because of the stories he told in his past life before he was put into the hospital. The character I disliked was Mrs.Ratched which I am sure no one enjoyed but if she wasn\`t in the story it wouldn\`t of been as interesting. Mrs.Ratched is the complete opposite of McMurphy which makes the story more appealing because everything he does is in spite of Mrs.Ratched.Besides being a good book, it also seems realistic because the book was written through Ken Kesey\`s Experiences as well. It wasn\`t a science fiction or fantasy, it was written about real life characters and events that could have really happened. I read about how Ken Kesey has worked at a mental institute and talked to many of the patients at the hospital and to him all the patients seemed normal which made him think that maybe they were not crazy they just lived in a society that thought they were. I liked the book because it was realistic and it was trying to show people a message about life.The book comes off as an ordinary story but when it starts to pick up it begins to be more interesting and things start to happen that you wouldn\`t expect to. The very end was the most interesting and saddest part to me because McMurphy ends up dying. At the same time the Indian gets to be free and try to find his family that he\`s been away from for so long. To be honest, I was shocked to see McMurphy get put through that surgery and basically become a vegetable because of his behavior. I thought that McMurphy would escape with the Indian and they would become friends or it would end with that general idea.Another significant part of the book to me was the writing because of how descriptive it was about everything the characters, the hospital, and any item that was talked about in the hospital. In the very beginning it describes Mrs.Ratched and her briefcase that she is holding filled with her papers for work. So many things were said about her and the briefcase that after she was described I had a perfect image of her and that made reading it more enjoyable because I could imagine the story in my head.One Flew Over the Cuckoo\`s Nest was a very interesting book to me and I thought it was a great story with a lot of sad and happy moments. The book was creative and very very descriptive which makes it more enjoyable and easier to understand. There was not one moment in that book that was dull or hard to understand even during the dialogue were there was no action because of how entertaining and interesting the characters are in the story. I enjoyed the book and even the movie."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I recently heard an NPR conversation about the 50th anniversary of \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest\\"; the conversation referred to author Kesey's displeasure over the movie. I decided to read the book for the first time and then see the movie, which I had seen years ago. What a great read and what a great movie. Like most book-to-movie productions, the movie lacked the depth and nuances of the book and there is a key perspective shift from the book to the movie that I won't describe (it is such a pleasure to discover the shift by reading and watching.) Differences notwithstanding, both the book and movie are classics and thoroughly enjoyable and disturbing, and the stories behind the production of both are fascinating as well. A must read-and-see, so glad I am so glad I did it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Sure, I had seen the movie a few times, like everybody, and so I figured there was no pressing reason to read the book. But lately I have been getting interested in Kesey. There was an interesting article about him and his fight to make his son's death (in a car accident on an icy road) meaningful in a literary journal a couple of years ago, and I also saw the documentary \\"Magic Trip\\", which shows clearly that Kesey was a ringleader of the avant-garde group that was ushering in the counter-culture explosion of the 1960s. (Apparently he eventually turned his back on the movement he did so much to create, but that is another story.) I decided it was finally time to read something by him.I quickly discovered that this novel was much more than a good template for a movie. Nor was it merely a popular novel by a young man who became a cultural icon. This is a Great American Novel. Not only is the story and the main character fascinating and richly drawn, the prose hums with energy and color. The descriptions are full of detail (the author worked in a mental institution for a while, and knew what things were like). Kesey was capable of some very nice prose, but things never get stuffy. The story moves along nicely, and there is a lot of insight into the minds of, not just the troubled men depicted here, but men generally. My guess is that he was influenced by Kerouac and Burroughs, and probably by some traditional Western novelists too, such as Wallace Stegner, who was the director of the writing program at Stanford, where Kesey got his MFA. One of the interesting surprises here was how well Kesey wrote about the sights and sounds of rural Oregon, where he was raised and where he spent most of his life.I won't bother going into the plot or the characters of Randall McMurphy or Nurse Ratchid here, since they are so widely known. There are some interesting secondary characters who get a fuller description in the book. Professor Harding, the erudite but sexually confused and cowardly gentleman, is a bigger player in the book, as is Chief Bromden, who narrates the tale. There are large sections of hallucinatory prose in which the chief lets his twisted fantasies run wild which are fascinating to read. He also thinks back a fair amount to his childhood in a rural Indian village which was wiped out to make room for a dam. Billy Bibbitt seems very much the same on both page and film. In fact, the screenplay does a masterful job of condensing the story. A couple of incidents are cut out and others conflated, but for the most part it stays very true to the book.The themes are fairly clear from the beginning. Society breaks people down, robs them of their freedom, and forces them to conform. Lunatic asylums are mostly places where the mentally weak have come to lay low and avoid dealing with a world that has no use for them. This harsh, cold, overwhelming pressure to conform is personified by \\"the big nurse\\" (as Nurse Ratchid is called) a manipulative, heartless bitch who has no love for her patients or desire to cure them, but wants only to make them give in and follow the rules. (I am sure by the way that feminists would have some issues with this book, since the women in it are mostly either kindly prostitutes or Nurse Ratchid - but it is important to point out that the book takes place in a men's mental hospital. I would hope that Kesey's female characters were deeper in other things he wrote.) \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" presents a rebellious young man's view of the world to be sure, and the author was a rebellious young man when he wrote it. This way of thinking was a big part of the 1960s ethos - personal, individual freedom from social mores and restrictions was seen as an unquestionable good. Kesey was one of the people who put it into words and images and characters, and he did so brilliantly in this novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is so well written I can call it flawless without giving it a second thought. I can see why Kesey had a problem with the way the screenplay was put together. Kesey himself couldn't have done this book justice as a screenplay. This one of the few \\"classics\\" that deserves all the hype it gets. If you read it once you'll end up reading it five times."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Out of all the books I've read in my life, Kesey's \\"willing\\" masterpiece is nothing sort of perfect. Heavily emotional and compelling, Randle Patrick McMurphy is a beautiful character, \\"capable of doing no wrong\\". McMurphy is far from the average American, in that he willingly goes against the system (The Combine), and although he meets his fate in the end, his influence in the rest of the men in the ward is impenetrable as the book ends with Chief Bromden breaking out of the sanitary ward into nature, wild and free where life does not run on a schedule.I won't say too much more about this book, but I definitely recommend either buying it here on Amazon or, if you don't have the dough, borrowing it from your local library. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest does have the potential to change your life...and change your heart."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book. Ken Kesey has a great insight into how our minds work and the societal breakdown that people can suffer. None of his main characters are \\"crazy\\" per se, but just unable to handle the \\"outside world\\" mentally and emotionally. But these men are smart and will give readers and insight to themselves that they may have never realized if it weren't for this book.\\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is told in the narrative of one of the asylum residents who plays \\"deaf and dumb\\" to everyone around him so he is able to get closet o people and hear their conversations.The story is based on Nurse Ratched's strict orders and rules for the ward and MacMurphy's determination to break down those rules. This battle of wills is charming and amusing and will keep readers turning the pages to see how each battle is won."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the best books, if not the best, I've ever read.It translates many things people feel but don't know how to express- for example, &quot;The Combine,&quot; or &quot;fog.&quot; Chief Broom is schizophrenic, which allows the book to be written in a very interesting matter. But most importantly it is beautifully written.One of my favorite quotes:&quot;It started slow and pumped itself full welling the men bigger and bigger. I watched, part of them, laughing with them- and somehow not with them. I was off the boat, blown up off the water and skating the wind with those black birds, high above myself, and I could look down and see myself and the rest of the guys see the boat rocking there in the middle of those diving birds, see McMurphy surrounded by his dozen people, and watch them, us swinging a laughter that rang out on the water in ever-widening circles, farther and farther, ntil it crashed up on beaches all over the coast, on beaches all over all coasts in wave after wave after wave.&quot;&quot;"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"the topic explored in one flew over the cuckoo's nest is not innovative by any means, it is touched on in other novels like a clock work orange and 1984, perhaps more clearly. the detail that sets it apart from these other novels, though, is the setting. placed at a mental hospital, it allows the book to dabble in the socially taboo subject of dementia, daring to explore the effects of government intervention and ostracism. this is not a book that makes you feel particularly happy or enlightened, but an excellent read nonetheless."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A book is a book, but nevertheless there seems to be always something special about one. There are those books that are incredibly boring, and others that grab the reader and touch their hearts or perhaps chill them to their bones. But &iexcl;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&iexcl;s Nest&iexcl; is something in between all of this. Not something that feels too extreme, yet more of something that makes the reader wonder.Taking place in the a mental ward in the sixties, the story is told through the thoughts and eyes of a Native American Indian chief Bromden, who escapes into the fog which is created by his own paranoia till the new patient Randle Patrick McMurphy arrives. The boisterous McMurphy brings a spark into the depressing mood of the hospital, breaking the monotonous pattern of life in the ward and challenging the authority of the Big Nurse Ratched.But to tell the truth, the plot was not what interested me but rather the characters themselves. Each was so vividly described from appearance to personality; all were well defined and varied from one person to another. Perhaps it was just the fact that each of them had various different mental disorders that made them act the eccentric ways they do, like Bromden who is lost in his fog, hiding from the world and Harding who&iexcl;s sophisticated speech contrasts with his squeaking laugher.But to come back to the point, the book really is something that seems somewhat enigmatic to me. Perhaps it is just that I read too much fiction, but the line between the delusions and hallucinations of Bromden and what is really happening in the ward are blurred. Creating a soupy mixture of reality and illusions, which at some points confuses me (that&iexcl;s why its four stars not five).As a reader I found myself wondering what it all was; what was the root of the problem, why was it attacking Bromden and various other questions. Here the human trait of curiosity is played on, and I found myself falling deep into the storyline seeking to satisfy my inquisitiveness. Undeniably a very good read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of the few cases where the much more commercial movie is actually better than the book! But don't get me wrong, because the book is very good too! Like the movie, its about a man who pretends to be crazy in order to escape a jail sentence but instead of focusing on him, the book focuses more on the character of the Native American, his fellow in-mate. It gives insights into the character's past that the movie tends to ignore and this makes the ending of the story make more sense.a"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book, put simply, shattered me. Anyone who says that they &quot;understand&quot; the book and think its morals are quite wrong is quite mistaken. This book does not present you with clear morals to live by, in fact, I don't think any book does. A book is nothing more than a story... it is left to you to draw from it what you like. As I reached the end, I began to realize that this book like no other shows you that some times the fog is so thick in every direction that you are not elft with any clear &quot;right&quot; option. When the inmates were runnig around drunk through the ward, I thought that this had to be the happy world Kesey meant to show, and that there was a clear moral to the book after all. However, my good state of mind was bashed apart immediately when Billy broke down in front of the nurse. It proved that the world is, however much we like to ignore it, a very dark place, no matter how you choose to live. So, in the end, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is probabley the best written piece of work with the best, most well-executed, and very rich story I can remember reading. It ultimately proves, to some degree, as Scanlon said, &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't...&quot;"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"For a book written by a paid volunteer to use hallucinogenic drugs, a book written by a man who at some points while writing was under the influence of LSD and peyote, and a book that funded the writer's San Francisco to New York road trip on psychedelically painted bus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest turned out perfectly normal, in fact even clever and stimulating. Considered a masterpiece by many, this novel is an extremely insightful satire of the society of the 1950's. Just as the drugs and psychedelic bus may suggest, Kesey could in fact be considered a founding-father of hippie-ism. His \\"hippie\\" attitudes shine through with this book, which in many ways challenges numerable aspects of authority and society. The setting is inspired by Kesey's work at the Menlo Park, Virginia hospital, where he was introduced to LSD by a government-sponsored program researching the effects of hallucinogenic drugs. This experience led him to continue his drug use, and further developed his opinions of society, which we can read about in this excellent book. The story starts when R.P. McMurphy is admitted into the mental ward, transferred from a work farm. He's a self-proclaimed gambling champion and womanizing sex machine, a rough-around-the-edges cowboy of a jokester. McMurphy is the one person who stands up to Nurse Ratched, the symbol of the cold oppression and conformity in society. The book is the story of the patients' struggle against the strict policy and rules of the ward. Under the leadership of McMurphy, who sings, laughs, walks around wearing only a towel, and does anything that he can think of which will disrupt the cold order that Nurse Ratched has on the ward, their adventures include everything from rowdy poker games, to a fishing trip, to a completely against policy late night party in the ward, complete with alcohol, marijuana, and prostitutes. The books end is sad, but realistic and a reminder of the control society ultimately has The narrator of the book is the paranoid Chief Bromden, a 7 foot something giant of an Indian who fakes deaf and dumb in order to hear everything and yet remain safe. It is his narration that keeps the book interesting. Bromden, always standing in the corner with a broom, is able to see and hear everything that goes on in the ward. He is extremely insightful and the style that Kesey uses to portray Bromden as a character is very entertaining to read. Bromden, a paranoid schizophrenic, at some points in the story, hallucinates. The imagery that he provides is usually mechanical and he often talks about seeing fog from a machine that the nurse controls. His hallucinations are metaphors, he describes the ward as having hidden mechanical components, and frequently he sees fog that represents confusion and fear. He depicts society as a combine, a giant machine, and all of the patients at the hospital are broken parts needing repair. They are parts that didn't fit into their place in the machine, didn't fit into the conformity of society. Not only is it an entertaining read, but also a compelling cautionary story. Kesey is giving a warning about a society centered around conformity. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is Kesey's investigation of the control of the 1950's society over the individual, bringing into play themes ranging from the importance of laughter and sexuality to the definition of insanity. The book's ending gets mixed reactions, but it is realistic, and a reminder of the control society ultimately has. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a fantastic book, a highly recommended read, both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"this was a brilliant book. once again, ken kesey establishes wit, courage, and remarkable tactics in his words. well done."},{"Title":"Green Hell","review":"This is not the real \\"Green Hell\\"!!!!!It's not a great book either.

It is a truly amazing story that will keep you enthralled whether you read it slow or fast.

Bravo to the story and all those involved in bring this facinating tale to readers. 5 stars for story, -2 stars for delivery"},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"Rabbit Proof Fence was a slow going book; you had to really have the will to continue reading. The first 50 pages consisted of Doris Pilkington describing the history of Western Australia in the late 1800's/early 1900's. It was slightly confusing since she skipped between different tribes and places, all of which are in a completely different language- sometimes full sentences would be in an aboriginal dialect. She then followed a couple of young girls. It finally started to get interesting and worthwhile. But then, instead of the book reaching the climax and enthralling you, it loses it. I got completely bored for the last 75 pages; it seemed as though it was the same thing happening over and over. The ending also seemed quite rushed, as though she had to fit it in a certain number of pages. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are obsessed with Australian history or know how to read many confusing aboriginal languages."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"Sorry folks I just could not get through this book.

The pace of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" helped me be there.I would reccomend reading the book (even though I didn't...) and highly recommend viewing the DVD. I experienced the grace and courage that exists in all of us at some level."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"It's an insult to Doris Pilkington and to the children's endeavour alike to race through this book. Still, circumstances dictated [the film was waiting] and the deed was done. Which merely led to a re-read. This real-life story of three young girls escaping from the looming slavery of a Christian mission to return home is another entry on the balance sheet of imperialism. With immense forces arrayed against them, the three evaded all pursuit, even expert Aborigine trackers, to cross half a continent to rejoin their families. The distance covered was likely the longest walk in Australian history.The roots of this story lie in the opening chapters which recount the actions of European visitors and settlers against the indigenous Australian population. Women were raped, murdered or abandoned. Men were killed, imprisoned, led into slavery as they watched their traditional lands overrun by cattle, sheep or grain. The ease with which firearms overcame spears added to the European's attitude of \\"superiority\\". By the time of Molly Craig's capture, killing had been mostly abandoned in favour of \\"assimilation\\" - a mild word for indentured servitude. Molly, recognised the fallacy of being forced into an unwanted life. She took steps to avoid this fate - many steps, as it turned out. Enough to hide from pursuers, do some elusive backtracking and arrive at home. At least 1800 km of mostly barefoot walking.There were adventures enough along the way, and some ironies. Although alerted to their escape, the wives of white selectors fed, clothed and sheltered them briefly. Then dobbed them in to the police after the trio had again gone bush. The girls lived on donated food, captured rabbits, birds' eggs or whatever else the bush provided. Each contributed as best they could. It was enough. Seven weeks after their escape, two of the three were reunited with family. Yet, nine years later, Molly Craig, this time carrying her infant daughter, had to repeat her incredible performance.To those complaining the book is too brief, one can only ask: \\"What would you add?\\". This is an Aborigine tale told in an Aborigine manner. It doesn't examine the lives and motivations of such people as A. O. Neville or Const. Rigg. It doesn't delve into the psychological foundations of Molly or Gracie or even Mrs Flanagan. The book presents the tale as it occurred without ostentation or enhancement. There are numerous works on the conquest of Australia and its \\"White Only\\" policy and its implications. This story, stark and simple, stands on its own merits. Don't read it too quickly. There is too much to learn. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"If you are interested in what happens to native or aboriginal peoples when whites try to incorporate them into a white culturally based society, READ THIS BOOK! The book is 10x better than the movie...full of real details. Even though this story was told orally from a vantage point of 60+ years, it is backed up with articles, poice reports,etc. Very credible and tragic story."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of 3 young part-Aboriginal girls in Australia, the oldest only fifteen years of age. Historically, \\"half-caste children\\", (half-Aboriginal and half-Caucasian) were considered wards of the Australian government and were, therefore, forcibly removed from their families and taken to settlment schools that were little more than jails. The purpose of these schools was to prepare these Aboriginal children for their role in white society as domestics and farmworkers. This book is a true story of 3 girls who escaped from the Moore River Settlement school. Their story is nothing less than amazing. The description of the \\"weevily porridge\\" that they were served for breakfast at the school, or the sheets that were only issued when the big inspectors were coming to visit and the other hardships they faced should sadden and anger every reader. Unfortunately, there are many similarities between their story and the treatment of Native Americans in this country. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"What a great 300 page story packed into 100 pages. This is one of those stories that everyone should read, but sadly the delivery of the walk home is so straightforward. I wanted to know more about what the three girls went through, I wanted to really be able to see into them a little more. That said, western readers love characters. They do. It's a trait of being brought up on those books we all read in high school. This book does subvert expectations about character being central rather than journey or community. Indeed, journey and community are paramount to this story. But I still would have loved 200 more pages. So many places left me wanting for more landscape, more discussion of language, more description of the people. Just more. Read it, but know that there's a whole other story underneath this one as well."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"A different kind of coming-of-age story, set in Australia. And the kids are three aborininal girls (remember that at one time the Austrailans considered the aboriginal people to be animals, or at least sub-human) who trek across sere and wild landscapes to return to their home.Then realize that this is a true story, told by the daughter of one of the three girls who, along with maybe thousands of other children, were separated from their families by government edict, forced to 'live as white.' It was a misguided effort at assimilation, masquerading as well-intentioned but in reality was a formal effort to erase an entire culture.Rabbit-Proof Fence is an inspiring story of survival, defiance, resiliance, and ultimately of love."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"I first saw the Miramax movie starring Kenneth Branagh, which was based upon this book. I was intrigued enough by the film to read this book. I was not disappointed. This book is certainly a testament to the human spirit. It also reveals the harsh, paternalistic and racist policies that the Australian government imposed upon its Aboriginal population.In 1931, the Australian government issued an edict that mandated that all Aboriginal and part Aboriginal children were to be forcibly removed from their homes and taken to special settlements where they were to be assimilated. There, while living in inhumane and degrading conditions, they would be taught to be culturally white, would be mandated to speak English only, and would be trained to be domestic help or laborers in white households.The author tells the reader the story of three young girls, Mollie, Gracie, and Daisy, who had Aboriginal mothers and White fathers. Ranging in age from nine to fifteen years old, the three girls were forcibly removed from their loving families and taken to a special settlement. The girls rebelled against this system, and, homesick, escaped from such a settlement. They left with iterally just the clothes on their back. Their only guide home would be a rabbit-proof fence that stretched for over a thousand miles across Australia.The girls Aboriginal heritage and survival skills would come in handy throughout their nearly nine week long trek across Australia, as they were forced to subsist on the land and the occasional kindness from strangers. They had to endure thirst, hunger, and danger, while avoiding being caught along the way by professional trackers, police on the lookout for them, and white settlers that were unsympathetic to their situation.This story is a most personal one for the author, as one of the girls, Molly, is the author's mother. Told in a straightforward, factual manner, it is an incredible story that is an indictment of the Australian government's racist policies against its Aboriginal people and its imperialistic self-proclaimed superiority over them."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"I was enthralled by this story. It is also educational.Having seen the movie, I just had to read the book to get the details--and I might add, the real truth about the details. For example, in the book it is Gracie and Daisy, not Molly, who first approach a house for food. (I don't know why this is changed in the movie.) I thought this was wise on Molly's part, since younger children are often times better received by strangers.If you don't have a lot of time to read, you might appreciate the brevity of this book. The \\"Glossary of Mardujara Words\\" is helpful, especially since some non-English words appear in the book more than once."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"I read this book after a trip to Australia and after seeing the movie. Don't know what to say about it other then it left me speechless. Is there a country anywhere in the world that hasn't treated it's indigenous people horribly at some point? Rabbit Proof Fence is a pretty amazing story of human spirit. I would suggest reading the book first then seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"Rabbit-Proof Fence is the most fantastic film we ever watched at school.We think that the film is even better than the book because you are touched by the landscape and the music of the Australian continent.

Enjoy reading and do not forget watching the film!Thank you."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"This may be an absolute first, and hopefully last, but I am going to say it: the movie is better than the book. While the premise of the book is amazing, the actually book is poorly written, at times grammatically incorrect, and a huge disappointment. There is a little insight from the girls' perspective and the first fifty pages or so is a disorganized retelling of european colonization. The first half of the book jumps around all over the place with little to no transition between completely new subjects.Sure, its a \\"quick read,\\" but there is a reason: the writing is elementary and often rushed. Where the heck was this woman's editor?"},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"'Rabbit-Proof Fence' is the short, but completely captivating story of three girls escape from a half-caste aboriginal centre and their epic, long walk home back to their families. This book is simply written, but extremely evocative and can easily be read in a couple of hours. But, for those hours, you will live and breathe the lives of these tenacious and brave girls completely. Written by the daughter of one of the girls (Molly) and pieced together from recollections and telegram records, this book charts what the human spirit is capable of and what bravery was shown by the girls to get back to their homes. A simple story, beautifully told and one to leave you awe inspired and full of respect.

In America after the Indian wars in the late 1800'sIndian children were kidnapped as well. It was all done with very good intentionsof making good white men and women of the childrenwho ended up as a new kind of indentured servant in many cases and never saw their real families again.I've never heard of any of the American Indians escaping and making the trip home,but it is known that they many of them did return to reservation lifeand their family rather than be servants in east coast homes.I learned of this doing genealogy research on names related to mine by vowel changes(Bagola is an Indian surname).That three young girls made it home under such conditionsis just amazing. For that alone the story is an epic... but theyhad \\"professional\\" trackers on their trail as if they were hardened criminalsunder a death sentence. It is a classic in role reversal for this reason.Other stories of the mistreatment of natives peoples and their childrenexist, but this is a classic."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"Even the best of countries has its dark spots. In one of the best of countries - Australia - half-white, half-aborigine children were taken from their homes in a forced assimilation into white society. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is about three young girls who ran away from this forced assimilation and walked back to their native people across the Australian outback. Although the story is interesting, the writing is such that getting through the book, even at a slim 130 pages, is as slow and plodding as the girls' trek itself.The first half of the book is a snapshot history of Western Australia. Although some points are interesting, it is far too disorganized and even rambling to provide a solid picture of the period. This is further complicated by the author's slant of the native people living in peace and harmony before the brutish white man came along. No doubt there is truth to this, even a large degree of truth. But as the aborigines are later described as voluntarily working for whites and describing certain employers in positive terms, it is obvious that the full story and texture of the environment is not provided.The latter part of the book describes the girls' actual journey from the southern part of Western Australia to the north, following the rabbit-proof fence which dissects the country and will lead them home. Even given the lifeless writing style, one cannot help but be impressed with the tenacity this required, especially as they had professional trackers on their trail. This book is good for someone interested in Austalia but be forwarned that the writing is not up to telling a tale such as this."},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"this is a great book. should be read by everybody. it's a nice reminder that we have lots of work to do.True story and it has been around for a while even made into a movieRead the book"},{"Title":"Rabbit-Proof Fence","review":"I saw the movie and was fascinated with the story line.

Molly made me proud and also all schools should teach about Aborigines because I had never heard of them nor their history until I turned the channel one day. I saw it maybe three times, and said to heck with it because I kept missing the beginning. I decided to order this book because those little angels were amazing. The Canadian reviewer said it best; DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THIS BOOK because this is an extremely important story. I am going to spread awareness obo the Aborignals, the Mardujara tribe, and the people of Jigalong.Do you realize I finished the book Sunday, and I am now reading it again? I will read the book until I get sick of it; over and over. Now, the movie producer changed a lot of important events around. For instance, in the movie Gracie was captured on those tracks, but in the book it stated that DAISY WILLINGLY went with some woman to meet her mother, but a few days later that woman turned her in; the producer meant to say Gracie was caught. The producer mixed Gracie up with Daisy. Gracie is now deceased, so Daisy is the one who was in the film with Molly. Mrs. Pinkerton said this was ONE of the greatest escapes of all time; well she was wrong because THIS WAS IN FACT THEE GREATEST ESCAPE OF ALL TIMES, and in my opinion it was the longst walk EVER IN THE WORLD (not just Australia). No one in the USA has ever walked that far, and in that condition. NEVER! Those babies were mentally strong and I hope the Lord will bless the rest of their days with rest and relaxation. I also hope Mrs. Pinkerton was able to talk the two remaining survivors into going on a nice vacation outside of Austrailia. I doubt it though because at the end of the movie Dgudu said \\"I'm never leaving this place again--I'm staying right here in Jigalong\\". God, I love her and the younger sisters/cousins as well. They sure blessed my soul through their courage and willpower.You must count your blessings people. These women lived a hard life, and then the \\"Protector\\" of Aboriginals had the audacity to take Molly and the author later in life. What is this I'll teach you housekeeping mess? I sure wish I could have given that nut a piece of my mind. The US President should have done something to help those lovely people. I guess not due to the era; the 1940's.

After the pointlessly long and tiring introduction, you are quickly 'introduced' to the three main characters, who are quickly picked up by a white police officer to take them to a school for children of mixed race. The author gives long, uninteresting descriptions of the landscape and the people that they meet on their brief trip. The three girls spend about five or six pages at the school once they arrive, before they decide to escape. And the next 100 or so pages are more long, uninteresting descriptions of the landscape as they travel back home.

However, current reprints of this dictionary (including this Hendrickson one, which I own) suffer from the blurriness of letters that inevitably comes from copies photographed from earlier copies or from editions printed with very worn old plates.While I know of no recent published dictionary that covers the Targumim, there is a very recent dictionary that covers Talmudic and Geonic literature, and incidentally contains much of the vocabulary of the Targumim. It is Michael Sokoloff'sA Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods. See my review of it for more details. However, its price puts it out of the range of all but the most serious students. So for those not yet prepared to shell out well over $100, Jastrow's dictionary remains the alternative--and not a bad one.I was surprised to see that one reviewer said that Jastrow lists words by root, because he does not, at least not as most people count this. Nouns such as _mas.s.uth_ are listed alphabetically, not under the root _ns.'_. The reviewer must be referring to the fact that the various verb stems are all listed under the Peal/G stem.

During that Exile, Israel found itself.It not only rediscovered the Torah and made it the rule of life, but under its influence new religious institutions, such as the synagogue, i.e., congregational worship without priest or ritual, came into existence - one of the most far-reaching spiritual achievements in the whole history of Religion.At the re-establishment of the Jewish Commonwealth, Ezra the Sofer, or Scribe, in the year 444 B.C.E. formally proclaimed the Torah the civil and religious law of the new Commonwealth.He brought with him all the oral traditions that were taught in the Exile, and he dealt with the new issues that confronted the struggling community in that same spirit which had created the synagogue.His successors, called after him Soferim (Scribes'), otherwiseknown as the \`Men of the Great Assembly', continued his work. Their teachings and ordinances received the sanction of popular practice, and came to be looked upon as halachah, literally, \`the trodden path', the clear religious guidance to the Israelite in the way he should go. When the Men of the Great Assembly were no more, the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem took their place. The delight of all those generations was in the Law of the Lord, and in His Law did they meditate day and night. When their exposition followed the verses of Scripture, it was called Midrash; and when such exposition followed the various precepts, it was known as Mishnah.Academies arose for systematic cultivation of this New Learning, as well as for the assiduous gathering of the oral traditions current from times immemorial concerning the proper observance of the commandments of the Torah. This movement for the intensive study of Scripture did not pass unchallenged. The aristocratic and official element of the population - later known as the Sadducees - unhesitatingly declared every law that was not specifically written in the Torah to be a dangerous and reprehensible innovation.The opposition of the Sadducees only gave an additional impetus to the spread of the Oral Law by the Scribes, later known as the Pharisees. What they sought was the full and inexhaustible revelation which God had made.The knowledge of the contents of that revelation, they held, was to be found in the first Instance in the Written Text of the Pentateuch; but the revelation, the real Torah, was the meaning of that Written Text, the Divine thought therein disclosed, as unfolded in ever greater richness of detail by successive generations of devoted teachers.\`Apart from the direct intercourse of prayer,' says Herford, \`the study of Torah was the way of closest approach to God; it might be called the Pharisaic form of the Beatific Vision. To study Torah was to think God's thoughts after Him, as Kepler said."},{"Title":"Mythology and You, Student Edition","review":"bought this for a siblings course requirement. does what it needs too. this was a good purchase at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Mythology and You, Student Edition","review":"I aboslutly loved this book!!!

It also brings awareness to the wonder and miracle of life and our connection to the environment. It promotes values that are important and does more than simply entertain. The content can spark meaningful dialogues with your children about the things that really matter most in life.The book also explores adversity and the need to turn inward for guidance when things get tough. This is a good lesson to learn early and The Gift of You, The Gift of Me makes the point that after a storm the sun returns and the whole process of life is a miracle.The illustrations in this book are colorful and creative. Every other page is a full page water color drawing that convey emotion and has highly symbolic content. Just the thing to spark a young person's imagination.The book is short and doesn't have a lot of words. However, the words were chosen carefully and are packed with meaning. It is the type of book you can be interactive with and you can uncover layers of meaning with as a child gets older.I have an upcoming speaking engagement where I am going to read this book to a group of children as a separate part of my speaking committment. I am using it because this book is a good touchstone for talking about the mystery of life, hope and gratitude for the good things in life that so often go unnoticed, especially when adversity hits like physical illness. I think it's perfect for this occasion, but no time is the wrong time to introduce children to an attitude of gratitude for what is good in their lives."},{"Title":"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me","review":"\\"The Gift of You the Gift of Me\\" cleverly captures how the little cat Jamile appreciates the really important things in life, especially nature and those we love and those who love us. When difficult times come, Jamile thinks of those really important things, and finds courage and peace of mind. The poignant story of the \\"Gift of You\\" makes a wonderful present for young and old alike."},{"Title":"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me","review":"\\"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me\\" is a beautifully written and illustrated picture book which offers hope and wisdom. At its center is the little cat Jamile, who each day walks down the lane to visit his \\"tree friends.\\" He listens to the trees quietly expressing their gratitude for the beauty of nature in a cadence that will sooth and comfort both child and adult alike:Thank you forA place of peaceA place of dreamsAnd a place of sleepThank you for the ancient stonesFor sand and seaAnd a place called homeSuch flow is reminiscent of the soothing tone of \\"Good Night Moon.\\"\\"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me\\" also carries a message of hope. One day, Jamile is unable to visit the trees because of a terrible storm, and he retreats to his home, \\"tired and cold.\\" Yet even in his sadness, he is able to recall the voices of the trees, and in doing so, he finds not only comfort but also strength and courage. He realizes that expressing our gratitude helps us, and so he is able thank his eyes, his ears, his hands:Thank you hands,For reaching out,Over sadness and over doubtToward all that is of wonder.The book also offers \\"a secret\\" that makes us free, which is recongizing what Martin Buber calls the \\"I-Thou relationship\\": that \\"you\\" are a gift, and so am \\"I.\\"An Amazon-Listmania reader/writer has already said that the illustrations are worthy of a Caldecott, and I truly agree.

At first glance The Gift of You The Gift of Me appeared to be simply a lovely story-poem, but that impression gave way quickly as the allegory in Jamile's story emerged. This book is filled with unexpected and thrilling depths. In fact, it is a beautifully written testament to the life changing and saving qualities gained by the habit of gratitude. This book is for EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me","review":"My children and I are so happy to have found and to be enjoying this book! The writer has reminded my children through the book (and me, as well) that there are wonderful gifts upon the earth that almost every human being,universally, may enjoy and drink in...\\"the ring around the moon at night...the western sky...the air we breathe...a place of dreams and a place of sleep.\\" She connects us with all that has come before (\\"Thank you for the ancient stones...\\"), and with feelings that we have all experienced at some time (\\"the color of joy and the shape of love\\").Even death is something understood to be thankful for, in the sense that it is part of the cycle of life, and that death often leads to life which comes after. We all know this to be true. A seed must die in order for a tree to be born. Dead leaves from the fall, nourish the earth and help the plants and flowers to thrive in the springtime. Such wisdom is great for children, especially when they experience the death of a loved one or beloved pet...That there is a larger perspective and a plan, and death is a part of it. Not that it is easy or simple, but it somehow is part of a larger, ongoing process of life that is good. (This is not part of the book, but just even on the simplest level, think what life on this globe would be like if no creature from the dawn of history, and no plant, had ever died but continued to live throughout all the ages of the earth!)The book points out, without being \\"preachy,\\" that even toes, eyes, ears, hands, and sweet memories are terrific things we can appreciate while going through hard times! Life does indeed become lonely at times, says Webster, but even when we feel we have no friends, the trees are our friends. They continually give to us, even when we're not noticing this giving.And, insightfully, Webster adds that during lonely times, \\"remember to thank your Self, that you have traveled this far along your path and in your heart.\\" Life is indeed often very hard, even for children. Each day that is lived and survived in a tough phase of life can be an act of courage. Webster shows them, and us, that we can give our own souls credit for just going on in the face of adversity - and to realize at the end of a hugely saddening day, that we have indeed accomplished something: we have gotten through it! We have survived it! We are still trying, and have not given up on life. (Shouldn't they have a Girl Scout or a Boy Scout badge for this? The \\"Survival in Adversity\\" badge. How important it is for children to learn how to do this because there WILL be adversity in their lives.)The book neatly sums up its lyric journey through the blessings of life with the following, final things for which to be thankful: \\"for believing, loving, feeling, seeing, the gift of Earth, the miracle of being.\\" I love that with this book, I can reinforce to my kids what I have been trying to teach them: that life itself is a miracle, and to live in such a beautiful place as Earth, and to be able to know ourselves to be alive and in communion with the Earth, with our fellow human beings, and with our own souls, is a miracle.Sometimes our eyes can be so focused upon our troubles that we cannot see the positives in our lives. But all around us is a magnificent, marvelous world, and people with whom to share love, and a world full of hope and reasons to give thanks, even if they are not the things after which people so avidly chase: wealth, popularity, admiration and an absence of sadness (from which we run away).I love that the author is never preachy in this book. Many books for children geared towards the theme of \\"thankfulness\\" are \\"you should\\" types of books. But this book, written as it is from the perspective of Jamile's thoughts extending themselves in saying \\"thanks\\" to the trees, etc., helps to draw children in and brings them to a natural point of gratitude without telling them they MUST be grateful. The book has a comfortable, reflective flow which envelops and welcomes and embraces with acceptance. Children feel completely at home reading this lovely book and relate to Jamile when he is happy and also when he is lonely in the dark in his bed.A word about the illustrations: we have rarely seen such innovative illustrations in a book. They have a kind of 20th-century art, symbolic feel; yet are, like the text, so warm, embracing and \\"drawing-in.\\" The colors are vibrant and rich. The little cat is so adorable as he walks around observing nature, becoming carried away by a fast-flowing river, staring up at a vast sky full of stars, hiding under his covers in his bed with front paws just bent over the top edge of the covers, and peeking out of the corner of a lit window of his house at night. Children see themselves in the cat Jamile! This strikes me as a beautiful technique, because the child doesn't feel distanced from the thoughts of the book by illustrations which depict a child very different from himself. The cat Jamile is a \\"universal\\" character. We each can see ourselves in Jamile as he walks through the pages of this book, looking at life...pondering...and finally reaching understanding."},{"Title":"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me","review":"As a veteran teacher, I cannot express how grateful I am that a book has hit the shelves that profoundly addresses gratitude -- and in such a thoughtful and artful way!

Thus, whether Nina Reilly is fulfilling her role as a tough attorney or feeling more intimate emotions listeners become involved, all due to Merlington's performance. She delivers again in \\"Case Of Lies.\\"The 11th thriller in the popular Nina Reilly series finds Nina back on home ground - in her Lake Tahoe law office. The case she faces may be old (two years) but it's far from finished. A new client, David Hanna, comes to her to relate the story of how his wife was shot and killed during a robbery at a casino. He feels the casino should be responsible for not providing adequate security.The shooter was never caught but there were witnesses. The victims of the robbery - three MIT students originally lied about their identities and now are staying in California to avoid being called by a Nevada court.As Nina tries to track down the truth about what happened on that night two years ago she treks to Germany to interview two of witnesses. As it turns out, they are in a village not far from where her son's father lives.Affairs of justice and affairs of the heart are mingled in this absorbing story by Perri O'Shaughnessy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I've been reading Perri O'Shaughnessy books from the very beginning and I've always enjoyed them. I love the Nina Reilly character, but the math in this book was just a bit too much. I think the story could have survived with a lot less detail where the mathematics were concerned. I don't think the average person, myself included, could follow the technical explanations. The end takes a little twist, which is always a pleasure. It will be nice seeing where Nina goes from here."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I did not like this book. First of all it seemed to be about two different things, math and murder. While I recognize Elliott Wakefield's importance to the story, his math theories could have taken up about two pages and made clear that he was a genius who would some day possibly change the world but the authors went on and on with detailed information that I doubt many people understood or cared about. Would many who understand the concept of this math even read this type of book? Then Nina takes a sleazy client and agrees to represent him. He isn't really interested in pursuing the case regarding his wife's murder or getting any money but agrees because of the push to do so by his brother-in-law and neice who foot the legal bills. Plus he doesn't want to get stuck with the respondent's legal fees if the suit is allowed to be kicked out of court for non-action. Then after conferring with the opposing attorney, Nina convinces him the settlement offered of $50,000. is probably the best he will get. He agrees to accept that. Suit over! No wait, while her client is in jail for DWI, she lies to the judge and says her client agrees with her when he knows nothing about what she is doing, gets the settlement dropped, lies again to the same judge to get the robbery victims named as respondents in the suit because they won't come to CA to testify as she wants. Bob is worried about his dad because he has something wrong with his hands and works hard to earn money to visit him. Nina knows this but after a brief talk with Kurt, tells Bob \\"they\\" decided he shouldn't visit, another lie. Then to make matters worse several innocent people are murdered because of her \\"pursuit\\" of justice and in the end she has no honor. She steals Elliott's math notebook, copies a page, wants to copy the whole thing, sends it to a math professor who gives it to someone else. Who knows who ends up with it. Then flies to XYC headquarters, gives them part of Elliott's theory, which she has no right to do but wants to impress them, lies to them by omission when they think she is his lawyer. She knows XYC are scum bags but doesn't seem to care if Elliott or his sick father are murdered or what happens to them. Then wants to blame someone else for all of her conniving when all is said and done and four more people are dead because of the mess she made. She still doesn't really know who the killer of Sarah, the original victim was. Wish takes her by the hand and leads her through the steps to realize who the evidence says is the real killer and finally, she gets it! No, I didn't like this book and I don't believe any ethical lawyer would operate the way she does. I doubt I will be buying any more of the author's books."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"This book was way over my head. I am a avid reader and do enjoy the O'Shaughnessy's books, but this one left me behind."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"As a prime number buff and retired math teacher, I was intrigued when a friend recommended Case of Lies to me. The mathematics topic is accurate and comprehensive -- encryption and prime number factorization is current and likely to be for some time to come. I'm familiar with the locale and things mentioned in passing, e.g., PrivateEye.com, which I've used. I've studied Sanskrit and watched eyes glaze over when I mention prime numbers. I found the book a little slow starting but a page turner. I was disappointed a bit with the ending, as I thought the motive of the killer, Lee Flint, was not fully developed. Neither was the motive for the keystone killing, that of Hanna's wife. It seems frankly unbelievable. I think that Professor Braun should have been developed as the culprit -- the MIT students were his and he was in on XYC and his motive could have been to get the money without doing much work, as well as Elliott's notebook for XYC and himself. But we can't all be perfect. Bottom line: worth reading and educational!"},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"As a retired bean counter, I loved the math. Because I live near Placerville where part of the book takes place, it was fun to read. The only flaw I saw was the statement that Placerville's elevation is 4000 ft. Not so, it is much lower. Pollock Pines is at 4000 ft. Other than that technical flaw, it was a great read. Can't wait to see how the love interest goes in the next installment."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I was disappointed with this novel. Usually the O'Shaughnessy's novels are page turners and a good read. This novel was just too deep into primes and maths for me. As the book progresses it does get a little better."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"The O'Shaughnessy sisters, Mary and Pamela, have been writing collectively under the pen name \\"Perri O'Shaughnessy\\" for a good while now, building a voluminous mythos around Nina Reilly, a professionally talented but personally troubled attorney who has a penchant for attracting danger even while eschewing it. CASE OF LIES, which may turn out to be the penultimate novel in the series, finds Reilly changing residential locales yet again, relocating this time to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, yet continuing to find that the problems of her past affect her present and future.O'Shaughnessy brings quite an interesting mix into CASE OF LIES, with a group of MIT students, one of whom is a bona fide mathematical genius on the verge of solving one of the world's greatest puzzles. The students hit the Tahoe casinos with the goal of busting the tables by utilizing a card-counting scheme based upon --- what else? --- mathematical probability. It works fine until they are robbed; and, in the course of the robbery, a pregnant woman who is an innocent bystander is killed.Flash forward to the present: Nina Reilly is brought in at the eleventh hour to represent Dave Hanna, a somewhat reluctant plaintiff in a wrongful death suit. Hanna is the husband and father of the woman and unborn child murdered during the course of the robbery. The students are the only witnesses, and they seem to have vanished into the sands of time. The statute of limitations to bring the matter to trial is running, and with Hanna's original counsel withdrawing, Reilly has little to work with.With some dogged investigative work, Reilly is able to trace the mathematics student. It's pretty ingenious the way this is set up --- so ingenious, in fact, that it smacks of a real-world incident. Reilly's involvement in the case, however, seems to have drawn the murderer out of the woodwork, and almost immediately he seems to be after Reilly and everyone else connected to the case.Mathematics plays a big role in the backstory of CASE OF LIES, and O'Shaughnessy does an impressive job of introducing the reader to the history and world of numbers, and those who are obsessed with them, without capsizing the plot and the entire book along with it. Some of the mathematical concepts presented herein are a bit dense, and those of us whose idea of calculation is knowing in advance how much to pay the pizza delivery guy could have gotten lost pretty quickly were we in lesser hands. But O'Shaughnessy pulls this really neat trick wherein she equates an element of quantum physics with some basic (and understandable) legal concepts and makes everything --- if not perfectly clear --- clear enough.CASE OF LIES isn't all prime numbers and quantum theorem. Far from it. There's a passel of interesting characters, a bit of sex and explosions (even taking place simultaneously at one point), and an extremely well-explained plot that is just complex enough to be interesting and, given the math tie-in, quite exotic. A side trip to Germany to depose witnesses on the run also gives Reilly a chance to reestablish an old and unresolved link with an old flame. And there also is a particular moment two-thirds of the way through that will bring you out of your seat.Given that it may be a while before we see another Nina Reilly novel, CASE OF LIES is a must-read this summer.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"disappoint...a very good page turner. As a very math-averse person whose eyes glazed over when it got to the bit about integers and prime numbers,,,well, I just skimmed over those parts to get back to the story.

Some books are better than others, and at the start I thought this book was going to be one of the very best. The authors' prose style has improved, Nina has a full and realistic life (not always the case in the past, where plot seemed to push character), the story is intriguing, and the other viewpoint character - one of the witnesses to the crime - is fascinating. I was engrossed in the story all along, but by the end I was scratching my head, feeling cheated. The motivations and actions of the main culprits (trying not to give too much away here) are totally without foundation or logic. That ruined the story for me. I recommended the book to a couple of friends while I was reading it, and I've had to go back and tell them, \\"maybe not.\\" Still, if you don't think about logic or motivation but just go along for the ride, it's a fine ride."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"This latest installment in the Nina Reilly series was close to a complete disappointment to me. I've read all the previous novels, following Nina through two marriages and one prolonged affair, and have always enjoyed the tales, even the one which focused on the gambling casinos and seemed to go a bit too far off-tangent. But this one was nearly incomprehensible to the average reader. Other reviewers have criticized it for the same reason: the mathematical mumbo-jumbo was entirely too complex (and definitely off-tangent)to be enjoyable reading. If I'd wanted to study a math textbook, I'd have bought one. While a writer needs to introduce sub-plot and the sisters here have seemed to do a lot of research, it doesn't always make for a good read. I'm a fan of the TV show, Numb3rs, which easily makes math look interesting---this book does not. It was a disappointment and a real drag at times. Nina, too, is starting to get on my nerves---she cannot commit in any personal relationship, and she vacilates back and forth between being bright and being fairly stupid in her cases. Flawed heroines are all well and good, but growth is essential. Let's pick up the pace, or this series is going to languish."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"There are various plot/story lines in this book. Some were very interesting, others only so-so. There was a lot of information about very high level math involving prime numbers. I admit that I skipped over some of the technical details, but I also did learn a few things. Most of the story kept my interest, but there was a big let down in the plot.Not to give anything away, but one person's 'reason' for committing a particular crime was just ludicrous. It made no sense at all and really detracted from the overall story. If the O'Shaughnessys could have made the motive more understandable and realistic, it would have helped the story in general. I am glad that Nina returned to Tahoe, but she needs to stay put for a while. There has been too much moving, changing of partners and jobs, etc. Settle down, girl.This was an OK book, but I know the O'Shaughnessy girls can do much better."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS BOOKS...

Overkill(pun intended) on both the math theory and the number of witnesses killed with our heroine standing right next to them.

The robber is able to make a reservation, get there ahead of her, buy an illegal gun, find out where the interview is to take place, find a second story window overlooking interview, do his mischief, get away, flies back home.

I had picked up about half of your points, but I let them slide. But seeing a compilation really is pretty sobering.SECOND - I sort-of-agree with the \\"too much math\\" comments but I must confess I enjoyed the glimpse into the fringe of math theory. The obsession seemed plausible, or is it? I started reading the Amazon reviews to see if there was any feedback from math fanatics. I will send it to my roommate who majored in math 40 years ago.THIRD - I was disappointed by the final pages on the math genius. Why would he turn out to be a super hacker who can easily access NSA or other highly secure web sites? His mania was narrowly focused, and (unless I am wrong) the hurdles that would need be overcome go way, way beyond encryption, and mastery of large primes is only one major step of breaking the encryption. And the guy who has lived his life focused at least 99% on theory suddenly becomes a wheeler-dealer, acting exactly as he saw his enemy act, even using the exact same people?FOURTH - This is a chick book! Ooh, I'm in deep now! Love, passion, regret, children, etc. But I thought it worked OK - I was curious to see how Kurt would be resolved.STARS - The math that almost everyone else disliked added the fourth star to my rating. Except for the math aspect, it seemed pretty typical of her other books to me - a fairly improbable romp, fairly-well crafted, a page-turner, a tidy ending, and characters that were touching. I will probably read another book or two of theirs.Hope this helps you decide if it's your cup of tea."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"Attorney Nina Reilly has re-opened her law office in Lake Tahoe, after several months of living and working in Monterey. Her lover and private investigator Paul von Waggoner are out of her life, and as \\"Case of Lies\\" opens, Nina seems to be embracing her life and work in Lake Tahoe.Nina's masseusse asks her to take on a wrongful death case involving her Aunt Sarah, who was an innocent bystander shot in a robbery at a local motel, the Ace High. It's been almost two years since the robbery and murder, and the statue of limitations is almost up on this civil case. The shooter was never apprehended, and Nina grabs onto this mission to find the person who shot Sarah Hanna. A large part of the plotlines revolve around finding the three young robbery victims at the Ace High, in hopes that they can help identify the shooter. Of course, the robbery is much more complicated than it seems at first, and after finding the witnesses, Nina has her hands full getting them to talk to her.The robbery victims turn out to be grad students at MIT, and one of them is poised on solving one of the great mysteries remaining in the world of mathematics--the factoring of very large numbers. It turns out that this technology is critical to today's Internet security, and the work of the young math genius turn out to be very valuable indeed.There is a lot of the story devoted to the higher math research. I found this story line quite interesting. I felt that this book was quite a bit stronger than the last several in the Nina Reilly series. I enjoy seeing Nina and her son Bob develop further in each story. Since Nina has severed many of her old ties to the Monterey area, this book stands alone on its own quite well. \\"Case of Lies\\" is an intelligent, exciting legal thriller."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"* Spoilers *Sorry, but besides the improbable plot, this book is so full of legal and other bloopers it's ruined. The legal bloopers are even more bewildering in a book written by a supposed graduate of Harvard Law School.The book revolves around a man who doesn't want it to be discovered that he committed a robbery, and so he hangs around the robbery scene, stalks victims who haven't come forward yet, stalks the attorney in a related wrongful death case, tries to beat a confession out of a suspected perpetrator of the murder which happened at the same time, and kills several people, including two in Germany -- all of this from someone who just wants to lay low and avoid discovery.The legal bloopers are many. A man, Dave Hanna, has a wrongful death suit for the shooting death of his wife at a motel. Virtually without exception, wrongful death cases are taken by plaintiffs' attorneys on a contingency basis. Yet, Dave's prior attorney, and current attorney Nina (heroine of the book), both charge him on an hourly basis, with no explanation of why they're taking this unusual step.Attorney fees are NOT recoverable by the defendant if a wrongful death case is lost. Yet the defendant seeks attorney fees, and Nina fails to point out such a claim cannot be brought under California law. In fact, she warns Dave that they may succeed in their claim.Nina says the court MAY dismiss the case prior to two years for failure to prosecute or serve a defendant, and that the court MUST dismiss for failure to prosecute or serve a defendant after two years. Both statements are plainly incorrect under the very California statute cited by the authors in the book (Civ. Proc. 583.420).When Dave's life is in danger, Nina says, \\"It's a surefire way to end a lawsuit. Dispose of the plaintiff.\\" Sorry, not true. The lawsuit continues and the estate collects.Nina tells the court she wants to dismiss her case against \\"James Bova as an individual and as an insured of his insurance company.\\" You don't sue someone \\"as an insured of his insurance company.\\"Nina tells the decedent's brother that he has a cause of action for wrongful death. That's not true in California where, as here, there is a surviving spouse.It's unlikely a process server would tell someone he just served, \\"you should consult an attorney right away.\\"A proposed contract offer is for \\"Two million for you, properly sheltered from income tax....\\" A business can't \\"shelter\\" a payee from income tax. The only way to pay someone two million dollars, for services, tax-free, is to pay enough so that the net after tax is two million. (Merely paying the tax for them doesn't work, since the tax paid -itself- is income, and taxable.)A major issue in the book is how many shots were fired during the robbery at the motel, and where the bullets went. On the stand, the genius mathematician mentally \\"estimates\\" the distance to the motel balcony by the Pythagorean theorem as 50.99 feet -- that's accuracy within 3 millimeters!!We first read that the motel clerk, who was next-door, \\"heard the shots -- two quick shots\\" and then ran toward the motel office. No mention of her hearing a third shot.Dave Hanna's wife Sarah was shot, on a motel balcony, and we're told that there was no gun recovered, but \\"they have the casings and the two bullets, including the one recovered from Sarah Hanna's body.\\" Another witness later states, \\"The gunman fired one warning shot, and I think the second happened when Elliott reached him.\\" It turns out later that the first two shots were fired up at an 80 degree angle, away from Sarah on the balcony, but it's not mentioned that one of the bullets recovered by the police was aimed directly away from Sarah. That would have been obvious at the time and is simply misleading to not include it early on.Suddenly, half-way through the book, with no witness or evidence of a third shot, Nina asks a witness, \\"What about the third shot?\\" The witness miraculously remembers, \\"The final shot? Yes, we heard one more shot while we were running away.\\" Where did THAT come from? But the book now hinges on the new third shot.The same man who had two shots fired toward him now testifies, \\"'I was running for my room when I heard the third shot.' 'The police report doesn't mention any third shot. Where were you for the first two shots?' 'Going toward him.... There were three shots, I know that much. I don't care what the police reports say.'\\"It turns out the third bullet killed Sarah, and THAT bullet was recovered, but Nina's investigator says, \\"Too bad the police couldn't find the third bullet.\\"The authors are just clueless when it comes to how handguns work -- something crime thriller authors should know a LITTLE about at least. Examination of the ammunition casings found at the scene would indicate the gun was an auto-loading pistol, both from the type of rim on the casing, and the fact that they were ejected. Yet Nina finds a witness who picked up the gun at the scene and kept it, which gun is identified by the authors as \\"a blue-steel revolver.\\" But wait -- the authors just said that the bullet casings were recovered at the scene, and bullet casings are ejected from an auto-loading pistol, not a revolver. Later on a police sergeant identifies the gun as a \\"six-shooter\\" and asks the evidence technician how many rounds are left \\"in the chamber.\\" A six-shot revolver has six chambers. If a pistol has one chamber, it's not a revolver. A chamber only holds one round at a time.In describing the gun used in Germany, Nina says, \\"The German police have it. They tell me it was probably a Sig, a target pistol, a single-action semi-auto.\\" This is contradictory. A single-action gun is one in which pulling the trigger ONLY fires the round and does not move the action. A semi-auto is a gun in which pulling the trigger fires the round AND prepares another round for firing by loading it into the chamber. This is like saying the German police found a car which was an automatic with a manual transmission.The authors should be ashamed to sell this book. This is a merely a first draft of what might be an acceptable novel if the bloopers and the illogical bit about the robber trying to maintain a low profile while going on a killing spree were fixed. Not to mention that the college kids probably went gambling at Laughlin, Nevada, instead of \\"Loughlin, Nevada.\\""},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I like all the books by this author and this one did not let me down, a good tale as usual...."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"This was a great book. The O'Shaugnessy sisters did a great job once again!"},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"A robbery, the murder of a pregnant schoolteacher, followed by the disappearance of three witnesses - all take place at a Lake Tahoe motel and lead to a wrongful death suit. Time is running out on the case and there has been no significant progress; the previous attorney wants out. Nina Reilly takes over the case of the bereaved spouse, at the personal request of the victim's niece.Her first action is to locate the witnesses - three brilliant math students - and she tracks two of them to Boston. When she finds the third in an island near Seattle, she has a plan.But then more people start turning up dead, and all indications are that the man who robbed the students at the motel is responsible. As more facts surface, it becomes clear that money alone was not the motive - one of the students has a secret notebook in which he has recorded his work on a significant mathematical proof, and coincidentally, a large corporation in Seattle wants the notebook.But the more Nina Reilly investigates, the more twisted become the facts. Soon, nothing is as it seems. And in a final confrontation between the alleged killer and her client, a whole new array of facts unfold. Only one man will still be standing in the end, and what she learns after it is over will blow Nina Reilly's mind.Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)is exciting, and suspenseful storytelling that highlights still another Nina Reilly escapade.I deducted one star after some of the plot points failed to add up to a plausible conclusion.

If you are looking for something life-changing, this is not it, but it is enjoyable as a quick, light read. For people unfamiliar with the series, Nina Reilly is a lawyer with a teenage son. She generally takes challenging cases, often putting herself in some kind of danger. In Case of Lies, Nina has returned to her home of Lake Tahoe after splitting with her private investigator colleague and lover, Paul van Waggoner. While she is picking up the pieces of her life, she meets Chelsi, a masseuse whose aunt was murdered two years previously at a low-rent motel near the Nevada casinos. There were three witnesses, but they fled the scene, and the killer was never caught. Chelsi's alcoholic uncle was pursuing legal action against the motel, but his dysfunctional life stalled his progress. Nina agrees to take the case, which is on the verge of being dismissed.Nina begins legal proceedings against the motel, but the case becomes personal when the killer begins picking off people related to the case and threatens Nina. She enlists the help of a new private investigator, Wish (the son of her office manager and a longtime friend). He figures out that the missing witnesses were math students from MIT and tracks them down. The case eventually leads Nina to Germany and the father of her son, as she tries to unravel the mystery before the killer takes out all of the witnesses and her.Case of Lies was fast-paced, even if not always logical. Some of the characters' motivations were a little thin, and most were not very likable. The ending especially was not really satisfying. Also, the characters' study of math played a role in the plot, but some of the theories mentioned were very technical and not necessarily interesting to someone lacking a passion for graduate-level math.Case of Lies was not a great book, but was not bad either, just fairly mediocre. I got what I expected from it, and will continue reading the series."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I love the Perri o'Shaughnessy series, but this was my least favorite."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"i really like this author, so far. i've only read one other book of there's, but this one, though being a mostly good read, goes way too much into primes, and gives information on them which just really don't matter. the average reader will have no clue what they are saying. and though i rarely skip even boring parts of otherwise good books, i could not keep going with the math descriptions, and skipped an entire section. it is otherwise a very compelling read."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"A good read but not the best Nina Reilly.

It suffers from \\"Just Cause\\" syndrome -- killers kill just because they want to, player gamble just because they want to, a minor red herring character with-holds major evidence until page 300 for no good reason than to try and tie all the flapping loose plots threads together that are thrashing around. Nina doesn't even really solve the case; she's as fooled as everybody else is.Adequate quick mystery reading, but compare it with say, UNFIT TO PRACTICE from a few years back, and it is definately wanting. Hopefully the series will bounce back, although the outlook is grim, with the authors' next novel being their first non-series, stand-alone."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"Nina Reilly's first case back in Tahoe after her break-up with her investigator Paul von Waggnoner , comes courtesy of her masseuse, Chelsi.

The civil suit is going to lapse soon due to Chelsi's uncle's emotional inertia. Chelsi wants justice for her aunt. The case is more complicated than it seems at first. Three PH.D students did more than witness the murder. One of the students was a genius mathematician and had devised a card-counting scheme to rook the casinos. To protect their own interests, they fled before they could be questioned. Nina's investigation is a catalyst to more murders before all is said and done.Perri O'Shaughnessy can always be counted upon to tell an interesting story with multi-faceted characters.

American mysteries are too action oriented , English mysteries are more interior.

The mathmatical theme is centered around 3 college students who develop a method of winning at the casinos, and the obsession of one whose research in prime numbers puts their lives in jeopardy as well as that of Miss Reilly and her client. A surprise ending."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"I was terribly disappointed with this Audio book because of the plot and the reader. Laurel Merlington was a bad choice to read the book she can only do young American women accents. She butchered most of the male voices, the other older woman lawyer and all the foreign accents. It's clear she has never heard a German speak. The German girl's accent was annoyingly wrong.As for the plot, from the pointless foray into mathematics to the unlikely happenings; e.g. where did this unsophisticated, rather stupid shooter get money from to go to Germany and find the witnesses? Why wasn't Nina Reilly shot at the masseuse's parlor? Why would the shooter hang around a Lake Tahoe?Much of the book does not make sense.

No one was caught and the three witnesses quietly fled town. Dave sued the motel, but ran out of money and wants to drop the case. His niece and brother-in-law feel he should pursue his suit.

Neither realized at the time the twists the investigation will take involving card shark mathematicians Yale grads, wealthy Texans, a trek to Germany, a serial killer and the return of Nina's ex husband.CASE OF LIES is an exhilarating legal thriller in which Reilly is at her best in her latest appearance, which says a lot since this series is consistently a best seller. The story line seizes the audience from the moment most of the players appear on the stage starting with readers wondering what the connection between two blackjack card-counting experts have with a motel murder and other spins follow that all seem reasonable, even the final chiller.

No matter how meticulous she is, she somehow always winds up being the target of a crazed murderer. And this time is no exception.Nina is hired by the brother-in-law and niece of sad alcoholic David Hanna, whose pregnant wife was the victim of a seemingly accidental shooting committed by a robber at a local motel. Hanna has lapsed into an alcoholic stupor as a result, and Nina is asked to file a wrongful death suit.Seems straightforward, but none of Nina's cases is straightforward. Before we know it, she is neck-deep in a case involving three young genius mathematicians from MIT (we get to know them very well as part of the sub-plot, and it is very interesting, albeit a bit arcane when it comes to the mathematical theories), a serial killer, a hostile local female lawyer, and the usual cast of characters. Nina's personal life has changed as well, as readers of the last book know, but I won't commit a spoiler here in case some do NOT know. Suffice to say things are VERY different.Good, mostly fast-paced, too much mathematical theory, killer predictable halway through the book, but highly pleasurable anyway. This is the last book on which the sisters had the input and help of their late brother Patrick, to whom it is dedicated. Those who know how much he contributed to their work (via their explanations on their Web site)will be as saddened as I to hear of his death.A good book, a fast read...recommended."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"Nina and most of her gang is back.

Nina doesn't take the deal, but does take the uncle as a client.Add to the mix three rather bizarre mathematicians who were cheating casinos by, simplistically, counting cards at the blackjack tables. There is much written about prime numbers and various other mathematical theories and while commendable that the O'Shaughnessy sisters understand these, they certainly don't add to the book in any way. I rocked with the first foray into college math 1A, but by the continuation of the \\"class,\\" I was seriously skimming through it.These little asides seemed to slow the book considerably.I've been a fan of the sisters since reading their first book, but this one leaves a bit to be desired and is not up to their usual 4-5 star rating. In a nutshell, I really didn't care who murdered whom or why before I was halfway through the book. I finished it out of mild curiosity and the hope that it would get better soon.Perhaps Paul was the glue/stability that held the previous storylines together, perhaps Nina needs to \\"get a grip and stop dithering,\\" perhaps this series is running out of gas - whatever the reason, this is not a must read or even a must buy."},{"Title":"Case of Lies (Nina Reilly)","review":"The longer this series runs, the less interesting it becomes.

You never know if the person tapping hilarious answers to your questions is the girl of your dreams --- or her gay best friend.In M OR F? by Lisa Papademetriou and Chris Tebbetts, Frannie has a crush. And for once it's on someone suitable: Jeffrey Osborne. Hot, friendly and socially responsible, he seems to be the man of her dreams. The only problem is that Frannie freezes up around him. She'll relax when she gets to know him better, right?In the meantime, there's the Internet. Frannie and Jeffrey chat almost every night, and the online conversation is intelligent, smooth and sizzling with chemistry. The fact that the person actually writing the words isn't Frannie at all, but her gay best friend Marcus --- well, that's just a minor detail, right? After all, Frannie is right in the room with Marcus when he's writing. Well, at least at first. When Marcus continues chatting to Jeffrey under Frannie's screen name, without telling anyone what he's doing, things get complicated. Who's falling in love with who?M OR F? is a fun, breezy, updated version of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story. Told in alternating perspectives by Frannie and Marcus, the quick pace will keep the reader turning pages. Many scenes are laugh-out-loud hilarious. And just when you think you've figured out exactly what is going on, the story twists and turns and you have to scramble to keep up.Although both main characters are engaging, I found Marcus particularly well-drawn. This is not a coming-out story; Marcus is secure in his sexuality and neither angst-ridden nor persecuted for it. In fact, most of the important characters in the book are very supportive. But their high school isn't Utopia; there's a well-meaning but clueless faculty advisor for the Gay Students Association, for example, and a few homophobic classmates lurking in the halls. It's a realistic scenario that adds believability to the madcap antics that seem to follow both characters.Despite some slapstick, M OR F? relies heavily on witty conversation, both for its humor and to develop its characters --- and fortunately for the reader, the conversation works on many levels. Parts of the novel read like a segment from an episode of \\"Will and Grace,\\" minus the sexual references. (The focus of M or F? is always on friendship and light romance, and neither discussion nor action ever progresses beyond kissing.)Papademetriou and Tebbetts are careful to show the small details that make Frannie and Marcus's friendship meaningful. Ultimately, M OR F? is more about their relationship with each other and the test of that relationship. This is both the core of the book and its strength, and is one reason why readers might be happy to read it again and again.--- Reviewed by Paula Jolin"},{"Title":"M or F?","review":"M or F? by Lisa Papademetriou and Chris Tebbetts defies the format of most typical high school romance stories. Like many, it combines a story of friendship with a story of romance. Frannie falls for an attractive guy that her best friend Marcus actually approves of. His name is Jeffrey Osborne and he's all too perfect: popular, smart, gorgeous, and sincere. Frannie even has the opportunity to speak to him online. Here's the twist, though: Frannie gets too queasy to talk to him by herself. So instead, her gay best friend does the talking for her. Eventually, while things are getting hot, Marcus gets out of control and starts chatting with Jeffrey without Frannie knowing. This tests Frannie and Marcus's friendship, and makes both of them struggle to learn which is stronger: friendship or love?It was a pleasure to read M or F? and I recently recommended it to friends of mine who are members of our school's GSA. Not being able relate to Frannie's struggle of deciding whether Jeffrey is falling for her or for her \\"brain twin,\\" Marcus, shouldn't stop you from reading the book. No one I know escapes fights with friends over what type of relationship is most important. Organized into chapters from both Frannie and Marcus's perspectives, it is easy and enjoyable to hear both sides of the story for once.

A well written novel of historical mystery and romance. I wouldn't say it's a thriller, since the the romance part is the majority of the story.Set in Egypt during the height of World War I, a husband-and-wife + son-and-daughter-in-law Egyptologists adventures were told in a very interesting way. Being my first Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody adventure, I found this lady writer has developed a romance story, while enveloping it with history and adventure quite well. There are many mundane daily things which are missed in current thriller novels which were not skipped by the author. Which, by themselves are quite interesting since the reader can try to relate how people during the early 1900s era might lived their lives.Though it was written quite excellently, I did not find the edge of plot too convincing. The author left the end dangling, which is what she had in mind to prolonged these series. The culprit in this novel, Jamil, was nowhere to be found. Waiting for the next novel to pick up the saga.Anyhow, an excellent read for anybody interested in romance, adventure and Egyptian hystory novels."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"This book was just a lot of fun to read! Of course, the plots are getting a little improbable with each novel, but hey we knew they were never meant to be fact, didn't we? The plot of this novel is fast-paced, exciting, dangerous, adventuresome, and fun -- something that has been lacking in them for awhile (with a few exceptions here and there). The Emersons are once again back in Egypt, their ever-increasing clan along for the ride, and even a new cat with a very ostentatious name. Once again, the family improbably finds itself drawn into the military intelligence escapades that nearly took the life of Ramses in He Shall Thunder in the Sky. Along the way we have some archaeological excavations, dead bodies, dangerous traps, and yes some more ruined shirts. Not everything is perfect with this novel. As stated before, the plots are getting over the top, some of the newer supporting characters are annoying (Jumana!), and Sethos just isn't as much fun as he used to be. Since Peters outed him as the long lost half-brother of Radcliffe and Walter, he's lost some of that zing. I will say that Selim has really started to grown on me. He may never be Abdullah, but he is an interesting character.

The Golden One was SUPERB."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Emerson and Amelia Peabody have a new archeological dig, Ramses is overjoyed with his wife, and Amelia's adoptive family continues to grow, but all is not well in World War I era Egypt. Tomb robbers have discovered an ancient temple and are sneaking artifacts out, and are willing to kill Emerson and Amelia to preserve their treasure. The British army has bogged down outside of Gaza and its intelligence community desperately wishes to get Ramese back in the fold. And somehow, Amelia has to manage all of this while hoping that she will soon become a grandmother. Naturally, Sethos--Emerson's half brother and something of a love interest for Amelia is back and in the midst of both tomb robbing and the war.Author Elizabeth Peters has created a wonderful set of characters in the extended Emerson family. Emerson's bull-headedness, Ramses's honor, Sethos's deviousness and overcompensated inferiority complex, and Amelia's proper British manipulativeness all ring true and consistent through the novel and, indeed, through the series. THE GOLDEN ONE does not integrate World War I with the archeological elements of the story as well as some of the earlier novels in the series (perhaps because the Turks have been driven further from Egypt), but is otherwise a delightful adventure.Readers new to this series may find Amelia's proper Britishisms somewhat off-putting but; for me at least, these have become familiar friends and amusing reminders of a time when the British really thought that they had a great moral lesson to share with the world. Peters certainly knows her Egypt and makes this great period of Archeology and Egyptology come to life."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Elizabeth Peters does not disappoint in the latest adventures of Emerson clan. The novel is fast-paced, the characters as interesting as ever, and the plot intriguing. She does a wonderful job in the further development of her characters, and it's like a family reunion of old friends. Her trademark sly, ironic humor keeps the reader turning every page. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Oh, how I love this series! I was afraid that things would settle down and get stale after the marriage of Ramses &amp; Nefret, and things seemed to be resolved with Sethos, but I was worried for nothing!

All of our favourite characters are here, from the redoubtable Amelia and Emerson, to the fascinating Nefret and Ramses. With a few clever strokes of her pen, all of the characters, from major to minor, spring to life and into action. Makes me long to visit Egypt, though her writing is so superb throughout the whole series, I feel as if I already have."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Well, I got it and finished it. It was pretty good but I was thrown off at the beginning with Emerson calling his wife 'sweetheat' and 'my love' before we even got three pages into the book. (It just bugged me for the rest of the story) But I loved it. I was glad to see Sethos back and prowling where and when he shouldn't be and Peters left the book with such a cliffhanger that I find that I'll have a VERY hard time waiting for the next book."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I have read quite a few of her books and this is the best one.It is a real page turner.The plot is just so exciting!!!"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I have read all of the books in this series and have enjoyed every one of them.

There isn't a book by this author I haven't read, and this one is just alright. The plot meaders from time to time, where usually Ms. Peters writes very tightly.

It could have been better, but it wasn't awful."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Some years ago my husband recommended these mysteries both for Ms. Peters deft characterizations and for her knowledge of Egypt and her accurate portrayal of the practice of archeology in the early 20th century. I made the mistake of trying to read this book before any of the others. It's important to read these books in order to see the development of the characters and the way in whichthe author moves them through this particular part of history.This book takes place during World War I. So there is a plot that centers around the excavation of various sites and a plot that has to do with the use of archeologists as spies. The plot is genuinely suspenseful and Ms. Peters takes great care to create characters that are both interesting and about whom you can care. However, the key to all of these books is the voice of their narrator, Amelia Peabody. If you don't like her you're not likely to like the books. I especially enjoy her wit. This is Amelia's husband (and fellow archeologist) Radcliffe Emerson dressing her down for a remark she's just made: \`Peabody,' he said mildy \`that is even more pompous and pedantic than your usual declarations. Do not suppose that the complexity of your syntax can conceal the inaccuracy of your conclusion.'If you are someone who likes mystery series in order of publication, be sure to visit stopyourekillingme.com"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Am reading thru the series and enjoyed this one very much.

My only complaint about the audible version, it was abridged."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Ramses Emerson, son of Egyptologists Radcliffe and Amelia Peabody Emerson, hopes he is through with working for the secret service in World War I Egypt. Married at last to his lifelong love, surgeon Nefret Forth, Ramses wants only to work with his parents at their archaeological dig site and make his wife happy. But when the call for another mission arrives, he cannot refuse it; because its subject is his father's illegitimate half brother, the mysterious reformed criminal known as Sethos (among other aliases), and Ramses fears that only he can keep his uncle safe from assassination. Of course his parents and his wife insist on following him to the Holy Land's gateway city of Gaza, where the spying partner assigned to Ramses by the military does something unexpected...something that results in Ramses's capture, which sets off a chain of events involving the daughter of the head of Turkish intelligence.This series allows its characters to change with time, growing and developing in ways that are the natural outcome of both their setting and the events they experience. The author knows her setting thoroughly, and that makes it easy for the reader to become immersed. This book has the feel of a middle novel in a trilogy, which seems odd to me because it's actually an installment in a long series - that may be the case due to events that are foreshadowed by this story's closing, but not fulfilled until the next book. Anyway, as usual it's a fun read. As a friend who has followed the series for years puts it, \\"There are no bad Amelia Peabody books.\\"--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I read the other reviews saying the plot wandered or Ms Peters doesn't know what to do with WWI. So not true. The people who said the series got stale after Ramses and Nefret got married are also off the beam.I have enjoyed equally the different nuances the series has taken at all junctions. I loved Ramses when he was a tiny boy. The descriptions of him in his little nightshirt with toes peeking out lisping were hysterical. The description of him dumping a smelly old bone onto the lap of a snobby woman Amelia wanted to get rid of were a riot. The descriptions of Ramses as he got older lecturing ponderously as his mother would interrupt him were great. I loved it when Ramses, Nefret and David got older and got their own lives. The parts where Ramses was in complete shambles because Nefret had touched him, or made an innocent remark but his family could not see his agony were great. I enjoyed the between the lines parts of Ramses and David having adventures in the suks that was only hinted at. The book that left Nefret and Ramses hanging in mutual agony over misunderstandings was agony. I was so overjoyed at their happiness when they finally discovered each other. I am enjoying their marriage very much. The between the lines bits of marital life as their parents look on at a distance are great. In this book, the bit in which Ramses and Nefret are reunited in the harem and their mother reminds them as they totter off to bed there are peep holes she may not have found and covered up; and they had better just...sleep, was so apropos. When they finally have children, I will love that as much.Yes, I miss David and Lia. But as Ms Peters has pointed out in answer to where they have been the past couple of books, she can only manipulate so many characters in one book without it spilling into thousands of pages.This book, The Golden One, has the war intrigue, the murder ingrigue, the interworkings of characters from past books. In short, it has it all. I liked the minor characters, Lord Edward, Jumana and Jamil, and the pimp (I forget his name) pop up to become bigger characters in this book. I will not go into the ins and out of characters and plots the other reviewers have covered. I will close by saying, if you have not experienced Amelia Peabody and Elizabeth Peters, do yourself a favor and do so. Start with \\"Crocodile on the Sandbanks.\\""},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Elizabeth Peters' gets it right and The Golden One is right at the top of her best style of writing. All the usual old friends, family, and bad guys show up. The Emersons are all over the place finding villians and Egyptian treasures. Nefret is much more pleasing following her 'confused' state in the past. Marriage has done much to calm her and Ramses, but not in their adventures. By the end of the book, we know a little more of what's to come and there is the introduction of a new villian. I hope Ms. Peters continues to write more just like this one."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Few tales are as eagerly awaited as another in the addictive Amelia Peabody mystery series. After all, what other heroine is intrepid, tastefully dressed, and secretes a sword in her parasol - just in case.When first introduced in the 1975 &quot;Crocodile On The Sandbank,&quot; Amelia Peabody was a stalwart spinster who determined to use her hefty inheritance in pursuit of her overriding interest - Egyptology. It was 1884, yet she set out for Egypt where she was to be confronted with a number of perplexing circumstances.With &quot;The Golden One&quot; it is 1917, and Amelia is married to Radcliffe, the most famous archeologist in Egypt. Ramses, their son is a chip off the old blocks; he is an investigator wed to Nefret, who is, of course, beautiful. Choosing to overlook German submarines lurking in the waters, this encourage sets out for Egypt.Their plans for an anticipated excavation are interrupted with the appearance of Sethos, Radcliffe's ne'er-do-well brother. Matters are further complicated when they hear that royal tombs have been robbed, and a body is found.Those who have read the Amelia Peabody series in the past will be thrilled with this latest adventure. Those who have not have a treat in store.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Emerson and Amelia Peabody have a new archeological dig, Ramses is overjoyed with his wife, and Amelia's adoptive family continues to grow, but all is not well in World War I era Egypt. Tomb robbers have discovered an ancient temple and are sneaking artifacts out, and are willing to kill Emerson and Amelia to preserve their treasure. The British army has bogged down outside of Gaza and its intelligence community desperately wishes to get Ramese back in the fold. And somehow, Amelia has to manage all of this while hoping that she will soon become a grandmother. Naturally, Sethos--Emerson's half brother and something of a love interest for Amelia is back and in the midst of both tomb robbing and the war.Author Elizabeth Peters has created a wonderful set of characters in the extended Emerson family. Emerson's bull-headedness, Ramses's honor, Sethos's deviousness and overcompensated inferiority complex, and Amelia's proper British manipulativeness all ring true and consistent through the novel and, indeed, through the series.

However, it was still an enjoyable read, even if it did follow along on predictable formulaic lines.The Emersons and entourage have returned to Luxor for another season of 'digging,' where they learn that tomb thieves have been ransacking a newly excavated royal tomb. Of course Amelia, Emerson, Ramses and Nefret, immediately hunker down to discover who is behind these thefts and to put a stop to them, and discover that an enemy from a previous adventure (\\"The Lord of the Silent\\") may be involved in these felonious goings-on, and that he is bent on revenging himself against the Emersons... Halfway through this storyline however, the novel veers off into another direction, when officers from the British Military Intelligence ask Ramses to resume his espionage activities and to discover the fate of one of their operatives, Ismail Pasha (also known as Sethos, one time foe of Amelia's and Emerson's, and who also happens to be Emerson's half-brother), who seems to have disappeared. Normally, I'm not much of a fan of sudden plot departures that go really off tangent for no apparent reason. But I must say that I'm glad that Elizabeth Peters did introduce this subplot as it proved to be a highly entertaining one with some really humorous moments.All in all, \\"The Golden One\\" was quite an entertaining read even if the storyline was not a very original one. It was nice to visit with the incredibly adventurous and eccentric Emersons again. And I liked that Jumana (a character from \\"Lord of the Silent\\") made an appearance again, even if she seems to have lost some of her edge and been reduced to hand wringing and light histrionics. (Perhaps her character will revert to type in the next Amelia Peabody adventure?) However, I would have to agree with the previous reviewer, Kathy Farrell, either borrow this book from the library or else wait for the paperback edition. Because while I DID ENJOY reading this book very much, there really is no earth-shatteringly compelling reason to go out and buy this expensive hardcover edition."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"By the beginning of 1917, the Great War makes travel across the Mediterranean unsafe. Still, the archeologist Peabody-Emerson family journeys from England to Egypt to begin another season digging up ancient history. However, their arrival at Luxor is accompanied by the word that thieves attacked a royal tomb with one of the criminals left behind dead.Before the matriarch Amelia Peabody Emerson can fully investigate the crime as she always does, British intelligence draft her son Ramses to work for them. They need Ramses to ascertain whether Ismail Pasha, an individual quickly rising to power in Gaza, is really Sethos his brother and a criminal. Unable to resist, the Peabody brood follows Ramses on his trek to keep him safe and to learn first hand if Sethos has surfaced.Fans of this series will enjoy this mixing of a World War I espionage tale with a who-done-it. However, historical mystery readers will feel disappointed as the intel mission intrudes on the investigation, which is left dangling while completing the espionage assignment before the family returns to solve the murder. This leaves the audience with two distinct story lines that never merge and a feeling of a novella inset inside a historical amateur sleuth mystery. Elizabeth Peters provides a wonderful look into Egyptology during the encroachment of World War I that along with the fourteenth return of the clan will delight series fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Amelia Peabody relates another thrilling adventure (with occasional entries by her son, Ramses) that starts when the war affects their beloved Egypt. Ramses is recruited as a spy by the British and Amelia and Radcliff cannot let their son face danger alone so the whole family gets in on the act. This is a great story from Ms. Peters from one of the few authors whose work I automatically buy in hardback. Elizabeth Peters has a PhD in Egyptology and her main character Amelia is based on a combination of several Victorian women explorers/archeologists. Every time I read one of these books I have to dig up one of the real Amelia's books (Amelia Ann Blanford Edwards) about Egypt to reread. The similarity in writing style and voice is uncanny. This series is best if you start with the first in the series, Crocodile On The Sandbank."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I am such a huge fan of this series and I was bitterly disappointed by \\"The Lord of the Silent\\", but that could just have been that the whole Ramses and Nefret thing was solved as was the tension and the book seemed pale in comparison to 4 previous ones. However, Peters has come back in top form with a story that combines her classic Egyptian mystery as well as military intrigue. The story occurs the in 1917, which means thankfully WWI will be over soon, and involves every reader's favorite characters. We also get the dead body, ruined shirts, and dry humor throughout.

The yarn keeps turning!This book will have the greatest impact on those already deeply immersed in Elizabeth Peters' series. But then, that seems like a very good place to be immersed!I get impatient each year for the new volume. I hope Ms. Peters (and I, of course) live forever.

Characters get introduced and recur in a series that it can be hard for the beginning reader to get a handle on. Looking at the other reviewers of the book, it appears that my view may suffer from this entry into Peters' \\"Amelia Peabody\\" series with book 14.Saying that, the book was enjoyable. Peters has a doctorate and egyptology and it enables her to give a vivid portrait of WWI Egypt, and knowing a little about the period myself (though not to Peters' extent) an accurate one.The Peabodys -- Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret -- are an engaging group and their adventures are quite fun. I liked the descriptive nature of Peters' writing. The humor is light, but not overly slapstick. The plot, however, was weak, though again this comes from someone who has not read the earlier books of the series and thus the minor characters who moved in and out of the telling had nuances that were lost on me.The overall 3 stars is a \\"rounding down\\" as I would put it at just shy of a 3.5, but my caveat would be to start with the earlier books in the series. A theme that seems to be shared by the other reviewers."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Probably the best mystery author I have ever read.

Must i say that his family also went to Gaza in disguise. Emerson as an Arab (Don't forget the beard!!) with 2 wives. Amelia his chief wife and Nefret his \\"favorite\\".

Nefret has her own little secret that she reveals and it's quite a shocker...and the way Emerson behaves with the news is...cute!This is a great read... took me a day and half to read... and i've read it twice since then.

Great book."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"This is the first book in the series that I picked up. I have no need to pick up any before it, because the author starts the book by describing every plot point of the thirteen that preceded it! When the exhaustive preamble finally concludes, a plot of sorts does begin to ponderously unfold. Unfortunately, we lose a driving character halfway through, just in time for a series of events that have nothing to do with the mystery to begin. When that finally gets wrapped up, the characters return to the main story just in time to conclude the book with a rushed and unsatisfying denouemont. I do give this book three stars, merely because the descriptions did make me want to join the characters for a whiskey and soda in the middle of the Egyptian landscape."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Elizabeth Peters seems to be running out of steam with Amelia, Emerson, et. al. The series was once a really wonderful one. Now, I still follow along since I've liked the characters so much over the years, but the characters themselves seem tired at times, and the plots are predicatable and often flabby.

By any means it is a great improvement over \\"Lord of the Silent\\". Lets hope that Nefret gives birth without difficulty to a fine healthy boy who takes after Ramses to the T.

However, the Golden One brings the focus back on our favorite heroine, Amelia Peabody. The plot was delightfully complex and kept me on the edge of my seat. Even with Ramses and Nefret married, the book still had some tension, though I liked the series better before they were married. The book also did not tie up every single problem so we can all expect that the next Amelia Peabody mystery will be as interesting or better. However, I found Sethos' turn for the good a little unrealistic and I wished there was more from the rest of the family. This series is great for anyone who likes good mysteries or has an interest in Egyptology.

The last 100 or so seem a bit anti-climatctic, but this book is a gem anyway. In it we have two main adventures. The first part of the book is devoted to beautiful Luxor and tomb robbers, murder and mayhem. The second part puts the Emersons right in the thick of World War I intrigue between England and Turkey, and puts all of them, especially Ramses in grave danger.

Amelia and Emerson are, as usual, very humorous and fun. Nefret and Ramses are great to read about too. And the newest addition to the Emerson's... the Great Cat of Re... is tons of fun. However, I WOULD NOT read this book as a first. I would definately start with Crocodile on the Sandbank, or, if you just can't wait, The Ape Who Guards the Balance.

You meet the characters as they meet each other, and form relationships, can create their histories which are as much a part of any book in the series as is the history of Ancien Egypt. There are constant references to past adventures, and the reader who begins other than at the beginning will be confused.Fortunately they are all delightful, and reading the first naturally leads into the second, and so on. The latest is particularly delightful, and the bargain book in the entire series. There are two separate plots in the book, and it could have ended with the resolution of the first. The second simply feels like a another book. Very generous of Ms. Peters, but just a bit odd.

There are new characters and those that have been part of the series from the beginning and there are continuing mysteries that continue to change their shape. These are the books to read when you've had enough of the complexities of modern life. There are mysteries, but they are not too complex, there is suspense, but not too much, there is humor in abundance and the bonhomie of spending time with a family that millions adore."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"On a recent trip, I entertained myself by listening to The Golden One by Elizabeth Peters. The book is a fabulous listening experience due to the talent of Barbara Rosenblat, the actress who narrates the story.The story itself is full of intrigue, greed, tomb robbing - think of the Brendan Fraser/Rachel Weisz \\"Mummy\\" movies without the supernatural element. It's a great swashbuckling kind of story, but what makes the audio book so wonderful is Barbara Rosenblat. She's simply amazing as she performs. Her voice lends itself as easily to a wily Egyptian trader as it does to a young girl or middle-aged Egyptologist Amelia Peabody or Radcliffe Emerson, the Father of Curses.Ms. Rosenblat weaves a spell with her voice and transports you to Egypt as it was in 1917. I adore Elizabeth Peters. Her writing is always superb. Barbara Rosenblat does her Amelia Peabody books justice, easily helping your imagination create mental pictures of the characters as she effortlessly goes from character to character.In short, Ms. Barbara Rosenblat has a voice that is a golden treasure."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I first met Amanda Peabody some years ago and have followed her for a long time.

A pleasure to work with this seller."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"As the year 1917 dawns the extended (and ever expanding) Peabody-Emerson clan has returned to their beloved Egypt to resume their archeology (and hopefully only those) pursuits. WWI is continuing to rage across Europe and the Middle East making travel quite dangerous. With that in mind Emerson and Amelia have decided to remain in Egypt indefinitely and to take as many of their extended family as possible with them. The group has certainly grown in the thirty plus years that this (AMELIA PEABODY) series has covered so far. Besides Amelia and Emerson the family now includes their son Ramses, his wife Nefret, ward Sennia, butler Gargery and Horus their most recent feline companion. They are met in Egypt by the Egyptian branch of the family and various friends. Unfortunately they soon discover that others have noticed their arrival, particularly those who are determined to recruit Ramses once again in undercover work.Despite the most determined efforts of all involved Ramses is finally persuaded to return to 'The Great Game', an enterprise that quickly turns into a family affair ranging from Luxor to Cairo to Gaza. Even when long suffering Emerson is allowed to return to his dig he is plagued by tomb robbers and bl**** tourists.As always the story is told primarily by Amelia with additional material supplied by Ramses. THE GOLDEN ONE is called a 'novel of suspense' rather than a mystery and while there is plenty of action and adventure the true attraction here is the on-going 'back' story of the various characters. Those unfamiliar with the series would do well to begin with CROCODILE ON THE SANDBANK and proceed in order. Long time fans of this series (this is the fourteenth installment), will not want to miss the latest news about this delightful group."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"She entertains me, over and over.

The plot is typical Peters - tombs to find, killers to capture, espionage adventures that showcase the son, Ramses for the true hero he is - But what has impressed me in the entire series is the character developement - from the 1st book Crocodile on the Sandbank, which brings Amelia in contact with the vibrant Emerson, to the birth of their son, Walter (Ramses), to the introduction of the beautiful Nefret in one of the best of the series, The Last Camel Died at Noon, we see the family and their servants and workers and what they mean to their lives - Their reis, Abdullah, is a strong presence that is felt even now - The best thing about this progression is we finally get to see what each character means to each other, and that is wonderful.Yes, there are great adventures, yes, there are recurring villians, and new villians to come, but the fun of these novels makes you feel you are in that time and in that place and enjoying every second of it.For those of you thinking of buying The Golden One, I suggest you start with the 1st and work your way up - You'll be delighted you did."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"One would think that reading 13 books in the Amelia Peabody Emerson series would be enough. But there can never be enough Amelia! This lastest book continues Ms. Peters' great tradition, or as she says, edification of the most astounding journals of one of the greatest(and most opinionated) women Egyptologists of the time. This book continues the narration of Mrs. Emerson's, and her husband, Radclife Emerson's adventures and their work in the field of archeology. Their equally talented and intellegent son, Ramses and his wife, Nefret, join them in their search for ancient tombs and pyramids. This book takes them back to Egypt during the war-torn days of the First World War. Again, the Emersons encounter corpses, secret agents, old nemises and danger around every corner. Amelia, Emerson and Nefret follow Ramses, who is once again called up by the British Secret Service, into the desert and encounter, once again, their old nemisis, Sethos.This book is a must=read for anyone who loves Agatha Christie mysteries, Victorian society, romance or Epyptology. As Ms. Peters holds a Ph.D. in Egyptology, she does an outstanding job describing the excavation of tombs and the archeological methods of the late 19th century, not to mention the colonial and Egyptian lifestyle in Egypt at the turn of the century.Some may find Amelia's ramblings in her &quot;journal&quot; annoying, but as this book is kept in the true Victorian writing style, this should be over looked and enjoyed. All in all I would give this lastest addition a huge Two Thumbs Up! Brava, Ms. Peters!"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"As a devoted fan of Amelia Peabody, I've faithfully followed the series with each book. The earlier novels were funny, infused with Ramses' precocious exploits as a child, Amelia's musing on the inferiority of the male gender, and rich displays of romantic imagination. As Ramses grew into a teen, the novels became a little less campy and a little more serious, the tension of the novels often residing in the Ramses-Nefret relationship or the Amelia-Sethos-Emerson triangle. In this latest novel, Peter's heart just doesn't seem to be in it. The plot seems forced, the sense of what-will-happen-next is missing (Rames and Nefret are safely married, Amelia and Sethos are a &quot;has been&quot; item), and the war has erased the humor. The tension in the novel comes almost wholly from a rather mundane plot versus the characters' relationships, making it fairly dull compared with earlier Peabody novels. Amelia's character, the heart of the book, seems to lack the love of life she used to have and none of the characters around her are as interestingly as they used to be. Has Peters grown tired of the Peabody series? This book reads as if it has been churned out rather than written with Peter's former humor and warmth."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"For those who worried that there was no where for the Amelia Peabody storyline to go after Ramses and Nefret married or that the elder Emersons would be phased out for the younger generation...Don't Worry! The Golden One is Peters at her best with interwoven storylines, multiple villians and all of the Emersons thouroughly engaged in the highjinks! With the very satisfying clues dropped at the end of the book hinting at future escapades, I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I very much enjoy the entire Amelia Peabody series, and this is a fine addition. There are very few mysteries whose characters have much depth or history, which I appreciate, so I espcially enjoy the length of this series (14 so far). The 30 years of the Peabody /Emmerson adventures have kept me highly entertained. Ms. Peters is one of the few mystery authors who allows her charecters to develop significant relationships, and then builds those charecters into the story (so tierd of the cynical loner types)! Amliea &amp; co. continue to deal with archeological, world and family events which are both suspensful and amusing. The plot wanders a little, but that just gave me more to read. If you haven't read the whole series, you should. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"I really enjoyed all of the &quot;Amelia&quot; stories, however, I felt as if this was two storylines stuffed into one book - the missing tomb and the adventures in Gaza. It would have been much more fun to have two books written; one on each topic instead of two unrelated storylines.Having said that, it was still a good read and I loved the development of Sethos and his daughter. Can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"of course you'll need to read the latest installment. However I'd recommend getting a library copy if possible and waiting for paperback before purchasing a copy for your own shelves.As in the last few books in the series, Ms. Peters seems to have lost focus, unsure of how to treat the affects of the Great War on Amelia and company. The archeological mystery feels trivial in comparison to the happenings in the world beyond Luxor. The adventure into espionage is perfunctory and fragmented. And the way Sethos has become a Deus Ex Machina makes me irritated with a character I formerly loved.If I were truly honest, this book probably deserves less than 3 stars. But my enduring affection for the series made it readable. I just wish I hadn't paid hard cover prices."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"The Golden OneI tend to stick with certain authors through a great deal of thick or thin before I give up totally. But I have to admit that the last few of Amelia Peabody/Emerson's adventures have been a bit trying. She and her husband Emerson have always been strong-minded to the point of obnoxiousness, but, beyond a certain point, it gets monotonous and even a little sad instead of funny. It is quite a relief to find that Elizabeth Peters is back on track, if not headed down another path entirely.Make no mistake; this is the usual heady brew of stolen antiquities, hidden tombs, Ramses' heroics and Amelia's infernal meddling. And it is the regular cast of nearly 20 very eccentric characters. But something special seems to have happened. Peters has made them all lighten up and take themselves quite a bit less seriously. Not only is the end result far less ponderous, but the tongue in cheek interplay of the characters reveals not just their faults, but many of their more endearing qualities as well.The story takes place in 1917, with the Emerson's returning to Egypt for some extended digging. They have decided to settle in for the duration of the war rather than risk being sunk by u-boats while traveling back in forth. They arrive amid rumors that thieves have found and emptied yet another tomb. The Emersons descend upon Luxor determined to unearth the culprits. Of course, they quickly find that the emptied tomb isn't quite empty. Someone seems to have left a corpse in it.There was a time when this would have provided enough plot for an entire Emersonian melodrama. But, in those days, there were four or five regular characters, not the twenty we have now. This time Ramses is again drawn into the deadly game of spies. It seems you can never have just one Emerson, though, and all four Emersons pile into a motorcar and race off to Gaza, behind enemy lines, checking up on a certain cousin Ismail.Before the Emerson's are done, they will have baffled the Turks, terrorized the thieves, embarrassed British military intelligence, chased back and forth across the desert in search of a mysterious tomb and... Well, suffice it to say, that almost everything that could happen does, repeatedly. In fact, there are more than enough loose ends to guarantee a sequel. And enough excitement to ensure that this reader will once again line up to buy it. Be warned, this series is long past the point where it is easy to dive right in and understand all the subplots. The book is enjoyable on its own, but seeking out some of the earlier novels in this series will make it even more rewarding."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"Having been just [very] slightly disappointed in the last book in this series, Lord of the Silent, I was brought back to loving this series once again with this entry. There are the usual elements of an Amelia Peabody mystery: a couple of dead bodies, some threats made against the family, Emerson screaming, Peabody knowing all, Ramses being enigmatic and so forth.In this episode, Amelia and family are being led to believe that someone has found a previously undiscovered royal tomb. They waver back &amp; forth as to whether this is possible or not but continue to think about the clues pointing in that direction.Meanwhile, Ramses is convinced by the army to sneak himself into the enemy-controlled Gaza to discover if their old nemesis, Sethos, has indeed gone over to the enemy. Amelia, Emerson, and Nefret cannot allow him to do this without their help, of course, and mayhem ensues.All in all an enjoyable read and a nice cliffhanger at the end to build interest in the next book."},{"Title":"The Golden One (Amelia Peabody Mysteries, Book 14)","review":"From lack of use, that is!

Rounding out the entourage are Gargery, the loyal butler, and the precocious child Sennia, a newer addition to the clan, along with several other familiar and not-so-familiar acquaintances.WWI still rages on, but that doesn't stop the Emersons from continuing their beloved excavations. Until, of course, the ineluctable dead body turns up. What unfolds from there will not be revealed by this reviewer, as Ms. Peters' talent is best enjoyed first-hand.

Your views will not be challenged and you can bask in the reassurance that the only opinions worth having are Christian ones. This is a deeply biased and intellectually impoverished book. His pronouncements on the scientific world view were cringe-making. It was laughable to find him cribbing from other \\"introduction to philosophy\\" books like Will Durant's work, as the foundation for his own introductory book. Such is the shallowness of Sproul's scholarship... a first year undergraduate could have done better research.This book willl be of no use to any one serious about studying philosophy. At best it might serve as an intro reader in conservative Christian high schools."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"This is a good book for a Christian Fundamentalist that is looking to use Philosphy to support their beliefs rather than challenge. My take is that the Consequences of Ideas for Sproul is how ideas potentially lead you away from fundamentalist beliefs. For example, his simplistic refutation of Darwin represents a cliche of Christian thought of the 20th Century.I don't recommend this book one based on its method and also based on its constant errored summaries. For example, page 163, on his treatment of Nietzche: &quot;The will to power may be link to modern paradignms such as people's attempt to rise to the top of the pyramid, an adult version of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;&quot;. That is not what is Nietzche was saying at all and is completely inaccurate.Philosophy is so much more than what Sproul has given. We can actually learn from the critiques of the history and use them to open our mind rather than close it."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"This book covers roughly 2,500 years of Western philosophy from Plato to Jean-Paul Sartre. Sproul's sections on Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and the section on the influence of Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud (even though they cannot properly be called philosophers) were the most insightful sections in the book. The conclusion was excellent as well.Sproul opens the book with an introduction to what philosophy is and why he is interested in it. I think his definition that philosophy is foundational thinking is simple and very accurate. His attention to epistemology (The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity) throughout the book was a good to choice. Sproul's explanation of the various philosophers was accessible; the use of diagrams (e.g. his illustration of Kierkegaard and Hegel's synthesis) will help those who are totally unfamiliar with philosophy.Many readers will probably say that the book is far too short (at 203 pages), but I think Sproul's objective was to provide a concise introduction. I think the book could be twice the length and still be concise (then he could have included Pragmatism and perhaps even an Eastern philosopher or two). I think that the book failed to do accomplish its title. What do I mean? I think except for a few places (e.g. Marx), he failed to show the consequences of these ideas. Examples of how these ideas have impacted society would make philosophy more relevant. At the same time, I recognize that perhaps Sproul wanted to reader to reflect on these ideas and then realize when these ideas have influenced the arts, politics etc but I think he failed to show how these ideas have worked themselves out (again, there are a few exceptions) in our world. Also, he rarely mentioned the Christian response to these philosophers; I think perhaps an annotated bibliography of Christian books responding to each philosophical movement (i.e. rationalism, empiricism, Marxism or existentialism) would have been helpful. One book I can recommend that evaluates some of these philosophers (e.g. Kant, Hume, Plato and others) is Norman Geisler's, \\"Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics.\\"I would recommend this book for Christians who want to learn about philosophy but don't know where to begin."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"As I have suggested in the title, this book appears to me to be a \\"brief introduction to an introduction.\\" The book is not to be confused with Richard Weaver's classic, \\"Ideas Have Consequences\\", in which he (Weaver) provides the reader with a pellucid introduction and overview of Western philosophy and how the Age of Reason gave birth to the decline of true philosophy (the study of wisdom, i.e., sophia/logos), and the birth of rationalism (the exaltation of man's reason over revelation) and the granddaughter, postmodernism, which teaches subjective irrationalism (\\"What I believe is true, IS True\\"). Unfortunately, for my money, R.C. Sproul, who is a fine theologian and writer, indeed (I have most of his works) misses the mark in what he propounds to be a basic introduction for the non-philosopher. My reasons are twofold: First, the book barely introduces key concepts and then quickly moves on to the next topic or philosopher; and second, what is explained is not clear enough because of my first point. For example, Sproul points out that Plato was an idealist and that Aristotle was a realist, doing this in one single paragraph, and then moves on. His definition of idealism and realism is incomplete. As I have taught my philosophy students, the two schools are indeed simple enough to understand, but more detail is required. Plato's reality was absorbed in the mind; the reality of truth, justice and aesthetics is found in the reality of the mind, for behind all corporeal things, behind the physical appearances we see each day, exists in a metaphysical sphere the reality of such appearances. The black stallion we see running in the field is an inferior black stallion, a \\"shadow\\" of its true reality, for somewhere in the heavens exists the perfect black stallion, and sadly, we must content ourselves with its imperfect image. Plato said that reality is a dream, that what is before us is an illusion (similar to Eastern mysticism), that all physical objects, including humans, are sinful. Thus, when John says in his Gospel that the \\"Word (divine logos to the Greeks) became flesh,\\" this notion would have been utterly contemptible to many Greeks in the first century. Plato, therefore, was an idealist is that he formulated truth in the mind, and from his most famous work, \\"The Republic\\", we see his idealism played out in what he envisioned as a perfect society, a society that \\"should be,\\" not the realistic society of \\"what is\\" taught by his student Aristotle, in his book, \\"The Politics.\\" Aristotle was a realist in that he believed that inductive and scientific investigation of the real world, as opposed to Plato's unreal cosmology, would lead one to both understand the Prime Mover (God) and how the world worked and could be harnessed. Thanks to Aristotle, who became the prevailing philosopher, the West would launch into detailed investigations that would lead to inventions and the notion of human rights, freedom and autonomy. In my view, Sproul gives scant notice to the fundamental differences between idealism and realism, and does not make applications or logical connections, or in his words, he does not demonstrate the consequences of those ideas. I find it remarkable that he gives no space to Cicero, one who constantly quotes or alludes to Plato in his works. Cicero was a loan voice who hearkened decadent Rome back to the wisdom of the Greeks, and laid a foundation for future understanding of ethics, morals, political responsibility and freedom. Sproul should have shown the clear influences between the philosophers. For example, how Plato deeply influenced St. Augustine who credited Plato with being his teacher; how Augustine influenced Luther and Calvin; how Plato influenced Locke and then Freud; how Aristotle influenced, well, everyone, especially St. Thomas, Calvin, then down to philosophers in our own time. In short, all philosophers since Plato and Aristotle have merely stood on the shoulders of those two giants, and one philosopher even penned that all philosophers since Plato are merely a footnote to Plato himself. Both Plato and Aristotle are quite literally the Fathers of Western Civilization, but that idea has little consequence in the book.To be brief is fine, but to be vastly incomplete could mean that the reader is not getting a necessary foundation in order to understand other philosophers. For example, Sproul takes barely two pages to explain Hegel's theory of thesis/antithesis. He explains that for Hegel, one begins with a thesis from which one derives an antithesis, from which one formulates a synthesis; then the synthesis becomes a new thesis. For the layperson in philosophy, I would (I can only) imagine that this construct would be confusing. Sproul never posits a thesis and antithesis for clarification, but merely provides a graduating graph. The reader is left clueless. On this point, Francis Schaeffer in his book, \\"Escape from Reason\\", is a little more helpful.Why Sproul left John Dewey as a footnote in the last chapter is a mystery to me, as it was John Dewey who nearly single handedly presided over the death of American public education, slowly from the 1920's and 30's to this death in 1965. The Pragmatism philosophy invented by John Dewey is clearly connected to the Existentialism of Hegel, Kierkegaard, Camus and Sartre, and has profoundly influenced American society, particularly the free fall of ethics and morals beginning in the 1960s to the present day. It was Dewey in his 1941 book, \\"Theory of the Moral Life\\", maintained that there are two enemies of his beloved \\"Progressive\\" Education movement in America, i.e., first, religion in general, and the church in particular with its outmoded creeds, and secondly, parents. He envisioned a society where, in order for students to progress intellectually, that social engineering (public education) will free young people from both religious negative influences and the negative influences of parents. For a brilliant discussion of John Dewey, George Counts and others Doctors of Intellectual Death, read Diane Ravitch's book, \\"Left Back: A Century of Failed Education Reform.\\" Every parent should own Ravitch's book.Unfortunately, because Sproul opted for brevity in his introduction to an introduction, the reader is given a fragmented portrait of the history of ideas, their consequences, and their logical outcomes.I give the book three stars because R.C. Sproul is the author, and a fine one indeed, but I must subtract two stars because the several ideas within are incomplete, and not applied.

The penultimate chapter before the conclusion covers Darwin and Freud. Sproul discussed how these 19th century thinkers have had great influence on the current secular worldview. As others have noted, the book ends rather abruptly after 200 pages.Throughout this book R. C. Sproul does not hide his biases. He clearly states he is a Christian and a dedicated supporter of the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. He agrees with Roman Catholic philosopher Etienne Gilson, and concludes, \\"our choice is not between Immanuel Kant and Ren&eacute; Descartes or between G. W. F. Hegel and Sren Kierkegaard. We must choose instead between Kant and Thomas Aquinas. Gilson insists that all other positions are mere halfway houses on the road to either absolute religious agnosticism or the natural theology of Christian metaphysics.\\"R. C. Sproul is a very good writer. He is both easy to read, and communicates many ideas in a few words. I gave _Consequences_ four stars because it is a very good introduction to ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. Some of the discussions of how philosophies interacted with each other were very nice. Sproul also has an excellent skill in explaining such concepts as epistemology (knowledge), ontology (being), and teleology (purpose).This book includes the best short introduction to the medieval scholastics I have ever read. The inclusion of proofs for the existence of God was very nicely done. Kierkegaard is also very good, although Sproul does not seem to go as far as he might to meet him on his own terms. As a fideist Kierkegaard has a different philosophical emphasis than Sproul. To judge Kierkegaard in purely rational way seems unfair; he was more concerned about matters of faith and heart and saw philosophy as a means to expression, rather than a way to find absolute truth. I respectfully disagree with Sproul who feels that fideism is one of the \\"mere byproducts born of the decomposition of the Christian living God.\\" R. C. Sproul certainly is not as friendly to his philosophy as Calvin College's C. Stephen Evans is in _Faith Beyond Reason_.The book claims to help the reader understand \\"the concepts that shaped our world.\\" I felt that the book fell short of its purpose because it seems to ignore the influences to our culture in the last fifty years. There was little, if any, mention of postmodernism and eastern philosophy. I found myself checking the copyright date to make sure it wasn't written in the nineteen-fifties. In recent years, the influence of postmodernism has had a profound affect on our culture, and I see the omission as a flaw. In the introduction, Sproul states, \\"Philosophy forces us to think foundationally.\\" The current voices of postmodern philosophers reject the foundationalism, and much of the rationalism of the modern era. Some people today go as far as saying \\"What is true for you, is true for you. What is true for me is true for me.\\" That being said, this book and another such as Stanley J. Grentz's _A Primer on Postmodernism_ make a great pair.The fact that R. C. Sproul is a Reformed Christian, and seems to be quite partial to Thomas Aquinas, does not detract from the fact that he is also a very competent historian of philosophy. I appreciate his ministry to promote thinking among evangelical Christians. After reading _Consequences_, I would highly recommend the highly acclaimed nine-volume series _A History of Philosophy_ by Thomist philosopher Frederick C. Copleston."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"R. C. Sproul presents a readable, accessible history of Western philosophy, from the pre-Socratics to the present. In just over 200 pages he presents the major ideas and world-views that have affected the minds of humans and the course of history. Writing as a committed Christian, he challenges Christians to not merely BELIEVE, but also to THINK. In the end, Sproul affirms (with Gilson) that our fundamental choice is between the world-view of Thomas Aquinas (rational Christian theism) or the world-view of Immanuel Kant (irrational agnosticism)."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"Noted theologian and philosopher R.C. Sproul has written a concise and clear text on the history of philosophy, its major contributers, and the ideas which sprang from these great minds.The strength of this book is its easy to read style that can attract non-philosophers who are interested in the subject and would like to understand the modern ideas and from which they come.The book begins with a brief chapter on the &quot;Fisrt Philosophers&quot; and then sweeps through history with chapter after chapter, reviewing and processing the greatest philosophers up to the present time: Plato, Aristotle, Agustine, Aquinas, Kierkegaard, Marx, Sarte and many more are discussed.The reviewer who gave this book only one star has made some unfounded attacks. The first attack, is that Dr. Sproul is not a fundamentalist Christian, but a Reformed Christian,and the differences, though similar in some respects are also in others, quite different. Sproul's review of Nietzsche is on target and the one sentence quoted by the previous reviewer, needs to be read in its entire context on &quot;The will to Power.&quot; Old Friedrich's philosophies do allow for such uses against our fellow man, even if Nietzsche himself wouldn't have done so.Further, this is a book about ideals and their consequences and Sproul does take a Cristian worldview position. This is no reason to disregard a book because it may afront one's personal world-view. There is much to be learned from this text.The chapters on Aquinas and Kiekergaard are outsanding. The conclusion is the weakess point in the book and should have been better developed. It is as Sproul was tired of writing and decided to stop; This is a problem in some of his other books Like &quot;The Last Days According to Jesus.&quot;A highly recommemded the text. After reading this book, I would suggest one purchase the more detialed work called &quot;Life's Ultimate Questions&quot; by Nash."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"224 pages and every concept and idea made clear for beginners and experts. R.C. has written a masterpiece. He explains the main contours of the history of philosophy. He goes further by making philosophical thought come alive. Finally, I understand many ideas I heard before many times. Each main philosophical player is made crystal clear. Transitions are included so that R.C. can acknowledge pivotal contributions that he can't cover extensively. I recommend this book for a great general introduction to the history of philosophy. R.C. is know for being a teacher of reformed theology yet many of his students will appreciate his expertise in philosophy. He concludes with the challenge to choose between Aquinas or Kant. This is a very balanced view of Christian thought for a reformed theologian to acknowledge a Catholic thinker as Aquinas. I enjoyed every page of Sprouls' treatise. If you want to really grasp ideas for the first time, I recommend this for you. If you are a homeschooler and into the classical approach to education you will be delighted by the conclusion of the book. I hope R.C. writes another book, maybe on classical education?"},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. I was told that Sproul was famous for taking hard concepts and putting them into easy-to-read/easy-to-understand words. So, after reading the description and especially after reading through the table of contents, I was expecting this to be a pretty decent work on the history of philosophy.Instead, I got more of an introduction to 'some' of the 'names' in the history of philosophy, but barely an adequate concept of what they contributed to western knowledge and how their ideas have \\"shaped our world.\\" There was very little education on what these guys actually articulated and how that changed the course of western thought. Moreover, with the exception of his chapter on Marx, there was little interaction with these \\"ideas\\" and their \\"consequences,\\" especially as they pertain to a Biblical worldview.I enjoy Sproul's style, and I anticipate keeping this book as a quick reference to remember simple things, like: Descartes=cognito ergo sum and Locke=tabula rasa. But to get even a little bit deeper understanding of what all this means, I'll have to turn to a different source. (In this book he frequently references, \\"Thales to Dewey\\" by Gordon Clark. I'm thinking I'd get a lot more use out of that.)"},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"If you are interested in a good introduction to Western Philosophy and how the ideas of the past effects your life today, this book is it. I found the book easy to read. The case R.C. makes is both compelling and a learning experience. Read this book if you are interested in getting an overview of why we think the way we do in the western world."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"A powerful book that is sure to please the thoughtful reader. The author does a splendid job of keeping philosophy in its proper ministerial place while allowing Scripture its rightful magisterial position in shaping truth. True ideas have truthful consequences; false ideas also have truthful consequences, which sometimes are like ideological gravity: painful landings without a biblically informed parachute! Napoleon was right: 'the pen is mightier than the sword',or as Solomon said: 'as a man thinketh, so is he'. This volume is a great help for saint, seeker, skeptic, sage to 'love the Lord your God with all your mind'. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"My expectations were not as high as other reviewers. Sproul's Consequences is only 224 pages long and any reader of Sproul's work will know that he publishes in readable type too. Sproul is in no way representing comprehensiveness. He states up front that he is offering a \\"familiarization\\" in Amazon's \\"Product Description\\".Sproul is an unabashed Christian theologian. If you bought the book without knowing of him, that might have been unfortunate. It should come as no surprise that his philosophical survey would be targeted to his Christian thinking audience. I give Sproul high marks for stepping out of theology to describe and correlate 14 secular philosophical schools in some manner of theological context. Very few trying to walk in Christ's path will have even heard of most of these philosophers. I have yet to meet a layman or pastor with an adequate depth of knowledge to discuss the philosophy of even the Christian Kierkegaard. Christians have faith and belief but quite frankly, as a body in Christ, we are largely ignorant of these critical thinkers and their postulations and if we are familiar, we need a reminder years after our first visit with these philosophical concepts.For me, the chronologic tour of philosophers was an excellent revisit of forgotten memories. I'm writing this review at least 3 years after I read Consequences. I find myself referring to Consequences as a reference within basic philosophical thought and from there to explore my specific interest directly. I got my money's worth."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"One thing that I have learned from studying apologetics and the faith is that the Christian attempting to defend his/her faith must be grounded in firm philosophical reasoning as well as farmiliar with many of the main philosophical schools of thought, especially those which we see predominating our culture today. While I think that the best and most thorough book for this is \\"Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview\\", Sproul's work is an excellent, readable, and much shorter alternate to the massive 600 page tome requiring some familiarity with philosophy that is Craig and Moreland. Sproul devotes each chapter to a particular philosopher who created a new school of thought. He begins with the Greeks, including Aristotle and Plato, moving onto the major Christian thinkers Augustine and Aquinas, before moving onto philosophies which may have some elements of truth but are not fully compatible with Christianity, like Kant and Kierkegaard, and also covers the most destructive philosophies such as those of Marx and Nietzsche. Each chapter is fairly short, and Sproul gives examples and illustrations to give the reader a simple picture of what the main idea of a particular philosophy is. In doing this, Sproul argues the case for their philosophy before giving a Christian response, which is something that we as Christians must be able to do."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"I have tired to make sense of this subject several times. My eyes usual cross about the time the author begins talking about reality and non-reality. THIS BOOK makes sense of all of that. If you are like me, you know you should have a working knowledge of philosophy for your job (pastoring a church in my case, but the idea of hitting all those books make you gag. This is the one to read to help you get a grip"},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"Sproul's book makes philosophy very attractive. I fully endorse this very thorough and well written book. Even if philosophy is not your strength, he makes you want to learn about it. R.C. Sproul's resources have always penetrated my walk with Christ to love God with my mind(Luke 10:27). This book is one of many comforting Christian books in the midst of a starving postmodern society."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"I'm a big fan of Dr. Sproul and his radio program &quot;Renewing Your Mind.&quot; I appreciate the way he takes a philosopher's perspective of Christianity and analyzes/debunks competing worldviews in light of biblical teachings. I had also read some of Sproul's other books, and thus was drawn to this rather intriguing offering. It is intended to supplement the average believer's biblical knowledge with some essential grounding in philosophy, of which Christianity (some would argue) is just another variant.The book promises to give an overview of major philosophical influences on modern western thought, and it does just that. The presentation is essentially chronological, beginning with the early Greek masters and proceeding through the Renaissance to the likes of Descartes and Kant (where's Hegel?), and on into the twentieth century. There is some loose structure beyond that as certain thinkers built upon the frameworks of some of their forebears, but otherwise the major movements of thought are unconnected.Sproul presents the gist of each philosopher's major teachings, then analyzes it to identify its particular weaknesses, occasionally doing so in a dismissive way that sort of assumes that the reader understands the subject matter nearly as well as the author. In general the writing style comes across very much like a professor's lecture, sometimes easy to follow, sometimes not. In light of Sproul's radio presentation style, though, this was to be expected (although frankly I thought the style in &quot;Chosen By God&quot; was much preferable).My real disappointment was that the book really had no specific direction other than as a quick trip through philosophical history. There's no real point that's being made, and very little practical application that can be drawn from it for daily living. The book ends rather abruptly as the discussion of the last thinker's position is concluded, without any real effort to draw it all together into a meaningful whole.Maybe I'm just looking for more there than the author intended, maybe not. Yes, it's valuable to edify your mind a little bit if (like me) you have no background in philosophy. If that's not what you're after, however, I think you would be wasting your time with this one."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"'The Consequences of Ideas' by R.C. Sproul is a very well done book on the history of thought. I originally purchased this book to sharpen my apologetics in relation to philosophy, and I believe this book helped, though not in the way I thought it would. My perception was that Sproul would examine the major philosophies that affect the secular American worldview of today. I expected him to go through the ideas one by one, accepting those that are true and shooting down the ones that are inconsistent. Instead, this book walks through the major idea creators of the last few thousand years one by one and discusses what their ideas were. As I said above, I still feel that this book increased my apologetic knowledge of philosophy as it showed me where many ideas that are around today come from, and knowing where ideas come from helps to take their power away.Again, I really liked this book, and especially appreciated the unexpected treat in that Sproul ventured off the beaten path of 'meaning of life' philosophy to look at the political ideas of John Locke and the economic ideas of Karl Marx.If you were like I was when originally buying this book and want to find a book that is more of a survey and critique of the various worldviews and religions of today, I recommend 'The Universe Next Door' by James Sire. Both books are very good in their own right."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"A very well written book and one that I would highly recommend for several different types of people. For those marginally interested in philosophy or time-constrained and wishing an overview in philosophy, I know of no better book to recommend; the language, while still sprinkled with some progressive vocabulary, is still understandable for most people. For those with more previous exposure and formal study of philosophy, perhaps in earlier years, this book will also satisfy as a refresher. In short, which is what the book is, and masterfully so, it's a very good survey of modern philosophy. I was a bit disaapointed however, as I see at least one other reviewer was in the same vein, in that R.C. didn't really tie the philosophies discussed more concretely to any societial consequences -- elements of thinking (or non-thinking as the case may be) which are tearing our world apart. The consequences of the ideas discussed on the book are left for the reader to surmise. In some cases, the consequences in our present society of the ideas presented are more easily realized. In some cases, they are not. And exactly how some of those ideas were propagated from the original &quot;thinker&quot; into reality in our society is not discussed at all. So in this way, I think R.C. missed a great opportunity to draw more concrete conclusions, which is precisely why I purchased the book. Nevertheless, the book turned out to be a pleasant surprise, though I feel the title is a bit misleading in that the ideas are merely presented, but not concretely concluded (as the title would have one to believe.) I would sub-title this book &quot;A Survey Of Philosophy.&quot; Finally, I think wisdom dictates that this book only be given to him that shows proper grounding and exudes the fruit of faith in his life. To give this book to a confused person/Christian, or &quot;free thinker&quot; (perhaps a disallusioned teenager?), wouldn't be a good idea. R.C. does a great job of laying out the thoughts of many men -- deranged men even in some cases, and certainly few that agree with Jesus in their thinking -- without always providing proper rebuttal or antidote, so, beware that while the book is good, it would only be good in some cases. Other cases, depending on the person, it could have undesirable effects. As the greatest teacher EVER indicated, words are seeds... So, be careful. Otherwise, a very good read and worth having."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"I felt the need to join my review to the list of glowing reports about this gem of a volume. Dr. Sproul's review of philosophy from the Greeks to the present era builds around selected philosophers who have \\"shaped our world\\"(phrase taken from the subtitle of the book). In this respect it is different from the more technical work by Prof. Clark, From Thales to Dewey, (also an excellent book) that provides detailed reviews of arguments of different philosophers in the area of epistemology from the Greeks to the present. This work does not need an extensive background in philosophy; rather, a well-educated layman or laywoman will find this text readable and edifying.One thing Dr. Sproul does very well and in this volume and in all his books is give respect to \\"the opposition.\\" Although only Augustine and Acquinas of the philosophers covered could be considered \\"Christian,\\" Dr. Sproul patiently reveals what each is getting at, and one gets a sense of the power of their ideas. At the same time, he reveals in each case the limitations of their thinking in light of Christ and theology without belaboring his points. It is a perfect kind of book for me. I have a lifelong love for philosophy and many Christians might wonder what I see in that \\"junk\\" now that I am saved and know \\"the truth.\\" On the other hand, philosophers undoubtedly see little to dialogue about with theology types since theology and philosophy seem to have gone their separate ways a few hundred years ago. Dr. Sproul shows that as a Christian theologian he is not a \\"second class citizen\\" in the world of philosophy, and that fittingness of expression re-establishes a connection that should never have been broken."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"On Monday I found out my books for school.

While on the surface it appears to be an abridged history of philosophy, Mr. Sproul takes the reader on a journey through the working of the mind. As in his other books, the author does not tell you what to think or what he thinks, but he forces his reader to think for themselves. This is a very powerful book, especially for one so short, but it should not be attempted by anyone who is not willing to have their basis for being and thinking challenged."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"Sproul has a manner of writing that is smooth and engaging. I do most of my research in areas of rigid and precise epistemology and philosophy, nonetheless I enjoy reading everything Sproul writes on apologetics. It was a delight to read this in one sitting even though I have a different apologetic view. This book may help ignite a hunger for deeper intellectual issues in the reader. Hence it fulfills the aims of examining philosophy and providing material to increase one's desire for academic issues.

It seems a waste of time in these days when pragmatism reigns. But Sproul argues that ideas are important and dangerous. And as the title says they have consequences. He argues that foundational thinking (thinking about basic truths) is necessary since many of our assumptions are dangerous and lethal. He does this by showing how our assumptions have developed by tracing the history of ideas from one prominent philosopher to the next.Sproul has written this book for the average reader. This is not a book for the professional philosopher. It is for those of us who want to learn about philosophy but don't have the time to go get a phd. It is written for this who are curious about how we got where we are in a culture that feels pretty insane much of the time.The themes that seem to stick out are problem with epistemology (how we know what we know), the existence of God, and the meaning behind it all. There are other themes but to me these seem to be the ones that keep popping up. For example we begin discussing Plato and Aristotle's teachings regarding the realm of ideals and the realm of shadows and the development in Aristotle, then there is the development throughout history. Such as Descartes basing knowledge on his discernment of his own existence as a foundation for knowing.This argument matters. Ideas do have consequences. Think for example of the consequences of the idea of Aryan ethnic superiority. The consequences of that idea were the holocaust, a second world war, and many deaths of soldiers and civilians.The execution of the book seems to be a bit mixed. Sometimes it really felt like too much was being summarized, like something was being lost. That's not a knock on Sproul it's simply the nature of the effort. He wanted to give us a summary of the history of ideas, and that encompasses a lot of ideas, a lot of time, and a lot of people. Sproul gave us a good effort but it should be considered a starting point. Leading to more reading in philosophy. One of the things that was really helpful and well executed was the way he used terminology. He didn't avoid using the jargon of philosophy but whenever he used the jargon he was careful to define it consistently, I found this extremely helpful.My Recommendation - If you are well read in philosophy then all this book can offer you is a quality refresher. But if you are curious about philosophy then Sproul has given us the gift of an interesting and usable introduction to philosophy. If you are interested about how we got where we are in our culture this book helps trace the ideas that shape us, since there are no new ideas. If you have no interest in philosophy or worldview thinking then you will have absolutely no use for this book. But I liked it immensely."},{"Title":"The Consequences of Ideas: Understanding the Concepts that Shaped Our World","review":"This book is made simple by one of the best teachers today.

This charming memory of these days has somehow managed to escape being outdated in the 25 years since its original appearance.Schullery combines reminiscences with musings about Yellowstone and its people. He ponders the tourist experience, life as a ranger, the meaning of wilderness, and much else besides. Even when admitting a bit of criticism into his musings, Schullery remains too good natured not to see the best side of Yellowstone and its visitors. Indeed, he can be criticized for thinking too well of the park service, tourists, campgrounds, RVs, and much else besides. (Though he doesn't like RVs either.)This would be a great book to have in your suitcase when visiting Yellowstone.

I have spent years around the park and this book contained much that was new to me. There is a warmth and a dignity to Schullery's writing that befits our oldest national park.Unusual for an on-the-record Park Service employee, Schullery does have his own opinions. There are friends and enemies. In the twenty years since this book was originally published, the world of Yellowstone has changed. Its greatest threat does not come from extractive and exploitative corporations, nor a complicitous government, nor even from the dingbat Congressional delegation attached to its home states. Rather, it comes from the citizenry that most professes to cherish the resource. People like you and me who are loving it to death, slicing subdivisions into critical habitat in a fevered quest for their piece of the West.Ahhh, but Yellowstone belongs as much to the sunburned bricklayer from Ohio and his sausage-legged wife as it does to me. Schullery understands that this land was made for you and me, no matter how difficult the mediation between user groups. And as the title of the book reminds us, Yellowstone is indeed on mountain time. All the snowmobilers and timber company executives and tree-hugging commies who visit the park this year will be rotting in their graves in a hundred years but Yellowstone will endure in spite of us."},{"Title":"Mountain Time: A Yellowstone Memoir","review":"This is a wonderfully engaging book on life in one of natures wonders, Yellowstone National Park.

He is also very funny, largely because he is quite unable to take himself too seriously."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"Alan Wilson Watts (1915-1973) was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as a populariser of Eastern philosophy. He and his then-wife left England for America in 1938 on the eve of WWII, and he became an Episcopal priest---but he left the priesthood in 1950 and moved to California, where he became a cult figure in the Beat movement of the 1950s and later.He wrote in the Preface to this 1972 book, \\"I thought I had no business writing an autobiography, because I have been a sedentary and contemplative character... and also somewhat of a disreputable epicurean who has had three wives, seven children, and five grandchildren---and I cannot make up my mind whether I am confessing or boasting... It seemed to me, therefore, that I had no STORY to tell... But two women [his wife, and an editor] absolutely insisted that I write this tale...\\" (Pg. x)He argues, \\"To take sides in a modern, technological war is to take sides in a lunatic asylum... Call me a physical coward, a sissy, a nervous Nellie, a traitor, a deserter, a chicken, a worm, a slug, a salamander, or anything you like, but I have always used my ingenuity to stay out of these ridiculous uproars. I would rather exercise my manhood in bed with the ladies...\\" (Pg. 23)He admits, \\"I am an unrepentant sensualist. I am an immoderate lover of women and the delights of sexuality, of the greatest french, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine, of wines and spiritous drinks, of smoking cigars and pipes, of gardens, forests, and oceans, of jewels and paintings, of colorful clothes, and of finely bound and printed books.\\" (Pg. 54-55)He states, \\"I do not consider it intellectually respectable to be a partisan in matters of religion... Thus I am not formally a committed member of any creed or sect and hold no particular religious view or doctrine as absolute. I deplore missionary zeal... Yet my work and my life are fully concerned with religion, and the mystery of being is my supreme fascination, though, as a shameless mystic, I am more interested in religion as feeling and experience than as conception and theory.\\" (Pg. 72)He concludes, \\"If I would become more Christlike, I should remember that the Crusades and the Holy Inquisition were conducted in his name. If I would practice asceticism, I should bear it in mind that Hitler was quite an ascetic... If I would observe sobriety, I should recall that Bertrand Russell put down a fifth of whiskey daily, and if I would find it in myself to be chaste, I should ... twit myself that I once had the privilege of sharing a mistress with one of the holiest men in the land.\\" (Pg. 423)For anyone interested in Watts' spoken words and writings, this (somwhat elusive) book will be of great interest."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"This autobiography, published 1972, by Alan Wilson Watts, the expatriate British orientalist and philosopher, is a joy to read, a document of Watts' life, and a history of the 1960s counterculture.Watts early on evidenced a love for eastern philosophy. At the age of 20, he was already one of the major writers and thinkers on subjects such as Zen Buddhism and Taoism. He was a major exponent of the Zen outlook of Thou Art That.Watts, an unfrocked Episcopal priest, has often been derided (wrongfully) as a 'popularizer' of subjects more properly reserved for serious study and practice, and (more rightly) as sometimes glib and definitely irreverent. This book is a record of Watts' indulgence in the pleasures of the flesh with a high spiritual purpose.Watts wrote more than 20 books, and this is Watts at his irreverent best. Written with his tongue firmly jammed into his cheek, it is a compendium of a lifetime's worth of exuberant fun and learning for the joy of it.Watts gleefully recounts tales of spiritual masters with stomachaches, hidebound bishops drinking fine wines, and sexy women discovering their Buddha-nature.Nothing is too minor or too major for Watts's wit, and his reminiscences carry us from the bathroom of his childhood home in England to Canterbury Cathedral, from New York City to Big Sur, and touch on almost every major and many minor figures of the 1950s and 1960s.Watts unabashedly tells us that he finds his life intensely interesting. Anyone reading IN MY OWN WAY would agree."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"I didn't find this autobiography as appealing as many of the other flowery reviews. I like Alan Watts' philosophical pieces a lot, but there was something in the tone of his autobiography that was arrogant and misleading. His writing is beautiful, as usual, but there is lack of intimacy that I would have expected in a candid autobiography, especially from someone who claims to be a spiritual entertainer. The prose is sprinkled with reminders of how he realizes the ego is a fiction, and how he is enlightened in that sense. Which is fine, I suppose, but I thought the frequent reminders were a little unnecessary, or as he likes to put it, \\"putting legs on a snake.\\"More importantly, his recounting of his life completely lacks a sense of problems or misfortunes. Some people really do lack this, but from his biographies it is evident that Alan Watts did not. He does not (at the request of his father) talk about his relationship with his mother at all in the book, and he also does not discuss at all his alcoholism problems. He also does not discuss the sexual problems which led to his first marriage dissolving, and doesn't really explain why he divorced his second wife. I found this disappointing because he probably had a lot of wisdom to share about this. It also makes him seem less human. ...Despite all this, the autobiography is entertaining and definitely worth reading for anyone interested in an inside view of the counterculture movement. His reflections, though at times a little too confident, are still mostly interesting to read.However, I would recommend reading this book along with an objective biography like \\"Zen Effects- the Life of Alan Watts\\" to get a more balanced view on his life."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"Though I was skeptical when handed this book - I am neither into religion nor do I desire to have a hip-zen lifestyle in Southern California - I was immediately drawn in to the way this amazing man's life unfolded. Early on, he set out to be an independent intellectual, constantly learning and living in his \\"own way.\\" He succeeded, in spite of the odds, on the terms that he set out for himself. This was deeply inspiring to me, and it turned out that despite the surface differences of interest, Alan Watts had a lot to say about the choices one makes in life and how to go about living.The book is also filled with details that are as fascinating as they are hilarious. A friend of his youth made a pilgrimage to a famous and ancient monastery, which he discovered was \\"an elaborate homosexual organization.\\" Though he lacked a university degree, Watts was allowed to study at Northwestern, which he described as \\"the type of place where philosphers worked from 9 to 5.\\" Later, in LA, he hung out with Aldous Huxley, experimenting with hallucinogens, beating drums all night long, and listening to the incredible rhythm of that brilliant man's speech, which he says arrested all conversation in entire restaurants. The list goes on and on.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"In My Own Way: An Autobiography is the endlessly engrossing story of the persona, the public figure, of Alan Wilson Watts, who is sometimes referred to, and rightly so, as &quot;the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines,&quot; and Zen Buddhism in particular. It was not Alan's idea to write this book, as he candidly admits in the Preface to the book, since in his opinion he had not done anything worthy of recounting. &quot;I have not fought in wars, explored mountains and jungles, battled in politics, commanded great business corporations, or accumulated vast wealth. It seemed to me, therefore, that I had no story to tell as the world judges stories.&quot;It was only at the insistence of two women in his life, his publisher's editor, Paula McGuire, and his third wife, Mary Jane Yates, that he consented to write down the details of the making of Alan Watts. Along the way we meet the people who influenced Alan, who helped guide, shape, and direct his persona. And though he was influenced by many people in his life, whose works and ideas found their way into his many books, essays, and lectures, Alan possessed, all on his own, a certain knack or genius for getting at the essence of a theme or subject. And then he was able to effectively communicate that essence, using his abundant imagination, to his readers and listeners. And this not just for the highbrows in the audience, but for every class of person who picks up one of his books and proceeds to make the effort to understand the ideas and concepts he expresses. Alan's work was, if anything, accessible to the reader, whatever his level of interest.The title of this review, The Way I Came To Be, refers to the story that makes up the book. And so much of that story centers around the people Alan interacted with from whom he gathered the ideas, concepts and &quot;philosophy&quot; that he expoused. It's the inside story of how Alan Watts came to think and see things in the way he came to think and see them. And for this value alone the book is abundantly worth reading and re-reading.(From a personal point of interest, it fascinated and amazed me, at first reading several years ago, how much my own life paralleled and intersected the same aspects of cultivation as his life: an early interest in Eastern philosophy; being associated with and entering a Western religious order, Episcopal in his case and old Catholic in my own; an interest in the metaphysical rituals of religion; a background in meditation combined with a fascination with psychology and psychoanalysis; and an insight into the little talked about mystical aspects of Western religions and the thought to express the marriage between Western and Eastern mysticism.)In My Own Way is, in reality, an extension of Alan Watts' previous books in that it covers a lot of the same ground but with new stories of the people he lived with which provides additional insight into the concepts and ideas he wrote about.For instance, there is the passage that quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson from his famous essay on &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; in which Emerson is writing about the timelessness of things in nature, roses in this case, and how the roses &quot;make no reference to former roses or the better ones; they are for what they are....There is no time for them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence...But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past,or,...stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.&quot;And then Watts writes: &quot;Sokei-an Sasaki told me that reading this passage touched off his first experience of satori.&quot; Sokei-an Sasaki was one of the Zen masters with whom Watts studied. An alert reader, recognizing this fact, would be fascinated to learn about this passage which had such a profound effect upon a Zen master to see whether or not it could have the same effect on him. When one is on the path to self discovery, every little clue is valuable. And such clues as this, coming as it does from the experience of a Zen master, are especially invaluable.There are dozens and dozens of such moments of insight and clarity offered up in this autobiography that it makes it a joy to read.And if you are a careful reader, that is if you can read between the lines, you might even learn a thing or two about Alan Watts the man in addition to what you learn about his public facade. And herein lies the value of biography or autobiography and the reading of such, because the reader has the opportunity to gain a rare look at the inside workings of a fellow human being in order to learn and gain wisdom from that person's life which he can then apply to his own life.You may learn, for example, to recognize and avoid the fatal flaw in Alan's approach to life that took him out at such a relatively young age, fifty-eight. And I'm not referring here to the much discussed abuse of alcohol, although that undoubtedly was a contributing factor. But it was secondary, however, and not the primary factor which led to his early death. He does mention the reason once or twice, but it's so well camouflaged that most people will read right through it without recognizing its significance. I'll leave it to you, the reader of his autobiography, to come to your own conclusion.At any rate, suffice it to say that this book is a treasure trove of subtle wisdom, valuable perceptions, and fascinating stories of the development and coronation of one of Western civilization's most visible spiritual gurus."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"If you have any interest in Alan Watt's writing, you will enjoy reading his autobiography. He is a great storyteller and this book contains some of this most funny stories. I found myself laughing out loud in many sections.One of the most memorable stories for me was his recounting of a game he used to play called, \\"you are the target.\\" In this game, you shoot an arrow up in the air and measure how close it lands to you. This was done in the context of adolescent competition and Watts brings this spirit and fearlessness of youth alive.Alan Watts had a great sense of humor and was a deep thinker. He also had a gift for analogy and getting his points across with rich prose. This book represents some of his best writing in terms of vulnerability, openness and reflecting on his own life. It may or may not be very accurate, but it is certainly quite entertaining.I also found that this was a good book to get a sense of the context for various other books that Alan Watts wrote over the course of his life. I have found some to be better than others, but all of them to be useful in some ways.My favorite books by Alan Watts are the WAY OF ZEN, THE WISDOM OF INSECURITY and THE BOOK. Some of his later books, I found to be of lower quality, but he was in the zone when he wrote the three above. NATURE, MAN and WOMAN was also quite good and there is a lot of humor and deep insights throughout."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"I saw Alan Watts speak at Oklahoma University. Dressed in a suit, he began by saying that he usually war robes but said that \\"I'd been told I was going somewhere called 'Norman' in 'Oklahoma.'\\" He'd given a speech the night before and the head of the philosophy department had presented him with a list of 13 logical objections to his speech. He thought that was pretty funny and didn't even bother to reply. I recall thinking how humiliated I would be if I'd been that guy.Watts was my first introduction to Asian thought. As Buddhism became popular in America I began reading other authors who seemed to take it more seriously. For years I thought of Watts as a lightweight. When I picked up one of his essays a couple years ago I began thinking that really, his gift was his light heart.He lived quite a life. He was born in Victorian England and he died in psychedelic America. He was a sharp observer of the world and understood both places very well. He was wise enough to avoid taking an ideological position on religion. He was a guy who was way out there living life just as it was. Anyone intersted in a breezy history of the counterculture will find this book a fascinating read."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"This is a very readable autobiography by Alan Watts about his life from boyhood to influencial teacher of the early &quot;New Age Movement.&quot; He tells of his conflicts with Krishnamurti, Aldous Huxley and other famous friends as well as his expermentation with LSD. Alan Watts was educated at King's School, Canterbury which may explain how he became such a desiplined and clear writer. England's oldest prep school also produced writers such as Somerset Maugham and Hugh Walpole. An early conflict in his life was brought on by the idea of the commandment, &quot;You must love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart and all thy soul.&quot; How can one be commanded to love with ones heart, he thought! His journey was one of great production: &quot;The Way of Zen,&quot; &quot;Psychotherapy; East and West,&quot; etc. This book is a must for any serious student of the early Vedanta Movement in California started during World War II by Christopher Isherwood, W.H. Auden, Gerald Heard and others."},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"The unabashedly eclectic Alan Watts neither aspired to dogmatic purity nor engaged in academic nitpicking. He culls what he needs, mostly from the Oriental tradition, in order to construct a project of spiritual hedonism.Watts thinking and approach to life are emblematic of the 1960s,even though his quest began many years prior to that tumultuous decade. He rejects the transcendental God, super-ego and status quo, in favor of a spirituality of immanence and id. This coincided with the human potential movement, blossoming at that time.It is interesting to consider, however, how far the human potential movement in its latest incarnation - the new-age movement- diverged from the course laid down by Watts. For one thing, though he was a popularizer, Watts was undoubtedly an intellectual and would accept little or nothing as a matter of faith. The \\"New Age\\", on the other hand, seems to be intellectually vacuous. Like newagers, Watts did turn to the Orient for answeres. This may originally have been inspired by a sort of exoticism, but after having tried to frame his spirituality withinin the epicopalian faith (he became an ordained minister),Zen/taoism turned out to be the best vehicle for him.The New Age seems to have reconstructed a more Oriental God, who nonetheless resembles the fatherly God of their Catholic/Protestant parents. This God says \\"Thou Shalt\\" (although his rules are slightly different) and looks after his followers as a shepherd does for his flock. This takes many guises...the New Thought one, where if you supplicate to God and repeat enough affirmations, God, under the sobriquet of \\"the Universe\\" will grant you what you want...or the guru, in traditional costume or in his new thread as psychotherapist.Watts rejects all of this transcentalism. He accepts the notion of karma, becoming as one acts,(but not necessarily the new age conception of karma which clings to the idea of returning in a next life).On the one hand, the new age is either ascetic or it fully embraces hyperconsumersim. It is apparent throughout this biography that Watts rejects both of these paths. On the one hand, he does not envision the body as fallen spirit, but as part of the universe, hence part of God, and to be celebrated.This is to be done through wine, food, sex and many other ways.On the other hand, he is wary of the money game, and a blind pursuit of things.This was my first reading of Watts, though I had listened to a few of his recorded lectures. I shall read more. I am particularly interested in understanding this question of the \\"illusion of the ego\\", in comparison with concept of the individual from the point of view of cartesianism or postmodernism.Apart from those concerns, it was an enjoyable read. I found the first 50 pages, concerned with his childhood, to be a bit slow, but after that it was a real page-turner.Thomas"},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"In My Own Way by good old Alan was a fantastically joyful experience, and I am still not quite at the end, although I have sneak-peaked at what the end is about, so I am convinced the last chapter will be just as fulfilling.In the beginning of the book, Watts points out that in a biography there is basically two stances that the writer can take; either he/she boasts or confesses - that was not what our spiritual entertainer had in mind, even though, as he states in the book, he has of course had some wonderfully satisfying experiences at, and made even more enjoyable with, the expense of stuffy people. What I am trying to say here is that this book is not the ordinary autobiography at all, and that if you are expecting a very detailed and honest insight to his life, like a confession or a pompous description of himself, this book will disappoint you greatly. Although he lets out a few hints of his character at times, there is more of his always charming and complex descriptions of his experiences with places and people that impressed upon him more than usual. If anything is to be said about his philosophy within this book, I think it is safe to conclude that this book contains a large collection of his most profoundly written work, delivered within very short bursts, so naturally this book requires you to have heard some of his lectures and or read his other books before you delve into this one. He does not explain it very thoroughly, because it is his glimpses, and once again he most definitely wrote this in the assumption that you have been involved in his work before.The only negative remarks I can contrive about this book is that it, at times, becomes somewhat uninteresting - but I am fully prepared to admit that that is because I have not yet the mindset to fully grasp his mumbling about detailed flower-types et cetera. This book was written by a man in his late 50's, and at the age of 17, I think, there is still a lot to be found in his work, which is why I always pay more and more attention to his work as I go my way; in Alan's work there are several layers, whether he planned that to be or not. Some of the layers you discover within the book or in his other work might even be your extended philosophy with his as the basis, so give yourself some credit when this happens! What I meant by uninteresting, was that he, as is obvious, because anything that is uninteresting to you is uninteresting for the very reason that it is uninteresting, writes about things that become quite lengthy and incomprehensible at times (for me who does not have the interest to go back and read it several times, but rest I am certain I will some time). But, however, these things that he writes of is probably the knowledge of a man who had really understood that it was his own life, and his interests were his universe; his playground. It is up to others if they want to hop in the sandbox and join in or go to church and whatnot.Overall, this is a very witty and humorous book, describing only in elaborate detail his encounters with other famous philosophers and artists, and the dialogue between them of which he has a very good recollection. Enjoy In My Own Way, and even though I did not like parts of the book, there is a subtle feeling in me which tells me that I will at some point, which is why I gave this book five stars. I hope this book becomes a prominent influence In Your Way, as it did me!"},{"Title":"In My Own Way an Autobiography","review":"After hearing Alan Watts' audio lectures I became fascinated with his interpretation of world religions, especially Zen Buddhism, and Christianity. In My Own Way reveals how Alan Watts studied immensely the religions of the world, philosophy, psychology and astrology, even experimenting with LSD. Alan Watts also explained that his autobiography could not be done without mentioning friends whom helped him cultivate his knowledge. Alan Watts' friends consisted of a who's who list ranging from gurus to famous writers such as Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and Krishnamurti (just to name a few). Many of these famous gurus and authors inspired Alan Watt's writings either directly or indirectly. As when Alan Watts mentioned that he wrote The Joyous Cosmology following his contemporaries, namely Aldous Huxley who release his account with LSD and wrote The Doors of Perception, which inspired Watts' LSD induced book.I was surprised that Alan Watts doesn't credit any specific revelation to his awaking. Perhaps this is why Alan Watts professed to be a genuine fake. In fake meaning he felt in-touch with enlightenment yet chose to play the human game without coming off as holier than thou as most religious peoples do. Sadly this meant that he was also fond of smoking, drinking and other vices. Another gaping misfortune in the book is that Alan Watts seldom mentions his family, wives briefly, and children even less so. Alan Watts even claimed that he didn't feel a connection with his children, nor young children in general.Overall the book gives a well written account of Alan Watts' life from a positive light. Alan Watts is very detailed in his writings and paints vivid pictures of the scenery of places he has traveled and the people he has met. He does this all the while keeping true to narrating his autobiography (keeping religious and philosophical digressions to a minimum)."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"I was a little surprised at the reviewer who thought that the quality of this series was not up to the Pitt and Wolf series. My opinion is that it's quite the opposite. I have enjoyed Perry's earlier works but considered them a little lightweight. This WWI series is anything but. I think the author wrestles admirably with some timeless issues - war, is it ever justified, at what cost? does God exist? if he/she does, what difference does it make? etc. I love the characters and have gotten great benefit out of the general philosophical debates. True, the 'mysteries' in this series are not terribly compelling (who is the Peacemaker? Who killed the scientist?), but that is such a tangential part of the series that I would not fault her for that. I am very much looking forward to the next installment. I think this represents the author's best effort yet."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Anne Perry continues even at this late date to mystify for all the right reasons. Not content to rest on the laurels of her two historical mystery series --- one featuring William Monk, the other concerning Charlotte and Thomas Pitt --- she introduced a third that has become known as the World War I novels. ANGELS IN THE GLOOM, the third of this fine series after NO GRAVES AS YET and SHOULDER THE SKY, continues the saga of the Reavley family, or specifically the Reavley siblings ---Joseph, Matthew, Judith and Hannah --- all of whom are involved in primary or secondary roles in the British military effort during the early days of World War I.While these tales are primarily mysteries, Perry delves into war and romance as well. Indeed, Perry's powers of description are fully revealed in ANGELS IN THE GLOOM, as her descriptions of war on land and sea are so realistic and riveting that they almost overshadow the plotlines they support. The primary mystery in this series continues to revolve around a powerful, shadowy figure known as The Peacemaker, who is determined that the hostilities will end quickly, even if it means the ultimate subjugation of Great Britain to Germany. His machinations have already caused the death of the Reavleys' parents, giving them dual reasons --- revenge and patriotism --- for bringing his actions to an end.In the meantime Joseph, on leave to home after sustaining grievous wounds on the front lines while pursuing his duties as a chaplain, finds himself embroiled in a murder mystery when Theo Blaine is found brutally murdered in his own backyard. Blaine had been instrumental in the creation and development of a new, top-secret weapon that is certain to turn the tide of the war in Britain's favor, and his death prior to the completion of the project is potentially a lethal blow not only to the weapon but also to the war effort. There is no lack of suspects for the murder --- everyone from a clandestine German spy to Blaine's own wife is under suspicion --- and Joseph soon finds that his role of priestly confessor makes him privy to a number of village secrets that he would rather not know. Joseph is also torn as to whether his duty lies in ministering to the needs of the village citizens reeling from their personal wartime losses, or whether he should resume his post on the front.Meanwhile, Matthew pursues his own espionage, working uneasily with an attractive double agent to whom he is feeling an unwelcome but undeniable attraction, even as he knows that her ties to the enemy doom any involvement he might otherwise entertain. Hannah, Matthew and Joseph's sister, maintains a somewhat passive role, caring for Joseph as he recovers from his wounds while at the same time tending the home fires as her husband Archie is involved in Britain's naval effort.If anyone in the family receives short shrift in ANGELS IN THE GLOOM, it is Judith, still performing the dangerous but important work of driving an ambulance in the thick of combat on the European front. Rather, the focus is on David, who finds that the fate of a family friend depends entirely on him, and Matthew, who in the heat of battle discovers at long last the identity of The Peacemaker and has the opportunity to avenge the wrong and heartbreak done to his family.The World War I series is arguably Perry's most ambitious work, painted upon a broad canvas that encompasses wartime England, the European front, and the war-ravaged Atlantic where England's maritime supremacy is challenged and rises to meet its penultimate test. While The Peacemaker plot, which has been the thread connecting the first three novels of this series, is ultimately resolved in ANGELS IN THE GLOOM, Perry could certainly take the series in a number of other directions. If her fans have any say in the matter, her World War I series undoubtedly will live on.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"We get to know Hannah and Archie better, and have an excellentmurder mystery, along with a great sea battle. I couldn't putthe book down, and am distressed that I'll have to wait (a year?)for the next one."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"I thought I had written a review about this book, but found out I hadn't. I've been reading so much about WWI both nonfictional and fictional, that I am getting behind. I am really enjoying these particular novels of Anne Perry. I've read some of her other mysteries, and though they are often good and interesting, she has not been one of my favorite authors for books that I read for enjoyment.Perry is weaving a series about a family whose lives are altered not only by the war, but also the death of the parents of the family. The parents were murdered, and the now grown-up children of the family are not only dealing with their own families and their service to their country in the war, but they are trying to determine who killed their parents, who were apparently on to someone in British government who was trying to bring peace to the world in such a way as to force democratic countries like England and the U.S. to give up the freedoms we take so much for granted.This particular book is about three or four books into the series and should not be read until the first ones are read. The reader will be confused if they don't know the background to the whole story. One of the main characters is a brother who chose to go into the ministry and then served overseas during the war. I cannot begin to imagine the horrors that chaplains had to deal with then, how to comfort those young men who were dying far away from home and from their families, trying to give courage to those who needed it when the war seemed so senseless and knowing the generals behind the lines were making stupid decisions.The chaplain ends up wounded and goes home on leave. He's fed up with the war and wants to stay home with his sister and her children, and his parishioners but knows that the young men serving in France and Belgium need him. In the midst of all this, someone who is serving the war effort by creating some type of naval weapon like radar, that would serve to end the war is murdered, and again, the suspected murderer is someone called \\"The Peacemaker\\" who wants peace over freedom, and it seems he is involved with people who are high up in Germany's government. It's a bit confusing with these books, because there are so many different threads of stories going through them, it's hard to separate them all. Sometimes, it seems Perry is not keeping track of all the different story lines, but the plots are still well-done and interesting. For those of us who have studied European history, we know how closely related all the royal families were...the Germans were cousins of the British royalty, and all of them were related to the Tsars in Russia.WWI was a horrific war, one that was or seemed to be worse than usual because of the use of trench warfare and chemical weapons, and the disregard of generals for the lives of all the young men sent out to perish. We need to be reminded of what these gallant people did, both the men who served in the war, and the British who stayed at home and supported them. I'm so glad my son will not have to be involved in something like this, but I am grateful for the freedom that we have, which was paid for so dearly at this time.Karen SAdler"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"In March 1916 in the icy mud that separated the trenches, several British soldiers raided the nearby German forces; two failed to return with one dead, but the other Tucky Nann apparently is alive. Protestant chaplain Captain Joseph Reavley finds the badly injured Tucky and moves him to bring him safely to his side. However, before he can make it, a shell exploded nearby sending Joseph into severe pain and immediately thereafter unconsciousness.He awakens with a horrendous headache and other pain as Surgeon Cavan explains he has a broken arm, a badly injured leg and lost plenty of blood. He is sent to his Cambridgeshire hometown for surgery and recuperation. However, rest is not what Joseph will find as he soon becomes embroiled in trying to stop the diabolically clever plot of the Peacemaker to forge an Anglo-German Empire that would dominate the world for centuries.ANGELS IN THE GLOOM is a fabulous historical thriller that is at its best on the not so quiet Western Front as readers taste the horrific conditions that the soldiers faced during the trench warfare. When the tale returns to idyllic Cambridgeshire and the London nightlife, it remains quite intriguing with the comparison between those at home enjoying nightclubs and those at the front or like dedicated Joseph recovering from war injuries. As the story line twists into a murder mystery with a conspiratorial twist, the plot remains exciting and action-packed but loses some of its grittiness. Still Anne Perry provides a fine World War I tale with her latest Reavley caper.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Angels in the Gloom continues the saga of the Reavley family and the deaths of their parents, the mystery of a treaty that could have changed the course of history, and graphic scenes of WWI front lines.

Mrs. Perry is an expert in the history of the Victorian Era and the era of WWI. Everything is succinct and not a word frivolously wasted.This new series is as satisfying as her other works.Makes me think of Wilfred Owens' poetry about England at war -touches the heart and puts you in the trenches with the poor soldiers and the staff.One hopes Mrs. Perry doesn't forget Monk and Pitt series - while developing this excellent series."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Anne Perry is amazingly able to create a timescape - she does that in all her series - this one is no exception. While I like the plot what I love is the feeling of stepping back into the 2nd decade of the last century. I have studied WWII but WWI is a tragedy I wasn't as familiar with. The whole episode was truly heartbreaking, it took and changed so many lives. It also changed the entire fabric of British society and this is well illustrated. Reading novels of quality can give a sense of perspective that factual history book do not. This series does that very well."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Anne Perry has hit her stride in the third volume of her First World War series with \\"Angels in the Gloom\\". She has concocted an intricate narrative that covers enormous ground,managing to enlist a vast array of characters in the process. No need to recap the story here, as others commenting here have done it well. What is important is the fine quality of research she has done on this period, and the way she is able to incorporate this into her plot. When she writes well, it can be stunning, and she keeps the reader turning the pages. What holds her back from being a really five star writer is a certain propensity for repeating herself. Too many times she uses the same descriptive adjectives to depict a recurring situation. For instance, in \\"Shoulder the Sky\\" several characters return to London after absences at the front lines in France. They all notice that there are now far more cars than horses in Piccadilly. A nice observation, but we don't need to read it several times in a row. She needs a better editor, one that would pick up on these details. I make a point of this, because it makes me think she writes in haste. She is far too good a writer to allow this type of oversight. I like her atmospheric touches, and her sensitivity to nature. Her battle scenes are not easy to read, but she is often at her best in these passages. In sum, this is an engrossing story, worth the effort, even with the excesses."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Angels in the Gloom is an excellent book from the standpoint of history. This gripping tale of the Reavley family of England in 1916 at the height of WWI, graphically describes the horrors of war and their effect on the folks at home as well as the soldiers at the front (the French lost a generation of young men in the killing fields of Flanders, along with millions of soldiers and many civilians of the other nations involved).In this third book in Perry's WWI series, we see the effects of war on the village of St. Giles and its citizens. It is truly a wonder how the human spirit manages to recover from the horrors brought on by the pain and suffering of war. However, peace at any cost can be just as bad, if not worse. This is the essence of the battle of minds in this story (and in all stories of war).Joseph Reavley is seriously injured and is sent home to St. Giles to recover. His sister, Hannah MacAllister, married to a British naval officer (Archie), is there to nurse him. The Reavleys are still reeling from the murder of their parents, John and Alys, by The Peacemaker, and they continue to seek him. Shanley Corcoran, long-time family friend and best friend of John, and his group of scientists are trying to develop a torpedo guidance system that will allow the British navy to destroy the U-boats that ravage the ships plying the waters between America and Great Britain. The Americans, though not in the war at this time, are attempting to send much-needed munitions and supplies to Britain to help in their effort against Germany and its allies. However, ships are being sabotaged at sea with smoke bombs placed in their cargo holds and set to go off during transit. The captains of the ships than have to flood the holds to destroy what they believe to be real bombs, destroying the munitions in the process. Matthew Reavley is in the intelligence business and is attempting to get information from Irish double agent Detta Hannassey in order to stop the sabotage.While I enjoyed most of this book, I had trouble with a couple things. I wondered why the author bothered with journalist Richard Mason, who disappeared from the story after his meeting with Trotsky. His attentions toward Judith Reavley (the ambulance-driving sister) were intriguing, but also, disappointingly, went nowhere (perhaps Perry plans to pick up on it in the next installment). I also found the handling of the Peacemaker a bit irksome and his ultimate end a bit confusing, while the outcome of events involving the Scientific Establishment was entirely predictable.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"\\"ANGELS IN THE GLOOM\\" is book #3 in Anne Perry's ambitious 5 part WWI series.

The author's description of war on the Western Front is so vividly described that the reader feels as if he/she is present in the trenches. The development of all the characters, especially the Reavley family, is brilliant and, after accompanying these people on so many adventures, I have come to care for them deeply. The ongoing espionage, and the perpetrators involved, provide an added attraction which builds tension and drama.\\"ANGELS IN THE GLOOM\\" finds Captain Joseph Reavley, chaplain and former Cambridge professor, ministering to the wounded and dying in the thick of trench warfare on the Western Front, the Ypres Salient in Belgium - a job he has been doing since the war started in 1914. It is now 1916, and Matthew Reavley, Joseph's younger brother, a member of England's Secret Intelligence Service, (SIS), is fighting the war covertly from London, desperately trying to find the identities of the \\"Peacemaker,\\" and his treacherous minions, before they can implement their lethal schemes. Twenty-six year-old Judith Reavley, Joseph's and Matthew's youngest sister, is a volunteer ambulance driver and amateur nurse when needed. She serves on the frontline battlefields and has been at this bloody task since 1914, risking her life on more than a few occasions. Only Hannah, living with her children in the family home in Cambridgeshire, seems safe, although her husband, Archie MacAllister, is a Commander in the Royal Navy and always in harm's way.While trying to save another soldier's life, Joseph is severely wounded, in fact, he is so badly injured that he must return home to St. Giles to recover. He joins Hannah and her two children at the large Reavley home where she nurses him back to health. St. Giles, once a bucolic and peaceful place, is filled with grieving families, mourning the losses of brothers, sons and husbands. Shanley Corcoran, an old school friend, comes to visit Joseph. Corcoran heads a team of scientists working at the local research facility. They are in the process of inventing a new torpedo, a missile that would track U-boats with more accuracy - \\"which could change course, if needed, search out a U-boat through the water and explode when it strikes.\\" If successful, this invention could end the war quickly, and save England, especially if the United States doesn't join the war. But when the lead scientist on the project is killed, the chances of success dim. Now the town is rife with fears of spies and treachery.A prototype of the device is eventually built and set to be tested on the destroyer \\"Cormorant,\\" commanded by Hannah's husband. Matthew Reavley has been selected to go along on the voyage to try and draw out and capture a German spy. In a thrilling episode, during the Battle of Jutland, Mathew finally confronts the man he believes to be the Peacemaker... and almost loses his life in the process.Subplots abound, including one which surrounds a beautiful Irish spy who becomes involved with Matthew. Both are aware of each others' work and accept the inevitability of their doomed romance. I quickly became absorbed in each of the series mysteries, except for book #1. The author manages to grab the reader and pull him/her along into another time and place. \\"Angels In The Gloom\\" is a terrific read.

I have read the first three, I don't think I care enough about the main storyline to buy the last two."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Another powerful entry in Anne Perry's Reavlry-WWI mystery series.It's March of 1916, the war is still raging on and England and her allies are experiencing enormous losses and facing, for the first time, the realisation that they may lose the war. If only America, with all her abundant resources would join in... But in the meantime, the Reavlry brothers, Joseph and Matthew, continue with their determined hunt for the Peacemaker, a powerful and dangerous foe who is repsonsible for their parents murder and who has a mad scheme to bring about a peace between England and Germany that would only tarnish England's honour with her current allies.Joseph, however, soon finds himself once again in the quiet countryside of Cambridgeshire, when he gets injured while trying to rescue a soldier from no man's land. Once home again, Joseph finds himself, unexpectedly, couseling a very inept vicar as well as providing comfort for the many women of the village who have lost their husbands and sons. That is until a weapons scientist, Theo Blaine, is found brutally and viciously murdered in his garden. Rumours run rampant that there is a German spy in the village and the he has murdered Blaine in order to stop the work he was doing. But, while assissting the police in their investigations, Joseph discovers that Blaine was a man with quite a few secrets. Was Blaine murdered by a spy or was he murdered because of his secrets? Once again, Joseph finds himself in the middle of a perplexing murder investigation...\\"Angels in the Gloom\\" truly was a riveting read. The storyline was divided into two subplots -- one dealing with brother Matthew's efforts to thwart the nefarious schemes of a beautiful Irish spy who is in league with the Peacemaker, and the other to do with Joseph's hunt for Blaine's murderer. Both are very well done and full of suspense and intrigue. But what really made this novel a fantastic read was how Anne Perry developed the motif of the women who were left behind -- the wives and mothers who faced the fears that they would never see their menfolk again and the hurt they felt over the fact that their husbands were keeping part of themselves from them. And this was mavellously encapsulated in the manner in which Perry depicted what Hannah, the married Reavlry sister experienced. Her confusion over the way things were changing socially as well as the anguish and resentment she felt because her family would keep things secret from her. And it was this heart-rendering motif that made \\"Angels in the Gloom\\" something out of the ordinary and well worth recommending as an excellent read."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"It too long - I think it sat in the Post Office for a week before they put it in my mail boxGee"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"I just found this out yesterday and it might add a new dimension to your reading while enjoying Anne Perry novels.

I have enjoyed her both her Pitt and Monk novels, but this series seems almost to be by a different author. I find the style in which she 'hides' the identity of the Peacekeeper and his associates to be particularly annoying. The action seems to consist of people driving back and forth, and thinking, and changing their minds, and thinking more. There does not seem to be much investigating- just suspecting someone for a while, then suspecing someone else."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Perry's word pictures contrast WWI home-front/battle-front with remarkable versimilitude (I guess). Her plot line stretches to the vanishing point over three, going on five, novels, however."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"After reading the previous two novels in this series by Anne Perry, I knew that I had to keep going, despite the general grimness and despair of the setting. After all, reading about life in the trenches of Belgium during World War I is not exactly a cheerful topic. But under the careful plotting of Anne Perry, best known for her ongoing mystery series set in Victorian England, I knew that I was in for some serious storytelling, and a mystery that would be certain not to leave me going eh! at the end.The year is now 1916, and for three long years, Captain Joseph Reavley has been trying to give what comfort and aid to the men that serve with him in the British army. Forbidden to carry arms as a chaplain himself, he does what he can to save lives, and often risks his own to rescue the injured in the devastated no-man's-land beyond the trenches. But during one such rescue, he's badly wounded, enough to send him back home to convalesence.Back home in the Cambridgeshire village that he grew up in, Joseph is continually reminded of the grim accident that resulted in the death of his parents. Carefully, he tries to gain some sort of meaning and balance back into his life, under the caring watch of his sister Hannah and her three children. Hannah has plenty of problems of her own, coping with the fact that her husband, a naval commander, serving aboard a destroyer at sea. We see through their eyes the terrible toll that the war is taking on the families around them, even in this pastoral setting.Sons and husbands and brothers are missing or wounded or dead. The local vicar, Hallam Kerr, is quickly losing his faith and can't comfort anyone, always turning up on Joseph's doorstep in a blithering wreck. After only a few days home, Joseph has a dead body turn up nearby, shattering whatever peace he's managed to find.Theo Blaine, a young scientist working at The Establishment, where a mystery weapon that will win the war for the Allies, is found brutally killed. His body has been badly mauled with a hay fork, and he is found by his wife, Lizzie, after the couple had an argument. There are very few leads, but everyone suspects that it must have been a German spy. Old tensions and rivalries spring up the village.Which in turn leads to the other main plot of the story. Joseph and Hannah's brother Matthew is a member of the Intellegence Services in London. He's managed to find a double agent, Detta Hannasey, and he's trying to uncover who is behind tampered supplies from the Americans, and ruthlessly using Detta to uncover who is behind it all. The fact that Detta is a lovely and attractive young Irish woman doesn't hurt either, and despite his best efforts to distance himself, Matthew keeps finding himself attracted to her.Even more shocking, Detta might have a connection with the mysterious Peacemaker, who seeks an Anglo-German alliance that will bring the world under the control of a domineering Kaiser. And who was responsible for the murder of John and Alys Reavley...How all of this resolves itself is the main focus of the novel. Of course, we get to learn little more about who is the Peacemaker, but that plotline is a bit overshadowed this time. Instead, the two plots weave together nicely with plenty of real life details and introspection. Not only can Perry catch the mood of the time and place, she manages to keep the mental attitudes right for the times. Hannah finds the new role of women fitting into men's work and roles during the war frightening to face; Joseph questions his reputation for heroism and bravery, and Matthew has to decide how much and how far he will use another human being, a woman, to further the Allied win. This delicate dance of morality comes through in people's speech and their thoughts, but Perry is wise enough not to let the story bog down too far.Another excellent touch is the use of real events. There is the Battle of Jutland to climax the novel, an aerial bombing of London from German zepplins, the Easter Uprising in Dublin, and other little snippets that give the story a solid base in history. It's an excellent touch that really helps to move the story along, and the feel of the war that changed the world forever. My only real complaint about this entry in the series is that the villain is revealed in a sort of deus ex machina fashion, and there wasn't enough clues or foreshadowing given to let the reader figure it out -- suddenly, the killer is revealed and I was left thinking Huh? Where did that come from? Other than that, it's an excellent read.Several characters from previous novels appear, most notably Richard Mason from Shoulder the Sky, but alas, Judith, the fourth Reavley sibling isn't here at all. That's a pity, as she's one of the best characters that Perry has created.Summing up, this one is worth the effort to get through, despite all of the grim details and at times, slow pace. It's a novel that not just re-creates a time of great suffering and courage, but also strives to put the reader inside of the character's heads. It's pretty obvious from this one that Perry feels strongly about this series, and it does have a beginning and end in sight, unlike her other mystery series. If the reader can handle the somewhat gory sequences that appear, it's a fine read, and certain to stir some serious thoughts in the reader's mind.The trade paperback edition has an excerpt from the next book in the series, At Some Disputed Barricade. As with all of the books in this series, it's really necessary to read them in order, as many characters and events appear in the earlier volumes, and little space is given to backing things up and explaining.Four stars overall."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Although I love Anne Perry's books and the characters she has fashioned out of Victorian life, this series is particularly meaningful for me. I had an aunt (who I never knew) who was a Red Cross nurse in France in WWI. Family history tells that she was never the same when she came back. The Reavely series gives me an insight into the dangers, terrors, discomforts and deprivations my aunt had to have suffered while nursing in France. Bravo Ms. Perry!"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"I think Ms. Perry's latest volume in this series is excellent. Her characters are more deeply developed than in her mysteries, and they are believeable people with real and important problems. I hope Ms Perry continues to write about them. It's great that she's writing novels as well as mysteries."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"I liked this book much better than her other series books. Some of the reasons I abandoned her as an author, over moralizing and introspection, glacial plot, and veiled all-knowing bad guys; work in this book to illuminate the insanity of the times. Although I would not be in favor of the Anglo-German world empire that the supposed bad guy is trying to see established, he at least is trying to stop the slaughter or suicide of a generation of English males, so appears to modern reads as somewhat sympatric. This really was a time of mass insanity, if that is to be defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The British high command was particularly insane as were the French. It is worth noting that in 1916 the average life expectancy of a British infantryman was 4 months. The Somme campaign that year some saw daily butchers bills such as the Royal Newfoundland Regiment that went forward as the second wave on the first day. Of the 780 men who went over the top that morning only 68 were able to answer role call the next morning. Verdun is the epitome of pointless butchery. How such a war could have drawn the nave British public into its conflagration needs to be clearly examined in historical accounts and fiction such as Anne Perry's books.I found the interplay of the village vicar and the chaplain to be particularly well done. The interplay of the Irish nationalist as a German agent and the British intelligence officer also illuminates the complexity for the times and divides sympathies, at least for American readers, yet again. The plot itself is really just there to add loose structure to what is more a mood and character piece of writing. The secret device around which the actions revolve is plainly ridiculous for the technology of the times but limps along as a plot device to bring in the battle of Jutland.A much better written series of books about Brittan during and after the Great War is to be found in the Maisie Dobbs books by Jacqueline Winspear. These again are mysteries but much tighter in the writing and realistic in plot while still giving a deep sense of time and place."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"It was not as good as the previous books in the series, still I enjoyed the continuing saga of this WWI era British family. Mainly, I love the whole atmosphere of the War years in Europe...... sort of nostalgic I suppose. Anne Perry is excellent when it comes to take you back in time."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"This is such a very powerful series, and with her writing, it's almost as though Ms. Perry has experienced World War I herself. In this book she gives as fine an example of a navy battle that you'll read anywhere. But not only that; readers also get a glimpse into what this war did to people and to their emotions, as well as what it did to everyone touched by it(which includes family and friends back home). And to top all of this off, there is a top-notch mystery to be solved within the pages of this book. This is the third book in this series about the Reavely family. We do get to know the older daughter Hannah much better in this book, but there is little in the book about the younger daughter Judith in it. Joseph Reavely, the chaplain, has been injured out of the army for a time, so he is sent back home to recover. Most of the action takes place in the Reavely hometown of St. Giles. But even here, far from the front lines, the effects of this terrible war are felt very keenly. Ms. Perry does a masterful job of showing us just what it was like for those left at home while their sons, husbands, brothers and/or frineds were on the front lines. I cannot stress enough how important and wonderful this series is, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in some World War I history, or in someone who is a student of human nature."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"It does not matter to me - the title, subject, or look-of-a-book by one of the greatest authors of our time, Ms. Anne Perry. What matters is that I know as a retired criminal attorney and author myself, that I am going to get the absolute best that great literature has to offer. And this latest masterpiece, Angels In The Gloom, is no exception. Ms. Perry has utterly transcended the genre of mystery by bringing to the fore, world-wide issues concerning all of humanity that once again span the good versus evil dymanic amid forces of pyschology, metaphysics, religion, faith-or-no-faith, history, economics, morality, philosophy, law - and, of cousrse, poetry.

I was compelled to read it whenever I could. I think the style of writing in the WW1 series is more to my liking. Ms. Perry explores some difficult life questions through her varied characters, and yes, the element of mystery is certainly there. I am looking forward to the next in the series, Shoulder the Sky."},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","review":"Chaplain Joseph Reavley carries one more injured man back from \\"no man's land\\" after a battle, and this time he finds himself badly wounded. So Joseph spends most of this third novel in Anne Perry's World War I series at home in the village of St. Giles, recuperating under the care of his sister Hannah. Hannah, the most like their mother of the four adult Reavley siblings, keeps the family home running and cares for her children and worries about her husband, Archie, captain of a Royal Navy destroyer. Meanwhile, ambulance driver Judith continues her work in France; and intelligence officer Matthew continues his delicate dance with an Irish agent to keep her organization believing that his has yet to break the Irish codes. Not far away from St. Giles, Shanley Corcoran - murdered John Reavley's closest friend, and Joseph's godfather - leads a research team in a desperate race to invent technology that can win the war for either Britain or Germany. Depending on whether or not a suspected spy on Corcoran's team passes the invention on to his handlers as soon as it's completed. That situation turns into a crisis when one of Corcoran's scientists is murdered, and Joseph once again finds himself forced into the role of detective.The nature and value of faith in God, especially as it relates (or fails to relate) to human beings facing the horrors and losses of war, has been a constant theme in this series; but in this book it really comes into its own. Joseph finds that the safe, certain existence of the home front offers no refuge from challenges to his faith; nor does it give him a respite from ministering, as best he can, to people who desperately need him. Should he stay in St. Giles, or should he return to the front and the men with whom he has served since the war's beginning? He agonizes over that question even as he puzzles over finding the murderer who may well live in his village, and be someone he and his family both know and trust. Matthew, meanwhile, pursues both the spy in Shanley Corcoran's research team and the shadowy figure nicknamed the Peacemaker - the man responsible for murdering the Reavley parents.A winning combination of vividly written adventure and thoughtful exploration of the human soul's reaction to the incredible stresses of war. Meticulously accurate as to time and place, but timeless as far as war's effect on human beings is concerned.--Reviewed by Nina M.

As a former college professor and scientific researcher, the \\"footnotes,\\" collected at the end of the book, that direct the enthusiastic reader to further references, swayed my judgment. The penetrating questions and more sources in the book's Study Guide, matched with each of the ten Sessions, challenge even the most percipient reader to contemplate the verse of the Beatitudes according to Saint Matthew just covered.The book is very accessible and a compelling read. Reverend Lucado employs a narrative style and strong figurative language to create unforgettable images - metaphors, similes and puns punctuate his anecdotes that all can relate to. Without proselytizing, the minister imaginatively explicates the paradoxes and jarring hyperboles that comprise the Beatitudes. He invites the reader of The Applause of Heaven to a preview of the eternal blessing of unbounded joy promised to the believer in the Kingdom of God. Whether, as a drunk, one uses the lamppost for support or to find ones way, this book guides one on the path to meet with Jesus on the Mount.

Before you know it, your appointed arrival time will come; you'll descend the ramp and enter the City.You'll see faces that are waiting for you. You'll hear your name spoken by those who love you. And, maybe, just maybe--in the back, behind the crowds--the One who would rather die than live without you will remove his heavenly robe and . . . applaud.My goodness, what an ending. It made me excited about going home.:)"},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"This is a good book by Lucado. Uses his family and experiences to show the Christian faith anld how it works. Was not sure if I would like this type of book because I normally read theology rather than stories, but it was a book well worth reading.J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\""},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"I finally finished Lucado's The Applesauce of Heaven. In this book, Max takes a close look at each of the Beatitudes listed in the Bible (found in Matthew 5). Each chapter focuses on one Beatitude. I have read many of Max Lucado's books, and although I did not immerse myself in this book like I usually do with his writings, I still found myself relating more to this passage of the Bible than I ever have before. Lucado makes the Bible extremely relatable and he did not let me down with The Applesauce of Heaven. Max Lucado is an amazing writer who is able to ignite passion in my heart, understanding in my mind, and a stronger sense of peace in my soul.I was thrilled when I found this as a free nook book. So much so, I made sure to pass the deal onto several of my other close nook owning friends.[...]"},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"My husband liked the book. The kindle was his birthday gift so he downloaded anything free to read. This was one of his choices. So far, he has enjoyed most of his books."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"I am big fan of Max Lucardos' books for many years. This book the Applause of Heaven was also a mightly blessing from the Lord. What can I say? I believe every Christian would recieve great blessings from reading this beautiful book. It will deepen your relationship with Jesus and bring you closer to Him. It is a beautifully written book, as you would expect from Max Lucardo, one of the world's greatest Christian authors in my opinion.I can't recommend this enough."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"It was an easy, short, and uplifting read. Great book for reflection which we all need from time to time."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"This author has an extraordianry writing style. He crafts words precisely as a person would speak in a casual yet striking conversation. He's living proof that sometimes less is more. His word selection lights up the pages--eye-catching metaphors, succinct but deep messages, contemporary language and phraseology--and a great grasp of knowing when to stop. When you combine this exceptional writing style with deep, substantive and meaningful messages you develop an outstanding book. The value of the messages doesn't overwhelm you--it provides a sense of relief that you just might have the ability to embrace the messages and put them to work in your life and realize a positive impact.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"Yes I have read this book. Thanks to God for working through Max Lucado, my family and I, who were estranged for three years, are now back together and closer than ever. We quarrled over something trival, and we each wanted to be right. When I read chapter 11, about mercy, my eyes were opened to the fact that did I want to be right, or did I want my family. Thank you Max. I cried when I realized how many years I had missed with my parents. I thank God for you and your words. Through your words God brought my parents and I back together, without any of the hurtful memories anymore."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"The Applause of heaven made me cry and laugh in Joy. Max Lucado describes times when he is writing that &quot;The soft slap of sandaled feet will break the stillness, a pierced hand will extend a quiet invitation, and I will follow&quot;. Max takes you the reader along with him in his walk and talk with Jesus! What a priviledge."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"I have read this book at least 5 times. Without a doubt this book has the happiest ending a story could ever have!"},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"I can't count the number of times I've read and re-read the beatitudes and come away with nothing more than a feeling of emptiness. Much like the banal dronings of Polonoius in Hamlet. Through Max Lucado's eyes, I have seen them anew! They represent a blueprint for life. Lucado's style is warm and friendly. By bringing you into events of his own life, he puts tough theological concepts into crystal clear imagery."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"Great book. Purchased for a bible study group discussion. Everyone is enjoying reviewing the beautitudes."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"I read this several years ago, and just read it again. It is a great book over the beattitudes. Max Lucado does a great job of teaching through stories and this book is no exception. It gave me a fresh perspective a very popular Bible passage."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"After reading the book, I was able to see more clearly the immensity of God's love for me personally. Thanks to Max Lucado whose relationship with Christ is in itself inspiring."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"To read this book was one of the best things I have done all summer. My first experience with Max was In the Grip of Grace, but I must say that this book is by far the best book I have read by him, and it contains the best chapter of a book I have ever read in my life (Chapter 15). If you are studying the beatitudes this is a must read, if you want some questions answered about God then this is a must read, or if you are depressed and think nothing can pick you up then you must read this book. It's nice to affirm that the reality of life is opposite of the world's reality. I hate to read, except when my soul is flooded, and God does that through Max in this piece of extraordinary work."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"Max Lucado has vividly expressed in this book how much God loves us and supports us in our Christian life.

I highly recommend you to purchase a copy for you to realize how God miss you a lot! To God be the Glory!"},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"This is my first Max Lucado book; it won't be my last. I've not met such wisdom and humor together like I found here. Touching stories, laugh-out-loud moments, deeply moving and full of insights that add a new dimension to the age-old truths. It was a word fitly spoken in time and I won't be the same. This is no dry spiritual how-to. It's a new way to look at the Beatitudes and how God meant for them to impact your life. Instead of separate statements, Lucado makes a case for their being the sequential path of \\"God's radical reconstruction of the heart\\".Whether you want a fresh touch from God, a reminder of His love, or a way to find joy in the midst of this life, you need to read this!"},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"This book has encouraged my heart and also helped me get a new view of an old subject!

It is truly like drinking from the fountain of Heaven.

I loaned this to a friend years ago, moved away, never got my book back. Glad I now have my own personal copy. It's a great read; especially when you need to be encouraged."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"Great study on the beattitudes for small groups.Chapters are short enough not to be a burden on busy people."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"The Applause of Heaven was written in 1990 and was one of the first books Max Lucado wrote. I received the book several years ago and finished it in no time. The 200 pages is divided into 18 chapters focused on the Beatitudes found in Matthew 5. Each chapter starts with a picture representing in some way the theme or message of the chapter. A publisher's preface and a foreword by Calvin Miller are found at the start of the book while some notes and a 22 page study guide are found in the back of the book. Additionally, a list of some of the inspirational books written by Pastor Lucado are provided in the back of the book. Although Max Lucado's books are regularly on the New York Times Best Seller List, I thought The Applause of Heaven was just a fair read. Like Lucado's Cast of Characters (2008), I think The Applause of Heaven does not have a great deal of depth. I have enjoyed reading to my daughters some of the children's books that Lucado has written. The Crippled Lamb and You Are Special are two Lucado books that I can recommend."},{"Title":"Applause of Heaven","review":"very good not quite done with it but it has been great thusfar.

On one hand, Anglo Saxon women could divorce their husbands and independently own property, while their conterparts in Latin-speaking countries enjoyed no such rights. On the other hand, female babies in Germanic societies were often left to die from exposure with only a bit of pork fat to suck on. This book reminds us that the world of our Teutonic ancestors is nearly as alien to modern Northern Europeans (and their American cousins) as that of distant cultures--and that the Norman Conquest obliterated the Teutonic heritage of the English as surely as white settlers undermined the heritage of Native American Indians centuries later."},{"Title":"Catalysis by Ceria and Related Materials (Catalytic Science Series)","review":"This book provides a summary of previously published work on ceria (cerium oxide) and related materials used in catalysis. The goal is to provide a thorough overview of material properties and technological uses of this material. The book basically takes previously published peer review articles and organizes them together by subject to form chapters. The articles cover the electrical, mechanical, thermodynamic and chemical properties, along with synthesis, characterization, and uses. The book covers both pure ceria, and materials containing ceria, such as ceria - zirconia alloys, ceria - metal interfaces, and impurity atoms in ceria.This book gives a very comprehensive summary of ceria though it has two major drawbacks. First, for a book dedicated to one system, it should have included an extended table of properties (experimental and calculated) for this system. Second, there is very little data on Ce2O3, which is unfortunate given that the primary use of ceria in catalysis relies on the CeO2 - Ce2O3 phase transition. But overall, a good book on this topic; probably the only one worth buying."},{"Title":"Humana Festival 1998: The Complete Plays","review":"This compilation of plays from the Humana Festival of 1998 is fabulous for any aspiring actor or director. It features 9 plays, recently written by new playwrights. Acorn, by David Graziano, is the most impressive, by far. It tells the story of a young man and woman who fall in love because of some acorns. It is cute and touching. A few other impressive plays included in this anthology are &quot;The Trestle At Pope Lick Creek,&quot; by Naomi Wallace, &quot;Let the Big Dog Eat,&quot; by Elizabeth Wong, and &quot;Meow,&quot; by Val Smith. Once again, this book is a wonderful addition to your collection if you are interested in new and interesting, short plays."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"The title is misleading. &quot;American Foreign Policy and Iraq&quot; would be more appropriate. That said, it is an excellent depiction of the distinctly different foreign policies pursued by the current and two previous administrations towards Iraq. Importantly, it provides an ideological framework for understanding better the views expressed by current newsmakers from within the current (e.g. Powell, Rumsfeld,etc)and past administrations (e.g. Albright, Snowcroft, etc). For obvious reasons, Bush 43's policy (a distinctly american internationalism combining &quot;national self interest&quot; and &quot;values&quot;)receives the most attention. The authors argue that Bush 43's policy is an extension of those followed by Truman, Kennedy and Reagan and that America and the world will be more secure and free if he stays the course. I agree."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"In this era of renewed dissent, protest, ambiguous phrases, and vague analogies as to America's--and the international community's--call to disarm Iraq, Kaplan and Kristol have offered up reasoned analysis to a hot-button issue. Though it's nearly incomprehensible that there could be any doubt as to the need to depose Saddam, this book lays out not only the short-term implications, but also those for the future of American foreign policy. It should be required reading for all those who oppose the idea of war with Iraq, but offer little in viable alternatives."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"There are a few books on this subject which are selling quite well. Almost all of those imply it is necessary to attack Iraq. This book properly analysis the situations which involve a matrix of questions, in many cases provide more than one answer. However all these books take the physical approach or the traditional approach of seen evidense rather than the more important evidense in this specific region, belief and sentiment of the rest of the surrounding countries of Iraq. Kristol and Kaplan do not touch this in The War over Iraq. These books all rely on information being passed through the system. Most of that information is historical actions of Hussien, and past weapon systems. This book also assumes Iraq does possess significant amounts of weapons of mass distruction, recent United Nations inspections reveal nothing, more or less on this level Kaplan assumes. I see this book as being cautionary as none of us really know what Iraq posseses, that is a favorable trait to this particular book. However not one mention of the rest of this regions response to an invasion of Iraq. If we are fighting a war to prevent terrorism, which comes from many different independent but sentimentally connected peoples in this region, we should try to undersatnd what the re-actions from these people will be. The only book that I've read(which also states we do invade Iraq and leave Saddam inept, then terrorism escalates beyond thought) which covers the entire spectrum well, to include what will transpire after this war. Title is SB or God by Karl Maddox. I recommend reading that book to complete the subject of attacking or not."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"A detailed blueprint for brutal imperialism. This text sets the stage for perpetual warfare and the constant manufacturing of security threats to achieve that end."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Like other conservative con jobs like Charles Murray's &quot;The Bell Curve,&quot; this book loads it thesis up first and then either cherry picks data to fit or just makes it up.In this instance, these guys wanted war with Iraq for a long time. (Never mind that either ever served in the military, they are more like keyboard commandos than fighting men.)So they cherry picked the evidence or just made it up.The key for was- just as Bush recited in his State of the Union 2003 - was that Iraq had WMD when in fact they were destroyed years ago.The admin and these guys knew this but they had to present to the US public that Iraq posed a clear threat to American.This book should be read in conjunction with Pollack's article in the Jan/Feb 2004 issue of The Atlantic Magazine where he said:&quot;When the United States confronts future challenges, the exaggerated estimates of Iraq's WMD will loom like an ugly shadow over the diplomatic discussions. Fairly or not, no foreigner trusts U.S. intelligence to get it right anymore, or trusts the Bush Administration to tell the truth.&quot; -Kenneth M. Pollack, in &quot;Spies, Lies, and Weapons: What Went Wrong,&quot;In light of the above, it appears that either the Bush administration lied or was willfully ignorant about the \`threat of Iraq.'Whatever the reason, it does not appear as if the Bush administration was being honest to the public.Kristol and Kaplan's book will be of interest to future scholars about how the Iraq war was sold to the American public. Not a pretty picture since the American taxpayers will be paying for the war in decades to come."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This is a progaganda piece for William Kristol's pet project \\"The Project for a New American Century\\". You can go to their website...and read all about their agenda. All to often we look for books to read to justify our values or beliefs. Unfortunately, too few of us have the time to investigate authors or \\"experts\\" on issues and find out their real agenda. This booklet is not journalism but a long editorial. This is agenda for the what the neo cons and the neo liberals promote: The UN, globalization and social welfare for multi national corporations who trade in arms, technology and finance. The PNAC as it is called, is a champion of old style liberal ideals as the IMF, the World Bank and the EU.William Kristol's Project for a New American Century is too a propaganda machine for the New World Order, the old Illuminati, the world elitists. The PNAC has nothing to do with spreading democracy or fighting terrorism. These are smoke screens. Their goal is to insert pro Globalists regimes (not democractic by the way) who will continue their agenda of corporate social welfare throughout the world."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Dig below the surface and this book is Hitlerian doctrine gussied up with Democractic Mythology. A recipe for world disaster. Read only if you worship at the feet of Machiavelli."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"The message of this book is loud and clear: as long as we are going to force democracy on Iraqis, then killing 500,000 civilians is just fine (oops, I forgot, the book didn't mention that Pentagon estimate--that's one of the gaping holes).Nothing is said of the dangers of the United States possessing weapons of mass destruction WHICH IT HAS USED--nuclear and bio-chemical both--or of how overwhelmingly powerful our military is as compared to Iraq's. The imperialistic and ethnocentric mindset reflected by this book is frightening."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"As the founder of the influential conservative think-tank American Patriots who Never Fought In War But Advocate Violent Imperialism In the New American Century (APNFWAVINAC), Kristol successfully promoted the idea that a group of draft-dodging muddle-headed bureaucrats should be the main decision makers when it comes to America going to war. APNFWAVINAC made it a primary goal of the U.S. to liberate the good people of the Arab and Muslim countries that Kristol loves so much from their tyrannical leaders, just so long as none of their own children had to fight. APNFWAVINAC published the historic open letter to George W. Bush titled Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iraq, advocating the violent overthrow of the Iraqi leader in order to free the good people of Iraq. John McCain used the letter as the source of a hilarious and much beloved joke during his 2008 presidential campaign.Among the high level members of APNFWAVINAC who were signatories to the famous letter were other great intellectuals and patriots such as Paul \\"never served in the military but I have a girlfriend at age 62\\" Wolfowitz, Douglas \\"f***ing stupidest guy on earth\\" Feith, John \\"kiss-up, kick-down\\" Bolton, Dick \\"no bid contract for my war profiteering Haliburton pals and we're in the last throws of the insurgency\\" Cheney, as well as many other brilliant and highly accomplished warriors and scholars of world history and military strategy. These APNFWAVINAC members were so deeply troubled by reports of Iraqis being terrorized by Saddam that they felt they had to intervene with their carefully researched and passionately presented plea to Bush to bomb Iraq. Kristol even volunteered to join the Army in order to defend the Iraqi people that he loved so dearly and to support the military that he has revered all of his life. Even though the Army had dropped many of the enlistment requirements to attract recruits, Kristol still failed the physical because of his disproportionately large mid-region.Kristol fought bravely for his country in Viet Nam and in the Persian Gulf (I'm guessing). And if he had children, they would have been the first to volunteer to fight and die in Iraq. He sacrificed his life and lost a large part of his brain on the battlefield in Hanoi (I'm guessing on that one too). His extended tours in both wars testify to his deep sense of patriotism and duty to his country. So when he repeatedly calls for the U.S. to go to war with Iraq, Iran, Korea, France, Germany, New Zealand, and against the radical leftists in Boston and Seattle, he is speaking as a man who has seen first-hand the horrors of war and does not make such recommendations lightly.Although he has been wrong in every single prediction and observation he has ever publicly made, we must remember that he is a genial commentator on the FOX channel with a charming sense of humor and he is a brave veteran who served his country with great honor and continues to maintain the attractive APNFWAVINAC website calling for war with all non-American countries so we should heed his valuable, if completely wrong advice."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Kaplan and Kristol add an interesting perspective to the debate over the war in Iraq. Their argument is that this war is definitely not about oil, and not just or even mainly about weapons of mass destruction. It is about liberating Iraq and making the world both more democratic and a safer place for democracy. It's a breezy, argumentative book, not really so much an attempt to convince opponents of the war as an attempt to stake a theoretical claim that something they call a distinctly American internationalism is what informs the Bush Administration's action against Iraq. Naturally, Clinton's Administration is targetted for particular contempt, but interestingly enough Bush I and even Reagan are also criticised as narrow realists.What's missing from this analysis is any sense of history and of how the US is perceived outside its borders--and even outside the Beltway. Not everyone is going to be able to accept the notion that the US should simply be trusted to do the right thing. The book's authors clearly have either no idea or--scarier still--no interest in how a book like this will be read by people who have either watched or experienced first-hand a less-than-idealistic USA in action.At the precise time of writing (Baghdad seems to have fallen today) and for the next few months, the Kristol/Kaplan theory will be riding high. But whatever this book claims, what they charitably consider to be activist idealism is not going to turn into doctrine. It won't because the US is always going to feel the need for the moral flexibility that realism offers. \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom\\" is a catchy slogan, but will it be followed by, say, \\"Operation Uzbeki Freedom\\", aimed at liberating Uzbeks from a brutal and corrupt dictatorship in Tashkent that happens to be allied with Washington against radical Islam? Of course not. Nor is it going to be followed by \\"Operation Pakistani Freedom\\" or \\"Operation Zimbabwean Freedom\\".My own conclusion is that Kaplan and Kristol either do not really believe what they are arguing, or they are dangerously naive utopians, not unlike the dogmatists who steered the Kremlin into wild Third World adventures in the 1960s and 1970s. I suspect it's the former, and this book is mainly about raising the authors' own profiles for the next few months. Otherwise, someone as ideologically pure as Kristol claims to be would have resigned several times over in protest during the Reagan Administration (e.g. over Iran-Contra) and refused to serve under a realist such as George H W Bush.It's fascinating to watch just how far Kristol and Kaplan will go to make the evidence fit their theory. They ask us to believe, for example, that attacking Iraq today is akin to Kennedy's decision to quarantine Cuba. The fact that Kennedy was faced with a nuclear threat that could have unfolded in a matter of weeks, not years or decades as in the case of Iraq, seems lost on Kaplan and Kristol, who instead conclude that war on Iraq is further justified because Kennedy did consider a military option for a while. Amazing stuff.This book will naturally appeal to ignorant ideologues who seek confirmation of their reflexive militaristic instincts, but it is actually quite worthwhile for others to read too. Just keep asking yourself questions while you read it."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Some folks just refuse to let real facts get in the way of their good story...how pedestrian that those who disagree with conservatives would call this book racist...apparently they lack original thought. Misters Kristol & Kaplan lay out a complete, fact laden picture of the Real Saddam. This isn't just current events, they cover Saddam and his interactions with the U.S. from his rise to power. The authors are rightly critical of Bush 1's errors in the first Gulf War and lay out a strong case of the clear and present danger this butcher-ous tyrant presents to people here in the U.S., the middle east, and his own country."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Misters Kristol and Kaplan deliver a thorough, well researched, case against Saddam. Not just a one-sided political diatribe, they carefully examine the historical record and what lead us to the situation we are dealing with today. They cast a critical eye to errors made during the Bush 1 administration. Not cut from some whole-cloth they back up what they say with end notes and research."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I picked up this book because as the title states I wanted to learn how people in government or at least associated with some people in the government (Wolfowitz is a close friend of Kristol) justify this preemptive war.Whether you agree with the war or not, this book is probably as close as you can get to have an extensive conversation with Wolfowitz about his reasoning for pushing the removal of Saddam through military means. If you think that oil is the reason for the Iraq war and every action by this government is regulated through the Halliburton front office, every page in this book will get your blood boiling. Just as in the official hearings or speeches by government officials, oil is not given as a reason for the war.But if you are against the war and look for weaknesses in the political justification for the war, this book is a reference manual for building your arguments. It details the historical roots of the current government's foreign policy and cites the best examples (in their opinion) why Saddam has to be removed now and not 5 years later.If you support the war, this book may give you additional arguments to support your case or will simply reinforce your opinion.Written by Kristol, who has previously taught political science, and Kaplan, who is senior editor of The New Republic, this book is overall well referenced (contrast that to Ann Coulter's books) and an easy read for people interested in political sciences."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This is an absolute must read, regardless of your postion on the war. Kristol and Kaplan clearly layout the case against Sadaam. They then point out the foreign policy flaws of not just Bush 41 and Clinton but also of pre-9/11 Bush 43. You will more fully understand the philosophy that layed the framework of foreign policy for each president. You will also clearly grasph how President Bush's view of the world has changed since 9/11.Finally, you will be presented with the arguments and facts that form the backbone of our current stance towards Iraq. Even if you do not come to the same conclusion as that of the authors, you will better understand why our country is embarking on a path to the liberation of Iraq.My only complaint is that there are only 125 pages of riveting reading!"},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I wonder if the authors of this book have since gone back and read it to see how close they came to predicting the reasons for and the outcome of the Iraqi war, or at least its progress up to today? I admit that one of the reasons I picked up this book was to get a clear view of the pro war crowd thinking and to judge their views with the advantage of hindsight . I also wanted to read this book because the two authors are both know to excellent writers and not too shabby on the intellectual front. Yes they are both poster children for very far right conservative thinking, but how else are you to truly understand an issue unless to read all sides of the debate? Lastly I had heard that if you wanted to get a solid brief explanation of the way the Bush Team thought about the Iraqi war then this was the book to read.Given that the authors are rather conservation, it was humorous to me, if not totally expected, that they were able to work in so many digs at all the favorite whipping boys of the right wing in relation to foreign affairs. Judging by the rhetoric of the book, France will be the next country invaded followed by the UN, the offices of the Democratic party and ending at the office of Bill Clinton. I wondered if the attacks on this diverse group were truly heart felt or were they just the standard playbook that the authors fell back on out of habit. What struck me was that about 50% of the authors argument for taking action in Iraq was that it was vital to the U.S. national interests and that the U.S. should do everything it can along these lines, but that the authors felt that France, using the same justification, was somehow beyond the pale and close to a tyrannical world bully. It was also surprising to me that they complimented the Truman and Wilson administrations so often and tried to tie in what the Bush 2 administration wanted to do in Iraq with what these two leaders did during the World Wars. I could not tell if they truly felt this way or if they were trying to add some legitimacy to the Bush argument.The last section of the book spent a good amount of time beating up on many ex officials of the Bush 1 administration that came out against the war. The area that, what in hindsight is very ironic, the authors gave these ex officials the most grief on was their predictions of the aftermath of the war. It turns out that, at the current time, exactly the difficulties that were predicted have come to pass and the rosy predictions of a smooth transition from Saddam to democracy 101 is not taking place. Overall the book was well written and the views for the pro war constituents are laid out in a logical order. It turns out that the facts, as they have come out, make about 75% of this book incorrect although I do not think that makes this book any less valuable because it truly is the overview of the war sales campaign. If I had one complaint of the book was that it was maybe just a little too high level, Kenneth Pollacks book The Threatening Storm provides far more detail and is a little less rabid in its overt partisan view of the world. Given the book is short and can be had rather inexpensively, it is a nice addition to your Bush 2 collection."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This book was written prior to the invasion and was along the lines of making the case for US intervention in Iraq. It definitely has a conservative bent and from that angle is reflective of the administrative running the execution of the war.The books perspective deals primarily with the geopolitical reasons surrounding the war and not the specific interdepartmental issues that surround the massive machinery that is the United States Government. It focused primarily on principal and not application of those principals as well. I feel this is the strong point of the book and in hind sight can see how these authors were very spot on in many of their observations.While I felt the book was well researched and quoted, the documentation relating to the references was geared toward a casual political reader and to dive a bit deeper into the research on exact quotes was a bit harder to do than other comparable works. I enjoy the stylistic writing of both of these tremendously talented writers and while not as documented as I would have enjoyed, their prose contained something quotable almost every other page. These little quips of knowledge were smooth flowing and provided enlightenment and understanding on an issue that has captivated the minds of our greatest men and women now for a couple of years.The most significant aspect of this book outlines the policies of the Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II presidencies and how they are all a bit different. This political perspective was again a great strategic perspective in diplomatic style and allows the reader to then understand America's stance toward the Iraqi r&eacute;gime in a better light. The styles outlined for Bush I were a narrow realism. The Clinton years were wishful liberalism and Bush II had Distinctly American Internationalism.The book also addressed some interesting political perspectives of preemption and r&eacute;gime change. These are key changes in our modern world with different sets of consequences that the writers adequately address.This is a great book to focus not on the departmental interchanges but how the focus of the administration in office dealt with politics of Iraq specifically and what challenges were presented as a result of these stances. This is a good read even for liberal minded folks because it offers many of the pros and cons for each of these points of view.I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to take a look at what people were saying just before the war and how to have a proper historical perspective to see who was right! Kaplan and Kristol were spot on in many ways! Great Book!"},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Bear in mind that this book was written after Dubya Bush had been President for two years. So Kaplan and Kristol begin with a defense of Bush's use of the term \\"evil\\" as in \\"axis of evil.\\" President Reagan used the term \\"evil empire\\" in reference to the Soviet Union and for K and K this term was key in the downfall of the Soviet Union, so is \\"evil\\" a key term in identifying regimes which have records of aggression, arsenals of WMD's, and support organizations of terrorism which threaten the United States.For K and K, the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq fits this definition to the T. Hussein routinely violated the 1948 Gencide Convention forbidding the use of chemical weapons. In fact Hussein used WMD's against his own people. Hussein is a \\"predator of the 21st century\\" who flaunts his destructive powers. \\"Iraq's efforts to acquires WMD's long predate the Gulf War...\\" (page 27).In the 1990's the US did nothing to confront a tyrant bent on conquest. The senior President Bush halted the Persian Gulf War prematurely. The Clinton adminstration simply failed to confront the moral and strategic challange of Hussein. K and K call these modes of thinking \\"narrow realism\\" and \\"wishful liberalism.\\" K and K claim that the US policy toward Iraq was simply one of ambivalenceabout the use of force as an instrument of policy (page 51). It was the fate and duty of Dubya (a nickname he has accepted for years) Bush to watch Hussein's arsenal grow ever more threatening and to deal with it.This book is so full of deception that I don't know where to begin calling its authors a couple of liars. Let's try here: Kristol is identified in the blurb on the dust jacket as a political analyst for the Fox News Network. It is more important that Kristol is chairman for a political think tank founded in 1997 called the Project for a New American Century. Other members of this think tank include Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, John Bolton, the current ambassador to Iraq, and *Jeb Bush*.Web searches will show that PNAC maintains a militaristic view of US policy toward the world. Web searches will also show that Hussein received some of his WMD's from the US in the 1990's, that he reduced them in the latter 1990's (which K and K don't mention), and that the CIA told the Dubya admin that Iraq had no WMD's six months before the attack on Iraq, etc.PNAC has the idea that the US can set its own destiny in the 21st century by being militarily aggressive and by maintaining a moral high road. So far PNAC has gotten the rest of us Americans lots of grief over lost loved ones and an incursion into Iraq with no end in sight... and a huge national debt."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This is a very biased book full of neoconservative ideology and very few facts...."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"They say the man who reads only one book is much more dangeroud than the man who reads none. This book, released during these times, is meant to appeal to those who, instead of needing objective and scholarly convincing, only need a well known personality to solidify their knee-jerk patiotism.Bill Kristol, no doubt, is a very respectable columnist and Harvard teacher who really has let me down this time. Although I usually disagree with him, I usually find his political analysis well informed and cogent. In \\"war over Iraq\\", Kristol sets out to \\"prove\\" the need for invasion, in what can essentially be considered nothing more than a propaganda pamphlet, by making an extremely incomplete and sloppy case for war.Although the author addresses the history of U.S. relations with Hussien, and admits to alterior motives as the basis of American foriegn policy in the region, Kristol makes the wishful assumption that somehow this history does not reflect on the fundamental American attitude toward the rest of the world and that, amazingly, a future policy of American global aggression and geopolitical coersion will suddenly be based, as if isolated from the political and human nature of those that came before Bush, on the ideological altruism of an administration intent on making the world safe for freedom and democracy.Kristol makes little attempt to hide the extreme centrism that underlies his thesis. The basis of his argument is this: America is better than everyone else and, thus, our ideas and policies are what the world needs - they just don't know it yet. In order to make the world safe for peace and stability, we need to maintain American military and political preeminance at any cost. We cannot allow any nation, friend or foe, to compete with the America, especially those nations who's policies are not consistant with our interests.Kristol makes a token attempt to justify this attitude by invoking Sept. 11th and detailing how bad a guy Saddam is...revealing a considerable gulf between his evidence and conclusion to anyone who approaches the book with stoic and informed objectivity.Indeed, this book is meant to convince rather than to inform. Anyone who thinks this book lays out a comprehensive backdrop of current events is either uneducated or is comforting themself intellectually by consulting a text so extremelly selective of historical examples as to justify their bumper sticker patriotism.If you read this, do yourself a favor and read up on the history of this topic first. Do NOT go into it without a historical knowledge base."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I was reading the review written below that indicated that this book gives the conservative perspective on the war in Iraq. You couldn't be more wrong.This book gives you the NEO-CONSERVATIVE perspetive for going to war. And as with anything the neo cons try to sell you (see the Weekly Standard, Commentary magazine or anything written by Richard Perle or Robert Kagan), this is more propaganda than it is fact. This book was clearly written to promote a war that this small, but influential political faction have been pushing for since the early 90s.If you want a CONSERVATIVE perspective on all this, pick up Pat Buchanan's \\"Where the Right Went Wrong\\" or the recently released book from Scott Ritter. The \\"Neo-Conned\\" series is also a good starting point."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This book preaches that 'American\` ideas are good for the entire world and should be imposed by military force. Read this book and others by the neo-conservatives (\`The Threatening Storm\`, \`Of Paradise and Power\`) in order to understand what the men who run The War Machine (Rumsfeld, Cheney, Perle, Wolfowitz) believe and act on. This book advocates the neo-conservative policy of \`preemptive war\` for Iraq and other \`potential threats\` to the US. As foreign policy, one can compare this advocacy of preemptive war with von Neumann's early fifties advice to bomb the USSR immediately. von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematicians of all times. He contributed mightily to computer theory and design, and also contributed significantly to quantum physics. It was necessary to consider his advice, and then judge it wrong. Since the implosion of the USSR we know that Bohr and Einstein were right, that preemptive war is not the answer to national security.Kristol and Kagan, unlike von Neumann, are not scientists. They are philosopher-policitians following a line though Allan Bloom that goes back through the rabid Nazi Heidegger to Nietzsche, the author of \`God is Dead\`. The origin of their philosophy is Nietzsche\`s idea of 'the superman\` and consequently imperialist, warring strength as \`virtue\`. That is, in effect, the message of this awful book. Ths reader can judge for herself if she believes it to be \`American\` or foreign.The origin of the philosophy espoused in this book lies partly in confusion over standard economic theory with economic reality. I offer the following definitions for the readers\` consideration. A neo-classical economist believes, on no empirical basis whatsoever, that unregulated markets are stable and can approach equilibrium (this is the idea of Adam Smith's Invisible Hand). A neo-liberal believes in globalization via deregulation on the basis of neo-classical economics. A neo-conservative is a neo-liberal with a modern techo-army and the will and desire to use it to enforce on the globe his illusion/fantasy of the best of all possible economic worlds. The latter is basically the message of this book. Without the terrorism of 9/11 the neo-cons could not have had an adequate excuse for putting their blood-drenched program into effect, thus making the desire of this book come true. Hitler had to burn the Reichstag in order to create enough fear and anger in Germany to destroy civil liberties there and go to war, but 9/11 fell like mana from heaven into the laps of the neo-cons, who have started a preemptive war following exactly the advice of this book, and have additionally given us the Orwellian Patriot Act\`, a virtuous Nietzschean destruction of our civil liberties.The reader should also consult my much earlier review of Allan Bloom's \`The closing of the American Mind\`. As I pointed out in that review, I read the book and reread it many times, found it fascinating, but never could figure out what Bloom really wanted to say. Through his student Wolflowitz, we now understand much better what Allan Bloom wanted us to believe. By not making his program explicit, by keeping his scary program for America hidden, he helped the neo-cons to launch that program without the American people knowing what would follow."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I would venture to guess that some others who reviewed this book did not read it, but assumed because of its authors it was propaganda. I found it a historical account of how we came to the clear and present danger of WMD in the hands of dictators and madmen who consider the American people their enemy.While it did not explain why they hate Americans it does chronicle years and years of foreign policies that failed in their obligations to protect America.While I did not find it a easy read I would say everyone should read it to understand how we got to this point in time and why we should not and will not take no for an answer this time around!"},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"In \\"The War Over Iraq\\", Kristol & Kaplan present an excellent case for the use of pre-emptive force not only against Iraq but also against other nations that threaten American ideals and interests, both at home and overseas. They highlight the grievous actions of Hussein's regime and then proceed to detail the shortcomings of both George H.W. Bush's (\\"narrow realism\\") and Bill Clinton's (\\"wishful liberalism\\") foreign policy paradigms in dealing with Iraq.The crux of the book is their compelling argument, using the (George W.) Bush Doctrine (\\"American internationalism\\"), that the United States should pre-emptively strike Iraq. They fully explain the tenets of the Bush Doctrine, which is a viable model for dealing with threats in the post-9/11 world.Though the war with Iraq is already underway, do not be dissuaded from reading this work simply for that reason. The Iraqi situation is a real-world case study that helps explain the Bush Doctrine. This new paradigm is being tested right now and will be the method of engagement for US foreign policy for the forseeable future."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I have just ordered the book and cannot yet offer a review. I selected \\"three stars\\" so I could post this comment.Just to clear things up, Rhea's assertion that the official Pentagon civilian death estimate in Iraq in case of a new war is 500,000 is not true. The Pentagon is not in the business of making public any such estimates. There is a UN estimate for refugees at 500,000 which may be confusing Rhea. You may attach to the UN whatever credibility you wish to.To scale the issue, even Hussein claims 3,000 civilian deaths during Gulf War I and he has every reason to exaggerate the number. Those represent 3,000 tragedies, but that number represents a two order-of-magnitude smaller figure than the 500,000 figure cited by Rhea for any future war.PBS's Frontline has shown that the estimates of the total number of military deaths in Iraq has dramatically decreased over time as people have more carefully considered the data. This was because equipment rather than troops were targeted.If war happens there are two factors that will tend to both increase and decrease the number of civilian deaths. If a war results in door-to-door fighting in Baghdad (let's hope not) this will certainly increase the number of civilian casualties. On the other hand, any new war would use a far greater number of \\"smart\\" bombs. That will tend to decrease accidental civilians casualties."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"The book does a good job of articulating neoconservative views, and explaining the rationale behind those views. Kaplan and Kristol always take the moral high ground. They argue that their foreign policy perspective is based on extending American ideals of freedom and democracy while making the world safer. The book makes periodic weak attempts to present other viewpoints. Those opposing views are highlighted for the sole purpose of refuting them. While very little credit can be given to Kaplan and Kristol for presenting a balanced view they are even worse as psychics. Their predictions for Iraq war and its aftermath were wildly off the mark. In the book the writers asserted with great conviction that Iraq maintained a massive stockpile of WMD (there were none). They attacked critics who suggested that Iraq would descend into chaos after the war (it did). Kaplan and Kristol suggested that the occupation would require just several thousand troops after year when the number was near 150,000 trrops. They pegged the price of the war at $16 billion with a true cost is more like ten times that amount. Contrary to the concept that attacking Iraq would make United States safer most Americans believe that it has not. While we might give Kaplan and Kristol credit for high ideals the idea that the United States should militarily dominate the world and impose its brand of democracy on rogue states seems just a neoconservative pipe dream. The neoconservatives demonstrate an unpalatable arrogance to suppose that they know what is best for other nations and that American ideals are superior to any others in the world. The real problem is created when neoconservative ideas are put into action by the government. Preemptive wars, unilateralism, the employment of military strength in imposing democracy will prove costly in treasure and lives. While Americans generally do feel that their system of government is superior, it is likely that the use of military force to impose these systems will backfire creating more enemies not less, making America less safe, not more.The application of neoconservative doctrine in Iraq seems to be a complete disaster. While the fat lady has yet to sing, she is warming up, just offstage. Ironically, in the unlikely event that Iraq does become a liberal democracy it will not be because of American military might, but due to genuine leadership on the part of the Iraqis."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I have read a number of books on Iraq and Saddam over the last few months, but this little 130 or so pager is my favorite. It's detailed, intelligent and anything but dry. It draws a great picture about Saddam's unspeakable actions, and how Iraq has served as a foreign policy test of courage for both Clinton and the first Bush, both of who failed it miserably. It gives very close and fair attention to all arguments about Iraq and how to deal with Saddam. My favorite part of the book was the third and final section, which goes beyond Baghdad and explains how the Bush's new foreign policy will deal with the new threats of today, justifying it by drawing on history of the past 100 years.Buy this book. You'll enjoy it and it won't eat up too much of your time."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"I've noticed many Amazon reviewers begin (or end) their reviews explaining why they are uniquely qualified to evaluate an author's work. So I must also say... NO! I'm no expert! I simply bought this book because I sought a reference that was objective and would answer my questions, specifically: is this war truly necessary? My comments to you are: judge for yourself.The authors did an excellent job 'promoting' action against Iraq because they explained these heinous weapons, Saddam's genocidal attacks, and the splintered UN which he no doubt laughs about. And yes, Kristol and Kaplan talk about Clinton, Bush I and Bush II styles and THAT my friends makes it a more compelling read.Let's face it: a war in Iraq will probably rid us of Saddam Hussein for good. Kristol and Kaplan do - IMHO - a thorough job telling us why that's a \\"good thing,\\" and what we can expect afterwards."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This book was published at the perfect time. It is a major, up-to-date contribution to the debate on whether to go to war against Saddam. Also, it is a quick read. Congratulations to the authors and the publisher--well done."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This book should be kept in print, and indeed it will (or should) be studied for years to come for those who'd like to form an understanding of the (second) Iraq War.The years since the appearance of his book have perhaps given it a more extreme tone. It's essentially a selling guide for the war, which was launched about two months after the release. This should be reprinted with an invoice, or perhaps an order form, for body armor and ammo; Kaplan's tome amounts to a clear call to war and a catalog on how to justify it.There is a lot of info about Saddam Hussein and his awful regime, his atrocities, and all of the evil he represented. But the arguments, where there are any, collapse on the first page, where Kaplan comes out swinging with his reminder that \\"evil exists\\", but \\"luckily, it can be defeated\\", and that after careful review, he believes Saddamn personifies real evil. Wonderful, a great effort.Perhaps it's taken five more years of cynicism to build on the American people, perhaps nobody believed it to begin with. There are a lot of bad people in the world, and sometimes they make good allies, so you help them by giving them cash and weapons, etc, etc. And you don't want to see atrocities and gassings and torture, but they happen. And they're awful.But how can Kaplan pretend such a level of outrage, and indeed, moral authority , by justifying another war to remove a monster we readily assisted for so long? Just stop pretending, and perhaps Americans would appreciate the honesty. And these assumptions, hammered home right away, make the book difficult to read, perhaps many times more difficult than it was to begin with (before the war). If the US government was not up in arms about Saddam's awfulness in the 80s, why is anyone pretending people were upset in 2002-2003? They weren't, and yet Kaplan dutifully keeps the facade up. It must be tiring.This won't convince as many people now about Iraq (after the fact) though it's still a case for the Bush doctrine, which is something about spreading democracy in the Middle East, etc, etc. And no doubt Kaplan believes it himself, that a reverse domino effect of democracy will help us better absorb the Middle East into a sphere of influence.But it's the same old. There are plenty of books out there about what America should do now, etc, etc, but this one is straight for the history pile, and wouldn't even make a good propaganda book for the army. Or maybe not. Kaplan acknowledges that supporting bad guys to fight other bad guys is necessary, a necessary cynicism to justify fighting a larger evil. But he is not really convincing when discussing this larger evil (terrorism, naturally). Because the policies are so cynical, perhaps people might not really like or take kindly to it. And therein lies the problem, that you won't ever convince some people that you're not a fanatic who is probably very paranoid. And Kaplan won't be convinced that it's not the right thing to do to invade Iraq and etc, etc, etc.Not essential anymore, unless you want the quintessential neoconservative account of why we must go to war. Or did go to war. Perhaps he's penning the followup."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This book will give you the back-story.

Specifically, it will take you through the realist policies of the first president Bush, the liberal approach of president Clinton, and the new president Bush's internationalism.Though it does paint internationalism as an auspicious policy in light of today's events it nevertheless give you the facts that have brought us to our current situation.

It also considers the results of various choices the U.S. has made in the past, or can make now, and describes how those results lead to a need to make MORE choices. Some readers may disagree with its conclusions - that it is in the U.S. interest to intervene in Iraq actively and violently - but the book arrives at those conclusions after honest analysis."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"This, unfortunately, is a book of very few surprises and precious little fundamental gravity in terms of providing the objective reader with anything but the same old tired and limited arguments we have heard forwarded by the fulsome gaggle of Washington \\"chicken-hawks\\" (career politicians, think-tank intellectuals and businessmen who are wanna-be pseudo-macho bureaucrats, guys and gals who have themselves never tasted life in the military nor suffered the experience of war up close and personal). The problems with their well-presented and well-documented arguments is that they are unconvincing and nowhere near substantial enough to convince an objective third party of the need to take the action the United States and the so-called \\"coalition of the willing\\" are now embarking upon.The authors do provide yeoman service by way of placing the actions of Saddam hussein and his bloody regime in perspective, and are forthright in admitting, at least to a certain degree, the degree of complicity the American government had in creating and sustaining this monsteer over a spate of years in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet they are less than forthcoming in describing how the events of \\"9-11\\" make Hussein any more of a clear and present danger to the American polity or the American people than he has been for over twenty years. Given the fact that we have sporadically bombed him over the intervening years without provoking him into teroristic action should argue against the idea he is somehow out there actively plotting with fundamentalist muslim terror cells to do evil to us or our friends. Yet short shrift is paid to such considerations here.Instead we have the usual litany that the world is now somehow so much more dangerous that we cannot afford to take the chance he might harm us, and have to take preemptive action to smash him before he surrenders to his evil instincts somewhere down the line. The argument is limited, tailored more to convince rather than to educate and inform, and there are a whole raft of considerations and counter-cutting considerations never broached here. My recommendation is that you read this more to gain an understanding for the philosophical underpinnings of all these war-mongering neo-conservatives, most of whom like Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleeza Rice and Richard Pearle, never felt enough of an obligation to the country or its needs to ever volunteer for military service themselves.

They're part of the problem, not part of the solution"},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"Bill Krystol's book was part of a massive, well coordinated propaganda effort aimed to scare the American public into approving and, in fact supporting Bush's disastrous and ruinous invasion of Iraq. Bill Krystol and his colleagues, using Goebbels-type tactics (keep repeating the same outrageous lies and do it loudly and people will eventually believe you) abused their elevated positions in the government and/or in the media establishment to sow fear, confusion, hatred. All these lies had and have consequences. What we harvested was:- More than 4000 perfectly good Americans dead- Tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans physically or psychologically crippled- Trillions of dollars absurdly wasted to destroy and then attempt to rebuild a country- America's international credibility at its lowest ever- Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed or crippled- A country in ruins- Militant, anti-American jihadism increased and more popular than everWho benefits? Not the United States, for sure. The families left behind could have used the thousands dead or disabled and we could have used the trillions of dollars to build our own country instead of destroying someone else's. We would rather not see our president bombarded with shoes and called a war criminal and torturer in chief by millions all over the world.It's important to read this book because Bill Krystol and his colleagues continue to try to scare and confuse us. The book is a showcase example of how a 'well sourced' work can be used to twist reality so grotesquely, an otherwise decent nation is whipped into a frenzy of supporting unprovoked invasions, cheering the 'shock and awe' bombardment of civilians, medieval torture techniques and the wasting of billions or trillions for on activities that run against the national interest. There's nothing new about this. Everyone has heard about dishonest prosecutors twisting 'facts' to the degree of persuading any grand jury to indict 'a ham sandwich'. Bill Krystol is only applying such techniques to serve his own purpose. It's important to study his methods and techniques now because Krystol and friends are already busy working on their next project.After spending trillions and the blood of many thousands hunting for non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, today, as we speak, America is spending billions building radar and interceptor stations, 8000 miles away, in Europe, to counter Iran's non-existent nuclear warheads riding on top of Iran's non-existent missiles, aimed at Iran's non-existent enemies.This book is available for one penny from many booksellers today. Arguably, it's one penny too much but I advise anyone interested in the study of crass (but clearly effective) propaganda to sacrifice that one penny (plus shipping and handling) and order this book. Order it used because we don't want Bill Krystol to make even one penny off our curiosity but do get yourself a copy as 'historical evidence' because Bill Krystol and his friends have been for a couple of years already in damage-repair-and-back-to-attack mode, working hard at distorting their records of propagandistic lies on Iraq and working hard at refocusing America's remaining military resources at Iran as they assume that America has not been milked dry yet and those who've been fooled before can and deserve to be fooled again.Qui bono?

The reference notes are only indexed by page and the reader has to search for or conclude, to what they refer."},{"Title":"The War over Iraq","review":"The book is a first-rate review of where America has been, is now and will be going to fulfill Professor Strauzz-Hupe game plan. Professor Strauzz-Hupe saw an interdependent world founded on Principles of Free Institutions so individual pursuits can prosper within a community framework as we raise each nation for their own people to prosper with good government created of, by and for them.The authors correctly points out that two oceans no longer protect America. If weapons of mass destruction are given to terrorists from tyrants of regimes such as Iraq, Syria, North Korea, Libya, and Iran seeking to build them today, then escalation of death will only increase and progress cease.The book correctly points out that these regimes of dictators, radical religious cults and narco-drug dealers that use fear or chaos to control their masses can no longer be ignored. If they are aloud to rule and create Weapons of Mass Destruction they will cause havoc on each one of our own pursuits towards happiness under wide opened democracies dependent on the goodwill of educated people to thrive.The author points out, we can no longer stand by and let tyrants be tormenters to weave webs of turmoil so they can plunge the world into backward anarchy to flourish with delight. The time has come to change them before they ruin the world for all of us!The book outlines how each American President has error by not reacting to terrorism only emboldening the terrorists to foster more violence. It includes criticism Of Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton and Bush II. I might add it also praises all of them except for President Carter (Appropriate As Well), for taking action after making such mistakes including crediting President Clinton.Presidents prefer not to wrestle with preparing a strategy that shifts according to the terrorist's actions and reactions. Thus, the need to change the terrorists and transform the states that sponsor them is the first priority to a brave new world to prosper.Certain Islamic Whabbism believers have been planning revenge dating back to the 7th century since they are too lazy to work, think and provide in the 21st century. European politicians are thinking back to the 20th century since they are incapable of understanding the means necessary of using weapons and strategy being able to decide the safety for the 21st century. As Americans with a growing number of European and Asian visionaries we see the need to act in order to save the world from tyrants sponsoring terror into the 21st century.The alternatives are to do nothing and watch our nation and economic interests retrograde to 7th century thought! Or see our cities ruined with biological, chemical or dirty nuclear bombs by those who hate us no matter what we do. The Western Societies will then react and demand revenge to where our very own leaders will have to be militant aggressors to where the escalation of death will spiral out of control. Thus, the author is saying the need for the \\"Doctrine of Preemption,\\" is necessary today to stop and change those seeking destruction tomorrow.Some left wing critics will say this book is about replacing the threat of Communism with Terrorism to preserve the Military-Industrial Complex but as usual they are too late and quite wrong. These critics prefer undermining free institutions for socialistic ones and pointing finger is their only feat never lifting them to progress culture.The fact remains our Military-Industrial Complex has been transformed to one of Military-Technological innovations where creating casualties can be avoided as we go after terrorists who are responsible for killing innocent life. On 911 America lost 3,000 innocent people, but wars in Afghanistan and Iraq averted that number of innocent civilians in contrasts.We are now capable of catching and if need be killing the bad guys far easier and saving the innocent during such pursuits towards justice. There is no question that this task needs to be proficient to save a world against errant men bent on destruction not construction. The book outlines such a blueprint for why we need a better world and how to achieve it!The authors deserve credit for an easy to read understanding that America had to choose a \\"Just War\\" of choice over a short term appeasement policy that lets despots gather weapons of mass destruction towards everyone.

Of course, all the rationales used in it are false, and the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq lays bare for all to see the arrogance, wrongness, and decadence of this rightwing element. It is sad that, though we thought we had rid the world of fascism, there are those who, wittingly or otherwise, fall under its spell.Kristol absolutely has the sticky blood of fallen American troops on his hands, lives lost futiley and vainly for an obscure, unnecessary cause. There will be no domino chain reaction of democracy in the Middle East, we are not seen as liberators, and Bush, devoid of an exit strategy, continues to bumble his way through the slog of quagmire.The only thanks we can give to Kristol, et al is the satisfaction of knowing that, in their pursuit to make war just another instrument of policy, they have ensured that America will not be willingly going to war again for a very, very long time."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"The title of this book is mis-leading as there's hardly any technique.

As other's have mentioned there is heavy usage of Nik filters. However the author's are open and frank about the use of such filters and the results are great indeed. Reading content is not much more than a few hours long and wedding photographers will learn very little. This is a picture book with general comments and opinion, \\"professional techniques\\" it is not!"},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"I purchased and read Bambi's first book on wedding photography published in 2000 and also this one expecting new information and an updated on all that has changed over the past 5+ years. I was disappointed to find little new information other than a lot of plugs for Canon equipment.Many images that illustrate the value of NIK filters for Photoshop but little discussion of when to use them or why. One example is provided on an approach to converting images to black and white but no mention of the literally dozens of ways to do this and the many after-market action sets by Kubota and others to make this easy and efficient.Strongly suggest anyone getting into wedding photography or making the transition to digital from film purchase first the excellent book \\"Digital Wedding Photography\\" by Glen Johnson. Then fill in the gaps with books such as Bambi's - though I believe her 2000 book was better than this latest one which is largely a cosmetic makeover."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"This book is definately pretty to look at and it offers a few tips that any amateur photographer could make good use of, but the title is certainly misleading and overall its not a good buy if you're hoping to learn something. I found it to be very light on practical wedding photography information and heavy on photos.... It might answer your basic \\"what\\" questions, but it doesn't come close to answering any \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" questions. If you're looking for a book with several beautiful pictures that would look great on your coffee table, than this book is for you, but if you're actually hoping to learn something, I'd recommend buying something else."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"I returned this book after the first read. As a new wedding photographer I admire Cantrell's style and her first book was excellent, thus I had high expections for her second book which covered digital wedding photography. It seems as if she was distracted in writing this book. The explanations regarding equipment, dealing with the wedding couple, pricing, are vague and the explanations tired and repetetive, and many of the photos are out of focus and grainy. Definitely not of the quality and caliber of her first writing endeavor. If one is buying this book searching for ideas on how to effectively manage your digital workflow, deal with jpeg vs. raw, eye-candy photos for inspiration for one's one work, and digital techniques for wedding photography, you will not find it here.

I'm impressed with the flow, the writing and the images featured in this new book. My only complaint is that it took 2 years to actually be released, the suspence was enough to kill a person! Compared to her first book, this one has all new images, new ideas and new advice. I've been a pro wedding photojournalist for 6 years now and from a professional stand point I learned a number of things from it. It's also written in a way that anyone interested in becoming a photographer could understand.

It talks about breaking the day down into different sections, what the photographer likes to have in her bag, some post-processing filters she uses, etc... However the treatment is on the shallow end in detail.On the back of the book it says \\"... to inspire any bride-to-be and the photographer on her special day.\\" I think as long as your not looking for more than inspiration, this book will be fine, however it does not really go into technical depth on the challenges and techniques to handle those challenges that a wedding photographer will encounter.It's really aimed more at inspiration than instruction."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"As a wedding photographer, I tend to collect books like this one.

I rarely read technical books cover to cover, but this one I did!"},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"Bambi Cantrell is, quite simply, a legend in the wedding photography industry, both as a shooter and educator. Skip Cohen has impressive credentials of his own, as president of Hasselblad USA, and now a guiding force of The Rangefinder Magazine and WPPI. If there is anything about wedding photography that these two luminaries don't know, it's not worth knowing.That's why I was so pleased to see just how successful their collaboration was in this book. It showcases gorgeous photos, features useful professional tips, and provides an inspiring basis for raising the bar on the quality of your work. It's suitable both for new photographers looking for an introduction, and for wedding veterans who want to add useful techniques to their repertoires. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"This book has some cute pictures in it, but most of the info is misleading like how to find dust on your lens/sensor on your digital, they say to shoot wide open at a light source but everyone knows you stop your lens down to f/16+ to see dusty sensors or lenses. Alot of the pictures look amature at best, and the use of Nik filters on alot of them just does not look right.The print is a so so job, alot of the pictures look like blobs, but then again that might be from the original photo.I can only recommend this book if you find it on sale for under $9."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"I have her other book, the Art of Wedding Photography and it is simply amazing.As far as the previous idiot reviewer - it's obvious you're not a pro or a photographer of any sort to even talk about Bambi's work.

It came to me highly recommended and I can not agree more. Every detail covered and lots of style... Good work"},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"This book covers some basics of wedding photography, although there isn't much here that can't be found in any other relatively recent how-to book on the subject. Many of the photo examples in the book show technical problems (out of focus probably the most common one), along with a lot of hokey post-processing like colored flowers on a desaturated background. Lots of filter use, lots of infrared, lots of (maybe even excessive) camera tilt, cross processing - all of these \\"techniques\\" were already in use before digital, so there's nothing new here, really. The main problem, however, is that this book doesn't go into much detail of how to actually do most of these effects digitally. It just shows you what a certain piece of commercial software can do. In short, this book is really just a thinly veiled sales brochure for certain brands of gear and software, and not an impressive one at that."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"This book sets itself apart by providing the exposure information of every photo, and when relevant, the lighting information too (think the cake shots). This alone makes it a keeper because it allows you to better visualize yourself as the photographer. For instance, the focal length tells you where you would have been standing.Another notable strength of this book is the coverage of a wide variety of techniques. For example, those who have come to rely on auto-focus cameras may struggle on the dance floor. Not if you know the \\"zone focusing\\" technique highlighted in this book.In general, I find the coverage adequate and the photos inspiring. Some reviewers fault the postprocessing part of the book but really it is just a gallery demonstration of what can be done easily with photoshop filters. The subjects of postprocessing and retouching are better covered in other books.I highly recommend this book and its pre-digitalpredecessorfor those who are already familiar with photography but want to get started at weddings."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"Stunning images and inspiration here! Get this book! And get Glen Johnson's too. The only thing you will find that is a bit odd (but it also makes me feel good in a way, shows pros like Bambi have the same struggles as me!) is that quite a few of the sample images have problems - too dark, blurry or both dark and fuzzy. This is the same problem I have in dark, church settings.This may not be the place for it, but can anyone recommend a good book on ON CAMERA flash photography (using hot shoe, on and off camera external flashes)? I love 'Understanding Exposure; Revised Edition', every photography needs to read that! But when you add a speedlite (Canon, Nikon or other) the rules change and everything tends to be way too dark, or way over exposed. Anyone found a book that helps with that? For now, it is just trial and error for me, even with the super, ETTL powers that come with our super modern flashes. I don't want to but a Quantum light when I struggle with even mastering the manufactures flash."},{"Title":"The Art of Digital Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style (Amphoto)","review":"This book has excellent recommendations and techniques for capturing the most beautiful wedding photos.

A book to be used again and again, not just for information, but for pleasure."},{"Title":"Music","review":"The Eyewitness Books series is the gold standard for young readers. This volume focuses on \\"Music.\\" The subtitle provides some context: \\"Discover how music is made in close-up--from the most primitive to the most modern instruments.\\" Neil Ardley is the writer for this volume, and deserves much credit. And, as always, the illustrations are top notch.The first segment, \\"Seeing sound,\\" provides a brief introduction as to why different instruments sound differently. There are several examples showing how (Page 6) \\"The sound wave from each instrument makes its own kind of pressure changes. These can be shown by curved and jagged lines that are called waveforms. . . .\\" So, kids will learn a little physics by the side door! The examples are nicely illustrated on page 7.Thereafter, the book explores each family of instruments, one by one. From wind instruments to pipes/flutes to brass to strings (early and later) to harps to guitars. Later the book examines electrifying music and the rock guitar! The final section focuses on \\"Machine music,\\" such as synthesizers. Again, the examples illustrated on pages 62-63 will make this discussion \\"real\\" for youth who read this volume.One nice feature is the consideration of older instruments. For instance, pages 28-29 looks at \\"early and unusual strings,\\" including fiddles from Norway, the Middle East, and the Mongols. Other examples are also provided.So, all in all, another nice book for young readers. I congratulate myself that I was wise enough to buy this and many other works for my son a decade and a half ago, even though I'm not sure that I put that much thought into acquiring these wonderful works."},{"Title":"DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND OTHER TOPICS IN BIBLICAL GREEK","review":"All the essays in this book are helpful, but there are three that are outstanding. The first is Stanley Porter's survey of discourse analysis in New Testament studies. He describes the different schools of thought and their methods of discourse analysis. This is a very helpful essay for clarifying the similarities and differences in DA of NT. The second essay is Jeffrey Reed's essay on identifying theme in the NT. He centers his thoughts on the concept of prominence in text and how to identify it. Third is another Porter essay, where he attempts to answer the question, \\"How can biblical discourse be analyzed?\\" in response to the attempts by the other authors in the book."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"The book's title is totaly wrong, it should be like DCOM Programming in VC++ with ATL, because that's the only area it focus to, it's good on that though it lacks a lot for being professional, discusess very little DCOM itself."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"This book misrepresents itself. It is anything but &quot;Professional DCOM Programming&quot;. There is little DCOM, almost no coding outside the spoon-feeding wizards of ATL, and no examination of any of the challenging areas of COM/DCOM.The book does singularly impress, however, by taking line honours in a very competitive field: by providing the worst explanation of NT security I have ever read.It is educationally poor, technically unimpressive (despite Dr Grimes attempts to convince us of his expertise with a packet sniffer and a hex editor), and smacks of a quick grab at what at the time was an under-supplied market.If you want to be expert in any of the fields that this book purports to clarify, I suggest you consult the experts."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"This book is very confusing.

I'm a C and Ingres 4GL programmer who needs to get into Microsoft Visual J++ and DCOM, and this was not the book for me. From the earliest chapters, it seemed that the author was eager to explain everything except how to use DCOM and what the point of it was. Long chapters on alternatives to DCOM didn't tell me much about DCOM. It would have been most helpful to learn how to use DCOM using the typical tools available -- J++, VB6, etc. -- rather than discussions of the internals."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"One of the things I like best about this bookis its comparison to other object models, butespecially to RPC.

Everything I need to know about the ins and outs of DCOM is in this book and it is covered in a professional, thorough manner.Note that Dr. Grimes does not cover the tools and techniques for writing DCOM servers (ATL, MFC, VC++), but it is as well that he shouldn't have - that would be distracting and draw focus away from the more challenging tasks addressed by Dr. Grimes. Tools and techniques should be covered separately (as well they are).In addition to all of the DCOM architecture, design and implementation gems covered, I use this book exclusively as my &quot;other-than-Microsoft&quot; reference to MTS. In one chapter Dr. Grimes performs a superior effort in coverage of MTS than is done in SAMS' Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0 (Roger Jennings' Database Workshop), a book entirely devoted to MTS.I look forward to other such efforts of Dr. Grimes being published."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"Learning about DCOM is not easy. Yet, the book makes it very likely that almost any reader with some VC++ background can do it. The entire book, starting from first few &quot;backgrounder&quot; chapters and ending with chapters about NT Services, Multithreading, Microsoft Transaction Server, as well as Appendix, is very useful from both theoretical and practical points of view. Dr. Richard Grimes made sure that his detailed explanation of issues is complemented by good code examples. Besides DCOM-specific things, the author explains (not fully covers, though!) many general topics like COM itself, ATL, and COM Threading Models, which might be helpful for readers without solid background in those areas.

The reason behind this planned obsolesence is obvious, every time they come out with something new people will have to open their wallets to &quot;keep up.&quot;DCOM is just another disposable technology. As such, it was a complete failure; one that the marketing folks at M$ have tried to bury as quickly as possible under an avalanche of .NET hype.DCOM was hard to port because, like COM, it is based on a binary standard (i.e. a standard that changes when you leave x86 and go to 64-bit RISC). Not only that, but DCOM doesn't support distributed transactions. Worst of all, DCOM is a very, very complicated technology to use. Three strikes... YOU'RE OUT!The half-wit MBAs at Micro$oft realized their mistake and have abandoned DCOM, leaving it forever in the backwaters where the only record of its sorry existence are stupid books like this.I have no idea why someone would want to buy this book.

Even if you're not ready yet for the more advanced topics it covers related to remote servers, it has one of the best chapters I've ever read on basic COM architecture (Chapter 3). This book does a great job of mixing diagrams with code and has many sample programs. This is the only book I've seen that does a detailed job of showing how to develop DCOM servers as services. This book is oriented towards C++ developers. In my opinion, this book along with 3 others: Beginnng ATL COM, Professional Active X/COM Programming (both by WROX) and Essential COM (Don Box, Addison Wesley) are must have books for all COM developers."},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"This is perhaps the best book I've ever read covering a technical subject for Windows programming.Introductory chapters include a fine overview of non-distributed COM technology for those new to the topic, while the later chapters go into thorough detail on both the details of interfaces and the reasons those details exist.

The packet sniffing is very useful (Dr Wilson - have you tried to interpret what the packets mean, I've tried it for an RPC application I have developed and I can tell you it is not easy from Microsoft's documentation, Dr Grimes must have put a lot of work in this), so much so that the Eddons' have almost completely copied this chapter in their book!This may not be the most up-to-date book, but it is a classic in COM development!"},{"Title":"Professional DCOM Programming (Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model)","review":"This book fills what the outdated 'Inside OLE' on by bookshelf misses.

Anyone serious about DCOM programming should gain some theoretical knowledge about 'how things work under the hood' and this book is excellent at that. It discusses in detail how the information passes from the client to the server and back, across thread, process and machine boudaries.

From programming point of view, the book gives detail explaination of the subtlties of DCOM programming, concentrate on the difference between DCOM and COM. -- It is not just COM, it is DCOM.

She contends that the bureaucracy of education has worked against many students, resulting in their not learning. Policies, practices, and skills must be changed if education is to be reformed. Some of the changes discussed include decision-making which involves teachers, restructuring time in the schools, organizing staff into teams, creating smaller schools, using authentic assessments, providing opportunities for continuing professional development, and creating standards for student learning. Darling-Hammond describes some of the inequalities that still exist in schools today, such as a lack of funding, resources, and quality teachers. Major policy changes are necessary to improve the schools, and these policies must be considered together with the practices for change to be effective."},{"Title":"The Right to Learn A Blueprint for for Creating Schools That Work","review":"I am immensely impressed by Ms. Darling-Hammond's book. She has presented an incredible about of research and information and done it in an articulate defense of reform--for the student's sake, and ultimately, for everyone's sake.She begins by setting it all in perspective, outlining different waves that have swept over public education over the last fifty years. Later, she identifies nine related components that serve to buttress her reform agenda: active in-depth learning organized around common goals; a focus on authentic performance; attention to student development; appreciation of diversity; collaborative learning; a collective perspective within the school; structures for caring; support for democratic learning; and connections to families and to the community.It sounds obvious, but her clarion writing deserves our attention. Listen to this example: &quot;To engender serious learning, schools must dramatically increase the intellectual opportunities they offer, becoming more focused on developing understanding and competence...becoming more learning-centered as well as learner-centered (p. 32).&quot;She adeptly sets the double conundrum that many teacher currently face: How can test scores be raised adequately in the while in the clasp of financial, cultural, bureaucratic, systemic chains? But she provides viable solutions.She explains how to have learning standards without standardization; she calls for increasing students' opportunities-to-learn, making for actual democratic procedures in the classroom; she asserts how schools can re-structure to allow for identifiable learning. This is powerful stuff.So study this book, and then re-visit it. It's worthy of close scrutiny and it's worthy of action. It needs to be placed into the hands of anyone who cares about education, works within the system, or has children attending public schools. It clearly provides the necessary blueprint for educational reform, as advertised."},{"Title":"The Right to Learn A Blueprint for for Creating Schools That Work","review":"Educators, are you looking for a book to stretch your mind and leave you thinking for hours, possibly days? Are you looking for a book to offer ideas on how to reform your school from within? If your answer is yes, try diving into Linda Darling Hammonds book titled The Right to Learn: A Blueprint for Creating Schools that Work. One warning though, don't try to read this book alone. You will need other educators to plow through its intense thought provoking pages to build a deeper understanding of what Hammond is saying. As you read have a highlighter or sticky tabs in hand because you will want to mark the many well articulated ideas that LDH mentions. She has a way of pointing out the deep roots of problems in education but also offers ideas on how policies can change to improve our nations schools.One phrase that caught my eye early on in the book is this one regarding school accountability; \\"A vicious cycle is launched: the more paperwork teachers are asked to do, the less time they have for teaching; the less time for teaching, the less learning occurs; the less learning, the more the demand for paperwork intended to ensure that teachers are teaching as the bureaucracy insists they should.\\"(p.43) She says here thatthe demand for more paperwork which was intended to improve school accountability in reality undermines productivity because it takes time away from planning and teaching well thought out lessons.Hammond believes that we should strive to teach for understanding more so than covering a lot of curriculum. She strongly believes in the role of professional development in creating depth of understanding in our educators. The chapter that fascinated me the most was on Staffing Schools for Teaching and Learning. She offers several ideas to create smaller class sizes, give teachers more time for planning with their colleagues, as well as taking time for teachers to observe one another. These ideas occur through restructuring the schools and having every certified person in the building teaching at some point in their day and by creating teams that are responsible for a smaller group of students. I felt this could help our site teams think creatively when trying to come up with ways to make class sizes smaller.Research done by Hammond is included in this book as she searched out \\"positive deviants\\" to the difficulties facing public education. Positive deviants meaning schools that found ways to be successful within the same constraints as otherschools. She uses four schools in New York to give examples of schools that are working for creating learning environments that are effective in an age of schools striving to flee the grasp that the factory model of education has traditionally held formuch of the twentieth century. This research is helpful because once again it gives you ideas on how to try things differently to achieve success.One thing that has been a continual difficulty for me with this book is my lack of ability to retain what Hammond is saying without having to refer back to the book. I am not sure if the reason is because it is so packed with heavy information or if my brain is just on overload by the craziness of the amount I am responsible for in my own classroom, and trying to complete a graduate program. I look forward to our discussions in our literature groups hoping that they will lend some clarity or direction with the book but it is such a mass of information. Perhaps if the book was read slower allowing more time todigest what it says and then try putting some of the ideas into immediate action, I would be able to retain more of what I am reading. Perhaps this quote hits the nail on the head; \\"Active learning reflects the old saying, \`I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand.\\" (p. 107) This is a book that will stay nearby so that I can refer back to it, recommend it to others, put its ideas into action and strive toward the belief that all children have the right to learn! It is also an inspiration for educators to stretch ourselves to create a public education system that matches the needs of our time."},{"Title":"The Right to Learn A Blueprint for for Creating Schools That Work","review":"If you want to get angry, read this book. It's a searing indictment of the state of education in our country. We can guarantee poor and minority children the right to state-of-the-art prisons (especially in California), but we can't guarantee them the right to a qualified teacher. LDH does a great job of tracing the historical reasons for public education, and it wasn't to educate a diverse population for living in a democratic society. The have-nots from the past are the have-nots from the present, and a meaningful and useful education is at the core of the disparity. Our country must address these issues to remain globally competitive. LDH establishes how technological and globalization forces makes it imperative that we educate our youth.This is a data-packed book and a must-read. However, if you are happy with the status-quo, you may want to avoid it."},{"Title":"The Right to Learn A Blueprint for for Creating Schools That Work","review":"Book was sent almost immediately after order was placed, and it was in nearly perfect condition. Excellent buy, will definitely use again."},{"Title":"Polling Matters: Why Leaders Must Listen to the Wisdom of the People","review":"This is a fascinating book for me simply because the author nails so many aspects of polls, squarely on the head, especially those polls where the person being asked questions may be to uneducated, uninformed and is actually answering questions based on what they have heard about other poll results, thus a mob rule mentality. The methodology of how he does polls and how others do polls was intriguing. Alas I remember the adage opinion ... everyone has one.... but how was it formed and does it have real value? Having been polled on a few times I wondered how the questions were chosen and worried when answering them that there was a lot of grey area and few questions actually had a yes or no or one size fits all answer."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"In this volume of the Pitt series of mysteries set in late 19th-century London, Charlotte Pitt's sister Emily Ashworth relieves the boredom of mourning following her husband's death (see Cardington Crescent) by going undercover as a lady's maid to help Charlotte and Thomas Pitt uncover a murderer in the exclusive Hanover Close. When Thomas Pitt is asked by his superiors to open a three-year old unsolved mystery, he has no idea that he will put his family--and himself--in so much danger. It is Emily and her great-aunt Vespasia who finally save the day (and Thomas!).Silence in Hanover Close is one of the best books in the series because here we get to see Emily FINALLY get a clue as to how hard life is for the rest of London. I took a great deal of satisfaction in Emily's new recognition of how hard it was to iron perfect ruffles, and learned how to cut and butter paper thin slices of bread for tea (try the method in the book--it really works, and then you can have your friends over for a book discussion complete with English cucumber sandwiches). Thomas' own danger adds a higher level of drama to the conclusion of the case."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":". . .and we do mean that literally. Thomas and Charlotte helped clear her name when her first husband was poisoned. . .now it's her turn to try and do the same for one of them. This is one of the best in the series--and at the same time one of the hardest to read. If you read these books in order of publication, by now you should have come to really care about these characters and what happens to them. Here one of them suffers--and may hang--unjustly. Thank Heaven for Emily and wonderful folks like Great-Aunt Vespasia, who get out of their comfort zones here so that the one whodunnit gets what he--or she--deserves. Brava, Anne Perry!"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"I have read most of the books in this series, so it's plain that I generally enjoy them. Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, along with the others who regularly appear in these stories, are well-developed and plausible characters. By this time, they have become much like old friends and this familiarity adds to their appeal. Perry also does a good job of engaging the interest of the reader by providing mysteries that are intriguing from the start. Also, though I'm not an expert on Victorian London, she seems to do a good job of re-creating that milieu.On the other hand, Perry sometimes makes it plain who the murderer is in her stories by giving you one clearly dysfunctional character. Sometimes, too, her stories virtually turn into morality plays. She will take up some social evil of the period, make it part of her plot, and dwell on it. Finally, Perry has a tendency to end her stories very abruptly, leaving loose ends dangling and making you feeling like you've just stepped off a cliff.This particular installment has all the usual strengths. Charlotte and Emily work to solve the case and save Thomas from a dire fate. The unsolved death of Robert York three years earlier gets Pitt started. The case is re-opened because York's widow is soon to marry a Foreign Office official. York was also with the Foreign Office at the time of his death and some secret papers disappeared at that time, so any possibility of scandal or espionage must be put to rest. During the course of the story, the reader gets a close look at the evils of nineteenth century English prisons, but not more so than fits the story. The mystery deepens as more deaths compicate matters. Perry keeps the reader guessing right up to the end in this one. While the end comes rather abruptly, there aren't too many loose ends in this one, so the reader isn't left hanging so much as in some of Perry's other stories.As a mystery writer, Perry is a step below Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie. Her stories are enjoyable, especially if you've read enough of them to be familiar with the main characters, but the plots aren't usually as difficult to solve. This particular episode, however, is one of her best. A first-rate whodunit that will keep you guessing to the very end. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Perry never fails to weave interesting characters into a complex and compelling story that combines psychological study with a historical overview of the fascinating Victorian milieu. In this novel, however, she has outdone herself. Emily truly comes alive in a clever and dangerous masquerade. The theme of masquerade carries over to the mysterious figure of &quot;Cerise,&quot; the glamorous and possibly treacherous woman for whom Pitt relentless searches before murder can strike again. The end is a complete surprise, both delightful and sad.Perhaps my favorite of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt stories."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Not only are the supporting characters fascinating, but Perry truly plunges into and explores personal turning points for Pitt, Charlotte, and Emily. Some twists are a little too convenient, but one of the most important novels in the series. (I'd suggest reading them chronologically, however.) The ending makes it."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Perhaps I have read and heard too many Perry books. This one finally came out in audiobook. Not to be passed up. However, fairly early in the book I knew what the big surprise would be. Knowing Perry's writing goals, it was obvious, despite the major plot distraction. I knew none of the three \\"detectives\\", and friends, would stumble to it until the end of the book. (More than half the book passes while they wonder and wonder, not exercising their usually efficient brain power.) But they never did. I can't even belatedly feel pleased about someone's cleverness. So it's really a disappointing effort."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"I have only read 2 books by Anne - &quot;Farrier's Lane&quot; and Bluegate Fields&quot;. Anne Perry has shown us a great mystery within a victorian era. My goal is to read all Anne Perry's books. This book is probably the best I have read out of the three. You won't be disappointed whe reading an Anne Perry novel."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Having been a big fan of Agatha Christie all my life, I found Anne Perry to be comparable and just as original. Especially in this book. From the first word to the last, she had me hooked and I read this book in record time.Sadly, against the advice of others, I read this book first instead of starting the series with \\"Cater Street Hangman.\\" I was just so eager because I heard this was the best of the series. While that might be true, I also found that because I read this book first, I kind of ruined it for myself with the previous books becuase I knew how things would turn out. So my advice is read this, but start with \\"Cater Street Hangman\\" if you are new to the Pitt series. (And believe me, after reading this one, you'll WANT to read the others.)"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Ninth in the Thomas Pitt series by Anne Perry, Charlotte, Thomas Pitt's wife, and her sister, Emily, play major roles in helping Pitt with his investigation of an unsolved murder in the upperclass neighborhood of Hanover Close. In this book, Silence in Hanover Close, the author, I believe for the first time, toys with treason and its cover up as a possible motive for murder. It turns out not to be the case but, as with all Anne Perry's Pitt mysteries, the motive and the murderer are revealed in the final pages.I loved the intricate plotting, the main characters, the minor characters, the portrayal of the mysterious figure, the woman in cerise. Perry evokes the Victorian age with a deft hand, and paints a picture in this book of the rigors of a life in service as well as the state of prisons in Victorian England."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"I like Anne Perry in general. Don't read too many in a row because they are all essentially the same... not entirely great mysteries surrounded by extensive social commentary. Excellent social commentary, very interesting, insightful, etc... but it slows down the plot to a snail's pace. Reading one once in a while is nice... but don't indulge in many at a time or you'll be disappointed in the plot and pace and rather bored with the social commentary. (at least, I was... and it was one of the selling points early on in the series...)"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Inspector Thomas Pitt of the London Metropolitan Police in the late 1880s faces one of his more grueling cases in this ninth book in the series when he's asked to reopen the investigation into the murder three years before of a high official in the Foreign Office. His death was thought to be the result of a bungled burglary, but maybe not. Now the widow is contemplating remarriage, to another F.O. employee, and the Powers That Be want to make sure there will be no unexpected embarrassment on either side -- or that's what Pitt is led to believe, anyway. Hanover Close is a short cul-de-sac in which the three principal families are interrelated and know each other well, which limits things. Pitt speaks to the servants, all of whom had told their stories before, but one ladies' maid remembers an oddity -- a woman in cerise, flitting about in the middle of the night. And the next day, the maid is dead, too. Charlotte Pitt, who married considerably beneath herself, is familiar with the ins and outs of Society and contributes her own skills, but it's her sister, Emily, bored widow of Lord Ashworth (murdered in a previous book in the series) who risks the most, going undercover as a ladies' maid herself. And then Pitt finds himself in a very serious situation, suspected of murder himself. There's much less of the social commentary that Perry usually lards each of her novels with, except for an interesting and somewhat amusing view of below stairs through the eyes of a relatively high-born lady."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"I thought the end was very abrupt, not knowing how or who got Pitt out of jail or who the conspirators were."},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"I have read and love all her books, but this one takes you back a bit and it does not disappoint"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Great bookAnyone that has the time please read all of the books by Anne PerrySILENCE in Hanover close"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"This was a really good Charlotte & Thomas Pitt story.

Now his widow, Veronica, is planning to marry a Foreign Office colleague of her late husband; and Inspector Thomas Pitt is assigned to re-open the still unsolved murder case. No one in authority really cares who killed Robert York. They only want to be sure that marrying Veronica York will not embarrass her new fiance, and they think this necessary because certain information has gone missing.The trail leads Pitt to a witness who lies dead, and the scene is set to make Pitt look like the killer. With her husband locked up in the horrors of Newgate, Charlotte Pitt quickly realizes that his superintendent is perfectly happy for Pitt to be hanged if that's what it takes to make sure the York murder case goes away. So it's up to Charlotte, her sister Emily Ashworth (a recently widowed and thoroughly bored noblewoman), and Emily's friend Jack Radley to prove Pitt's innocence. Meanwhile, the reader gets a frightening picture of how Victorian working class society treats the family of an accused murderer.This fairly early entry in the still on-going Pitt series is a real page turner. Even if one knows from having read subsequent books how things must surely turn out, the suspense builds and with it concern for the familiar characters. Perry's understanding of the time and place gives the story an absolutely authentic frame, and in this case that matters even more than usual. Super reading!--Reviewed by Nina M.

In my effort to learn from other authors and editors, however, and thus become a better novelist myself, I was reading Donald Maass'Writing the Breakout Novel.Maass, who is Perry's agent, refers to \\"Silence in Hanover Close\\" as her \\"breakout\\" novel, attributing her increased sales from that point forward to the enlarged premise of this story --- not just crime, but a crime that may also be treason.The murder of an important employee of the British Foreign Office, and the disappearance of documents which might be relevant to important negotiations with the Germans about dividing up Africa (this in the late 1800s), certainly provides the higher stakes. Perry takes this possibility and develops an exciting detective story.The unorthodox work of Charlotte and Emily, while Thomas is \\"otherwise detained,\\" was a pleasure to savor, and of course there are all the period details that make reading Perry's work so much fun.There's also a major surprise at the end, one that I did not intuit, which brings together all of the unexplained threads that had me properly puzzled. If I have any criticism of the book, it's that the ending comes about a little too quickly. But it's a good one.If you'd like to see more of my comments about \\"Silence in Hanover Close,\\" I refer you to my \\"Education of a Novelist\\" blog which you can reach by searching the web for \\"weinstein education of a novelist\\".You are of course invited to consider my just-published NYC-based legal thrillerA Good Conviction, which tells the heart-wrenching story of a young man wrongly imprisoned in Sing Sing for a murder he did not commit by a Manhattan ADA who may have known he was innocent, and also my historical novel,The Heretic (Library of American Fiction), describing the persecution of a family of secret Jews by the Catholic Church on the eve of the Spanish Inquisition.LEW WEINSTEIN"},{"Title":"Silence in Hanover Close","review":"Anne Perry has done an excellent job with letting us view more of the human side of Thomas Pitt. While investigating the 3 year old murder of a member of the London consulate, Pitt continues to examine his own emotions regarding society, prostitution and his own family life. Additionally, Pitt begins to express anger at the well defined hierarchy of the London police. Charlotte takes a bit of a back seat in this novel as her sister Emily is moved to the forefront of the mystery. Although a bit contrived, based on her character in other Pitt novels, Emily enters the house in question as a lady's maid. Emily too begins look internally and examine her own mindset and treatment of domestic help. The ending of this thriller is a sad as it is shocking when the veil of deceit is finally lifted.

Over the course of the story, Ase is confronted with trials set upon him by family members. The story is surrounded by the theme of Ase recognizing his failures with his children, mother, and wife. He desperately wants to share with them his thoughts and feelings, but is unable to effectively articulate what he wants to communicate. This literary effort greatly contrasts with Marjorie Rawlings' earlier Florida writings. Critics tend to be hard on The Sojourner, probably due the enormous success of her previous Florida based novels. This criticism is unfounded.

It's usually the case where the movie adaptation of a book strips down the characters and pursues fewer plot lines than the book. But in this sad, bump-along novel, it's just the opposite.The &quot;Natural&quot; doesn't stand the test of time. Maybe way back in the day you could have invented a Roy Hobbs and the anti-hero story would be received as edgy and avant garde. But it's hokey now and too simplistic: the would-be hero who can't prevail because he chases what's bad for him and ensures his own destruction in spite of tremendous &quot;natural&quot; talent. We're not surprised by the ending at all. We expect it. We get it. We saw it play out in the last presidential administration. We're sick of it.It's one thing for a novel to be dark, it's another for that darkness to get in the way of the narrative, character development, and so on. Which is exactly what I loved so much about the movie. Remember those great scenes with Wilfred Brimley and the assistant coach? Remember when they were whistling to each other, playing &quot;name that tune?&quot; Those two characters have absolutely no depth at all in this book. The manager's reduced to a grouchy head of steam full of resentment and doubt for everyone. The assistant coach is just a box of fortune cookies come alive, kicking out hayseed credos and cutting the tension here and there. People we thought we KNEW by the end of the movie barely have any narrative power ripple over them in this book.Some of the pitiful contrivances are out-of-this world corny, implausible, or irrelevant: Roy's chance meeting with Memo, his gargantuan appetite, his magic tricks. Pages which should have been devoted to developing Roy's internal crisis and his unpreparedness for the world around him are wasted with vaudevillian-style hijinks where one character &quot;gets over&quot; on another.Hat's off to the writers of this movie. I didn't know they had to stretch this far to make such a great film. I've no problem with sad endings and disappointments, just don't play me &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; for 250 pages and call it &quot;Ave Maria.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Why would a well-rounded baseball player bring down his team's chances of winning a championship game?

A team needs everyone to contribute and if one person lets up, it could bring the rest of the team down. In this book, Roy brings the team down in a couple of different ways. He started letting the team down after he replaced the best player on the team who had recently passed away. He did not care about being a team player as he said to Harriet, a lady he met on the bus, &quot;I bet some day I will break every record for throwing and hitting&quot;(pg.30). These dreams of wealth and power set him up for failure. Also, shortly after the team started winning, Roy had fallen into a major league slump and the whole team fell apart. This left them wandering if they would ever recover from their losing streak.His decision making about women was less then desirable. Some of the decisions he made didn't make sense. First, he fell for a women named Memo Paris shortly after he noticed her for the first time. He didn't even know her and he was determined to meet her. After her boyfriend died, she hung out with him and blamed him for Bump's death. Throughout the book, she had been setting him up for disaster. All she wanted was his money and fame. He didn't even realize she was using him. Later in the book, he meets another lady named Iris, who helped him break out of his slump. She was very understanding and kind to him. But he insisted on dating Memo even though Iris was pregnant with his child.Anther reason I think this book has a negative effect on readers is by the way he handled himself around his coach. His coach, Pop Fisher, gave him a significant amount of playing time. During the team's slump, the coach decided to hire a hypnotist to make the players focus better. Roy opposed the coach and said, &quot;I might be on the team, but no medicine man is going to hypnotize me&quot;(pg.75). So, the coach benched him and Roy became angry. They also had a disagreement when Roy refused to try a different bat during his slump. The coach said, &quot;When will you get rid of that danged Wonderboy and try some other stick?&quot; Roy replies, &quot;Never&quot;(pg.150). If anyone tried that in today's game of baseball, they would be assessed a harsh punishment. I disapproved when Roy thought he was above everyone else and thought he did not have to listen or answer to anyone. This showed that the coach had no control and he was taken avantage of by Roy.I also disagree with the characters that were portrayed throughout the story along with the ending itself. When Harriet Bird, the women Roy met on the train, heard that Roy had a chance to be the best in the league, she decided to try and kill him by firing a bullet into his stomach. This had no relevance to the story and it seemed unusual.I also didn't like the way the owner of Roy's major league team ran the organization. Judge Goodwill Barns, the owner of the Knights, tried to find an easy way to make money and loose the pennant. Roy said, &quot;Twenty-five thousand dollars for dropping a game is not enough&quot; and the Judge replied, &quot;Thirty and no more&quot;(pg.228). Roy did squeeze the money out of the Judge and he was satisfied. I think that was quite selfish of the owner to do this to his team by buying off a player.At the end of the game, the little boy turned to Roy and asked, &quot;Say it ain't true, Roy&quot;(pg.262). He was unable to respond and felt guilty and realized he had lost everything again. The conclusion of the story had a negative impact when the Judge paid him to lose the game and when the boy approached Roy.This book has negativity because of Roy's bad decisions, Roy inability to listen to his coach, unable to fit in and worked toward being a team player and chose to be around shady characters. Roy was unable to stay focussed throughout the season and he chose women and money over his morals. If had chosen a different major league team, he might not have experienced his downfall and loneliness."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I had to read this for class and was appalled at the prevailing message of despair and falling heroes and depravities such as rape. Please don't read this, it makes me sad to think of any one else having to suffer through this for a depressing ending. It's like Sweeney Todd; it doesn't get better."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Malamud's novel brings forth what all of what is good about literature and all that is bad about some fiction.Malamud's prose is certainly qualified and capable. He writes in a terse voice and conveys the story quite effectively.However, if you are expecting this novel to resemble the movie, you will be sadly disappointed. The book chronicles the life of protagonist Roy Hobbes as he strives to make his way into the immortal legends of baseball. Some might say that this novel is more realistic than the movie of the same name, and with that I will not argue. But, the movie differs from the book almost completely in tone.This is a much darker and more depressing novel than most would expect. The travails of Hobbes's life have clearly made him jaded and suspect, the final proof being his willingness to sell his dignity and glory of the game for personal profit.While I was not entirely expecting the Hollywood fantasy that was portrayed in the movie, I had hoped for something more than this dreary piece of literature that Malamud has offered.Hobbes is a character with few qualities to admire, and a protagonist that makes it hard to feel sympathy for.If you loved the movie, do not read this book--you will be dismayed, at best."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"If you want to read a well written book, this one is for you. If you want to read a good story, skip it. The author toys with the reader (or allows the reader to fool themselves) by making you think this is going to be a boy is good, bad thing happens, boy turns bad, man redeams himself story. The best line from the book that sums up the book and Roy Hobbs is &quot;Say it ain't true, Roy&quot;. When you finish the last five pages you will be thinking the same thing."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"considering the fame of this novel, I had the right to expect something more instead of a silly plot (very predictable and full of clich&eacute;) and a not particularly interesting style. I don't know what the main character stands for, but really it has taught me nothing."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural was very disappointing. It seemed a sports fans pornography. It described women's bodies in such an obscene way that it could make anyone blush. The use of sex to rush out of real life for Roy Hobbs was revolting and extremely dissatisfying. Bernard Malamud made it seem as if a baseball players life is all sex and money. I find this book unsatisfying and an utterly gross picture of the way Malamud describes life. The fantsies of these women were shown as carefree and a perfectly good thing. If one likes to read about sex then, this book would be a wonderful piece of disgusting and defiling literature."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"When it comes to great sports books The Natural has to be one of the best. This great book tells the story of the life of a young man named Roy Hobbs. This young boy is a great baseball player whose abilities on the field just seem to come natural to him, but he makes a couple of bad mistakes that buts him through a lot of bad times in his life.The story introduces Roy as a 19 year old boy looking to accomplish his dream and make it big in the major leagues. This would have happened if not for his bad choice in women, a beautiful but crazy woman who killed famous sports players with a silver bullet, which got him shot. After his near fatal experience his life just went down hill until his mid thirties.When he finally got his chance to make it big in the major leagues he was 34 years old. Even though he was past his prime as many thought as soon as he got his chance he showed everyone that he could play just as good as anyone else. After a good streak and breaking all kinds of records he had brought a last place team into the first place spot. Until once again his choice in women deceived and misused him when a young red head named Memo Paris walks in and tries to take advantage of Roy by making him throw a game, that would put his team into the World Series, just to be able to support her.This is one of the greatest books I have ever read and I would recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a sports fan you will still fall in love with this book because it is not only about baseball it is about greed, money, love, and life. You will also love the writing style, and the ending will send you into a whirl of amazement."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Although the natural is a good story, it is rated lower than its potential due to the Malamud clumsy attempt at literary devices. Due to their overambundance, one is distracted from the story and is concentrarting on the method in which this novel was written. Atheletes foot should never be used as a literary metaphor. The one device which I enjoyed utilized in the book, was the telling of the same basic story arc for the careers of many characters including youngberry at the end."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In \\"The Natural,\\" Bernard Malamud writes a novel that is part Raymond Chandler and part, well, Bernard Malamud.The characters talk in a kind of Chandler-like way, using clich&eacute;s from four or five decades back; however the book is anything but a clich&eacute;. They speak the way they do because they are largely simplistic, unsophisticated losers hoping to catch the one lucky break that in their hearts they know will always elude them.Roy Hobbs, the baseball star, and in fact all of the characters are tragicomic figures. When Hobbs finally makes it to the big leagues, it looks at first like he's broken the curse that's followed him all his life. His bat is called \\"Wonderboy,\\" and it's a nickname that could have applied to Hobbs had he started out in the pros earlier.In the end both Hobbs and Wonderboy end up broken in two. Littered around them are a cast of \\"The Natural\\" characters who as worn as a baseball jersey at season's end.The Natural really finds its voice (and its tragedy) in the final few chapters. Even when Hobbs tries to do the morale thing at the last of all possible moments, the breaks just won't fall his way. You turn the final page knowing that for him they never will."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural, by Bernard Malamud, is a wonderful piece of literature. It is an explanation of human nature through use of baseball analogies. The story begins with Roy Hobbs, a promising 19 year-old baseball player, on a train ride to Chicago, for a tryout with the Cubs. Through a long and complex chain of events, Harriet Bird, an athlete-hating murderess shoots Roy in the stomach, seriously injuring him.Fast-forward 15 years...The New York Knights are a cellar-dwelling team, and their coach, Pop Fisher is extremely exasperated with his team's performance. Suddenly, in the middle of another pathetic performance, the now-34 year-old Roy appears on the scene, and declares that he is the team's new left fielder. Since Roy has a contract, he is allowed to &quot;sit on the bench, like the other \`all-stars'&quot;. Meanwhile, Roy becomes attracted to Memo Paris, the niece of Pop Fisher. Coincidentally, Memo is in love with Bump Baily, the starting, self-centered left fielder. During practice Roy displaces his incredible talent, and sparks the team to work harder, including the lazy Bump. During one game, Bump is chasing a fly ball, and runs into the concrete wall, which causes his death. Roy takes his place in the starting lineup, though the fans are skeptical of his ability. Roy immediately grabs headlines with his incredible hitting, amazing fielding, and his heads up play.Fans start saying that Roy deserves more than the $3,000 dollars that Judge Banner, the skinflint owner, is paying him. Roy asks Banner for a raise, and Banner turns him down cold. The fans, loyal to their hero, organize a Roy Hobbs Day, in which Roy promises to be the best player ever. Right after that, Roy goes into a slump, and the suddenly soaring Knights resume their losing streak. When he comes out of his slump, Roy battles with all his might for the Knights to win the pennant. Before the few final games of the tight race, Roy gets appendicitis. Banner visits him in the hospital, and offers him a large sum of money to throw the playoff game between the Knights and the Pirates. The ending of the story is a true stunner.I would recommend this novel to anybody, but especially to baseball fans. My only hint is that Roy is reminiscent of Shoeless Joe Jackson in more than one way. Also, the Knights are reminiscent of the 1962 New York Mets, and episodes that they go through are really takeoffs of moments in baseball. The story of human nature, and how it dominates even the immortality of heroes."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"At first I was forced to read this book. I didn't want to really it sounded very boring. But when I began to compare how the book relates to the &quot;American Dream&quot; I found that I was quickly drawn it the plot. It is a very rich story of a normal man (Roy Hobbs) and his strive to be what everyone wants to be, the best. He keeps valiantly on his steady search. Though he stumbles on the bumps in the road, he keeps going. In his pursuit of happiness he experiences joy, sadness, loss and even love."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am a great admirer of THE NATURAL. In my seldom humble opinion, I consider it superior to the Robert Redford movie, though I loved the film. The novel is darker than the motion picture. The book ends differently than the movie. In THE NATURAL, Mr. Malamud creates a modern American myth with suggestions of links to the Arthurian Legend. Hobbs, the eventual star of the New York Knights, is the flawed hero born with the potential to be the greatest who ever was. This story tells the tale of his hardships, his heroic accomplishments, and his larger-than-life failures. I loved the way Malamud mixed actual baseball lore in with the invented events of his story, but I don't want to give away too many more specifics in the fear of ruining the novel for people who haven't yet read it. THE NATURAL is a great book on many levels. It's not just about baseball. It's about life. (But isn't life what baseball is really about?)"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The book, The Natural, is an excellent book because of the valuable lessons that the reader learns from reading the book. Bernard Malamud creates very realistic characters in a realistic plot to teach the reader that you need to step up to the plate in order to be successful in life. In the beginning of the story, Roy uses his inexperience to strike out the Whammer, who at the time was one of the greatest baseball players in the world. Unfortunately, Roy is shot by a woman, keeping him out of baseball for fifteen years. When he returns to baseball at the age of 34, he joins the struggling New York Knights and leads them to win the pennant. The conflict in the story that makes it a good read is that Roy is very susceptible to women and this causes him to go into a slump. At the end of the book, Roy is now faced with a phenomenal rookie, who symbolizes Roy when he was young. Roy is unable to step up to the plate, and the rookie pitcher ends up striking out Roy, showing that Roy had given up on baseball and on life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it because it is not just about baseball, but it is about valuable lessons in life that Roy learns in order to be successful in the real world."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I liked the book because it was about sports and I like sports' books. I woul recommmend this book because The Natural by Bernard Malamud is a wonderful work of literature that can be enjoyed by anyone to learn about the many hardships of life. Malamud uses the appropriate theme of success and failure to demonstrate to his readers the challenges we often face in life that we eventually overcome. I highly recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading about the trials and tribulations of characters in a great novel. The main element that Bernard Malamud uses in The Natural is the theme of success and failure. He talks about how Roy failures and how Roy succeeds in the game of baseball. Roy Hobbs is a young man just starting out in life. He's on his way to a major league baseball tryout when his agent dies. He meets Harriet Bird and visits her in her hotel room, and she shoots him. This is only the beginning of Roy Hobbs' many trials and tribulations in The Natural. This major complication sets Roy back many years in his desired career. . He does not return to the league until he is thirty-four years old. Everyone on his team feels as if he will be no good. As he begins to receive playing time, everyone realizes just how naturally talented he really is. He is soon on top of everything, but the nosy sports writer, Max Mercy, keeps trying to find out about Roy's past life. He also has to deal with Bump Baily, the team bully, and Memo Paris, the girl Roy thinks is his true love. Judge Banner, the owner of the baseball team, also always seems to be out to get Roy. Roy Hobbs has to figure out his own problems both on and off the field. Roy also feels as if he will become a hero, but then he gets into an awful hitting slump. He also falls ill right before a major play-off game. He then falls in love with Iris Lemon, which causes even more complications. Overall I thought that Bernard Malamud wrote a good book about how a man struggled to make it to the major leagues and when he got there he was one of the best players on the team.

During this time, the story reveals Roy's character flaws.

Different from the movie, may shock some people but without a doubt an American classic, if only all books were this captivating."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Bernard Malamud's exceptional debut novel is the finest tale ever told about baseball. And yet it transcends its baseball setting to become a mesmerizing tale about how someone possessed by greatness fails to overcome his demons and ultimately falls far short of his promise. There are echoes of the Arthurian legends in Malamud's depiction of Roy Hobbs, the flawed hero, most notably with regards to Hobbs' bat &quot;Wonderboy&quot; (It certainly reminds me of King Arthur's sword Excalibur.). Anyone interested in reading a riveting tale about one man's tenuous hold on greatness should read &quot;The Natural&quot;. Without question, it is one of the finest works of American fiction published in the last half of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is an exceptional novel. Like so many other outstanding works of fiction, it operates on several different levels. It's a great story about baseball. It has many parallels to the legends of King Arthur.

His happiness only comes when he surrenders to the forces which guide his life."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is a book that uses outstanding imagery to portray the lifestyle of a major league hero to a flawed homeric character.

Just read it."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"It's extremely rare that I think the movie version of anything is better than the original book. It's even rarer that I really like the movie and really dislike the book - this may be the first time - but not necessarily for the obvious reasons.Like a lot of people, I saw the movie multiple times before getting the book. While I like the movie, I don't really require the fairy tale ending. In fact, I was drawn to the book because I was interested in reading a darker, more realistic version of the story. So, my issue with the book is not simply that it lacks the Hollywood happy ending. My problem was that even in a darker story about an anti-hero there still needs to be something redeeming in the characters or the message to make the read worth more than just something to occupy your time. I didn't get anything out of the book, and felt like I wasted my time at the end.I find Malamud's writing style a bit annoying, but he is extremely good at creating the characters and their world in a believeable way. I think he probably portrays a pretty accurate picture of pro baseball in that time period. However, I found nothing remotely redeeming or sympathetic in the main characters of the story. While his Roy Hobbs is realistic, he is an all-around dislikeable person, who spends most of his time groping women and then getting pissed-off when they won't reciprocate. Except for being shot at the beginning of the book, all of his problems are essentially his own fault and the result of making every decision wrongly based on his ignorance.I suppose that's the point of the story, but that only works if we have some kind of empathy for him in the end. I had none - not even a tiny bit. There was an excellent opportunity at the end of the book for him to finally do the right thing concerning Iris, but we are left to draw the conclusion that he does not. None of the other main characters, while realistically portrayed, had anything that made me interested in what happened to them.It seems like the screenwriters took the best elements of the book and gave it the Hollywood treatment for the movie, which actually does work well. Personally, I would have liked to have seen something more realistic and a bit less fairy tale. I thought the book would give me that, but it did not. The best version for me would be something in-between the two. I may give one of Malamud's later books a try, but as far as this one goes, you may want to skip the book and just enjoy the movie (and it really pains me to say that)."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"...There seem to be two divergent opinions on this book and its relationship with the movie. Some say that the movie is another example of Hollywood creating simply another happily-ever-after flick for public consumption, out of a greatly different novel. Others state that the movie gave us a moving portrait of a true hero and a tale of redemption. I believe that both are true. The book is fantastic, but not in the traditional baseball sense. If you were to imagine that Roy was not a ballplayer but an actor or farmer--a position from which we don't crave heroes, The Natural would be an unquestionably great novel in everyone's mind. But, I, like many of these reviewers am an avid baseball fan. Something I'm not sure Malamud is. If he is, something turned him off. He was born too late for the Black Sox scandal, so it's probably just player greed. Not a single ballplayer in this novel is any way simpathetic: Roy is a glutton with a massive ego, Bump an arrogant showman, and the rest simply womanizing drinkers. In some ways I agree that modern ballplayers are a similar lot (Bonds, Henderson, A-Rod). It is in this light I enjoy the movie, in which Roy isn't as simple and ego-driven. He is an honest, hard-working hero, who teaches the care-free, partying guys on the team a thing or two about dedication and hard-work. I think this is a solid case for a book and its movie both being fantastic artistic works but with wholly separate messages."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In the novel, The Natural, Malamud demonstrated that a man's will to succeed, no matter what obstacles he faces on his journey, will bring him great reward. The saying, \\"Never give up\\" is used frequently in life to encourage people to move forward for the sake of success. This man succeeded even after being shot and having his dreams shattered. Bernard Malamud, in The Natural, used Roy Hobbs' strength and courage to get across the idea that anything is possible with hard work and devotion. Roy Hobbs was shot in a Chicago Hotel Room while being scouted by the Chicago Cubs. Initially, his injury was thought to have ruined his career, but after numerous years of recovery, he was able to return to the baseball diamond and become the best in baseball. Roy Hobbs had the ability to play any position from right field to pitcher, and he could hit the ball better than anyone else in the league. He demonstrated his courage when riding on a train to Chicago, he agreed to a bet in which he had to strike out Walter \\"The Whammer\\" Wambold, the best hitter in baseball. Roy Hobbs was to strike out \\"The Whammer\\" for ten dollars and on three straight pitches. At first, Roy did not want to take part in the bet, but his manager, Sam Simpson, convinced him to do so. \\" Sam, I wish you hadn't bet that money on me, Roy said.\\" He was not interested in striking Walter Wambold out; he agreed to do it because he was asked by his manager. Roy's manager caught for Roy and \\"The Whammer's\\" manager, Max Mercy, called strikes and balls. He wished to take no warm-up pitches; he was clearly ready for \\"The Whammer.\\" Roy blew two fastballs right \\"down the pipe\\" for two strikes that literally knocked his manager over. \\" The third ball slithered at the batter like a meteor, the flame swallowing itself...the Whammer understood he was, in the truest sense of it, out.\\" Roy Hobbs demonstrated his courage and confidence when he wished to take no warm-up pitches before attempting to strike out the best hitter in baseball, and he demonstrated his strength when he overpowered \\"The Whammer\\" and struck him out. This was a high point for both Roy and his manager because it proved to them that Roy had what it took to succeed in major league baseball. Roy Hobbs returned to baseball to prove once again that he had what it took to become the best in baseball and to achieve his goal of succeeding in baseball. He was placed on a team called, The Knights, who had not been doing so well in their present season and desperately needed a prospect to pull them out of the gutter. Roy Hobbs was indeed that prospect, but the coaches had yet to learn his capabilities. Roy did not play at first, but then the coach saw his hitting and fielding ability at a practice and started him in right field from then on. This is a prime example of how Roy displayed his courage and confidence. He was disappointed that he was not playing, but he did not let his anger get the best of him; he simply waited until he had the opportunity to show the coaches his athletic talents. Roy's confidence and enthusiasm spread throughout the team; the Knights improved their season and made it to the championship game. Unfortunately, Roy's wound from being shot got infected and was not in great condition. Roy had to be placed in a hospital and was told that playing in the championship game could mean the end of his baseball career. Roy did not care what the doctor's had to say; he was determined to play in the game and he did, even against the doctor's orders. He may not have been physically prepared for the game, but he was still willing to give it his best. \\" When the players began drifting into the clubhouse, they were surprised to see Roy there. He was wearing his uniform and slowly polishing wonderboy\\"(name for his bat). Roy played well in the game although he was struggling to throw, run, field, and hit. The Knights had their last at bats with a man on third and Roy Hobbs up to bat. Blood was seeping through his uniform from the wound. Roy wanted to bunt to bring in the tying run, but missed the opportunity. He struck out, but he was not disappointed. He had succeeded in playing in the game and accomplishing his goals; he had nothing to be ashamed of. Roy Hobbs displayed his devotion, strength, and courage by playing in a game that could have possibly ended his career. He made the commitment to his teammates, and he held his side of the bargain. Roy Hobbs was a man with enormous strength and courage and he demonstrated both of those qualities throughout the novel. He was a good role model for others. His teammates would have never made it as far into the season as they had without the support from Roy Hobbs. Roy's strength and courage can serve as a model for people who lack these two qualities. He is a prime example of a person who succeeded after facing numerous obstacles. Bernard Malamud was responsible for illustrating the qualities of Roy Hobbs in his novel and he did an exceptional job of explaining how anything is possible with hard work and devotion."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I am a baseball enthusiast who enjoys reading and watching baseball stories, factual or fiction. The book &quot;The Natural&quot; seemed to me to be a bit flatter than the movie, perhaps because I have seen the movie about 15 times and only read the book once. I enjoyed the way Redford portrayed Roy Hobbs, making him moral, decent, intelligent, and above all, a hero. To me, the book sort of characterized Roy Hobbs as a bit less intelligent and definately with a rougher edge. The book was a great read in my opinion but my vote between the mediums would have to go to the movies side. The casting for the movie didn't exactly portray the characters as described in the book, however, it was a positive spin that actors Wilford Brimley, Robert Redford and others enhanced these characters with a true grace and emotion meant for the big screen and lovers of baseball history. Definately read this classic piece of baseball fiction, it is with out a doubt the energy that generates the love for America's pastime."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I never realized how different the book version is a compared to the popular motion picture version starring Robert Redford. As many of you know the protagonist, Roy Hobbs was a natural at baseball, but his career is sidetracked by a crazed woman that kills famous sports athletes with a silver bulleted gun right before his tryout with the Chicago Cubs. Roy never had a chance to play with a Major League Baseball club until he was in his mid-thirties and well past his prime and was signed to a minimal salary to play for the NY Knights. Despite his age, Roy played better than anyone else during stretches in the baseball season, and raised the expectations of the Knights ballclub from a bunch of losers to true contenders.In his story, Malamud explains the highs and lows of any sports athlete - being in the zone and hitting slumps. The major differences between Robert Redford performing like Roy Hobbs, and the true Roy Hobbs in Malamud's book, is that Hobbs is not superhuman - or a \\"Wonderboy\\" as his bat exclaims. Robert Redford plays a mysterious Herculean athlete that carries his team to a pennant. Whereas, Malamud's Hobbs is a normal guy with exceptional ballplayer skills - but he makes human mistakes. I think what most readers of \`The Natural' will be most surprised at is the ending of the book - it builds up climatically just as the movie does, however the end is much different. I liked the book very much, and I am an admirer of Malamud's writing style. I recommend the book; I loved the movie, and I comparatively loved the book - but in a different way."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I wish that I would have read the book before I had watched the movie. I went into The Natural expecting to experience an uplifting story of a country boy who makes good, wins over his childhood sweetheart, and lives happily ever after. That, suffice to say, is not the way the book plays out. As a warning, other readers who enter the book with those same sort of narrow expectations will doubtlessly be disappointed somewhere along the way. However, I would be remiss to say that, in spite of the aforementioned let-downs (and perhaps even partly because of them), I found this work to be a facinating read. Malamud details a commentary on life, interspersed with wonderful Arturian allusions, through a saga of the game of baseball. Hobbs' character illustrates that, contrary to the movie's claim, that talent alone is not enough to succeed in life, and the way in which the story unfolds, while admittedly somewhat simple, is entertaining all the same. Once I got into it, I couldn't put the book down. The best advice I could give to readers would be to be open minded of the storyline, and not to limit yourself to preconceived expectations (this assuming you have watched the movie first). In doing so, I expect one will find Malamud's style to be fluid and his tale to be valuable."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In his 1952 novel, Bernard Malamud comments on the role of the hero in the modern world. In order to do so, he parallels Roy, the baseball natural and protagonist, with Percival the Arthurian knight. Roy is on a quest to join the game of baseball at the beginning of the novel. His first failure comes when he answers Harriet Bird's question wrong. When asked what he wants to become as a ballplayer, Roy can think of nothing more than personal gain. By inserting this in his book Malamud implies that many stars are in the game only for themselves. This refers to Percival asking the Fisher King the wrong question and being turned away. After a lapse of about fifteen years, Roy tries again to make it big in the pros. He joins a team called the New York Knights, an obvious relation to Arthurian legend, with the team coach Pop Fisher. Pop not only serves as a parent figure for Roy but he also resembles the Fisher King in the tale of Percival. Roy, who started out as a pitcher and is now a slugger, a reference to Babe Ruth, has made his own bat and dubbed it &quot;Wonderboy&quot;. Roy's hitting is unbelievable while using this bat and he quickly becomes the league slugger. Percival, much like Roy, created his own lance with which to do battle. As Roy continues to increase in popularity, he is confronted with a wish from a dying lad at a hospital. His father asks Roy to hit a home run for his son because that is the only way his son will survive. Roy accepts this challenge and does in fact knock one out of the park for the boy and in doing so saving him. This alludes to Babe Ruth hitting a home run for the same reason. Malamud inserts this into his novel to show that even though most ballplayers are playing for personal gain, some also try to give back to the supporters. In a conversation with Iris Lemon, one of Roy's many loves, they discuss the importance of heroes. Iris, and in essence Malamud, states &quot;Without heroes we're all plain people and don't know how far we can go.&quot; (167) This shows that Malamud respects heroes and expects them to set examples meant to be followed by all. There are many more examples of the hero motif as well as the Arthurian allusions near the end of the story, but in order to not spoil the ending, I will stop. Malamud does not only use these two motifs in his story but also many others such as color scheme, a bird motif, a train motif, and numerous allusions to events in baseball history. Beware though, this novel contains many scenes involving sexual topics. Malamud's use of these literary devices as well as his brilliant descriptions throughout the book make this story a must read for high school students."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural is a powerful work that contains some of the most vivid imagery I have ever read. It is a story of human struggle and redemption through suffering. Roy Hobbs, the protagonist, is a flawed figure whose shortcomings are only surpassed by his ability to hit a baseball. Malamud manages to weave a tale that makes you want Roy Hobbs to succeed to be &quot;the best player ever to play the game.&quot; To its credit the book bears almost no resemblance to the movie of the same name. Roy Hobbs is not Robert Redford! Malamud's use of imagery is well illustrated when a young Roy, on his way to a major league tryout as a pitcher has a showdown at a carnival with the Slammer. Each pitch is described in a way that shows just what a natural Roy is. His first major league at bat is also beautifully described. I must say that this book is not for the squeamish. It is an adult drama, well written and finely crafted. In short this is a book that is about more than baseball yet is baseball in its truest essence."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"A natural is defined as one who has natural talent, especially in baseball. In Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel, The Natural, written in Arthurian legend style, Roy Hobbs leads the New York Knights into victory after victory. With his trusty Excalibur-like bat dubbed \\"Wonderboy\\", Hobbs uses his natural talent and leads the Knights on a mythical quest for the pennant. In contrast, however, a natural may also mean, as it did in the Middle Ages, an innocent fool. In the novel, Malamud uses both definitions to tell a story of a hero whose pride got in the way. Throughout the book, Malamud uses references to different colors and the passage of the seasons as Roy meets a variety of different characters. The father-like coach of the Knights Pop Fisher, his puzzling love interest Memo, the pure Iris, the crooked gambler Gus Sands, and many more diverse characters help create a theme of good versus evil. From the ballfield where Roy wages battle, to the Pot of Fire night club where Roy is confronted with evil, Malamud develops the tragic story of a hero on a grail-like quest who is tempted by the forces of evil at every turn. In the novel, written much like a play, Malamud utilizes a pastoral style to present complex ideas in a natural way. Using film-technique, which is movie-like changes in scene, Malamud shows Roy's struggle to overcome the evil in his life. Facing the fixers, the fans, the slump, and the jinx, Roy Hobbs embarks on a mythical quest to battle pride and evil in a classic tale of the tarnishing of an American icon."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Wow...was I wrong! Having seen the movie years ago and (I know I am in the minority) not loving it, but at least feeling happy with the end, I assumed that the book was somewhat similar. The book is so very sad, but if you read (and you should), you will see that it stays true to Malamud's viewpoint all along. The ending fits. There is much symbolism and good vs. evil and all that good stuff. In the end, it is an American tragedy, I think. A nicely written and very sad look at sport. And one that is still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"It always intrigues me that folks insist on comparing a novel to the movie version that a novel spawns, when in fact they have almost nothing to do with one another. I have never seen the Robert Redford movie version of this book, but I can pretty much guess that the Roy Hobbs as portrayed by Redford is nothing like the shallow, rather selfish, self-centered character in the book.The only other Malamud book I had read before this one was \\"The Assistant\\", (a book I enjoyed immensely) and while I enjoyed this book well enough it did fall somewhat short of my expectations. Maybe it was because I was expecting a rags-to-riches hero, or maybe it was because I felt Malamud never got below the surface of nearly all the characters...However, the story of the baseball season that the book does cover is exceptionally good, and whether a fan of the game or not, you will be swept along. And while I can quibble some about plotting and depth, Malamud writes splendidly, in a clean, concise, riveting fashion. A somewhat mixed bag, but recommended still."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The novel The Natural by Bernard Malamud is one of the most thrilling novels I've ever read. It takes you through the ups and downs in the life of Roy Hobbs. At times the book became hard to understand because it seems to jump back and forth through time. Malamud does a superb job of revealing the characters' inner throughts and feelings. The setting is often changing, but the imagery makes them easy to picture. Malamud seems to throw you off guard with his ever-changing characters. Right when you think something predictable will happen, the story does a 180. The theme of the novel is clearly unveiled through Malamud's narration and also through the characters. Overall the novel The Natural was a tremendous book. I would recommend it to people who like to read about overcoming adversities and also to baseball fans."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The main character of the novel, Roy, plays ball for the New York Knights but also resembles a knight from an Arthurian legend. He participates in many duals, all testing of his ability. First, he challenges &quot;the Whammer,&quot; the American League batting champion, in a three pitch dual. Then the Knights best pitcher, Fowler, tries to get a ball past Roy but he hits all of his pitches over the fence. A motif that Malamud reveals all throughout the novel is the fall of a hero, which happens to Roy not only on the field but to himself. For Roy, the ultimate goal in baseball is to be the best there ever was. Unfortunately for Roy, all he thinks that is important is baseball and he is blind to the persons around him who await his downfall. Malamud manages to make baseball into a mythical and magical sport where the ballpark becomes an arena and the players become knights, dualing for every pitch. Roy uses a bat that is his Excalibur, it cracks with thunder and flashes like lightning when he swings. The players race to catch fly balls and the batters charge around the bases to get extra base hits. The novel takes a central focus on Roy's baseball career, but also includes a psychological aspect and a romantic part of Roy. I would recomend this novel to anyone who likes baseball, but also to those interested in seeing the quest of a man and how baseball defines him. I give the novel four stars becuase Malamud uses accurate historical allusions with a sense of importance; he expands on meaningful passages but breifly states things as fast as they happen. For instance, when Roy hits a homer against Fowler, Malamud simply writes that he sends it 20 rows deep in center field. But as Roy strikes out &quot;the Whammer,&quot; Malamud extends into how &quot;the Whammer&quot; was growing old and describes the third strike like a crashing planet. But overall the book maintains a good pace and keeps the reader entertained but also manages to sneak in thoughtful insights."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Comparing &quot;The Natural&quot; the book to &quot;The Natural&quot; the movie is like comparing a fine multi-course meal to a big chocolate cake. Both are fine to eat, but expect a lot more variety and nuance out of the meal, not just the sweetness of the dessert. The book is the dark story of a strong and talented man ultimately taken down by his weaknesses. The movie is completely the opposite -- a typical Hollywood story of a hero overcoming adversity to emerge triumphant. Having read the book before seeing the movie, I was appalled at the movie's complete change of message from the book. Although I can understand the point of view of those who came to the book after the movie, it seems a bit simplistic to fault it on the basis that the ending was a bummer because it was not the happy one of the movie. Hollywood has always done that trick well -- &quot;Breaking Away&quot;, &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot; etc. etc. etc. And they -- along with &quot;The Natural&quot; -- are good movies. But Malamud's true genius in &quot;The Natural&quot; (the book!) is that Roy Hobbs is not an icon -- he is a superman who turns out to be all too frail, a man on the run from the demons of his past, seeking his salvation in the power of his talents.There is nothing the matter with harmless escapism such as &quot;The Natural&quot; The Movie. But life is so much more complicated than that - a point which Bernard Malamud understands and commiunicates so well, and which Barry Levinson and his screenwriters have chosen to overlook."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"On the surface, Bernard Malamud's \\"The Natural\\" is a book about baseball and the exploits of mythic ballplayer Roy Hobbs. Delving deeper Malamud chronicles the relentless peaks and valleys of human existence as Hobbs goes through cycles of decimation and resurrection. \\"The Natural\\", Malamud's first published novel has been compared to Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" as we follow Hobb's meandering trek through life.We are introduced to Hobbs as a 19 year old pitching phenom aboard a train headed for a tryout with the Chicago Cubs, shepherded by an ex-major league catcher Sam. In a cruel reversal of fortune Hobbs hooks up with a crazed gal he met on the train in Chicago and gets gut shot for his trouble.Fast forwarding ahead we next see a mid thirtyish Hobbs reporting to the dreadful New York Knights major league baseball team after having been signed to a contract. Hobbs originally scorned and benched by manager Pop Fisher eventually turns into a baseball icon hitting and fielding his way into legendary status. His exploits have the doleful Knights skyrocketing in the standings threatening to finally win a pennant. Hobbs however goes through his slumps as the cycles of his life continue to wax and wane even after momentarily attaining his dream of being the best in the game.Hobbs a hero who totes around some heavy excess baggage cannot divorce himself from his attraction to loose women and pursues Pop Fisher's niece, a floozy named Memo who comports with gamblers. Despite meeting a fine woman, Iris, who stood by him during the depths of his most desperate slump, he cannot smell the coffee and give up Memo.The story continues with the fortunes of Hobbs bouncing up and down like the stock market, concluding in a much more realistic ending in a style Malamud used in other books, than seen in the movie version. Malamud used real life events in the history of baseball lore to craft the plot and characters in this novel."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Those who have seen the movie but have not read the book will be surprised. Bernard Malamud paints a much darker picture of the odyssey of Roy Hobbs. The book takes the arc of one person's career--Roy Hobbs--and weds it to a couple grim episodes in baseball's history: Eddie Waitkus and the Black Sox.The Hobbs of the novel is wonderfully talented--but very human. In the movie, there is a prolonged slump after Hobbs links up with Paris Memo. In the novel, he sometimes simply has a slump. In the novel, he appears to have supernatural powers; in the novel, he is very talented but very human.The movie's uplifting ending works. The novel's darker ending also works. Each version of \\"The Natural\\" works well in its own right; the momentum in each moves toward the closing.Malamud writes well and creates characters that seem to have life to them. He also captures the very human--and vulnerable--traits of the characters.Even if you liked the movie and its view of Roy Hobbs, you will find the book gripping in its own, very different way."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I really enjoyed The Natural. It was a really easy book to read and it really kept me interested because of how Malamud wrote the story about Roy's life. I used to play baseball a lot so I can really relate to this story well and what goes on in Roy's life. I like the way Malamud made it more realistic by talking about Roy's personal life as well as his professional life so it wasn't just some sports book that would not be as interesting. The title fits Roy's life perfectly, because he is a natural athlete at the game of baseball, as you would find out in the book.Just the overall storyline made me want to get back into baseball. I liked how it showed Roy going through hard times even as a superstar. He was focused on playing baseball, his dream. But he encounters all kinds of problems throughout his life, like women, and choices, so he gets sidetracked, and things change. It really helps you relate to everyday issues. This book really helped teach me a lesson about being selfish and listening to other people. I also like \\"Wonderboy,\\" Roy's special bat. I could tell from the start that Malamud was using that as a symbol of Roy's passion for the game in the story. Memo was also like a weapon for Roy. When he was with Memo he would do good, but when he wasn't he would go into slumps. It goes to show you how the love for a woman can really affect your life. I was kind sad the way it ended, and how such a great player could come from so far and then just have then just completely collapse. But I can see how it was the perfect ending because if he had made it any different then it would just be another one of those \\"hero, happy ending\\" kind of stories, that have no point or meaning to them at all.I had seen the movie The Natural first, which got me into reading it in the first place. The movie was really good also, but I have to admit reading the book seemed like I was watching Roy's life happen. It was really easy to read Malamud's writing and after this book I am encouraged to read another one of his books. I had never been familiar with Bernard Malamud, but he really grabbed my attention with this one. The Natural really tells a great sport story, but also teaches a good lesson in life. So what is better than a book with sports that helps you in life? Just kidding. The Natural is a really good book. I would really recommend this book to everyone because it is a great story that is fun to read and really keeps you thinking."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I really injoyed reading The Natural. This book is a great book for mature audiences of allgenerations. This book is not just a book about baseball, but about life. Malamud's novel bringsforth what all of what is good about literature and all that is bad about some fiction. Malamud dida successful job by portraying a character that everyone can relate to of every day experiences.The Natural is enriched with valuable lessons. The book reveals the life of the main character RoyHobbs. Whom strives to become a baseball legend. Determined that no one will rob of his goal.The Natural demonstrates how mans will to succeed, regardless of the obstacle he may face willlead to great rewards. Like in the book where Roy Hobbs is on a mission to become a professionalball player. But is criticized as being washed up and to old to play the game at his age. Roy doesnot let this minor set back delay his dream of becoming a professional baseball player. Malamuddoes a great job by depicting the ups and downs of an up coming baseball player. Malamud usedthe strengths of the character Roy Hobbs illustrate that anything is possible with hard work andeffort. Bernard Malamud uses symbolism and allusions to portray baseball as the quest of theAmerican dream and not just a simple game He uses the women in Roy's life to symbolize the evilin society. The Natural relates to many events that happened in actuality. Like the betting scandalof major league baseball in the twenties. Malamud describes the characters problems and liveswith great clarity. I personally think the book has nothing to do with baseball. Baseball is justmerely a scene. The title of this book fits Roy Hobbs life perfectly. Malamud uses both definitionsto tell a story of a hero and throughout the book, Malamud uses references to different colors andthe passage of the seasons as Roy meets a variety of different characters. This is a book that usesoutstanding imagery to portray the lifestyle of a major league hero to a flawed character. It useshuman struggles, to bring a new enlightenment to baseball and it's heroes. The Natural portrays astory of human struggle and redemption through suffering. This is a great book that I personallyenjoyed and should be a must- read for all."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Bernard Malamud uses symbolism and allusions to portray baseball as the quest of the American dream and not just a simple game He uses the women in Roy's life to symbolize the evil in society. The more time Roy devotes to them the worse his game gets because the women corrupt him. Roy plays his best when he seems pure which is why the color white is used in the book to describe Roy's bat. Wonderboy, the bat, symbolizes what seems pure in life. When one stays pure he will succeed in life, but when one contaminates himself with earthly pleasures those tools brought his success will terminate. The boy that he is asked to save by hitting a homerun symolizes all that is good in the human race. When one strives to do good for others than to attempt to achieve personal success for himself he will be more successful. Roy steps up for his first at bat of the game which happends to be in the ninth inning with the game on the line. He hits the third pitch with all his collossol might and sends the ball soaring out of the stands. His success is directly linked with his goal of helping others. Bernard Malamud also uses allusions to better establish baseball as the America of the twenties. He uses the allusion of Roy hitting the homerun to save the boy's life to Babe Ruth's mythical feat when he promises a dieing child that he would hit him a homerun if he will get better. He also has pop falling on his way around third to a player in the 1905 world series who lost the game for his team. The allusion shows no matter how close Pop gets he can never quiet reach his goals, just like in life. In baseball things do not always work out the way a person would want them to, but that is how life is and why Bernard Malamud wrote The Natural."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"&quot;The Natural&quot; is the story of Roy Hobbs, a baseball player with nearly supernatural talent. After losing his early career to a shooting, he returns to the Major Leagues at age 34. Still a tremendous player, he carries his team into the race for the National League pennant. However, he is plagued with indecision over which love interest to pursue and the temptation to solve his money problems by fixing games.A month after finishing &quot;The Natural,&quot; I still do not know just what to make of it. I cannot reconcile the two opposing influences that this book exerts on its readers. On the one hand, we love Roy Hobbs for his incredible baseball exploits, and we are rooting for his New York Knights to win the pennant wholeheartedly. On the other, I found myself seething with hatred for Roy when I felt that he should have been stronger. I even hated Bernard Malamud himself for not creating a more perfect character; emotionally, I resented that he had written a novel with twists and turns and an uncertain outcome, rather than an uplifting hagiography about how Roy Hobbs conquered baseball. In many ways, it is a fascinating book. It tells a compelling story, and it beautifully captures the suspense and exhilaration of professional sports. While I was reading the scenes that actually take place on the baseball diamond, I felt the same thrill one experiences while watching an exciting game but usually does not feel while reading a newspaper account of a game.This is why the conflict between the uplift associated with Roy's strength and the moralization associated with Roy's weakness is so profound: reading about Roy's trials and tribulations is like watching a favorite team lose. The Natural may make for more serious literature this way, but it can be difficult to digest sometimes at a visceral level. Nonetheless, I have come to appreciate this side of &quot;The Natural&quot;: I have gotten as much enjoyment from ruminating over it as I did while I was actually reading it. If nothing else, one must admire Malamud's courage for making a statement at all.The writing is mostly brilliant, but I do have one small reservation. Occasionally, Malamud omits commas or strings sentences together with comma splices. In order for me to make these passages mentally register, I have to \\"translate\\" them to correct grammar, which takes energy and makes it more difficult for me to become absorbed in a book.Incidentally, this book (which was published in 1952) makes a very cogent argument for free agency. I often hear people grumbling about how much athletes get paid and how they have no loyalty to their fans or their team. If one considers the nearly complete impotence of Roy Hobbs, and, indeed, all athletes before free agency, in dealing with the owner, though, the case for free agency becomes much stronger. If the owner does not have to compete with other teams to keep a player, he can pay players whatever he likes. As a result, the players see little of the profit that the team is turning, and some players, such as Roy in &quot;The Natural,&quot; make subsistence level wages. If the story took place today, Roy would have had no dilemma over fixing. Of course, he would also have made millions in advertising today, whereas in the world of 1952 companies are unwilling to sign him because they fear he is a flash in the pan."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"First of all, Pop does not have a love interest in Memo, he is related to her. Second, it is not the &quot;Slammer&quot;, it is &quot;Whammer&quot;. You people who write the reviews think you know so much. Get your facts straight before you go and tell other people the wrong thing."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is a book that every fan of baseball should read. The movie made from this book was wonderful too but the director changed many things from the original story to give it a happier ending. Malamud's classic tale of Roy Hobbs is about good vs. evil and desire vs. temptation. Sure, the book may be dark, intense and even tragic but one must remember that it wasn't written with Robert Redford and Glenn Close in mind! I believe the book was written in the 50's which, along with The Mick, Joltin' Joe and our other baseball heroes, also brought us corruption, McCarthyism and a strict social and moral order. The book is the great &quot;American Tragedy&quot; and should be a must-read for everyone who truly loves baseball fiction!"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Hard to follow and super boring.

My brother told me to quit reading when I was halfway through and I should have taken his advice. It is a good book, and well written. But there are too many expectations after seeing the movie and I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In the novel, The Natural, Malamud demonstrated that a man's will to succeed, no matter what obstacles he faces on his journey, will bring him great reward. The saying, &quot;Never give up&quot; is used frequently in life to encourage people to move forward for the sake of success. This man succeeded even after being shot and having his dreams shattered. Bernard Malamud, in The Natural, used Roy Hobbs' strength and courage to get across the idea that anything is possible with hard work and devotion. Roy Hobbs was shot in a Chicago Hotel Room while being scouted by the Chicago Cubs. Initially, his injury was thought to have ruined his career, but after numerous years of recovery, he was able to return to the baseball diamond and become the best in baseball. Roy Hobbs had the ability to play any position from right field to pitcher, and he could hit the ball better than anyone else in the league. He demonstrated his courage when riding on a train to Chicago, he agreed to a bet in which he had to strike out Walter &quot;The Whammer&quot; Wambold, the best hitter in baseball. Roy Hobbs was to strike out &quot;The Whammer&quot; for ten dollars and on three straight pitches. At first, Roy did not want to take part in the bet, but his manager, Sam Simpson, convinced him to do so. &quot; Sam, I wish you hadn't bet that money on me, Roy said.&quot; He was not interested in striking Walter Wambold out; he agreed to do it because he was asked by his manager. Roy's manager caught for Roy and &quot;The Whammer's&quot; manager, Max Mercy, called strikes and balls. He wished to take no warm-up pitches; he was clearly ready for &quot;The Whammer.&quot; Roy blew two fastballs right &quot;down the pipe&quot; for two strikes that literally knocked his manager over. &quot; The third ball slithered at the batter like a meteor, the flame swallowing itself...the Whammer understood he was, in the truest sense of it, out.&quot; Roy Hobbs demonstrated his courage and confidence when he wished to take no warm-up pitches before attempting to strike out the best hitter in baseball, and he demonstrated his strength when he overpowered &quot;The Whammer&quot; and struck him out. This was a high point for both Roy and his manager because it proved to them that Roy had what it took to succeed in major league baseball. Roy Hobbs returned to baseball to prove once again that he had what it took to become the best in baseball and to achieve his goal of succeeding in baseball. He was placed on a team called, The Knights, who had not been doing so well in their present season and desperately needed a prospect to pull them out of the gutter. Roy Hobbs was indeed that prospect, but the coaches had yet to learn his capabilities. Roy did not play at first, but then the coach saw his hitting and fielding ability at a practice and started him in right field from then on. This is a prime example of how Roy displayed his courage and confidence. He was disappointed that he was not playing, but he did not let his anger get the best of him; he simply waited until he had the opportunity to show the coaches his athletic talents. Roy's confidence and enthusiasm spread throughout the team; the Knights improved their season and made it to the championship game. Unfortunately, Roy's wound from being shot got infected and was not in great condition. Roy had to be placed in a hospital and was told that playing in the championship game could mean the end of his baseball career. Roy did not care what the doctor's had to say; he was determined to play in the game and he did, even against the doctor's orders. He may not have been physically prepared for the game, but he was still willing to give it his best. &quot; When the players began drifting into the clubhouse, they were surprised to see Roy there. He was wearing his uniform and slowly polishing wonderboy&quot;(name for his bat). Roy played well in the game although he was struggling to throw, run, field, and hit. The Knights had their last at bats with a man on third and Roy Hobbs up to bat. Blood was seeping through his uniform from the wound. Roy wanted to bunt to bring in the tying run, but missed the opportunity. He struck out, but he was not disappointed. He had succeeded in playing in the game and accomplishing his goals; he had nothing to be ashamed of. Roy Hobbs displayed his devotion, strength, and courage by playing in a game that could have possibly ended his career. He made the commitment to his teammates, and he held his side of the bargain. Roy Hobbs was a man with enormous strength and courage and he demonstrated both of those qualities throughout the novel. He was a good role model for others. His teammates would have never made it as far into the season as they had without the support from Roy Hobbs. Roy's strength and courage can serve as a model for people who lack these two qualities. He is a prime example of a person who succeeded after facing numerous obstacles. Bernard Malamud was responsible for illustrating the qualities of Roy Hobbs in his novel and he did an exceptional job of explaining how anything is possible with hard work and devotion. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I knew before beginning that Malamud's book was substantially different from the great film made from it. Specifically, I was aware that at the end Roy Hobbs would strike out instead of hitting that mammouth home run to win the pennant. I was, however, prepared to read the book, which I fully expected to enjoy. I was wrong.For one thing, and this I think should be obvious to any baseball fan of merit, it seems as though Mr.Malamud has decided to use flowery prose about mountains, women, and railroads to cover up a distinct lack of knowledge regarding the sport of baseball. At one point he refers to Pop Fisher having played for the Sox in the World Series \\"about forty years ago. It was the first series they'd been in in twenty years. Even if the book took place in 1952, the year it was published, that series sixty years ago would have been in 1892, eleven years before the first World Series. Another World Series is described as having pitted the Sox against the A's, when both of those teams were in the American League!There is much more to find disagreeable in this book, such as the illogicality of the plot. We go right from Hobbs being shot to 15 years later getting his big break. How did he survive the shot when the shooter clearly was attempting to kill him? Did he turn her name into the police? Where did Hobbs spend the next fifteen years?I've read and enjoyed many books, fiction and non-fiction, about baseball, the game I love. This is without question the worst I ever read.

Other than that the book is a compelling read.Put the movie out of your mind, read this book fresh, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Hailed as one of the greatest sports stories ever written, The Natural tells the story of fame, and betrayal.Many of us are probably familiar with the Robert Redford movie based on this novel.What we may not have known was that the book is quite different than the movie. (The ending is completely different!)Roy Hobbs was going to be the best ball player anyone had ever seen. He was going to walk down the street and people were going to say, \\"There goes Roy Hobbs; the best there ever was!\\"After being shot by a crazy woman, he disappeared from the game for a number of years.When he returns, he no longer has the pitching power that was to take him to mythological heights; instead, he relies on his hitting strength.The Natural shows you how complex professional baseball can be. You have owners and devious players vying for power and money, you have women who only seek name-recognition, and you honest men, wanting to simply enjoy America's past-time.I thought Malamud did a great job with this story. I was engaged right until the last page. I hated the ending of this book. Perhaps it's more realistic, but sometimes we need our mythic heroes in sports."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The book is okay, but the movie was far better. I loved the positive ending of the movie, the fairy tale-like conclusion. The best thing about the book, I think, is that Malamud introduces a character of legend--of mythological proportions that can achieve, even with a late start, things only imagined on a baseball field. Another thing I prefer about the movie, is that, while Roy Hobbs is indeed flawed, as are all of us, there is no implication that he deserved all the bad things that happened to him. Malamud is a harsh judge of his own race if he dishes out judgment in such a fashion."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Even if you have already seen the movie, which I happen to consider the greatest sports film of all-time, this book is worth buying. There are some notable differences and many more interesting characters. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural is the very best that baseball novels has to offer. As a reader, one follows the sordid life of Roy Hobbs as he tries to rebound from an indiscretion of youth that has derailed his career for many years. Just as in Frank Nappi's novel The Legend of Mickey Tussler, [[ASIN:0312381093 The Legend of Mickey Tussler], you find yourself cheering and rooting for this phenom to attain all sorts of baseball glory. But regrettably, there is something about the character -- a flaw or imperfection if you will -- that holds him back from grabbing the glory that by all means should be his. This great work reminds us that we as humans are all flawed and vulnerable, despite our physical skills and prowess. Frank Deford's novel The Entitled [[ASIN:1402208960 The Entitled]does the same thing on a more modern level. I found myself is all three cases, but mostly with Malamud's work, frustrated but riveted to the idea that these baseball stars just could not get to the level that their ability seemed to portend."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is a great book, but it is not the same story as the movie. In fact, it is much darker and more pessimistic. If you loved the movie, and now want to read the book, please remember that the story is quite different. This was author Bernard Malamud's first great literary success. It is classic and timeless. If you buy it expecting FIELD OF DREAMS or MAJOR LEAGUE you will be very disappointed in how it ends. This is not a romance or a feel good type of book. It should be read as a myth not as a baseball adventure. The ending will surprise the hell out of you after watching the watered down Robert Redford movie."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I loved this story, ten times better than the movie. I laughed, I cried, I went to the batting cages. The character Roy Hobbs goes through perfect examples of trials and tribulations American athletes must face (I felt sorry for him after they lost that last game knowing he really tried to win). He also makes a case for the best come back story of all time (even though he is a fictional character). Malamud created a true masterpiece of American literature. Go buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I strongly recommend people who are into sports to read this novel because the novel is a very easy read and the novel relates to the sports world of today despite the novel being published nearly fifty years ago. The Natural, which is about a baseball player, named Roy Hobbs who was a nobody that turns into a bona fide star, is a novel that's suitable anywhere from a pre-teen to an adult. The novel has rivalries, women, slumps, losing streaks, and corruption, just to name a few. It has a shocking ending that doesn't end well for Roy Hobbs. Most importantly, The Natural has a great flow and the novel keeps the reader's attention. For the people that aren't into sports or into baseball in particular, you will still find this book easy to read and enjoyable. It's one of the better sports novels written in the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The deeper meaning of this book is worth looking into. The analogy of King Arthur/Lancelot/Gueneviere's fall and their bringing down the moral kingdom is reflected in this fantasy.There have been many articles and a thesis done on Malamud's deep meaning."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Although I am not into baseball that much, I could not put the book down. And after I finished the book, I immediately rented the movie version. Both pieces are worth the time to read or see, even though they differ in some elements. In both, the viewer will find them selves rooting for the team and players like he was really there, and on their toes in anticipation of the next turn in the plot."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Malamud's genius lies in his refusal to compromise his integrity by mythicizing his characters. Those who are disappointed with the original ending of this book fail to realize that Malamud wrote his characters as they would occur in real life: dull, dumb, and error-prone. Luckily, Malamud could sift out of his stories the elements that make us all human, causing us to empathize with his characters and become engrossed in his depressing yet compelling novels."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"&quot;The Natural&quot; is a quiet, contemplative novel that uses the mythology of baseball to frame a poetic parable of fate...of the idea of &quot;what could have been.&quot;Baseball, more than any other sport, has a history composed equally of fact and legend. That's its' charm. Using that gauzy place between the real and the myth, Malamud tells the tale of Roy Hobbs, the greatest baseball player who ever lived, but who hardly ever played.Hobbs' life, at least the part we are privy to, is shaped by his decisions and actions surrounding three women. They each, and I'm reducing this to absurdity, represent a basic ideal: home-spun decency, harsh reality and seductive temptation. It could be said that where he ends up at the end of the novel is determined solely by the choices he makes regarding each woman. His character becomes better defined as the reader discovers Hobbs' feelings towards each as well.It's difficult not to see Robert Redford's face in the mind's eye, nor to hear Randy Newman's music in the background whilst reading the book. Those images and sounds have penetrated popular culture so deeply, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the movie.Read the book first, then see the movie. They actually make the other better."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"When you pick up Bernard Malamud's The Natural, inevitably the Robert Redford movie creeps into your conscious mind. But this book is a far darker vision than the movie, and the end, with its even duskier conclusion about human fallibility, makes reading The Natural both sad and enlivening.The Roy Hobbes of the book is intent on getting his second chance as a major league ball player. The strain of misogyny in the novel is strong, and women are the element that continually fouls Hobbes' chance at success. This is an ugly part of the book, but in keeping with the overall gray moral sentiments expressed throughout. Hobbes is not the eunuch of the movie, and he is interested sex, money and fame as much as success in baseball (and he often views baseball as merely a means to that end).The Natural provides a hard look at second chances, and the inability of people to capitalize on them. Our first lives intrude on our second. We repeat the same mistakes."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Good book but I'm sure I would have had a different overall view of the book if I hadn't ever seen the movie. The ending is different and the overall tone of the book is different from that of the movie. Still a good read, however."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"If you have seen The Natural over 100 times, and still get the same goosebumps when Hobbs blasts one through the house lights to win the Pennant, you should take some time out of your busy schedules to sit down and read the real fictional account of the legendary New York Knight. The legendary aura doesn't leave the mystique of the main character, but more human elements abide within the novel. Like in life, heroes don't always make the right decisions, and sometimes the story doesn't end in a happy tone. A must read for baseball fans, and those that like a valuable story."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"All good baseball novels are, in one way or another, about life: baseball is simply the arena in which life is played out. Of all the baseball novels I've read, \\"The Natural\\" is the least baseball-centered one. This is neither good nor bad, just an observation: if you're looking for good baseball action, you won't get it in this novel. In fact, this novel is dark and heavy, exploring the results of hubris. And, like a Greek drama, this book ends in tragedy. Malamud was a great writer, able to create vivid, memorable characters and conflicts, so if you like baseball novels and haven't read this book, consider doing so. Roy Hobbs and the New York Knights are worth reading about."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"\\"The Natural\\" is a story filled with metaphors as it follows the life of a baseball player named Roy Hobbs. He is a young man in the prime of his career and is on his way to Chicago to join the Cubs. At this point, things were looking great for Roy's baseball career, but then tragedy strikes. On his first night in Chicago, he's seduced by a woman who then shoots him. Roy survives, but the injury is a major setback. After years of rehab and playing for the minor leagues, Roy is brought up to play for the New York Knights, the worse team in Major League Baseball. Playing as a rookie in his 30's, Roy makes a big impact on the struggling franchise and quickly becomes a sensation in the baseball world. A lot of mystery surrounds him though, because no one knows anything about his past, which he refuses to talk about.Bernard Malamud does a great job crafting this story which illustrates the highs and lows of Hobbs' baseball career. When you look at it from a metaphorical point of view, what happens to Hobbs is what happens to a lot of athletes both then and today, which makes this story feel even more realistic. There's a lot of character development and the plot has a lot of twists and turns from beginning to end. The ending is a little unpredictable, and it's not a feel-good ending by any means, but it's symbolically appropriate when you look back at all the events in the story that led up to this point.Overall, this is a great book that every sports fan needs to read. It's not the most uplifting story you'll ever read, but it examines the life of a typical star athlete from a metaphorical point of view. Anyone whose seen the movie needs to read this regardless of their opinion of the movie. There are some similarities, but the differences are monumental. The movie is basically an optimistic feel-good story, which wasn't the point of the book at all. This is a lot better than the movie, and it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural is a 1952 novel by Bernard Malamud; it inspired the eponymous 1984 Robert Redford film, to which it bears only passing similarity. Here, the talented Roy Hobbs, a thirty-five-year-old rookie, tries to make a name for himself in Major League Baseball after a psychopath's gunshot nearly killed him when he was nineteen.The story is loosely based on the true story of Phillies first baseman Eddie Waitkus, and also heavily includes elements of baseball myths and legends, most notably that of Shoeless Joe Jackson. These elements give the story a fantastical side - it often feels one step away from a M&aacute;rquez-esque magical realism.Malamud's writing style is unusual, and not in a good way. He will speed through big chunks of dialogue in narration, often in mid-conversation. Malamud keeps the pages turning (this is a short book), but this feels more like a quick fix for boring conversation than good writing. And The Natural features a jarring non-use of contractions in dialogue, but only half the time, which makes many lines feel stiff and unrealistic.Most of the supporting characters here are cartoons; only Roy and Pop have any real depth, and Roy isn't sympathetic because he continually allows himself to be distracted from his goals, makes bad choices, and doesn't learn from his mistakes.All the elements of a morality tale are here, but it doesn't feel like one, mostly because Roy doesn't learn anything throughout the book. There's too much death and despair and no redemption. The Natural isn't a great baseball novel, either, because of the way Malamud handles fantastical myth elements and because he gets carried away with his descriptive epic metaphors and glosses over much of the baseball action itself. Plus Roy Hobbs seems to do nothing besides hit home runs and strike out.In the end, The Natural is a quick read with some tantalizingly interesting elements that don't often work well together."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Who would think Bernard Malamud could capture the hard-boiled lingo of the pre-show biz big leagues and re-create a myth in an American vernacular with characters that are life-like and larger than life at the same time. If you can find the audiobook, you will appreciate the dialogue, and should find it much more absorbing than that of the pretty skimpy Hollywood version."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In my english class I was told I had to read a book of my choice and write a review. So I chose this book just because I am a fan of baseball, and it was short. Let me tell you, I am glad I read this book. I myself hate to read but I couldn't put the book down. The inspirational story of how a baseball player lives out his dreams kept me captivated the whole time.The story is about a young man, Roy Hobbs, who was on his way to try out for the Chicago Cubs and on the way he met a girl who took him back to her hotel room and shot him. The story resumes years later when Roy begins his brilliant come back and over comes adversity to become one of the best baseball players of all time. He wins the love and respect of the baseball community who at first thought he was to old to play, but once they saw him play the fans fell in love with him. I got so into the story I wanted to get out of my seat and go play. This is a must read whether you are a baseball fan or not, it is a great story and you should not pass it up."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Simply smashing! A number one success! You have seen the movie, now it's time to listen to the book. Blackstone Audio has a real winner with this audio version of a great novel about America's national pastime - baseball.The five 1-1/2 hour cassettes recant the life of Roy Hobbs a promising young baseball prospect from that farmlands trying to make it to the majors. Hobbs is sideline by a woman with a deadly bullet and after 15 years his dream comes true.The story tells about the ups and down of Roy Hobbs and the New York Knights baseball club. From the strange death of Bump Bailey to the wiles of sports writer Max Mercy, you be treated to a first class story and you'll find it hard to stop listening.The ending was a true surprise and a real pleasure. I enjoyed the listening and would highly recommend this to anyone. Remember the movie is the movie and as is most cases movies often fall short of the books they copy."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Although they are two different stories, the book and the moviewere both phenominal. Hollywood turns Roy Hobbs into a mythical hero,a good guy with great talent and an even greater commitment. A man who choses winning over money, morals over cheap thrills. The way Malamud portrays Hobbs is quite different, but still tremendously entertaining. Despite the potential of being &quot;the best there ever was,&quot; Roy Hobbs could not overcome hubris, greed, and lust."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is one of the few books where it is made into a movie but both are very enjoyable. If only this was true for all books turned movies (aka &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;). This book was not exactly a feel good book, but it was one of the most suspenseful I've ever read that didn't involve murder and mystery. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural by book was very intersting by how much Roy Hobbs loved baseball. Compared to the movie of the book, the movie seemed that sure he likes baseball but is more interested in lady's. In the beginning the book it sounds like it takes a while to get the girl, for example he kept on sending things to Memo Paris and it took awhile for the two to hook up but in the movie Roy gets her right away. The movie should of showed how he tried hard to get Memo"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Roy Hobbs comes onto the last place New York Nights at an age when most players are contemplating retirement, and brings the last place team into playoff contention but first having to overcome his slump,the boss, the jinx, and Memo."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The beginning chapter of Malamud's The Natural was pracitcally word-for-word with the movie's opening scenes, however, later throughout the plot, things are completely different from the story's Hollywood counterpart. The book was a letdown for me, as I had grown up seeing the movie on HBO every summer, and decided recently to read the book, to compare it. The story of the book is less about Roy's baseball prowess, than it is about his many love interests and desires. I was a bit shocked at this...and it seemed that his baseball talent took backseat to his love urges. The ending was incredibly disappointing-a sad last page slightly reminiscent of Shoeless Joe's fall from grace. I wouldn't recommend it to a baseball fan, only a fan of mournful love stories"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This book ought to be titled \\"The Super-Natural,\\" rather than \\"The Natural,\\" since there are so many mythic and magical elements to it, in both style and content. Forget about any comparisons to the feel-good/and-they-lived-happily-ever-after movie starring Robert Redford. Don't get me wrong--I loved the movie, but still, Malamud must have been tearing his hair over what Hollywood did to his dark, tragic fable of thwarted human ambition, greed and lust.Even the main character's name, Hobbs, seems symbolic, or at least allusive: Hobbes (slightly different spelling) was a pessimistic philosopher who saw human life as a pitiless struggle for survival. Some reviewers have seen parallels with the King Arthur legend, but the novel isn't a contemporary retelling of that story. Malamud employs elements of the legend to give his own story a deeper, mythic resonance.What this book ISN'T is a simplistic baseball novel, with a clean-cut hero overcoming adversities and becoming a winner in the end. As a reader you want to like Roy Hobbs, want to see him succeed, but Malamud keeps shoving a stick into his spokes. (Or maybe into his spikes.) His character is a man of unhealthy appetites. Roy's ambition to be \\"the best that ever was\\" in baseball is utterly self-centered and he's unable to see beyond it to any higher goal in life. His relationships with women are clumsy and coarse, and his fleeting visions of domestic happiness dimmed by lust and a tendency to want the wrong women for all the wrong reasons. Even his relationship with food is problematic. Toward the end of the novel he becomes the personification of the vice of Gluttony, stuffing himself to the point where he nearly causes his stomach to explode and he winds up in the hospital.Without giving anything away, I think it's fair to say the book has a dark finale. This grim novel ends with an allusion to the Black Sox scandal--a newsboy begging Roy to \\"say it ain't true\\"--and Malamud offers a final line that sounds less like the King Arthur legend than like something from ancient Greek drama in its image of ruined hopes and tragic futility: \\"he lifted his hands to his face and wept many bitter tears.\\"Beats me how anyone can describe this brilliant, unforgetable but relentlessly bleak book as inspirational or uplifting. They must be confusing the novel with the movie."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The novel, The Natural, by Bernard Malamud is darker than the movie version starring Robert Redford. The protagonist is still Roy Hobbs a gifted ball player who is bedeviled by life's vicissitudes; however his flaws make him less herculean and more human. Perhaps that is why even 60 years after this novels debut we can still relate to Roy in a fundamental way. Maybe there is some of Hobbs in each of us? Maybe we all have our own metier which comes to us all at times as effortlessly as Roy's fluid swing. But like Roy we are still human and are at times undone by our own hubris and the snares life has set in each of our paths."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I expected more from this book. Yes, the part about Roy Hobbs' talent is great--it shines through, and creates something magical. But basically all of the rest of the book is just average--or worse. Roy Hobbs himself is a just a very average person, and I personally found it difficult to care about him one way or another. Although he's in his mid-30s for most of the book, he comes across almost consistently like a confused, psychologically-blind teenager--chasing women (most of whom are losers), practicing little or no self-reflection or self-restraint, gambling senselessly, overeating, and just leaning on his physical talent.His behavior is actually probably similar to that of a lot of modern baseball greats--which is probably why I find them so dull as people. Yes, it's amazing to watch them play, because their talent is something otherworldly, but who really cares about their silly teenage dramas?And, sadly, that's what this book is."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is truly a classic. Malamud develops deep themes in a seemingly simple world of baseball worship. A must read for anyone wanting to delve into America's favorite pastime with a an intellectual lens."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Anyone looking for a novel that's similar to thefilm adaptation will be mightily disappointed. Thisis almost nothing like the film adaptation of thesame name, especially when it comes to the conclusion.The novel itself is well-written and fairlyentertaining & absorbing, but it's a pretty good effortat best. Worth a read, but not necessarily incrediblymemorable. It's a shame, too, because much of the proseis so indelibly beautiful that I wish the overall plotwere better."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Struggling to pursue a professional baseball career, Rob Hobbs, a character in The Natural, overcomes many obstacles in his first year as the Rookie. Roy moves to the crowded and sleepless city of New York as he adapts to the celebrity lifestyle of parties and meeting new people, most of them being girls. It is successful in creating a realistic setting through the use of hectic moods and a party-like atmosphere. As Roy takes on new responsibilities, his main struggle is trying to balance everything while still playing a spectacular game night after night, a stability that not everyone is able to achieve.Roy enters the baseball world with a great deal of early criticism but besides all that, he is an immediate success. After finally gaining support of the coaches, teammates, and local fans, he begins to grow older and more experienced yet still continuing to pile on the pressure to do well. In fact, they demand perfection. The media is after him wanting to know all about his history, as Roy does not want the public to know about his personal stories. As a leader of the team, he brings them up from last place to being in the World Series. Roy has a passion for the game that no one could ever change, as I respect that in an athlete. Throughout his injuries and slumps, he would still put on his glove and go out and play, which is very practical as that is the life of professional athletes. Memo, one of Roy's friends, make a comment to him that could be used as thetheme of the book, which is, \\"Experience makes good people better.... Especially through their suffering.\\"I believe The Natural is an entertaining book for audiences of different generations as it interweaves a love story with an intense sports tale. As stated earlier, Roy Hobbs is a fighter who wants to keep his past a mystery. Readers from all backgrounds can relate to the struggles of the everyday perfection others expect out of you, and as we can see, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The book is great. But, it doesn't have the same inspirational kick as the movie. The book is better at showing the corruption of the sport. It is very well written and I recommend it to any baseball fan. But, if you are looking for an inspirational story, like the movie offers, I would rent the movie instead of reading the book."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I, like others, was also disappointed with this book. Having seen the movie before reading the book, I am amazed at the contrast. I was unable to care about the book Roy Hobbs because of his apparent incurable stupidity, inabiltiy to learn from his mistakes, and ultimatly his failure. His unfailing self-centeredness is annoying, and the use of dream imagery is boring and distracting. I was looking for something inspiring, and instead, got something dark and unfulfilling."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Perhaps I did not like this book because I was forced to read it. Perhaps I did not like it because I am over critical... At any rate, I absolutely did not enjoy this book at all. Bernard Malamud created a sex-crazed, egotistical moron who was better at hitting a ball than making passes at women. Malamud opens with a young, green, 19 year old Roy Hobbs who is too shy to order breakfast, but not shy enough to try to touch a woman in a *personal space.* After an unexplained 15 years, Roy comes back, plays great baseball, and brings the underdog Knights to the Penant. What I don't understand is, why did Malamud decide to end the book like he did! I won't give it away, in case someone actually wants to read this book, ..."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This book is a very good book. It is especially favored by people who like baseball. The book is about Roy Hobs and him trying to become the best in the MLB, but he gets shot and returns to the game 15 years later. He is now one of the oldest players on the team and has a hole cast of villians to cope with. I really injoyed this book probably because I like sports. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves baseballs and like a story about glory."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This book, is good if you like american style baseball!"},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Having first viewed the film of the same name, I found this book to be disappointment. It lacked the mythic and Arturian aspects of the film. Roy Hobbs is a coarse, unpleasant and not too bright character whose downfall is painful to follow. After finishing the book I felt the urge to take a shower, there was a feeling of being defiled, and certainly saddened by this account of a unfulfilled and wasted life. For once, a film adaption was better than the book."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"this is one of those rare instances in literary history when a film adaptation of a book is far more complex and inspiring than the book ever hoped to be. The addition of the Glenn Close character as having been a childhood sweetheart tied the film together with respect to Roy and her relationship much better than Malamud did. Roy's character is a shallow and selfish man who doesn't know a good thing when he sees it. The film's Roy at least has a sense of what is right and wrong(in some areas of his life). My advice to anyone is to enjoy one of the best movies ever made and forget about the The Natural by Bernard Malamud."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I am a big sports fan, and I also play baseball. Because of this, I was able to relate to the story and understand it easily. I believe that the theme of the story personifies today's lack of heroes. In today's society many of our sports heroes have selfish qualities. In this story Roy wants to be a hero but is overtaken by his greed and selfishness. It's sad to see this happen to such a great player, it also brings us to the reality that there is no perfect hero. I think the book did a great job of showing this reality. I also enjoyed how Malamud used objects to symbolize bigger meanings. \\"Wonderboy\\", Roy's special bat, is used to represent Roy's confidence or spirits. When Memo discourages him the bat is soft and droopy, but when he is happy with Memo the bat is hard and strong. At the end of the story when Roy's spirits are broke, his bat breaks along with them. Without the bat (his confidence), he is unable to fulfill his goal of being a great hero and breaking every record. I really like this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is a sports fan."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I just re-read Malmud's truly great first novel, The Natural. I had first read it over 20 years ago. It was more moving to me now -- having experienced both success and failure in my life. It is a book about baseball and it captures the best elements of the game (I grew up loving and playing baseball both in NY and Denver) and Mickey Mantle was my boyhood hero, much like Superman -- the comic book hero.Compulsive baseball statiticians with no real appreciation of genuinely fine literature may grow impatient with some seeming discrepencies. However, the larger picture is that through poetic metaphor and very real tough dialogue Malamud captures the glory and the anguish of the elusive American dream."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"If I were to give this book a rating on its plot, characters, interest, and storyline then I would have to give this 5 stars. Bernard Malamud wrote this book brilliantly. He uses his knowledge of baseball and creative talent to write a book about a man's life long struggle to become a professional baseball player. There were only really two minor things that I did not like about this great book the first is that it was a little hard to follow with the characters frequent flashbacks and dreams.It made it hard for me to exactly know when it was describing present day and when it was talking about a dream or telling a flashback. The second problem I had was when the book was talking about one of the main character's girlfriends, and since he had so many it was hard to tell which on the book was explaining.These two minor problems were easily overcome, but still were noticeable to be mentioned from memory. This book was an excellent portrayal of a baseball story, which gave the reading that little edge and twist."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural tells the story of Roy Hobbs a stubborn country man who dreams of planning in the pros but is detained after he is shot. Years later he joins the failing New York Knights who must win the penant if they are to still be owned by manger Pops. Roy although aging quickly leads the team to the playoffs. However he is continually hounded by Max Mercy a reprter who wants to uncover Roy's past and the Judge who will do anything to see the Knights lose.I thought that this was an excellent book. Bernard Malmund makes his characters seem incredibly real. He also describes their problems and lives with great clarity. He also tells the story at an even pace. he also make sit remarkbly believeable Roy's story could very well be taken from another great athlete. The ups and downs are the truest I have ever read from any novel. Also, the story in itself is intoxicating. Read it and it is easy to become lost in that world. It is also excellent drama. The way Roy lives and how he interacts with the other characters is excellent. The story is entertaining as well. You will be cheering for Roy and the Knights for the entire story. Read this story of determanation and love of the game and you will never look at baseball the same way again."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The sound of bat whipping against the ball, the smell of the leather from the gloves perfuming the air, and the cheers and jeers of the crowd, are many of the elements found in Bernard Malamud's, &quot;The Natural&quot;. In the 1952 novel, Roy Hobbs, the story's protagonist and hero, is considered by many to old and out of his prime. But Roy, with his stubborn demeanor and special bat, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, proves his critics wrong. Malamud takes you out to the ballpark on warm summer days, where Roy is on a &quot;quest&quot; to bring the last place Knights, out of the cellar and into the spotlight. Roy's task isn't easy with the likes of Harriet Bird and Memo Paris standing close by. Malamud offers a variety of motifs and allusions in The Natural. The &quot;bird&quot; motif pops up when Roy feels &quot;caged&quot; and inhibited. The 1919 White Sox gambling scandal can also be found in the novel. The incident where Roy succeeds in smashing a homerun for a sick little boy, offers insight into Roy's hero-like qualities. Malamud also depicts the life of the &quot;old-timey&quot; ballplayers, with their endless nights of club-hopping and alcohol. This type of behavior is also prevalent in many of today's athletes. With his back against the wall, Roy Hobbs and &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, do battle with the gamblers, the owner, and his love interests, to take the Knights to the pennant race."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural, a tad bit on the boring side, was a pretty good story. I am a huge sports fan so the book really interested me when the baseball plot came into play. Although I enjoyed Roy falling in \\"love\\", I enjoyed the baseball games and plot much better.The beginning of the book was boring. I felt the story needed to go somewhere and it did. It became much better. Even though I was confused when Harriet shot him, I began to understand everything and became interested again.Roy acts as a hero to all Knights' fans. He takes their sorry team and makes them better. Roy, out of the game for at least 15 years, comes back and makes a statement as one of the greats. I think his ego got in the way when he told everyone that he would be the greatest to ever play the game. Although Roy was great, he got into a slump. This shows that even the greats fall down sometimes. You can't always be on top, but it is a good thing that Roy got out of it to help the Knights.I have never seen the movie but I heard he hits a home run at the end. This is different from the book because he strikes out in the end which really surprised me. I felt very bad for roy, especially when the little boy says \\"Say it ain't true, Roy.\\" I felt a lot of emotion from that one scene and we all knew that Roy would not play baseball again.I would recommend this book for sports fans and for people who are just looking for a good read. I enjoyed reading this book for my class project. This is a book I could read again."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"This is absolutely the worst baseball book I ever read. I wasted my money. Save your money; go rent the movie.Spoiler alert:Hobbs sells out and strikes out."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In this baseball-themed novel, the main character battles a major flaw, which keeps him from becoming truly great. The romance and tragedy make this a great story."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Baseball is in one sense just a game. In another for many I knew growing up in America it was a kind of religion. Malamud understands both these dimensions and in this work he plays on the sense of baseball as a kind of metaphor for all that is important in life. The story of Roy Hobbs partakes of many of the myths of baseball , the small- town boy who makes it big, the underdog who comes from behind, the hero of extraordinary powers who single- handed like the Babe himself takes a team and makes it into a champion and a legend.This is not my all- time favorite baseball book (That distinction belongs to two books largely unread today, Zane Grey's ' The Shortstop ' and Charles Einstein's ' The Only Game in Town' )but it is a very good book that shows a real understanding of both the game of baseball and the game of life."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural focuses on the tragic flaws of all it's characters. I didn't read the book, I listened to it on tape. I found the story fascinating, but very depressing. I haven't seen the movie, and gather I would have found the book even more depressing. Rather than focus on baseball, as I had hoped it would, it focuses on the perils of hero worship, hubris, and human nature."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"If you are buying the classic book after seeing the excellent movie starring Robert Redford, you'll be in for a surprise. And please realize the book was published years before the movie was a big hit in theaters.The main character - Roy Hobbs - portrayed by Redford is a hero in the \\"old\\" Hollywood sense. Hobbs in the book has the surliness of Ty Cobb, the shadiness of Hal Chase and the larger-than-life appetites on and off the field like Babe Ruth.Bernard Malamud weaves a story which club owners, players and gamblers have a blast manipulating their Field of Dreams. Many of the scenes have real-life elements; in particular, situations reminiscent of the 1919 Black Sox Scandel.The ending is brilliantly penned by Malamud, as Hobbs steps into the batter's box with his career on the line. And please remember, storybook finishes are typically found only in the movies."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural, Bernard Malamud's work regarding a naive middle aged ballplayer entangled in a web of good versus evil, utilizes mythic parallels and dynamic symbols to portray the epic struggle of innocence in America. The work opens with Hobbs, the main character of the novel, traveling to Chicago to make his baseball debut. In route, he is challenged by the current batting champion in baseball, \\"the Whammer\\"(21), to a three-pitch duel. The situation is similar to that of the biblical myth of David slaying Goliath. Also, the scene takes on a resemblance to the Arthurian legend, Sir Percy lancing Sir Maldemer. The young and innocent Hobbs easily defeats the Whammer and attains the attention of Miss Harriet Bird, an ominous and mysterious figure. She is out to destroy the titans of sport. She takes advantage of Hobb's innocence and devastates his aspirations to enter the league young and become \\"the best there ever was\\"(26). Roy symbolizes ambition and youth while Miss Bird represents the corrupt members of society out to ruin the lives of others. Another powerful and mythic symbol of the novel is Hobbs' bat, Wonderboy. It is the weapon in which Hobbs battles for wins. Wins are so crucial because he feels obligated to attain for his manager, Pop Fisher, the pennant and save Pop's job. Wonderboy is like King Arthur's Excalibur, the sword presented to him to defend Camelot. The bat is so white that it glistens \\"like a leg bone in the sun\\"(65). The bat symbolizes the purity in the game of baseball for Hobbs. As opposed to life, baseball is simple to Hobbs; all he must do is play the game. The pennant struggle is also a parallel to the struggle of the Fisher King, Pop Fisher, and Sir Percival attempting to restore the fertility to the land. Hobbs acts as Percival trying to heal the wounds of Pop Fisher and restore life to the ball club. The name of the club is the Knights, another mythic quality of the novel. The Knights parallel to the Knights of the Round Table of King Arthur. These men symbolically battle on the field for the sake of pride. Memo, Gus, and the Judge all embody the evil and corrupt traits of society. They, like society, only care for themselves, and act selfishly to gain profit. They do not under any circumstances make sacrifice for others, and are against every characteristic of team sports. They serve to foil Hobbs' character, which devotes his life to others and his team. Like all Malamudian heroes, Hobbs also symbolizes the tragic figure, callously thrown from his course to fame, only to rise again to a pinnacle of greatness and to end where he began, with nothing to show for his marathon journey. His early conviction of his greatness led to a divine intervention of tragic events. It seems as though Hobbs was doomed before he began his passage to glory. The direct references to chivalric quests and heroic voyages render a semblance to the age-old struggle of moral versus malicious. Hobbs symbolizes the inherently good struggling in a world of vice. Malamud clearly depicts baseball as a representation of life, where the simple and pure are hunted by immoral predators."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel The Natural is one of the most well-known baseball books ever written, aided no doubt by the Robert Redford movie. I'd seen the movie before reading the book, and it turns out that there are actually many major differences between the original novel and the Hollywood edition.The basic story is probably familiar to many. Roy Hobbs, a 19 year old baseball phenomenon, is shot by a crazed athlete stalker before his major league tryout. Fifteen years later, Hobbs signs on as an outfielder for the New York Knights, perennial losers of the National League and his amazing skills take the club into contention for the pennant. I'll spare any more details, as where the book and movie differ there are some major twists.The book has a very mythic quality, and I'm not the first to note that there are many Arthurian parallels, with Roy's bat Wonderboy standing in for Excalibur, Hobbs being a Knight, and the dangers of pride interfering with the quest. In addition to the aura of legends, the description of baseball - the players, the games, the train rides, the business - definitely feels as though it's come through the mists of time to give us a glimpse into baseball as it was generations ago, and there are fictional echoes of real baseball personalities and events, such as Babe Ruth and the Black Sox scandal.I listened to the audio edition, read by Christopher Hunt. Hunt's narration is excellent. He alternates between folksy, dreamy, crude, terse, and lyrical, always hitting the right note to accompany the text.As a baseball fan, I probably should have read this long ago. Nonetheless, I'm glad I finally have. It's not perfect - at times it veers away from the game and into odd tangents a bit too much for my taste - but overall, it's an excellent book. Any baseball fan should make sure they read The Natural at some point. It's place in the culture of baseball is well-deserved."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"When it comes to great baseball novels, \\"The Natural\\" rates at the top. Malamud creates a nearly immortal great in Ray Hobbs, who suffers from a tragic flaw that prevents him from realizing his true greatness. Through surreal events, we follow the trials and tribulations of the great Roy Hobbs, who becomes an almost god-like figure, but whose time is fleeting and who fades away all too soon.Roy Hobbs, whose almost divine talent can be partly attributable to his bat, Wonderboy, emerges as a wide-eyed 19-year old whose natural pitching talent has scouts astounded. Yet, before he can tryout for the Cubs, his life is nearly ended by a silver bullet shot from the revolver of a demented young woman. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Roy emerges 15 years later as a 34-year old rookie for the New York National League Club, the Knights.Although baseball may be the focus, love, greed, and betrayal make their appearances as well. For all the God-given (or Wonderboy) talent that Hobbs has, he cannot overcome his human flaws and self-centered approach to the game. For it is not his boyhood passion that drives him to excel, but his task to be immortal through smashing records never to be broken. He is not a team player, but a player more interested in setting records. Yet, his most glaring flaw is in his choice of women that eventually leads to his tragic downfall. Although he has found a seemingly perfect match in Iris Lemon, he nevertheless attempts to gain the affection of Memo Paris. Although it's tough to compare her with the gambling kingpin Gus, she my be the most treacherous villain, as she manipulates Roy's lust for her to get her way, as Roy is too blind to see the truth. Even as Memo attempts to coerce Roy to throw the pennant-deciding game by admitting that he is not worth enough money to her, Roy lets his loins control his brain.Finally, Malamud imparts a supernatural aspect to his novel. Before Roy's first appearance, Knights Field is a dry wasteland. Yet, when Roy appears and begins his hitting streak, the \\"gods\\" open up the skies and rain falls as the fields becomes lush and fertile again. When he fades into a slump, the field once again dries up. It seems that the baseball gods can reward or punish the Knights based on Roy's performances and his actions off the field as well.\\"The Natural\\" has had a profound influence on sports literature, spawned a top-notch 1980s movie (although the ending is nearly opposite), and has become part of the fabric of the national pastime. Even Kirk Gibson's improbable home run in the 1988 World Series earned him the title of \\"Roy Hobbs.\\" It is hard to imagine a work of baseball (or any sports) literature that has had as profound an effect and following as \\"The Natural.\\" And even if you are not a baseball fan, this is a highly enjoyable and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural by Bernard Malamud is consistently lauded as the best baseball book ever written (along with Bang the Drum Slowly, another egg), and while it wasn't a bad read, I certainly don't put it up there in the best ever category; but perhaps that's more about me than it is about the book.In one of the rare cases of the movie being superior to the book it's based on, Robert Redford's film \`The Natural' is just a much much tighter and more engaging telling of the same story with a better ending, and in fact probably the best baseball movie ever. I found the book depressing and the Hobbs character not very likeable, while Redford is brilliant as the flawed hero Hobbs. You sort of get the sense that if Malamud watched the movie he might be thinking \\"Dammit, that's what I wanted to do with the story!\\""},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Author Bernard Malamud (1914-1986) wrote this semi-mystical novel in the early 1950's, when baseball was on top, TV was just starting, and players earned very modest paychecks. It's the story of Roy Hobbs, an incredibly talented player from somewhere out west who through tragic circumstance doesn't reach the majors until he's in his mid-thirties. Hobbs is a decent sort, but he finds himself overwhelmed by fame, manipulative owners, merciless sportswriters, and conniving women. His career with the fictional New York Knights is meteoric but short, and filled with controversy and temptation. Hobb's impact catapults his team into the pennant race, and the story improves as it unfolds.The book has a symbolic, semi-mythical style. The story was based partly on a 1949 incident involving Eddie Waitkus of the Phillies. This book is also tougher and less optimistic than the 1984 movie starring Robert Redford."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"The Natural is as fine a piece of baseball fiction as I have ever read. Roy Hobbs, a player with unlimited ability, makes a mistake and pays for it the rest of his life. I will not get into a book description or a discussion of Malamud's writting style, but I will say those of you expecting a rehash of the movie will be suprised. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"In The Natural, by Bernard Malamud, Malamud uses mythical parallels and symbolic motifs to relate the tale of Roy Hobbes, a \\"natural\\" baseball player who fits Malamud's archetypal protagonist: the partially corrupted hero whose continued suffering gives him understanding about himself but leads to his eventual downfall. Roy Hobbes serves as a symbol for Percival the Grail-Knight, who must heal the Fischer-King's wounds and return fertility to the land. The Fischer-King is represented by Knights' manager Pop Fisher, who has athlete's foot on his hand. When Roy plays well, Pop's ailment seems to disappear and the grass on Knight's Field begins to grow again. During Roy's slump, Pop Fisher's athlete's foot begins to creep back up on him. Malamud also uses such symbols as Roy's hurt eye and Memo's \\"sick\\" breast to make clear the underlying story of Roy Hobbes. When Roy and Memo are in a small car accident, Roy's eye is hurt and Memo's already sick breast is further injured. Roy's optical injuries represent his inability to see the ball during this time that he is with Memo, since he is hitting very poorly. Memo's sick breast stands for her infertility, as nothing good appears to come from her and her presence negates the fertility that Roy brings to the team. Memo herself admits, \\"I am strictly a dead man's girl.\\" Roy is deceived into accepting a bribe to win Memo's affection and then tries to redeem himself at the last minute, but like many of Malamud's tragic heroes, a personal weakness causes his downfall. Roy learns from his mistakes, but is not rewarded for his eventual change of heart."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Bernard Malamud's book is truly a classic. While the book is about a baseball player, it is about much more than baseball. This story goes through his thoughts, fears, and desires. It is a book about trials and perseverance, sex and greed, tragedy and failure. Be warned, however, that this is NOT Robert Redford's 'The Natural.' The characters are the same, but if you go in expecting it to be exactly the same as the movie, you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"Roy was just a semipro player when a scout found him and begged to help bring him a career in baseball. The story begins during Roy's journey on the train to Chicago in order to get into the game as a pro. It is a dream come true for Roy, who has all faith in himself to become a legend. He has his share of troubles, and at times remains in a state of despair as he journeys to the top. Some, like Harriet Bird and Bump Bailey, wish greatly to bring him down for their own gain. Others, however, want Roy to achieve success as badly as he wants it for himself. Pop Fisher, the manager of the Knights only wants to help Roy succeed. While reading The Natural, by Bernard Malamud, one soon discovers his use of motifs and themes in this great story of baseball. Throughout this novel, Malamud links his story with allusions of past historical events in baseball. Perhaps Roy Hobbs reminds you of Babe Ruth and perhaps you notice the White Sox scandal of 1919 somewhere in the novel. Malamud also makes reference to Roy's bat &quot;Wonderboy&quot; as his lance, linking the story to a time of legends and knights (Knights also being the team Roy plays for).There are elements of comedy like Pop Fisher, the manager, and his odd rash, and elements of tragedy, too. Roy's want for success is paralleled with his desire for food and his overconsumption, and also is linked to his desire for the love of Memo Paris. Malamud also uses the train theme from the beginning as a source of constant motion for Roy's life. Roy encounters many women that he intends to love and their relationships spin out of control like the game of baseball he plays for The Knights. Roy discovers he is not always free like a bird, sometimes even &quot;caged&quot;, which is another motif Malamud includes in the novel, showing the nievity and suseptability of people. Roy is a bird of baseball in this incredible novel by Bernard Malamud, which solidifies the game of baseball for your own understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I love reading writers who not only have a story to tell, but who tell it in language that is clear and well-crafted without calling attention to itself. My two happiest discoveries so far this year have been Malamud (whose novel The Fixer, read earlier this year, was my first experience with him), and John Edward Williams, a writer whose name I had never heard before walking into Kramer Books in Washington, DC, and purchasing Stoner. I returned to Malamud with The Natural, and have purchased a couple of additional Williams books to return to later.If I am going to read a book and see a movie based on that book, I always prefer to read the book first. Always. It sometimes doesn't happen that way, but that's always my preference. For one thing, I don't want images or characterizations from the movie to supplant my own imagination as I read. For another, as often as not the movie is a pale reflection of the book. If it's just a throwaway novel, that's not such a problem. But if it is a book of greater depth, then it is very hard for a movie to do it justice, and I'd really rather have the richer imaginative experience before seeing the stripped-down movie version. But when I first saw \\"The Natural\\" with Robert Redford years ago, I didn't really think about whether or not I would ever read Bernard Malamud's book. A book should not be reviewed in comparison with a movie, regardless of whether it comes out on the stronger or weaker side of the comparison, but it is hard to avoid in a case like this so I'm not going to avoid it. And here's the strange thing: maybe it doesn't matter. Full disclosure: I enjoyed Barry Levinson's film. But the book and the movie are so completely different, it's as if each is telling a different story, rather than one being an adaptation of the other. Either that, or the movie version gives the word \\"adaptation\\" a whole new meaning. Except for the part toward the beginning with Harriet Bird, every major plot device and turning point is different in substantive ways.The book is far less mythic in its orientation than the film. It is more human, flaws and all. The obvious comparison is the main character, Roy Hobbs. Malamud's original is a very different character from the confident-yet-transcendent Hobbs of the screen treatment. He is more complicated, less pure, far more ambivalent and archetypal. This also makes him more interesting, but he may take a little getting used to if the Redford character is stuck in your head. (Yet one more demonstration of the wisdom of reading the book first. I wish I had.) With women, for example, he's something of an oaf, with a one-track mind and no subtlety whatsoever. The Judge in the movie is a combination of Malamud's Judge and the bookie Gus Sands. Combining them into one character was an understandable decision for a movie, but having them both in the story makes the book richer and allows for two different influences--and pressures--in the lives of both Roy Hobbs and Memo Paris.I have now read two Malamud novels this year, and I like The Fixer better. I can see why it won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award in 1967. Though I have never seen John Frankenheimer's film version of The Fixer, I can also see why, with The Natural, Barry Levinson decided to depart so substantively from Malamud's story. Baseball lends itself particularly well to mythical storytelling. Yes, it's a team sport, but unlike others it boils down to a series of man-on-man contests, nine innings of individual battles. If Homer had written about sports, it would have been about baseball. That's the movie's angle on the story. But Malamud tells a different story. His is a tale of a man who wants to be the very best ever to play the game, and is just talented and arrogant enough to think that he can do it. But there are compromises all along the way, right up to the end--an ending which, like the movie, features Hobbs and a boy. But there the similarity ends, as does any hope for purity, reconciliation, or redemption through athletic prowess. The book is messier, more ambiguous, more complexly human. More like real life."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"A very good book by Bernard Malamud, whose protagonist Roy Hobbs, may have been the most gifted and most cursed character to appear in a sports novel. As a former sportswriter who really dug the movie, I put this book on my Bucket List and do not feel slighted -- too much.The only thing separating this book from five stars is the ending (much different than the movie and minus what I feel a full, satisfying closure).Malamud's attention to secondary characters serve only to highlight Hobbs all the more effectively. It's a classic book about a classic time in baseball -- when the players still traveled by train and lights were just beginning to appear in stadiums.To the uninitiated, Malamud springs some unexpected developments right from the beginning -- events one wouldn't really associate with baseball. That said, it is written in such a way that it is nearly a fable -- a potent combination.Hobbs is a rather convoluted character -- he has the self-centeredness that great athletes seem to have, while at the core he struggles with doing what is right.The dialogue is true to the sport and the era. And while it comes off a bit obscure at times, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Natural","review":"I saw the movie with Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, and Glen Close, but always wanted to read the novel. The Natural is a story of good and evil, temptation and discipline, and the bad things that come to those who cross the line. As a baseball fan, The Natural grabbed me by the collar with the opening paragraph and didn't release me to the last. I recommend it to men of a certain age who love baseball and view it as a metaphor for the important lessons of life."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function q(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const S=u(N,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-fe489d1a"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/40.md","filePath":"guide/40.md"}'),F={name:"guide/40.md"},P=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(S)]))}});export{W as __pageData,P as default};
