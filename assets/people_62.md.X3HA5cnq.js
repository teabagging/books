The author is clear, concise and straight to the point. I would recommend it to others who are already using Quickbooks software and need that extra helping hand with their understanding of the software. It is not tailored to every person using Quickbooks, but offers great tips from an expert who was always putting out fires for her clients. I highly recommend this book over Quickbook's for Dummies because it gets to the point and you don't waste your time looking for what your looking for. My favorite chapter is chapter 9: Mistakes to Avoid, Trouble Shooting Guide, and Stupid Questions (that are not stupid at all). My best to anyone who is starting a business of their own and need to learn something about Quickbooks and how to manage their finances, remember it's better to hire a bookkeeper eventually once you get things started, save yourself time and frustrations down the road and before tax time."},{"Title":"Feathered Dragons: Studies on the Transition from Dinosaurs to Birds (Life of the Past)","review":"This book is a nice collection of papers on dinosaur and bird relationships that was put together in combination with the then recent description of Bambirator. As such, there's a descriptive paper of this little Late Cretaceous dromaeosaurid, along with papers on theropod biology, interrelationships, and relationship to birds. Bob Bakker has a truly odd contribution in which he proclaims that Ceratosaurus was an aquatic, lungfish-hunting crocodile analog, Allosaurus inhabited \\"dens\\" and dragged carcasses back to feed chicks, and that complex ecosystems and interspecies relationships can be deciphered from examining isolated, shed teeth. his imagination is very fertile, but a more sober examination of the data feeding his ideas fails to support any of them. Regardless, Phil Currie, Mark Norrell, and others have some really good contributions in here and it is a great text that captures the brewing excitement of the previous decade, before so many featherd dinosaurs from China made such discoveries almost commonplace. There's nothing that today would be considered ground-breaking, but it's an interesting compilation that makes for good reading for interested amateurs or students of evolution and biology."},{"Title":"Feathered Dragons: Studies on the Transition from Dinosaurs to Birds (Life of the Past)","review":"The first reports of \\"feathered\\" dinosaurs (aka dragons) came out of China in 1997. Here in the U. S., Dr. John Ostrom examined one he termed BABGIRAPTOR FEINBERGI in October, 1997, in Montana. At the Fort Lauderdale Convention Center in April, 2000, he gave thirty-five talks about his find. Michael W. Skrepnick made the unusual illustration of this 'find' which looks like a giant baby duck. This is the cover for \\"Feathered Dragons.\\"Dr. Ostrom revealed finding a DEINONYCHUS in 1969, an unusual discover in paleontology which shows that dinosaurs were the logical ancestors of birds. Guess they at a lot to get so big.It was thought that they were a primitive form of Asian bird. The early dinosaurs had avian traits and could fly. They laid eggs like birds do, but fish do, too. They could be a combination of the two but how'd they get so large.The feathered COELUROSAURS were found in China and the SINOSAUROPTERYX were in Patagonia and Mongolia.

Du Pre who died tragically young was a cellist at the highest level. Her marriage to the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim , and their musical friendship with Zubin Mehta, Pinhas Zukerman and others put her in the center of the music world's attention .This book tells the story of her life but somehow does not give us a sense of who she most deeply was . The legend tells of her beauty and her genius and her tragic death. And the brother and sister seem fair in describing their own complicated relationship with her in which they often played a fostering and supportive role. Perhaps the real inner life of Du Pre is not to be sought in the kind of biographical work written here, or for that matter in any literary work, but in the playing in her recordings where she was most alive. In one passage of the book she does speak about the way playing takes her above into another realm of joy. And by all accounts she was a tremendously passionate and powerful cellist. There are even critics who say that she played more of herself, than she did of the score before her. And that in repertoire she was not broad and innovative enough. In any case it seems universally agreed by musical cognescenti that she at her best was at the very highest level. I am no great maven here but I too can admit to being quite moved at the hearing of her playing of the Elgar Cello Concerto.The story of her marriage to Barenboim, their whirlwind life, its break- up is also told here in a very concise and limited form. Barenboim the bon vivant, the tireless promoter and player somehow may have been a bit too fast for the English country girl who according to her sister needed nine hours of sleep and not the four or five Barenboim did. In any case this part of the book is devastatingly sad as of course is the end.The brother Piers and the sister Hilary who wrote this book truly cared for and tried to help their sister. This book is part of their effort to keep her memory alive in the best way possible."},{"Title":"A Genius in the Family: An Intimate Memoir of Jacqueline Du Pre","review":"This is a very personal and very sad book about the memories of English cellist Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;, as told by her brother and sister Piers and Hilary du Pr&eacute;.

That impression was completely wrong. Jacqueline's sister and brother don't say much about Barenboim. When they do, they only say good things about him. Barenboim was even interviewed by Hillary for this book. I don't believe at all he ever remarked \\"Couldn't they have waited until I was dead?\\" like someone wrote in Wikipedia.

All of her family members come to life in the pages of this remarkable book. The time period (England and France in the 1940 through 70s) is also vividly painted.To the \\"critics\\" of this memoir... Please read the following: I find the parts of the book covering Jacqueline's alleged affair with Kiffer Finze (the husband of her sister Hilary) and the parts of the book chronicling Jacqueline's difficult emotional periods, when she lashed out at the people who were closest to her (both episodes were most likely brought on by the onset of her MS...) only made Jacqueline seem all the more fragile and sympathetic.

I had very little idea of why it was so funny, but it was; rereading it now, it seems like a hardcore band covering a novel by Philip Roth. It's all there: the self-hatred, the obsession with sex, the worries about being Jewish, but Klane is so much faster, louder and angrier, and in so much worse taste.It concerns one Nemiroff (we never learn his first name and he doesn't seem to think that he has one) who works as the only Jewish counsellor in a summer camp. (I learned of the existence of summer camps from this book.) He hates the kids he is in charge of, hates the camp, hates his fellow workers, and especially hates his luscious Gentile colleague Miss Booe (we never learn her first name either), because he knows she'll never go to bed with him. In the course of the book, he throws up in a girl's ear, has attempted coitus with a guitar (the girl who's wearing refuses to take it off, even in bed) and generally behaves like one of the most singularly repellent anti-heroes in contemporary American fiction. But it all changes when Miss Booe suddenly turns out to love Jewish guys...\\"The Horse Is Dead\\" has been long out of print, and first editions are now extremely valuable.

It truly shows you can find your calling at almost any time in life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"MY LIFE IN FRANCE\\"by Julia Child with Alex Prud'hommeThe idea for this book was born in 1969 when Julia and her husband Paul in sifting through letters and photographs of their time in France (1948-54) realized that those formative and joyous years contained the elements for a book. It took thirty-six years but with the help of her grandnephew Alex, \\"the French book,\\" as she called it is a delightful reality.The cackling laugh and self-effacing humor so familiar to those millions for whom Julia demystified French cooking jumped off the page as I devoured this book with the same enthusiasm as a civet de sanglier on a cold Parisian day.Who could have predicted that the daughter of a staunchly Republican, Pasadena WASP businessman and a social mom who rarely ventured into kitchen would become one of the world's foremost authorities on The Art of French Cooking?She did it by absorbing the culture-listening, watching and questioning as in this visit to her local cr&eacute;merie:\\" Madame was a whiz at judging the ripeness of cheese. If you asked for a camembert, she would cock an eyebrow and ask at what time you wished to serve it; would you be eating it for lunch today, or at dinner tonight, or would you be enjoying it a few days hence? Once you had answered, she'd open several boxes, press each cheese intently with her thumbs, take a big sniff, and-voil&aacute;-she'd hand you just the right one. I marveled at her ability to calibrate a cheese's readiness down to the hour, and would even order cheese when I didn't need it just to watch her in action. I never knew her to be wrong.\\"MY LIFE IN FRANCE chronicles Julia's education as a chef in Paris, her collaboration with Simone (Simca) Beck and Louisette Bertholle on the seminal MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING and the creation of THE FRENCH CHEF cooking show that established her as a media star.But it is also a love story as Paul's tender observation of quotidian culinary activity so poignantly reveals: \\"She's becoming an expert plucker, skinner and boner. It's a wonderful sight to see her pulling all the guts out of a chicken through a tiny hole in it's neck and then, from the same little orifice, loosening the skin from the flesh in order to put in an array of leopard-spots made of truffles. Or to watch her remove all the bones from a goose without tearing the skin.

Enjoy Paris? Read Julia Child's lovely memoir compiled by her nephew from letters sent by Julia to her family during years of residence in France when she learned to cook and started producing the very first culinary instruction show on television back in the 1960's.

Thank you Julia!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If not quite an intimate self-portrait, this book was a slight, charming, and impressionistic memoir of halcyon France.

A quick read that is very informative as well."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"What I found to be very interesting and unique about this book in addition to all the comments made here on the joys of reading about France in the early fifties, and the inspiration that comes from reading about Julia's trials and tribulations in becoming a chef extraordinaire, are the vignettes on Paul's career as a USIS (USIA) officer in the diplomatic corps for the American Embassy in France and Germany. Suffering through the indignities imposed upon them at the height of the cold war during the McCarthy era, one is reminded of echoes of the Salem Witch Trials and tactics used in the Bush Administration today, to silence opposition. As artisans, liberals, and as a dynamic duo supporting one another's professional ambitions, Julia and Paul are two peas in a pod, rejecting American dominance and power and American chauvinism in favor of humanism, internationalism, and self determination. While much of the story takes place during their earlier life, so much of their life's lessons have enormous relevance for living in today's realities."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Child's book, it should be beyond surprise, reads rather like a cookbook. The reader is dizzied with untranslated French and long lists of French foods and left wondering if the subject was that of snails or gourmet crackers or perhaps the neighbor's cat. The text is a skillful lesson in gleaning from context quickly which passages should be read in detail and which should be merely glossed over for lack of adding anything to the narrative. No matter how assiduous I might read and reread Julia's detailed dinner menu from December 5th of 1962, it is exceptionally unlikely that any impression will be left on my apparently impregnable mind.Actual writing aside, one is left at the end with a vast respect for the life that Child led. Her experiences were varied, her energy and patience immense and yet she never seemed to succumb to the egotism so common in the accomplished. She acknowledged that her chosen topic was a complex one but she pursued it with a vigor and exactitude that made it accessible to the common housewife of the time. Unlike her predecessors she took the time to make sure that the recipes in her book were not only detailed enough to be executed by the uninitiated but also didn't include those ingredients that couldn't be obtained outside of France. Her legend as the bridge between French cooking and America seems well earned.Overall, I'd grant the book a few stars out of five but it would be much more entertaining to someone who had more of a connection either with cooking or with French culture. It is fairly hard to dive mind-first into a book that requires so much of it to be explicitly ignored."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This little book is longer than it looks...it flows and is interesting...it will keep you reading to see what's coming up."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I found 'My Life in France' an absolutely delightful read.

Glad I did because the book not only follows the movie (Julia's parts) closely, it also adds much more detail to her and John's lives. And one of the best bonuses is that the book continues after the film version ends with Julia's TV career, her next two cookbooks, and finishing with the later days of Julia and John's lives. It was written with her grand nephew and finished shortly before she died.

It is shear pleasurable reading as she takes one through Paris, Provance and Marseilles. One can hear Julia's voice as one reads."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child barreled forward in time, so stopping to write a memoir was never really an option for her until late life. Working with her nephew, the writer Alex Prud'homme, she finally sat down to capture her remarkable life and times not long before her death in 2004. It is to Prud'homme's credit that he is invisible in the posthumously published My Life in France, except for a brief foreword. The voice on the page is all Julia, the joie de vivre, the humor, the intelligence, the honesty and the passion. It is written in her own cadences, and her voice and face swim up from the page through the words.Julia focuses the narrative on the decades when she and husband Paul first lived as diplomats in Paris, beginning in the late 1940s, later moving to other cities, and then purchasing a second home in the French countryside once they had returned to America as their base. She makes the most distant years feel present and vibrant. Her cherished husband, Paul, is revealed as a remarkable man, an artist who had spent his youth with the Lost Generation in the Paris of the 1920s. It is his job as a cultural envoy with the United States government that takes them abroad, putting Julia in the right place at the right time to become who and what she became. As much as her narrative pays tribute to her charmed marriage and chronicles her path to writing the cookbooks and becoming a television phenomenon, it pays extraordinary witness to the post-World War II/Cold War American-European relations. When the Childs first arrived in Paris, there were a few lingering reminders of the artistic Lost Generation, but largely the expatriot community was comprised of embassy staff and diplomats. By the time they return to the US, the American military presence dominated. Joe McCarthy's long arm had tainted the good life, as had US government squabbling about how Europe, France in particular, was handling Communism.But Julia, handed lemons, always made far more than mere lemonade. Next came the cookbook (which offers a rare look at the innards of the publishing industry in the early 1960s) and then along came PBS. If we thought we knew it all, it seems like an entirely fresh story in her own words. The last chapters addressing Paul's declining health, the aging and loss of friends and the sale of their home in France are poignant after all the romping in the earlier years, but Julia presents it without sentimentality and a nod to the fact that this was all a natural progression of that great thing called life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book was everything I had expected from the information provided prior to purchase.

If you are a cook or foodie, you will enjoy all the talk about marketing, cooking, wine, setting up a kitchen in less than ideal circumstances, and how life can be transformed by the civilized custom of preparing and sharing a fine meal. One thing is clear, an essential ingredient in all the carefully planned and crafted recipes is love. A nice surprise will be the book's fascinating insight into the post World War II culture in Europe and the U.S. Mrs. Child's nephew and co-author Alex Prud'homme has done a fine job capturing the personality, joie de vivre, and love of French culture and food that this remarkable woman shared with so many people."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The story of Julia Child's \\"My Life in France\\" took me back to the fifties.

The words used are very discriptive and you can almost taste what she tastes, smell the scents, etc. She and her husband have a love of life and the better things in such a fun and unassuming way you have to love them and their experiences. i recommend this book to anyone. Everyone I know who has read it says the same. There are alot of rembrances of what they ate and drank, places they visited and lived so vividly because she kept extensive journals and her husband wrote letters to friends and family daily, so there is a thorough paper trail. Both are intelligent and rubbed elbows with well known people as friends. mostly, they just loved life so big it makes me look at everyday things for more than I usually do or take for granted.

I guess I should have been prepared when Mrs. Child slammed Julie Reed's blog (and book) for not being \\"serious.\\"Mrs. Child's love affair with food comes through loud and clear, but some of her comments about others (especially Simone Beck) seem self-centered and harsh. Whatever Mrs. Child's thoughts were about Ms. Beck's recipe-writing abilities, without the original idea by Ms. Beck and Mrs. Bertholle, Mrs. Child would probably still be just a very good American French cook. I think the way Mrs. Child repaid Ms. Beck for all her collaboration and kindness (including leasing land to the Childs for a country home in France at no charge) was petty and mean.If this book had been originally published from notes and diaries unearthed after Mrs. Child died, I could understand dredging up some drama and controversy. But Mrs. Child provided her journals and gave extensive interviews to Alex Prud'homme before her death. I just wish Mrs. Child could have stopped with the publishing of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and the beginning of her amazing career."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I grew up watching Julia Child's tv show on Boston's PBS station WGBH, and although I found her eccentric delivery and complicated cookery fascinating, I was much more inclined to see her in the Dan Akroyd school of haute cuisine. Having loved the \\"Julia\\" scenes of post-war Paris in the movie \\"Julie & Julia\\" I was most interested in reading this book about Julia Child's years in one of the world's most magical cities. It begins most evocatively with Julia's arrival in France, moving swiftly to the iconic scene of her life-changing discovery of sole meuniere at La Couronne in Rouen, her first night in Paris and the apartment she and Paul Child move into on the \\"Roo de Loo.\\" All well and good. Her descriptions of nights strolling Paris with friends or just alone with Paul, stopping in at bars and cafes along the way, are a joy to read for anyone who loves Paris. Being a francophile myself I enjoyed the French phrases she drops in almost constantly, but for those who haven't studied French I can imagine it would be quite annoying, as not all of them are translated. After a while it might seem tiresome. It was also disappointing that in order to love France she had to put down England. \\"The ruddy English faces, always chirping and drinking tea\\"--what an unkind thing to say! Granted, English food was not known for its quality in the post-war years, but England was still on rationing in those years. And she completely missed the boat on Italian food, which has become much more of the American cuisine than French home cooking did.But it is her intolerance of other ways of thinking and her hostility to her father that kept bringing the phrase \\"spoiled rotten\\" to mind while reading this book. Julia was only too happy to accept the goodies from Pop, all the while putting him down as a hopeless rube because he preferred his home in Pasadena to traveling in France. The part where she complains about having to travel first-class, Pop paying the way of course, was just too much, as was referring to her father and her stepmother as \\"Philapop\\" (Phila and Pop).There is no doubt that Julia and Paul Child were devoted to each other, that Julia Child influenced a generation, or even two, of American cooks and chefs, that she was most influential in introducing techniques and ingredients that American home cooks would never have used. No one argues that.It is her own rather snobbish, dismissive, superior personality, complimented by lashings of smug self-assurance, that becomes in the end a pain in the meuniere."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I'm reading \\"My Life in France,\\" Julia Child's memoir of her life in the late '40s/early '50s with her husband, Paul. Everything I'd read about Julia and Paul indicated that theirs was a perfect love story - that they were inseparable and blissfully in love - when in fact, Julia was probably more like Julie Powell (author of Julie & Julia) - self-absorbed and obsessed - than critics of Powell would like to admit.The book is written in a colourful manner, probably mostly thanks to Alex Prud'homme, her husband's twin brother's grandson (Julia did admit to being a terrible writer). You're able to easily envision every scene and can almost taste every dish, smell every aroma, fragrance, temperature... AND feel the indigestion rising.All those high-fat, high-sodium foods she loved so much - the heavy creams, red meat, etc. - is ironically what made her sick and might have caused her cancer. She definitely romanticized what was obviously very difficult living in post-war France. She had a positive attitude and absolutely loved what she was doing... but the movie, Julie & Julia made it seem as though she were living in luxury, when in reality, it was the opposite. Paul's $95/week - only $15 to live on after expenses - could not have sufficed for this ambitious lady.Julia was rebelling against her rich, conservative father and went for the opposite life - she was one of those spoiled California girls going off to live a so-called charmed Bohemian life struggling in the streets with the working class, yet still taking money from her parents - so not exactly struggling like the rest of the impoverished, just living among them. Though I do admire Julia's determination to document authentic French life and cooking rather than choosing to mingle with the bourgeoisie.She wasn't interested in creature comforts; she'd discovered a great passion - her wonderful career - relatively late in life and was determined not to take the easy road, to instead work hard to be the best cook possible - admitting her limitations and overcoming them step by step along the way. And thanks to her husband's support, she was able to achieve that and so much more.In every venue, including the movie version of Julie & Julia, Julia Child comes off as a beloved American master (thanks to Meryl Streep's brilliant portrayal) and her cheerful, optimistic attitude was the impetus to her success all along the way. Julie Powell, on the other hand, has become maligned for evidently cutting off her own nose to spite her face, revealing her dark side and being too \\"whiny\\" and immature.Powell might be a despicable person, but she was smart and creative enough to find her mirror image and to bring the Childs to the forefront of American history because of her discoveries about Julia. Julia Child may not have thought much of Julie's blog idea, but she can thank Powell for sparking an interest in us all so Julia Child is not just remembered as the goofy gawky cook on PBS in the '60s lampooned on SNL, but rather a real romantic - a brave woman, great pioneer in gastronomy - who found true love and her calling and was able to live a very full life in spite of limitations one of lesser character may have found insurmountable.The jury is still out on this one..."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I am surprised not to like this book but I do like the food descriptions. I've always loved to cook and, being Italian (Sicilian) this book helped me learn something about French cuisine which I appreciate. I also lived abroad in different countries, including within Europe so I can sort of relate to the feelings she describes about new experiences and romanticizing a place/people.I have to say, though, something about her tone is really irritating to me. The way she constantly describes different crowds as \\"all French\\" and \\"intellectual\\" seemed like she was just trying to find validation in her identity as someone who had assimilated in France (which she may or may not have). I just can't imagine a French person coming to America and writing a book that constantly described every venue as containing \\"all Americans\\" or being \\"in English\\". Along those lines, it was also aggravating how she incessantly categorized everyone as intellectuals or not (including family and other Americans). It's kind of self-promoting/self-hating/identity-seeking.I want to believe that this is a generation gap issue. Many people who are young now (her age in the book) are very aware and conscientious of ethnocentrism and self-hating identity issues and wouldn't express some of that in the way she did. She may have been just an exception for her time and excited to claim that identity as the adventerous woman abroad and that is what I picked up as obnoxious. I have to keep in mind that today in America it is a much more common practice to travel/live/study/work abroad than it was when she was young.She also often made herself out to be broke and struggling and even said she was new to household help, however in the beginning of the book she tells us she had cooks all growing up. I don't have a problem with her being privileged but I just think she should own it instead of trying to pass herself off as suffering financially. She even described the the heating/plumbing issues as something she was coping with to see how the rest of the world lives and I felt like laughing. She with her maid and cook and scores of hired help for parties, galavanting in restaurants and buying tons of groceries and cookware, yeah, she is really in solidarity with the world's less fortunate. She just wasn't used to a more earthy way of life, that's all. She still lived in basically a mansion with hired help in a good neighborhood and attended an expensive school and ate the best food and wine in town! She reminded me of a college freshman, just separating from her parents' identities and coming into her own vehemently. Everything is always black and white first to establish differences and individuality.The other stuff about her not liking Italian food didn't bother me. She exhibits an addictive personality that was stuck on France so of course she may not fully appreciate Italian cuisine.Annoying qualities aside, I like her perseverance and positive attitude, even if it seems to border on delusional sometimes (like when all \\"Parisians were delighed with the tall California girl\\" and all that nonsense). I wonder how she would feel about her portrayal in the movie as someone who didn't fit in well in France and spoke almost no French? Considering all the French words she insisted on incorporating in the book I bet she would be mortified! Overall this book is okay and I am just overly sensitive to ethnocentrism and identity issues because I am lucky enough to have alot of experience as an expat and I also work as a therapist cross-culturally."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"For a great hunk of my life, I was a Julia Child groupie. For years, I cooked from her books, took notes when the TV shows came on, ran around trying to find every exotic ingredient, thrilled with my successes, rarely gave up on my failures. Even today -- almost four decades later -- my copes of her cookbooks have survived every move (including overseas) and show my love for them with splashes, gobs of dried-on food and floury fingerprints. When \\"Appetite for Life\\" came out, I read it, reread it, then listened to the audio version, twice. While some of the hostility she harboured toward people and the US came through there, it was muted. Bottom line: I thought I loved Julia Child as a cook, a person and certainly as a gifted television personality.Alas, the woman who comes across in this book isn't the funny, clever, resourceful, self-deprecating, good natured woman I thought I knew so well. Maybe what bothers me most is her constant ridiculing of her father, a typical California businessman of his time. In her elitist view, she comes across as though she's the only enlightened person on the planet. No one else -- other than her beloved Paul -- knows anything. In talking of her father, she repeatedly describes his \\"stupidity\\" and \\"ignorance\\", merely because he supports different political candidates than she does. Similarly, it actually hurt to hear her trash Germany and German food, at least as compared to her beloved French. Don't get me wrong -- she's obviously entitled to her opinions. It's just the mean-spiritedness that shows through, the nasty streak that makes her ridicule rather than comment.The book is way too political. I see now that she truly hated the American system and way of life, at least as compared to the socialism of France and then Norway. She makes much of the McCarthy investigation of her husband Paul, and while it came to nothing, I found myself thinking that if she and he were saying the things that now appear in this book, I understand why someone might have thought they were anti-American. I thought so myself. I feel sorry for the other government employees she makes fun of, revealing her vicious pet nicknames for them. These people -- or their children -- are still around, and her gratitous and downright spiteful treatment of them must sting. It's really a vicious book.Even so, I read it all, didn't skip a word. Enjoyed the enjoyable parts, tried to tune out the rest. But I must say, there's a lot about Julia Child in this book I wish I didn't know. A little ignorance is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The product is what I expected. It arrived on time and in the condition advertised."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I very much enjoyed Julia's descriptions of beautiful France, wonderful food, painstaking work, and life with her devoted husband, Paul. She did seem a bit full of herself at times and forgot that not everyone has the privilege of life abroad. I also found myself frustrated with her obstinacy toward her father; after all, she was a grown woman and he, an old man set in his ways. Why engage him in political discussions at all? Altogether, though, an enjoyable look at Julia's life and 1950's France."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Overall, I liked the discussions on food and where they were in France, but after being a long time fan and having met her, I was surprised how mean-spirited she was throughout the book to Simca and Louisette."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The book was near mint and arrived in three days, in time for Mother's Day. Outstanding value and service. Thanks..."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book was in perfect condition when it arrived. I am most pleased with it. It also arrived in record time. I could not be more happy!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I'm a foodie so really enjoyed this book. It left me wanting to know more details about her later years. I guess I'll have to go to a biography for that. The years in France were magic though. I thought the book was well written and quite hilarious at times. I would have given it 5 stars but the ending was just too abrupt for me."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I saw the movie first and fell head over heels in love. Julia Child was an amazing and dedicated woman and it's hard not to give in to her charm. The book was a fun peek into her everyday life while living in the best city in the world, Paris! With her loving husband Paul at her side, she shares not only her tricks of the trade but some of her most intimate moments with friends and loved ones. A must read for all those who dream in food, long to visit Paris, or just like a good story!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Hang on to your hat; Julia Child's energy, enthusiasm and love of life makes this book a wonderful ride. The movie, \\"Julie and Julia\\" left me wanting to find out more about her early life. The Julia Child that most of us knew as a famous French cookbook author was interesting when viewed within those confines. When you add the OSS work during WWII, the romance with her husband, Paul, and the years of sheer work it took to get her book published, well that's amazing and fascinating. The amount of life experiences that Julia Child packed more into her long life should be a lesson to us all.Read it even if you haven't seen the movie or thought about cooking a coq au vin. It will inspire you to do more with your own life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is not merely a memoir about Julia Child's early career, it's a priceless, passionate glimpse into Paris of the late forties and fifties. Child writes beautifully and with an unguarded heart. Never mind about the cooking or the celebrity author, this is an outstanding book in every sense. If you weren't a Francophile at the beginning, you will be by the end."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child was one amazing woman! I loved her on TV, I loved her cookbooks, and I loved getting to know her better through this book, a collaboration with her husband's grandnephew, Alex Prud'homme, begun when she was 91. She wasn't afraid to tackle anything and set about learning new languages, cultures and especially cooking, with a determination and sense of fun which is worthy of emulation. I'm going back to her cookbooks with a new appreciation of all that went into creating them."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"While this book is certainly not a work of great literature it does give one a sense of the passion that Julia Child had for France and French cooking. It's a fast read and after reading I went right to my MTAoFC and cooked myself a delightful and very French dinner!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"One of my first cookbooks in 1965 was Mastering the Art of French Cooking and I have followed the work of Julia Child ever since. I very much enjoyed this book, and could almost hear Julia's distinctive voice as she reminisced. One of the things I enjoyed most was learning about the streams that fed into Mastering. The emphasis on technique, and the theme and variations structure of the book, then new to cookbooks, reflect the professional course Julia took from Le Cordon Bleu. Similarly, Julia's great success as a TV chef built upon her work as a cooking teacher and the demonstrations she did on a self-arranged publicity tour for Mastering."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This beautifully written and completely charming memoir captures Julia's unique and genuine personality. This is one of the most delightful, happy books I've ever read!Julia admits complete ignorance at the beginning of her story, which attests to her most unusual gift for blending self-deprecation with charming self-confidence, and it is her natural curiosity that led her to collaborate with master chefs, true to her non-condescending and bubbly personality. There is a heavenly breathless spirit about this book that captures her earthiness and integrity and complete emotional fulfillment that is absolutely contagious. This is the most beautiful love story between kindred spirits. Her husband, Paul, who clearly shines throughout, worked for the US State Department, and it was he who encouraged Julia's exploration and interest in fine cuisine and his transfer to Paris began her legacy. What a wonderful marriage they must have had! They shared an extraordinary life of love and passion, not only for each other but for travel and the tastes to explore other cultures. Her colorful and bright and cheery account of her 1940's life-changing stay in France is one of the most cherished, enjoyable and interesting books I've had the pleasure of reading. I wanted to sing.This book is a great biography, as well as a historical account of a nation, as instruction of the refined culinary arts, and it works well as the travelogue that evokes the locations being described. My senses were titillated; I could smell the baking bread, lavender fields, leg of lamb cooking in sumptuous herbs; I could taste the magnificent, succulent dishes; I could see the lush countryside, the cobblestone roads and streets. The laughter, the wit, the union, their lives together had to be Heaven on earth. This is beautifully told, brimming with life, just as Julie Child lived during her years in France, and as compelling as a great novel that you know has a happy ending.Because the family kept all of Paul and Julia's letters home, primarily Paul's twin brother, Charlie and his wife, the detail is as fresh and fun as when it first happened.Julia lived a \\"joie de vivre\\", loved a new adventure and took life on with an incredibly open mind. She seized opportunity with great zest and had the confidence that she could achieve her goal. She was real and fun and didn't take things too seriously. One of Julia Child's most compelling attributes was her ability to share her knowledge without being intimidating. She gave you the sense that she was as accessible and as friendly as if she'd known you all her life, although infinitely more interesting. She truly cared about people, all people. With class, charm, enormous magnetism, and great determination this remarkable woman had turned French cooking into an American fascination.This is not a book about food; this is a book about life, full of passion and love and wisdom, beauty, art and creation. You can learn a lot from a life like that. This should be on everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Like other reviewers, I got pulled up into this book and read steadily until I was finished with it. Just after finishing My Life In France, I read Patti Smith's memoir. Whereas Smith's voice was affected, and I'm pretty sure she exagerated the way her ealier life went, Julia Child spoke (apparently this memoir was dictated to a younger relative) with solid authenticity of her life as an artist. Child writes of how she developed her craft throughout her years in France, of how she came to love France itself, of her love for her husband, and of her gratitude for the ways in which he enriched her life. It's clear how highly she valued her relationships with other people in addition to her husband: friends, mentors and collaborators. She captures her times as well: post-war France especially, but also the US in the 50's and 60's. And, of course, she sure could cook! I kept thinking to myself, man I wish I were friends with this lady. I liked her, her life inspired me, her aesthetic attracts me.PS Don't get me wrong, Smith's memoir was a great read too."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book languished on my 'to be read' pile for quite a while, but when I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The writing is vivacious, just like Julia was, and gives an excellent day-to-day portrayal of life in postwar France (into the early '50's). In the first part of the book, I could see mental pictures from the movie (which I had seen & enjoyed), but towards the middle, the book diverged quite a bit from the movie and provided a great deal more detail as well as a different timeline. The narration was first person, past tense (occasionally 3rd person past, when a group was involved) and you felt like you knew Julia and her group of family & friends personally. The time period covers from when Julia and Paul arrived in France in 1948 right through to the mid-90's when Paul was in a nursing home and Julia gave up their French home. During that time, you followed the Childs as Paul was posted to several other cities and countries for his job with the Foreign Service; as Julia finished her book and took the first steps towards becoming a household name because of her TV show - all the ups and downs, joys and triumphs.Highly recommended for anyone interested in cooking (or eating!)or Julia Child herself.Note on Kindle formatting: Perfect. I did not notice any issues at all."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Loved this little book. Julia taught all of us \\"of a certain age\\" how to cook!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book about Julia's life in France is a wonderful, eye-opening and down-to-earth \\"expose'\\" right from the author's musings - she paints a wonderful pictureof her life, her surroundings, her friends, and her loves: cooking, her husband, and the city of Paris. This revelation of who she was (educated, insatiably curious about French cuisine, funny, liberal, well-liked,and extremely sociable) made me wish I had become a fan long ago. Now I'm cooking French as I've wanted tofor years!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved this book and found both the woman and her story fascinating. Julia Child discovered her passion for cooking late in life and her love of food and researching cooking techniques shows what a hard-working and consummate professional she was. Her relationships with her husband, colleagues and friends is also quite interesting. The aggravations of working for the government (and being totally unappreciated by them) and having to be uprooted from one country to another gives the reader a sense of the uncertainty in their lives and the sadness of having to leave locations that have captured the heart. Also compelling is a glimpse into the publishing business and the trials and tribulations of getting a book accepted by a publisher. France comes to life in the vivid descriptions and Paul Child's photographs are an added treat. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This isn't just a book about food, it's a love story. Julia's love for her husband, and her love for France, and she does both of them justice. You can feel the emotion, whatever she's writing about!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Julia Child through \\"My Life in France\\". I love cooking and reading recipe books (for fun)- and can really relate to Julia's process of learning to cook and perfecting each dish. Being an avid traveller and someone who currently lives in a foreign country, I felt a connection with Julia and her husband. Their adventures abroad (learning a new language, making local friends, fitting into a foreign culture) were wonderfully familiar. My husband had gotten me as a present the book \\"Julie and Julia\\" (now a motion picture) but I found the main character Julie very boring -there wasn't enough of Julia Child in that book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I have an appreciation for Julia Child now that I've read this book. The memories, thoughts, reflections and witty writing bring Julia back to life! What a force of nature she was! Skip the Julie/Julia book (reviews are very mixed for it) and read THIS book if you love food, life and adventure! Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"After reading Julie & Julia and being reduced to tears at the utter grossness of that book, I decided to try again when I found this one. I became pretty interested in Julia Child after reading that other monstrosity and was secretly curious about whether she was anything like that freak character \\"Julie\\" in the other book.What I got surpassed my wildest expectations-this is a beautifully written story of Julia Child's life with Paul and her friends and how she grew into a French Cook, teacher, and icon. The way this book was written, you can see with your mind where each story is set, the people that made up the story, and even the lovely food and drink! It was terrific and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Great read, would highly recommend, I ate it up in about two days!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"As a small child, I remember watching Julia Child and Graham Kerr cooking shows every weekday just before my afternoon nap. Even though I was only 5 or 6, I loved watching these shows because these cooks were so passionate about cooking and food.\\"My Life in France\\" is a delight because it describes how Julia Child, the new bride, became Julia Child, international chef and cultural icon. What fun it is to read about a person who is so interested in life and all of its possibilities. Instead of thinking, \\"I can't,\\" Julia dives into a cooking program at the Cordon Bleu, writing the quintessential cookbook on French cooking, and hosting a television program to show the average American housewife how to cook. Her \\"why not\\" attitude is inspiring.The only thing that made me occasionally cringe were the detailed descriptions of the preparation of poultry. I have a soft heart for animals. I'm not a vegetarian, but it was sometimes hard to take Julia's unsentimental view of animals as mere ingredients in a recipe.This book is a wonderful read because it describes the wide-open, full-throttle vision of a woman who loved life.Bon Appetite!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I picked up a copy of this book while my mother was in the hospital. Can I just say that in trying circumstances Julia is the ultimate companion. Julia's sense of vitality, joy and adventure jumps off the pages. This is an excellent story about a life well lived."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is wonderful. Not only does it give insight into Julia Child's wonderfully interesting and well-lived life, but I also quite enjoyed the insights into the Foreign Service and USIS in the 1950's.

The giftee seems to have enjoyed it"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julia Child was a warm, down to earth person. The story of Julia and her beloved husband was so entertaining. It is hard to imagine that she learned how to cook in her 30's. At times the book is laugh-out-loud funny."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I never would have read this book e/x for my book club, and so glad I did!! I've been living in Rome for the past 1 1/2 years, so I just loved reading about Julia's experience with living overseas and her falling in love with French food and cooking. The writing was fantastic -- I felt like I could hear Julia talking; hear the vendors at the markets selling their wares; hear the waves slapping on the port where their apartment was in Marseilles, and smell the countryside of their home, LaPeetch, in France. I so enjoyed Julia's honesty as well, with her collaborators, her relationship with her father, her sister, Dort. It truly was a joyous read!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this book...I feel completely inspired by Julie's story, especially her late start at her career. It gives hope to all women that the best may still be in front of them."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Great read with good photographs. Especially interesting for anyone who admires Julia Child, loves eating and cooking, or adores France."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If you're interested in Julia Child, this is a wonderful book about her time in France and how she became such a wonderful cook. A very human story....with honesty and a wonderful gusto for life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I really loved reading about Julia Child's time in France and her early TV shows. It was entertaining and a great read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"My Life in France\\" is a wonderful autobiography. Julia Child recounts the joys of her life in France, and it's easy to see why her experiences led her to love both the food and the country. She also discuses how she came to become the famous figure we all know and love--from her modest expectations for her first cookbook to her first TV show. Throughout the narrative it is clear that this was a life well lived by someone who truly loved her life.While I really enjoyed this book--what fan of Julia Child wouldn't love it--it's not the best written autobiography and at times I felt like I was reading a technical cookbook rather than an autobiography. I supposed Julia was simply writing in a style that she was comfortable with, but these more technical passages lessened some of the joy in the rest of the narrative.This book is a must read for Julia Child fans. If you're interested in reading this because you enjoyed the film \\"Julie and Julia\\" I don't think you'll be disappointed with the original!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Was a fun book to read, read it while traveling and picked it up as often as I could."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved reading this story! It was so romantic and I got lost in the world of cooking, romance, and France. Mrs. Julia Child's life is such an inspiration to me!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Very interesting and sometimes funny read. I enjoyed reading about Julia's life with Paul after seeing the movie Julie and Julia."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Very good read about a very interesting woman and a top-flight cook who was creative and imaginative in all she did."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I love to cook, but had never considered trying Julia Child's cookbooks since I believed they were simply too complex. This book talks about how she arrived at recipes, but with the telling is a glimpse of Julia herself. She is simply delightful and funny.I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a book that is light reading but very insightful.Having read this book, I am now interested in obtaining some of her books to review. Cooking is an art that Julia has raised with the understanding that nothing is too hard to try!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If you like to walk for exercise and a tantalizing book on tape makes the time pass quickly, this is an engaging book to listen to. You can walk an hour without even minding it if it's an enticing tale. If you love France, love cooking, love education, love positive and warm people, you would enjoy listening to this book. As someone who has started educational programs and run a school, I found that part of Julia's life is fascinating--how she started a cooking school in France and then continued to teach millions on television.The love affair between Julia and her Paul was charming, too. Everything about this book is a delight! If you believe in destiny, it's fascinating to see how events conspired to propel Julia into the life she was meant to lead. You see how she thought she had little marketable talent and just took a cooking class to fill the time while in France. Nor did she ever plan to write a book or host a television show.She had no business plan, no driving ambition...it just unfolded in a very natural way to a delightful person. It is said that truth is stranger than fiction; it's often more interesting, too, because it actually happened. An autobiography provides a front row seat on a life than no author could accurately imagine--to recreate the sights, sounds and zeitgeist of post-war France from the eyes of a California girl who happened to end up in the capital of the cooking world because of her husband's job. What a fun perch to view the world at that time period, especially Paris which would soon reassert itself as the capital of culture and style.Julia's unabashed, unassuming and joyous take on that time is a refreshing read or story to listen to. This is an autobiography that is as entertaining and original as any good novel."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I adored this book. Julia's style, as relayed by Alex Prud'homme, is so lively, you can almost hear her voice and experience her irrepressible ebullience. Her zest for life in general and food in particular is positively contagious. As a Francophile myself, I shared her awe and delight in all things French. Paul Child's photos add a wonderful density to this sensuous account of Julia's life in France."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"SUCH an amazing read, it was delicious and I could not put it down...such a sweet book! I am reading it a second time."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is the book about Julia Child you should read. It's inspiring, funny, fascinating, enlightening...well done. I really appreciating hearing more about her family and her upbringing, her doubts about her own career and discovering who she felt she really was. I could definitely relate. It was a delightful read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I read this book because, like Julia Child, I discovered a deep passion for cooking late in life. This book made me realize that you are never too old to try something new and have a wonderful adventure. Julia was as natural a writer as she was a cook, and the story flows along beautifully. I also learned a lot about the post-WWII adjustments faced by France, and was able to use the book when teaching my high school U.S. History classes about WWII."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I read as much as I can about Julia Child including autobiographies of her friends. This is Julia's autobiography and it is so wonderful What a life!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is a travel journal and autobiography in one. The personality of Julia Child shines through in Alex Prud'Homme's writing. I enjoyed the characterizations of people the Childs knew during their foreign service years and the peek into post WW II Europe of the 50's. An excellent period piece. The photos included are also a treat."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A charming and inspiring life story. It's her last book and co-written with her nephew so I'm not sure if it's her true voice that is presented. I never watched her cooking shows nor read her other books, but this one is sending me on a retrospective search for la belle Julia. Oh, I made boeuf bourguignon following Julia Child's recipe and it was merveilleux! Her passion for life, people and food is truly inspirational. Thankfully her dedication to preserving classic foodways is seeing a resurgence in the locavore and slow food movements. Hopefully I will find the same witty, perceptive and salivatory descriptions in Julia Child's other works."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Reading My Life in France makes me want to buy copper kitchen utensils and create great dinners! In fact, I think I will do just that this weekend.This book is also a window into the lives of people involved in international politics after WWII and into the everyday lives and culture of the French at that time. The words and photos created very real pictures in my mind, and added to my understanding of that time period.Having seen the movie Julie & Julia, I was amazed at how well Meryl Streep took on the persona that comes through in the book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I've always been a fan of Julia Childs' cookbooks and her TV performances but had never really known too much about her background except that she studied at the Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris. What a wonderful life she led with her husband...for anyone who loves bios and autobios and has ever been to France or would like to go to France, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"How great is this? You won't need to fast-forward through an irritating modern story line. I love this book and not just for the cooking. It is two geeks in Paris transformed by their love into a stunning couple. I give this to young women and tell them the least of it is the food. Here is a woman who grabs life and loves it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book co-written with Julia's grand-nephew, provides great insight into Julia Child's life, cooking technique and her love of food, the science of cooking, and more. The writing style is delightful to read and Alex deftly captures the emotions and passion of Julia in the book. Worth a read!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I admit that as an Australian I knew very little about Julia Child. The only information I knew about her was that she was a television cook and was a revered personality in American television. After reading this book about the start of her marriage and travelling through France with her husband and learning about the language, food and people of her adopted country is amazing. I thoroughly recommend this book, it is very well written and an interesting insight into a fascinating person."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"So..... I decide to go to go off the Paris for 7 weeks, and which books would serve me best? I ended up taking this one (on Audible... too bad Julia Child didn't narrate the book her self... but you can't have everything). It's equally enchanting as she gets rapturous about cheese or a fish market, and equally funny as she tussles with her co-authors. I am a Parisian trained chef, so Julia Child has ALWAYS been my hero and I loved her TV show when I was growing up for the unconscious flirtations she had with disaster (if part of it falls on the floor, just pick it up and continue on... no one will know!) and her gawkiness and her charm and wit. If you like food, or how to get a book published, or France (I happen to like all three) read it! It's very good and the movie DID NOT do it justice. As the French would say... Oh La La. (And I was just there...and not one single French person who I asked knew who she was!) It would be good to know a little French, but not as important to know as much (Spanish) if you were reading Comac McCarthy... so don't let the minuscule amount of French throw you off. It's just a great book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I always knew Julia Child was an accomplished cook and TV persona, but I had no clue how marvelous she was! My Life In France is a phenomenal book, her writing is so crisp and captures the moment; I felt transported to Paris in the 1940s and 1950s, even though I have never been nor surely not in that time period. This is the best book I have read this year! A must-read for anyone who's passionate about food, and appreciates stunningly good memoirs."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I've always loved Julia, I watched her show as a child, we only watched PBS. She's been an inspiration and this book was just wonderful. I've read it at least three times and watched the recent movie even more. Don't miss this opportunity to really get to know Julia Child."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I checked this book out of the library on a whim and didn't have high expectations. I then put off reading it and almost returned it without even opening the cover. Fortunately, I felt guilty returning a book with out at least reading the introduction and first few pages. Once I started I couldn't put it down! It was an easy, fast read, and very inspirational. This book made me want to travel, cook, write and figure out what my passion in life really is. Prior to reading this book I didn't know anything about Julia Child, but now I can't wait to check out some of her cookbooks."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"France, food, family and friends - Julia Child's life was fascinating. I didn't want this book to end, I enjoyed it so much. It was so interesting to see how her life and career unfolded, layer after layer. She was truly remarkable though she probably wouldn't see it that way. The love she and her husband shared was so touching. Told in Julia's own words, with the assistance of Alex Prud'homme, who did an excellent job of giving her story its continuity. Nicely done! Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I have been a fan of Julia Child's since her PBS cooking shows. I own most of her cooking books. I hated the book to end. It was like Julia was talking just to me and telling me of her experiences. A great lady!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I am such a backward gourmet...that Julia Child (maybe I'm too young but at 42 that's kind of a scary admission) was this manna-from-chef-heaven. The few times I saw her on tv her squeaky weird voice sort of scared me. I didn't know her history.But I love books about chefdom and so I read this one and gosh, it really clarified why Julia was such a kitchen saint. What I especially appreciated about the book was that she was not a real person saint -- she'd let you know that she was quirky or ego-centric or frustrated.I adored the book. Went out immediately and looked up the Masters of French Cooking or whatever it was called, because it was so much a part of this book -- and because, having read this one, I felt that I could connect with a bit 'ol (intimidating) cookbook.Absolutely worth reading. I got mine from the library but know I want to read it again someday and so will buy it for my bookshelf. I can't think of a higher accolade.Carolyn"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A collection of anecdotes about Julia Child's life in France is read with spirit by gravelly voiced Flo Salant Greenburg, who doesn't attempt to mimic Julia so that Julia's wit and wisdom come clearly through. Wonderful stories about Julia's cooking school and writing her famous cookbook as well as personal stories about food feasts Julia enjoyed. This is a pleasure for anyone who misses Julia and wants to learn more about her early cooking years."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I just finished this jewel. And I'm mourning that there's not more to read. Never having read any of her other material and discovering that Julia and I were in Paris and the south of France at the same time.... I feel as though I've lost \\"une bonne ami\\" even though we differ by decades in age.What I loved most was her attitude which oozed \\"joie de vivre\\". Julia was lover of adventure with a marvelously open mind. One cannot but be impressed with the way she seized opportunity and the confidence with which she carried herself in spite of being in a foreign environment.Maybe that was some of Paul's doing. Short, older and balding, Paul Child was a gentle artist and poet, comfortable in his own skin and a wonderful mentor. Surely others are struck by the emotional and physical support of his wife that we see in Paul. I treasure this book for the intimate view of a unique maturing marriage of two humble yet fascinating people who stayed deeply in love for the duration.I didn' t know Julia Child's life at all until I read this book. And I was thrilled to read that like my husband and I, the Child's fell in love with the South of France and had to set up a household there.Next time we go I'm making a pilgrimage to see where these two sweet, joyful people lived and loved... Meanwhile, I'm buying copies of My Life in France for my favorite friends and highly recommending it to anyone who will listen.Donna Delfino Dugay"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"My Life in France\\" was such a treat to read. As the legend that she was, I expected to learn about Julia's education and passion for cooking, which was still accomplished ten fold.What I didn't expect was such a unique look at her adorable, quirky personality! Even better was the charming love story between her and Paul. What an amazing partnership they shared in every way. We should all be so lucky at the end of our lives to have had such a relationship."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I was fortunate enough to have met Julia Child on several occasions and I can say that her personality shines through on every page of this wonderful book. Whether or not you cook yourself, you will find yourself charmed and entertained. Definately recommended."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is just a warning about the audio cd. If you dislike a voice that sounds like she smokes 4 packs of cigarettes a day and has a lisp-then don't purchase this. She can barely get any words out and I turned it off after 5 minutes. Read the book instead!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Rather than a complete biography this ebulliently phrased memoir covers the years Julia and her beloved husband, Paul, spent in France (1948 - 1954). Paris was where the the woman remembered as the doyenne of French cooking got a rather late start on what was to be an enormously succesful career.Paul and Julia met in Ceylon where both worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and married in 1946. Two years later Paul was assigned to head the exhibits office of the U.S. Information Service in Paris. A painter and photographer who had been to France earlier he was well suited for the task. On the other hand, Julia had never been to Europe, came from a middle class, conservative California family and by her own description was \\"six-foot-two-inch, 36-year-old, rather loud and unserious.\\" Little did she know what a life altering experience France would be.She well remembers their first meal in Rouen which she described as \\"absolute perfection. It was the most exciting meal of my life.\\" Thus began her love of French food, in fact for all things French - the markets, the people, the restaurants, the countryside. At that time she was an average cook at best but determined to learn how the French prepared such glorious food. To that end she learned the language and then enrolled at the famed Cordon Bleu. Surely no student has ever worked harder, more doggedly or found as much joy in food preparation as Julia. She wanted to know every infinitesimal detail of each dish, including the whys and wherefores of ingredients chosen, and variants in cooking time.Eventually this devotion to French cuisine led to a partnership with two French friends (Simone Beck and Laced Bertholle) in a cooking school and from that to dreams of a cookbook for the American market. There was a very long road ahead filled with happiness, surprises and disappointments but the book was published at last. This, of course, led to Julia's television series and more cookbooks.My Life In France is filled with rhapsodic descriptions of dishes and accompanying wines as well as details of keeping house in a country still recovering from a devastating war. Due to Paul's career the Childs moved from Paris to Marseille to Bonn to Washington to Oslo and then Paul's retirement. Julia met every challenge with pluck, purpose and bonhomie. Hers was a life well lived, thoroughly enjoyed, and vividly remembered.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child married Paul, her senior by ten years, and lived happily ever after. Their life is sweet and adventurous and Julia and Paul absolutely completed one another. He encouraged her to write her famous cook book and she busily set about with Simone Beck (mostly) and Louisette Bertholle (nominally) to write a masterpiece that is still essential to French cooking today.This book takes the reader to France beginning in 1948, to Julia and Paul's favorite restaurants and to dine with their best friends. Julia must have taken copious notes throughout her life to complement Paul's letters to his brother so that we are able to read in detail about the meals they ate and the fine wines (including the age of the wine!) they drank with their meal, what the weather was like and who they dined with.Now, if that sounds boring to you, you need not pick up this book. But, if like me, you are enthralled with feasting and good company all in an idyll setting, and love to read about such details; you will love this book.It was also interesting to see where reality lie between Julia Child's own account of events and the movie, Julie and Julia. I was also fascinated by the more in depth look at Julia and Paul's life.This book cements her place as one of America's most endearing chefs."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A large part of that is thanks to her grandnephew, Alex Prud'Homme, who went thru letters, etc. to piece together a narrative that Julia Child then fleshed out, expanded upon and clarified from her memories and recollections.There was always just something about her that was honest, humorous, quintessentially American, captivating, surprizing, etc. and this book captured all those and many other of her qualities so that I almost felt like I was listening to her speaking in person.She lived an interesting life, met some fascinating people, in interesting times, and in some very interesting places, and she tells about all that in an engaging manner in this memoir."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child's funny, bubbly, colorful and bright account of her 1940's life-changing stay in France (where her husband was a diplomat) is one of the most enjoyable and interesting books I've had the pleasure of reading. These stories of how Child discovered the culinary delights of France (long before she became America's most beloved television chef) are a lot of fun! Child's unusual gift for blending self-deprecation with appealing self-confidence has never been more finely tuned. This book is great as a biography, as an account of a nation during a time and place, as a tale of the refined culinary arts, and it even works as the sort of travelogue that evokes the locations being described. In the imagination the senses smell the baking bread Julia describes, we hear the running of those ancient rivers in the lush French countryside, and we can all-but taste the magnificent dishes about which she writes with such keen comprehension and reverence. We all miss Julia Child, but this reminder of her class and charm (as well as her devotion to French cooking) brings back her greatness. Easily a five-star book!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book completely caught me by surprise. I picked it up at the library because I saw a sprinkling of French phrases throughout and thought it might make an interesting read. I studied two years of French in college, lived near Paris for a month when I was 19, and dream of taking my children to France for a visit someday.Never would I have expected this book to be so life-changing for me! My first shock was that Julia didn't know how to cook when she married Paul in her mid-30s! She arrived in France knowing nothing about French cuisine, summarizing her view from the ship with this: \\"I was a six-foot-two-inch, thirty-six-year-old, rather loud and unserious Californian. The sight of France in my porthole was like a giant question mark.\\"Her years in Paris represented an awakening for Julia, and I held onto her every word. How many of us also have a dream, yet we feel like we're too old to even get started? Julia discovered French cooking to be her life's passion, her raison d'etre, and she dreamed of taking the techniques she learned at Le Cordon Bleu home to America.The heart of this book for me was \\"the Book,\\" with a capital 'B,' which Julia co-authored with two French women, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. The 700-page manuscript bounced around three different publishers before it finally settled under master editor, Judith Jones at Knopf. As a writer, I found her journey completely fascinating -- especially the process of how the title came to be. How different this book would have been if it had retained the original boring title of \\"French Home Cooking.\\" Editor Judith Jones is the genius behind the title, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\" C'est magnifique.The book is a love story, highlighting Julia and Paul's happy marriage, as they lived in various cities in France, Germany, Norway, and finally the U.S. Paul's magnificent photos of French life add visual depth to this work. I also thought it was interesting that the book was written by her grand-nephew, who interviewed his great-aunt during her last years of life, piecing together decades of letters written by Julia and Paul to family members. What joy that must have brought her to see her story so eloquently written.The book is laugh-out-loud funny at times, and I've become a lifelong Julia Child fan now. I must read her other books and watch \\"The French Chef\\" DVDs because I somehow missed the show when it was on PBS. (I guess I was too young.)For anyone remotely interested in writing, publishing, cooking, or French life and food, this book is a must-read to add to your collection of favorite books."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I bought Mastering the Art of French Cooking when it first came out, and I have followed Ms. Child's career with great interest since then. I had the pleasure of meeting her when I lived in Cambridge, and found her utterly delightful. Perhaps there are times when one is better off not knowing too much about an idol. Much of this memoir is charming, and it is presented with a light sophisticated touch. However, one is left with a picture of a woman of privilege who never doubted anything she did for very long, and who was a bit smug and superior. Her disdain for all non-French cuisines, especially that of Italy, should have been beneath her, and her condenscension toward her colleagues, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholde, verges on mean-spiritness. The excessive use of French phrases, when English ones would have been perfectly fine, smacks of Francophilia gone to excess. In spite of all that, I enjoyed hearing all about her early culinary experiences, and I continue to hold the lady in high regard for her unmatched influence in raising the culinary awareness of millions of Americans."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This was a perfect book of its kind- the memoir of a talented and interesting person at just the right place.Julia Child was always one of my heroes. I spent quite a few hours as a child watching her on tv and thinking that she was lovely and that I wanted to grow up to cook like her. This book tells me how her life was changed by France. The evocative description of her first meal there is a moment captured in time.The book deals with the culture of France, her marriage, her family back home and the physical pleasures of a land where good taste reigns.I love that I feel that I am right there with Julia as she tries new recipes for her cookbook or she and Paul go discovering together.Jolly- pure pleasure."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It was in a magazine article that I first became acquainted with this new book. The beginning of the book was well written and a pleasure to read. However, the more I read, the more puzzled I became. Yes, Julia Child is an icon in the culinary world, but the way her personality comes across in the book is not how I would have thought of her. She is not sentimental and she says this herself. The chapters dealing with her father's death and her husband's own illness and later demise makes her as though she doesn't have any feelings. The last part of the book is rather boring, listing only people, the food the ate and the wine they drank. The picture she paints of France is sublime and wonderful. I only wish she could have expanded her inner thoughts with the many people who were so important in her life. It left me feeling rather \\"puzzled\\"."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"While I find most food writing, particularly autobiographies, tiring to the core this book warmed my jaded little heart.It's hard not to love Julia Child, but when I got this book I was hardly expecting to come away from it not only satisfied with geeky details of her life but also inspired to explore food fearlessly.The story never bogs down in sentimentality. The prose is tight and focused and the tone is so perfect you can almost hear Juilia's shrill voice recounting meals in Provence.Few things I have read have made me want to not only cook but look at food as a philosophy of life.I have come away from this book changed for the better and I think that is the best thing any author can hope for."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Sit back and enjoy Julia Child's well written memories from her early married life in France. How interesting to read about Paris right after WWII. Her descriptions of the French countryside and Parisians are warm, detailed and wonderful. She is quite a good writer. Equally as charming are the many pictures included in the book, most of which her husband Paul took. She was a determined woman who decided shortly after her first meal in France that she was going to learn the language and how to cook. Her inspiration and love was her husband Paul who had a passion for good food and wine. I knew little of Julia Child's pesonal life up to this point and I found the writing easy to read, interesting and very honest while describing her relationships with family, friends and her husband. She isn't sentimental, but is extremely observant and the writing has excellent descriptions of the food, wines and the cooking techniques she learns. It took tremendous focus and organization to complete the cookbook \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\" The task seems even more incredible when you understand that Julia Child knew nothing about cooking when she arrived in France. The book at times did lag, especially after she moved to the U.S.A. and began her tv show. It's clear her first love and spiritual home is \\"le belle Francais\\", as she calls it. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"For anyone who loved Julia Child or who has the least interest in cooking, this is an absolute must read.I date my love affair with Ms. Child to the early seventies when I saw \\"The French Chef\\" in re-runs. Her style in the book is just as vigorous, witty and irreverant as it was in her various television shows.Note that there is not a recipe in the book; it is an account of her life.The pictures by her husband Paul Child are priceless. I am trying to get my twelve year old daughter to page through the book so that she can see what France looked like fifty years ago.And, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the book can be read as a love story. This is an absolutely wonderful, absorbing book!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I like that this book is written in letters from long ago. It made me realize that there is no such thing as 'the good old days', people and society haven't changed much since the 40s/50s. Better technology maybe, but we're still essentially the same. It was cool to see the history of Julia Child, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this to a friend."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"She has such an easy, relaxed style that makes it feel like she is sitting with you telling her stories."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The biggest image I come away from this book with it a woman that was absolutely comitted to what she loved and was one of the hardest working ladies I have ever read about. Can you imagine making a reciepe 80,90,100 times to make sure it is perfect. I have, and cook from her cookbooks , I learned to truly cook from Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It was interesting to find all the places Julia and Paul lived. It would seem that she gained far more in some ways from the ability to globe trot than did her husband. Julia Childs' story seems almost like a fairy tale ( a fairy tale with a lot of sweat involved). After reading My Life in France... and pondering over her life and her husbands life as detailed in this book I came to the conclusion that those of us who are better cooks than we ever would have been without her 2 Mastering the Art of French Cooking Books ; we are the ones who are the recipients of all her hard work and dedication to details in cooking. I did not always agree with her viewpoints but for me she is still to this day miles above the 8 ziliion cookbooks on the market or out of print.She has taught me more than anyone, class or group combined, and I learned it all from her books, icons to great foods."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Easily one of the best books I have read. With each page I fell more in love. Long live Julia."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia took me on a trip through France and encouraged me to remember my high school French. The joy she had for cooking is contagious."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"While her story is an interesting account of how she became super French chef, there was so much French interspersed throughout that I (who speak English and Spanish) often was at a loss. Some of her stories even had the &#34;punchline&#34; in French. I understood that the recipes would have some language references, and since she lived in France, I even expected some French words occasionally, but this was over the top. I have it by my bed for when I can't sleep. It puts me right out."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I really like Julia Child. She amazes me and will never cease to. Not only is she brilliant but she is funny too. Highly recommend. No spoilers here!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book came into my hands either completely by chance, or by divine intervention, I'm not sure which. I am not a Foodie or a chef or even all that interested in food beyond making dinner for my family and the occasional holiday meal for friends. I picked up \\"My Life in France\\" because I saw it in a used bookstore and had a unexplained urge to add it to my pile (possibly because I hadn't had lunch and was hungry.) But I am so glad I did pick it up. In her book Julia Child talks not just about food, but also about politics, culture, people, and facing challenges with humor and a sense of adventure. Of course, she also has plenty to say about food! As I mentioned before, I was not a Foodie before reading this, and I'm still not, but now that I have read \\"My Life in France\\" I find that I can't look at food quite the same as I did before. I'm more aware at the grocery store and more adventurous when planning a menu. \\"My Life in France\\" was hugely fun to read, and gave me a new perspective on history, on travel... and food, of course."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It follows the movie exactly. Very funny and tells the story of Julia Childs after WWII. If you are interested in this person it is a good read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This was a great book about Julia's life in her early days and with her husband. Its talks about her wonderful time in France and how she loved France and the difference between the US and France. About the war and people being accused (her husband of things that were untrue) but not being about the defend yourself time. She talks about her friends and her life cooking (this was before she was popular and had her own TV show. She talks about her life with her husband. They were so in love and she was his ying to her yang. Some things I felt could have been told more briefly. But what I liked about the book it came from the heart. I read this book because it was the book of the month in my book club. What is good about book clubs is they get you out of your comfort zone to read all kinds of books you might not have ever chosen. Try it you might just like it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Wow, this is a great portrayal of an extraordinary personality. As others have said, she is remembered as a parody of cooking shows, but this book really makes her come to life. She LOVED France and LOVED to cook. She really wanted to share her love of French food with Americans, and by writing her cook book, she did it. I remember trying to cook from it in high school--it seemed so difficult. But I cooked more recipes a couple years ago, and I can now appreciate how she revolutionized food in America. She was the Food Channel--before any one ever thought of it. This book really shows her vivid personality, good humor, dogged tenacity and zest for life (hackneyed as that phrase is, she really sounds like an amazing person)!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It made me want to cook, eat and live in France! Julia Child is very funny and honest. It took forever to realize that when she said \\"marketing\\" she really meant \\"shopping at the market.\\" Her story was very inspiring and it was fun to know that she loved cooking for no better reason than she loved eating. Same here!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"To those of us \\"of a certain age\\" Julia Child was an institution. She was the first real celebrity chef who cooked outrageous dishes on TV and did so with a flare and gusto that made her show one that few people wanted to miss. Oh, we all know that occasionally she would tend to go overboard, and there are parts of the shows that showed that cooking was not all antiseptic success, but that was definitely a part of her charm. As was her unforgettable voice and mannerisms.This book is about her life in cooking. It starts out with her memories of her first meal in France, right after World War 2, when she and her husband are posted to Paris. This meal was a revelation to her and launched her on the voyage of her life. I found it interesting that she was so taken with French food as she grew up in Southern California in a rich family and spent the war years in the far east where she was exposed to Chinese cooking and more. Nonetheless, it was French food that captured her interest.The book follows her burgeoning interest in food and what she did about it that eventually landed her in a position where she and two friends decided to create a cookbook that explained French cooking to an American audience to cook in the United States. As she explains it, there are differences in the ingredients and in the ways of cooking which is why such an effort was necessary. As we learn from reading this book, creating a cookbook is a lot of work. Following the runaway success of this book, she launches - quite accidentally - into the career of celebrity chef which results in TV shows, articles in magazines, and more cookbooks.While the first half of the book focuses on her life in Paris and learning how to cook, the rest of her life is described in terms of France. She discusses and describes memorable meals on the Cote D'Azur; her cottage there; and how her relationships with her French friends and co-authors changed. She also describes the filming of her TV show in its French episodes. This is why the book is titled \\"My Life in France.\\" There is very little in this book of her years in other countries or her life in the U.S. after her husband retires. One thing that struck me as odd was that she described her relationship with her father (which was not good) and his funeral, but there is nary a word about her husband's death. Towards the end of the book she mentions that she closes and leaves the French cottage because he suffered from strokes and was in a nursing home and neither of them could travel anymore. This was strange to me as it was obvious from the earlier part of the book that these two were very much in love and worked very well as a team.The book itself is very much written with and influenced by Julia Child. Essences of her personality shine through constantly. From the use of French terms - even when unnecessary - to the sometimes quirky terms she used (Cookery-Bookery; \\"I did not know a chicken could taste so chickeny!\\"). in the Foreword we learn that this book was written by her when she was in her early nineties and completed by her grand-nephew just after she died. It captures her essence and what she loved about French food. So, while today we would not want to even contemplate eating many of the foods that she discusses and appears to adore, it is a good recollection of what French food used to be like, and incidentally, discusses the life of a unique lady."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved watching Julia cook on TV...laughed at her stories and enjoyed cooking with her. This book she read into my ear...I am a fast and quick reader, 300 pages seldom take longer than a day but not this book...I read every word to myself in her voice....Enchanting...Great story of timeless love for life..Thanks to Alex for helping in telling the story!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"My Life in France\\" by Julia Child, tells after the how Paul and Julia Child comes to France to work at the Embassy in Paris, where Julia decides that she wants to go to school.

Not only does it give you a glimpse into the life of Julia, but also into France in the late 1940's and 1950's. The creative process of creating her first book--the set-backs, the triumphs, the hard work, the occasional wonders and difficulties in working with others--was also deeply interesting and inspiring.This is a book not only about Julie and the beginning of her love-affair with cooking and France, but about how she came into her own and about the enduring relationship with her husband. The black and white photos inside were fascinating...though my favorites must be the personal cards that she and Paul created. They were both creative people, each in their own way, and clearly respected and supported each other. The work and the sheer zest for live that they poured into everything--even their parties--was incredible.Not only would I recommend this book to anyone interested in Julia and cooking, but also to anyone who wishes to catch a glimpse of what it was like to live in Europe at that time. It also shows you how hard it can be to write and break into a business (such as television) and yet remain true to yourself. Most especially for women at that time. I applaude Julia for all that she accomplished and this book gives me more reason to thank her."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Never boring, sometimes startling, this is a jolly good autobiography by our jolly good cooking teacher, unfortunately now passed on. I never knew she was 6'2\\"! Her husband once used the lumber from a packing case to add a one-foot extension onto the end of their bed so that, as Julia says, \\"At last I could fit my size 12 feet comfortably under the covers, rather than having them sticking out like a pair of gargoyles.\\"It is as interesting to get to know about Paul, Julia's husband, as about her. They were living in Paris after 1948 because he was offered a job there running the Visual Presentation Department of the United States Information Service, a diplomatic function that had to do with presenting exhibits imparting beneficent impressions of the USA. On the side, he was an artist and a photographer. His photos contribute much to this book. I first noticed it, in fact, because of a little photo-ad with a book review that pictured Julia and her husband chest-deep in a bubble bath together. It said, \\"Wish you were here.\\" It had been one of Paul's numerous delightful Valentine post-cards that he created and that the two of them sent out to hundreds of family, friends, and acquaintances each year. (You can see it and others in the book.) Some of his and Julia's friends were a group of art historians. Paul, who had learned stained-glass making, was once prevailed upon to do repairs to windows high in the upper regions of a certain church in Paris, for which his friends thereafter nicknamed him Tarzan of the Apse. He kept up a heavy correspondence with his twin brother in the States, and many of those clever letters full of exclamatory wise-cracks contribute to the background commentary mixed into this memoir which was built in part upon letters of both Julia's and Paul's, and was dictated by Julia in her 90s to her nephew, Alex Prud'homme, without whose urging and assistance the story-telling would never have been accomplished.This is such a delicious book that I wish Julia had had a passion for writing many books as well as for being an expert chef. I felt bereft when I came to the end of this one. She does mention doing some creative writing in her early years at Smith College. I'll remember fondly the many friends and \\"characters\\" that she portrays--not to mention the descriptions of meals, the first of which in Paris included a sole meuniere that seems to have been the inception of her whole big food enthusiasm. Ever after, she ate it as often as possible! Her descriptive aptitude is apparent throughout the narrative. (I was surprised at how exciting and almost palpable were her two re-creations of the mistrals in Marseille.) Her humor and joi de vivre are real highlights of this memoir of her life in post-war Paris, and later in Marseille, Germany, Norway, and the USA, when she successfully heads the first TV cooking show in 1963.Because Julia fell absolutely in love with the place, the people, and the FOOD of France, she very soon made up her mind that she would master the language and the cooking. She signed up for a course at the Cordon Bleu and obtained a diploma there only with great difficulty--but not because she was a poor pupil. She went on to concentrate her energies in the writing of a cookbook that would be a gift to make possible for American cooks an at-home French cuisine, simple but of high quality. (I disagree that it's all that simple, though. For instance, I can't imagine that I'd ever get the hang of suspending a sack filled with a venison haunch, red wine, aromatic vegetables, and herbs out the window for several days until the meat reaches the right stage of \\"cure,\\" determined by smell, before being brought in to roast!) Julia's exquisitely detailed but simplified, over-sized cooking compendium that underwent a very long and difficult gestation was initially rejected before finally being given birth by Knopf publishers. After all the hard work and care that had gone into it for years, I was finally so relieved and happy to read Ms. Jones' enthusiastic acceptance letter, and then Craig Claiborne's favorable review of the book, that tears came to my eyes.The first thing you will learn to cook which IS simple in this Life in France book is scrambled eggs--done correctly a la Chef Bugnard, Julia's mentor at Le Cordon Bleu. (You probably don't know that you're probably not doing them right.) There are only a few actual recipes here, including Julia's originally Top Secret beurre blanc (per Mme. Michel), mayonnaise, and hollandaise, but there are quite a few cooking hints and tips. I'm not a devotee of French cuisine but was glad to get this information, and am getting ready to experiment with making beurre blanc, with its tricky chemistry, just because I want so much to know what it tastes like. (You can find it on-line now by putting it into Google/Search.) I mostly enjoyed Julia's quite personal take on her experiences with people and markets, like the following that occurred in her neighborhood \\"creamery\\": \\"Madame was a whiz at judging the ripeness of cheese. If you asked for a Camembert, she would cock an eye and ask at what time you wished to serve it: would you be eating it for lunch today, or at dinner tonight, or would you be enjoying it a few days hence? Once you had answered, she'd open several boxes, press each cheese intently with her thumbs, take a big sniff, and--voila!--she'd hand you just the right one. I marveled at her ability to calibrate a cheese's readiness down to the hour, and would even order cheese when I didn't need it just to watch her in action. I never knew her to be wrong. ---The neighborhood shopped there, and I got to know all the regulars. One of them was a properly dressed maid who shopped in the company of her household's proud, prancing black poodle. I saw her on a regular basis, and she was always dressed in formless gray and brown clothes. But one day I noticed that she had arrived without the poodle and dressed in a new, trim black costume. I could see the eyes of everyone in line shifting to observe her. As soon as Madame spotted the new finery, she summoned the maid to the front of the line and served her with great politesse. When she swept by me and out the door with a slight Mona Lisa smile on her lips, I asked my neighbor in line why the maid had been given such deferential treatment. ---'She has a new job,' the woman explained, with a knowing look. 'She works for la comtesse. Did you see how she's dressed today? Now she's practically a comtesse herself!' ---I laughed, and as I approached Madame to give my order, I thought, 'So much for the French Revolution.'\\"Julia and Paul always gave people, i.e., friends, first priority in their often busy lives. There is much in their life story about sharing and collaboration, not least in the friendship that allowed them to build, late in life, a small dream-home get-away in Provence.Much earlier, however, after four years living happily in Paris from 1948-1952, Julia and Paul felt a lot of anxiety while they were waiting to find out what they would do when Paul's job there closed out. \\"One night, at a dinner chez Bertholle, there were a dozen people at the table. The eight women and three of the four men began shouting at each other instead of talking--a French habit. They were having a fine old time arguing about Catholicism versus mysticism, about America's policy in Morocco, car accidents, how to mix a rum sour, and so on. I dove headfirst into the verbal maelstrom. But Paul, the only quiet one at the table, was miserable. He whispered that he wanted to leave. Well, this was one of our differences. On the way home in the car we had a spat. It began as a disagreement over what I saw as Paul's wish to withdraw from Life and go live in an Ivory Tower, and then it somehow devolved into a silly argument over Time magazine. Of course, the nub of our argument was probably something else entirely, like the uncertainty of our future.\\" (I thought this was a marvelously vivid and just-like-life scene, re-created with so few words!)The book ends appropriately with Julia's statement about how and why good French food is an art. If one \\"takes time and care and uses the freshest ingredients,\\" the results will be a \\"magnificent burst of flavor, a thoroughly satisfying meal, perhaps even a life-changing experience\\" such as her \\"epiphany\\" with the sole meuniere at her first meal in Paris. She concludes: \\"In all the years since that succulent meal I have yet to lose the feelings of wonder and excitement that it inspired in me. I can still almost taste it. And thinking back on it now reminds me that the pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite---toujours bon appetite!\\" (---Just goes to show, you never know when you might happen to consume your life's passion before it consumes you.)This book illumines the fact that plain-looking and plain-speaking Julia Child was a much more well-beloved, brilliant, beautiful (even pretty when young) person than we may have guessed while watching her on TV in her later years. I think it's wonderful that her once singular and personal, absolute passion to share some delicious food now reaches across the years to touch me, and you perhaps, and so many others, with such enjoyment."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I didn't expect to like this book but I LOVED it. I learned so much history thru the eyes of a woman who I really knew nothing about. Her sense of humor comes thru and the way she grew and learned new things was inspirational. She was really self taught in a lot of ways from the French language to French cooking. I got to see post WWII in a new perspective as well. Julia Child was a very interesting person in history."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Excellent book.

This is for the reader that loves a biography, France (and the French)and eating good food. You don't have to be a cook to read this; it is not a cook book. The love story of Julia & Paul is tender and real. I met the Childs back in the 80s and they were lovely, charming, smart & jovial; that comes through in the pages.

I never watched her programs or attempted one of her recipes. After reading My Life in France, I felt like I'd made a new friend. She is very open, honest, and genuine. Readers will find her sense of humor and humility entertaining and refreshing. I was truly inspired by the years of hard work and attention to detail required for her to master the art of French cooking.

While I did not really like the movie very much, I found that the parts I did enjoy were the ones that focused on Julia Child, not Julie Powell. This book, written by Julia and her grand-nephew, was exactly what I had hoped to find. It begins with Julia and Paul moving to France in 1948 for Paul's job, and her discovery of not only French cuisine, but of France itself. I genuinely felt like Julia Child was sitting next to me and telling me her most treasured memories in such detail. She describes meal after meal, it is amazing how she was able to recall it all! Her quirky personality shines through her stories. My Life in France is a must-read for anyone who appreciates food, even if you aren't very good at making it, or wants to know more about Julia Child from her perspective."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Having enjoyed readingJulie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerouslyit had me curious to find out more about Juia Child and her years in France.

Couldn't sleep ,so I used to watch Julia reruns on pbs in the middle of the night.I liked watching this tall person who like to ham it up, and seemed to really enjoy herself.I didn't necessarily have the same taste in food that she did, but it made me want to experiment.She made it look fun. I was sad when she died.When I saw this at Walmart for five dollars,I had to read it. You can tell julia was narrating it. She puncuates her sentences with words like Yum ! Hooray! Terrific!! Ach!The way she describes her friends,daily situations are priceless, I could see her doing all of this like a movie in my head.I enjoyed hearing about how she met her husband, Paul.He was the reason she learned how to cook.Her father never approved of Paul and she gave up alot to be with him.Had no idea her husband was a government agent ,artist,poet and a photographer.If you like reading books,about people who find a way to make the most of life regardless, please read.You won't be disapointed.

This book is for cooks and anyone who enjoys an amazing story of life!!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I have always loved cooking, my mother was an amazing cook and I like to think I learned a thing or two from her. I bought my Mom this book and decided I wanted to read it myself. Before I picked up this book, I only had really thought of Julia Child in the past 20 years with her TV show. The dancing chicken, need I say more. I always had thought of her as a caricature of a person, more an American making fun of French cooking. I realize this is my navet&eacute; but alas this was the impression I had from her TV show.I am SO glad that I read this book. I know have a wonderful understanding of how she evolved into food, into a relationship later in life, into her love for France. All things that I can relate to as a woman who found love for a man and food later in life as well. I married at 38, we honeymooned in Paris and I now take great pleasure in cooking as I did previously but I appreciate the ingredients and how they go together. I felt a kinship with Julia as I read the book. I have to admit, I was envious, she lived a life I wish I had.I want to apologize for not understanding who she really was but am eternally grateful for this book which introduced me to the real Julia Child. I am now eagerly waiting to buy both of her Mastering the Art of French Cooking books.Enjoy, I did!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Absolutely heartfelt, charmingly candid memoir from the woman who practically single-handedly brought French cuisine to the American kitchen. It's how she became who she became, in her own words.I read this concurrently with MFK Fisher's immortal The Gastronomical Me and Ian Kelly's biography Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Careme. Fisher was a gastronome, an appreciator and a highly sensitive writer; Careme was a showman and an innovator with a gift for the spectacular. There is no one definition for a foodie... they're as different as human beings. In this exalted company, Julia more than stands her ground.Speaking in her own clear words, Julia stands out as a sensible, fun-loving, seriously dedicated chef, student and teacher whose passion for her subject carries over to, and is an offshoot of, her love of life in general. It's virtually impossible to read this autobiography and be downhearted. Her joie de vivre, sense of adventure, experimentation, wonder and simple delight in discovery and sharing are contagious and much needed in a chilly world.I recommend this warm and engaging autobiography not just for those who enjoy cooking, but for anyone who would like a torch along the path to finding their own joy in life. Unmissable and life-enhancing."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book was so enjoyable to read! I was fascinated by this look into post-war France, and into Julia's world there. It made me wish I would have know her and understand why it seems that everyone who knew her, loved her.One thing I thought was fun was her encyclopedic recall of various meals they enjoyed, including the wine vintage.You'll also love hearing how she came to write her first cookbook and become a host of her own show on PBS. For those of us who are over 40, it's also great to note that the most interesting parts of her life didn't even begin until then."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"'My Life in France' is a superb book that effuses with that wonderful endearing quality we have all come to know and love in Julia Child. The book focuses mainly on the early years of developing her first cookbooks and television show.The book begins when she and her husband, Paul, make their first trip to France because of his new job assignment. You feel her giddy excitement upon landing on the shores of a place she had for so long desired to go. We hear in minute detail the look, smell and taste of her first French meal, and from there we are introduced to \\"La Belle France\\". Before I began the book, I wondered for how long I could sustain reading each night about a person's breakfast, lunch or dinner meal that had been eaten 50 years prior, but Julia has such an adorable way of speaking, and her sometimes child-like observations of life and people around her are so heartwarming, you just wish you had been there. As the book progresses, she speaks about her collaboration with two women for her first book, and sometimes the claws come out. You're thinking, \\"Julia!\\" But, as with all friendships, there are things that agree with us and things that don't. Without some of these tidbits, the book may have been too trite, or frankly boring. Subsequently, it was interesting to hear of the minor squabbles that occurred between the women and the simple controversies concerning her husband and his role as a \\"diplomat\\". Paul and Julia Child made many friends overseas, whom they adored and loved. The majority of these people stayed in her inner circle until the end of their lives. For me, night after night, I couldn't wait to sit down and read about so many dinner parties with simmering meats and side dishes, lovely conversations, and eccentric friends. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it ended too quickly, and I found myself missing the evenings with Julia."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Thank you, Julia, for sharing your wonderful life with us before we lost you, and especially \\"thank you\\" to Alex Prud'homme for continuing the project and creating this beautiful book. The spirit of Julia Child shines on every page. Merci beaucoup!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Mastering the Art of French Cooking is one of the few cookbooks I brought with me when I left California and came to live in Spain. After all, Julia Child was the only cooking teacher I had ever had (I had watched her shows on PBS when I was young). This wonderful memoir tells about how she came (struggled) to write this book, and also tells about her love of food and cooking, her love of France, and her wonderful marriage. She brings all of it to life -- the taste and aromas of the food, the markets, the sharing of meals, the learning of a new culture when she moved to France. Julia Child became passionate about cooking and about France and I found that her passion makes for marvelous reading."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"When you realize that Julia did not find her true calling until well into her 30's it is truly inspiring. This is eloquent and thoughtful story telling. A love story to her husband, France and food. A book to cherish and savor."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The new book about Julia Child, \\"My Life in France\\", written by her in collaboration with her grandnephew Alex Prud'homme is a fresh and wonderfully pleasing account of Julia's life in France after the Second World War. Arriving in 1948 with her devoted husband, Paul, Julia relates that she spoke no French, had never been to Europe and knew next to nothing about cooking. When she left several years later, this remarkable woman had turned French cooking on its ears.\\"My Life in France\\" is terrific from beginning to end. It is a far more satisfying book than Noel Riley Fitch's austere yet comprehensive 1999 biography of Julia. One hears in the current book much more of Julia's voice as she whisks her way from Paris to Marseilles (whisking all the while through various kitchens). While most of the story is told with regard to France, it also encompasses her time in Germany, Norway and the United States. What emerges is a self-portrait of a life run at sometimes breakneck speed as she learns the art of French cooking. Along the way the reader meets (or in my case, re-meets) the characters who make her story so wonderfully rich. There is her devoted \\"La soeur Francaise\\", Simca, who collaborates with her on their breakthrough book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and with whom she later parted professional company. Her often strained relations with her father, mostly about politics, make heady appearances, but it is her husband Paul who clearly shines through. What a wonderful marriage they must have had!Julia Child's story is hardly a rags-to-riches one, but eschewing the comfortable southern California life for adventure (and eventually finding her passion in so doing), makes her one of the formidably likeable people of her time. One can just hear her enjoying a good French meal (and there are many of these descriptions) and the fun she had through trial and error making a name for herself in the kitchen.\\"My Life in France\\" is as soothing as a French breeze and as scrumptious as the food about which she describes. It should be on everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\`My Life in France', a memoir by Julia Child, assisted by grand-nephew Alex Prud'homme is, as the title suggests, nowhere near a complete autobiography, yet it is a more than welcome look at a very important part of the life of one of America's most important culinary writers of this or any other time.My overwhelming impression when reading the book is that it peels away the third and deepest layer of understanding of that which made Julia Child the major influence she became. The topmost layer, known by virtually all literate Americans is the host of the PBS series \`The French Chef' and its various sequels. Virtually all foodies and culinary professionals know the second layer. This is the co-author of the great \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume I', the sole author of the second volume, and the author or co-author of many other books, whose best-known latter day collaborator was master chef and educator, Jacques Pepin. The third layer, which is just barely touched by the biography of Child, \`Appetite for Life' by Noel Riley Fitch, completed while Julia was alive, but with no assistance from her, is the story behind why the seminal \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking' was such a great work and how Child is almost exclusively responsible for that greatness. Anyone who doubts the stature of the book can read the excerpt of Craig Claiborne's review of the book in \`The New York Times' on page 230. It is clear from this statement that the quality of the book was recognized at once, and we can be thankful that the book found its way to the august and respected publisher of major new literature, Alfred Knopf, by way of its new editor, Judith Jones. Thus, the book was given a good look by the likes of Claiborne and other culinary opinion-makers of the day.What previous biographical material does not make clear is the extent to which Child was responsible for creating an important new standard for recipe writing for the amateur cook, the amount of research Child (and Simone Beck) did on all recipes, even those so basic as mayonnaise and beurre blanc, the extent to which Child crafted the techniques and ingredient lists to American markets, and the extent to which Child steered the selection of recipes to be a truly interesting reflection of the true \`cuisine bourgeois', in spite of frequent objections from the original French author, Mme. Beck (Simca).According to co-author Prud'homme's introduction, the work is based heavily on the letters between Julia and Paul Child to their family members in the US, primarily Paul's twin brother, Charlie and his wife. This is also evident from the text where, here and there, we find frequent references to letters, especially those between Paul and Charlie. Most of the remaining material is purely from Madame Child's recollections.True to the title of the book, it begins in November 1948, as Julia and Paul arrive in La Harve, France in order that Paul may take up his position running the cultural exhibits for the USIS out of the American embassy in Paris. This means it covers none of Julia's earlier life, up to and including her service in World War II as a clerk in the Far East for the wartime OSS (precursor to the CIA) and her courtship with and marriage to Paul. The lion's share of the book covers these first years in Paris and the following posting to the Consulate in Marseilles as the public affairs officer (PAO). This is the period where Julia discovers the joys of French cooking, finds her calling as a culinary teacher in her dedication to becoming a good cook for her gourmand husband, and establishes her writing collaboration with Frenchwomen Beck and Louisette Bertholle. What may not be well known is the fact that Beck and Bertholle were working on a collection of French recipes for years before hooking up with Child, to whom they went in order to have someone adapt the volume to American tastes. On the face of it, one may think that Child hijacked the project and ideas of her co-authors, especially as the arrangement with Knopf was that all royalties were to be paid to Child, who would then distribute funds to her co-authors. But, this book and the earlier biography make it fairly clear that without Julia Child and her contacts that lead to the connection with Knopf, the book would never have been.The work is not scholarly, and it is not even a good source for future biographers, but as it is a record taken directly from Mme. Child herself, it shows all the great love of food and life so evident to everyone who has ever seen Julia on TV or read her many books. One can only hope that this volume will not inhibit someone from writing a more definitive biography of \`Le Grand Julia'.After the publication of \`Mastering the Art ...', the book largely deals with the Childs' life in the little home, La Pitchoune, in Provence up to June, 1992, when Paul was no longer healthy enough to appreciate the venue and when so many of Child's culinary comrades were slipping off to the \`great Blue Yonder' and Provence was rapidly being turned into a copy of life in California.One more interesting aspect of the narrative later in the book is the description of the great friendship between Child and the second member of the great American culinary troika, James Beard (The third was Craig Claiborne). Beard was often a great source of information for Child, as he had a great memory of tastes from his long career as a culinary writer and consultant.This is easily identified as a \`must read' for all foodies, especially those who have not yet achieved an appreciation of Child's great contribution to American food writing."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"With the growing number of celebrity \\"chefs\\" on the Food Network and related lifestyle cable channels, it has become prosaic for anyone to have extensive culinary training when a telegenic personality is considered far more indispensable. Fortunately, Julia Child's posthumous memoir, co-written with her grand-nephew Alex Prud'homme, reminds us that it all comes back to what you learn from the masters and how essential it is to impart that wisdom to willing students with enthusiasm and precision. What the book captures with clarity is Child's pure joy of cooking and how it grew exponentially when she moved to France in 1948. Over the next fifteen years, with endless trial and error, she gradually became one of the leading authorities on French cuisine.True to her salty, non-condescending personality, she admits complete ignorance at the beginning of her story, and it is her natural curiosity that leads her to collaborate with master chefs who have earned a rarefied expertise in their field. The eminently readable book details her meticulous preparation toward joining them in their ranks, including a painstaking apprenticeship at the Cordon Bleu (which reminds me of the comical cooking lesson sequence in Billy Wilder's \\"Sabrina\\") and the creation of her own cooking school with life-long friends and unsung colleagues, \\"Simca\\" Beck and Louisette Bertholle. Her professional work culminated in the monumental book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\", published in 1961 after many fits and starts. It's fascinating to read how Houghton Mifflin, the book's eventual publisher, rejected the book under the presumption that the 734-page volume was too encyclopedic for American women wanting simple, how-to recipes, even though at the time, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was espousing the finer points of living through her ongoing fascination with French culture.Much to their chagrin, the book became a best seller and remains in print as a seminal resource for cooking. Child's no-nonsense approach led her to challenge alleged purists whom she felt held onto outdated culinary rules. While the book catapulted her into an early 1960's TV celebrity as the French Chef, it is her earthiness and integrity that made her a small screen fixture for four decades. Child and Prud'homme also do a nice job of filling in her personal history. In what amounts to a love story between kindred spirits, we learn that her husband Paul worked for the US State Department, and it was he who spurred her interest in fine cuisine and his transfer to Paris which began her legacy. Tellingly, the book comes full circle with her first meal in France of Rouen of oysters, sole meuniere and fine wine. There is a breathless spirit about this book, a charming mix of culinary exploration and emotional fulfillment that I find infectious. I certainly hope Child left further notes for a sequel and that Prud'homme is the one to translate them since he does such a fine job of capturing her most idiosyncratic voice here."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If all you want to do is learn something about the art of preparing French bourgoise cuisine, this warm and delightful memoir, written posthumously by Julia's grand nephew from notes taken of her stories and recollections, will add much to your understanding.But it also serves as a lesson on life as it should be lived. Julia's life stands as a testimony to the rewards for true grit and the need, sometimes, to stand up for what you believe. Many of us never find our true calling. Julia is among the fortunate few who discovered their purpose early enough that it made a difference in her life, and for countless others as well.Julia describes how she and her French companions re-invented the art of \\"cookery bookery,\\" and how they set a standard that has yet to be matched. This story is about writing a cook book. More importantly, it's about living life as it should be lived, With commitment, courage, determination and, above all, with love.This book should not be missed by those who enjoyed Julia's famous TV series, a classic in its own time. But I also recommend this book for those too young to remember Julia on TV, as an example of how you too can find purpose and joy in your life.I won't give the book 5 stars only because the writing sometimes lacks a good transition from one chapter to the next, as memoirs often can. But, don't let that keep you from enjoying this book for what it does offer."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Rather than a complete biography this ebulliently phrased memoir covers the years Julia and her beloved husband, Paul, spent in France (1948 - 1954). Paris was where the the woman remembered as the doyenne of French cooking got a rather late start on what was to be an enormously succesful career.Paul and Julia met in Ceylon where both worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and married in 1946. Two years later Paul was assigned to head the exhibits office of the U.S. Information Service in Paris. A painter and photographer who had been to France earlier he was well suited for the task. On the other hand, Julia had never been to Europe, came from a middle class, conservative California family and by her own description was \\"six-foot-two-inch, 36-year-old, rather loud and unserious.\\" Little did she know what a life altering experience France would be.She well remembers their first meal in Rouen which she described as \\"absolute perfection. It was the most exciting meal of my life.\\" Thus began her love of French food, in fact for all things French - the markets, the people, the restaurants, the countryside. At that time she was an average cook at best but determined to learn how the French prepared such glorious food. To that end she learned the language and then enrolled at the famed Cordon Bleu. Surely no student has ever worked harder, more doggedly or found as much joy in food preparation as Julia. She wanted to know every infinitesimal detail of each dish, including the whys and wherefores of ingredients chosen, and variants in cooking time.Eventually this devotion to French cuisine led to a partnership with two French friends (Simone Beck and Laced Bertholle) in a cooking school and from that to dreams of a cookbook for the American market. There was a very long road ahead filled with happiness, surprises and disappointments but the book was published at last. This, of course, led to Julia's television series and more cookbooks.My Life In France is filled with rhapsodic descriptions of dishes and accompanying wines as well as details of keeping house in a country still recovering from a devastating war. Due to Paul's career the Childs moved from Paris to Marseille to Bonn to Washington to Oslo and then Paul's retirement. Julia met every challenge with pluck, purpose and bonhomie. Hers was a life well lived, thoroughly enjoyed, and vividly remembered.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"For those who find Julia Child's recipes to be to their liking, plus those who appreciate her refreshingly irreverent attitude toward the culinary arts, will enjoy this book. That is by no means said in a critical way, but recognizes that Julia's manner can sometimes be off-putting to those who take their cooking rather too seriously. I enjoyed reading about her beginnings in Paris and her difficulty in establishing herself in the male dominated world of cooking. Her trials in getting her first books published is a most interesting story of that male domination. She tells an interesting story."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"For an American ex-pat, living in the South of France, this was an especially interestingbook. Not just the colorful description of a successful and happy life, but how, this tallCalifornian, who has never been in France and did not speak the language managed tomake it a success.Julia Child's positive attitude, her curiosity and her talent to pick the good things out ofthis foreign and strange country, won her real friends among the French people andenriched her life.Her energy was impressive. After a short while, she mastered the language, she studied inthe best French cooking schools, held cooking courses for Americans in Paris and startedto write her now famous Cook Book. She also had time to enjoy life in France. The reader,through her happy book learns to know a lovely, interesting and pleasant country, which'spopulation knows how to enjoy the pleasures of life, especially good eating and goodwine.Those who read her Cook Books will be interested to find out how she acquired theKnowledge that went in to writing these very successful books."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Prud'homme's writing made me fall completely in love with Julia and Paul Child's France. Though I had always enjoyed her, I didn't know very much about her life - how she came to be a chef at a later age, her vibrant and fun relationship with her husband, her complete and total absorption in the creation of good food. Foodies will love the description of pressed duck. The author really created something wonderful here, and the inclusion of personal photos made it even better. Totally worth it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It was Julia Child who taught a generation of us how to cook, and my, how we still miss her. This lovely book, wonderfully edited by Alex Prud'homme, is a collection of Julia's recollections, mainly from France, in the early years of her culinary exploits. As such, it is a fascinating read and a delightful experience. Amd Paul Child's photographs of the younger Julia and Paris in the 1960s alone is worth the price, almost. My only qualm with the book is that I wonder how much is actually Child and how much in Prud'home. Certainly, with any book published posthumously, one must wonder. But it's certainly a worthwhile addition to any Julia Child fan's library."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I and many friends found \\"My Life in France\\" to be one of most moving books of the year. It is a very revealing, and poignant look at somebody we thought was already well known."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I felt this was written like a travel log!Too many references to French resturants and food that I could care less about!!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Like all expat stories, they are gold mines of small trivia that you might learn nowhere else. Where else would I have learned that the French used to drive without their lights on as a general rule? Or that getting a phone in the 40s got you no less than five visits from five different sets of workers? And while this is all enlightening, Mrs. Child's story isn't. Her story of France reads painfully like every other one I have ever heard. Like every expat who bothers to write a memoir, Mrs. Child after only a few days in the country can apparently find nothing wrong with the place. in fact, it suddenly becomes superior to America in every possible way. After a while, even the massive inconveniences, such as no hot water and no phone become \\"quaint\\" or \\"we didn't mind\\" because \\"Paris was so charming.\\" Her musings on France are in fact so rose colored, it leaves me wonder if this is way she actually remembers it or if she is just so emotionally invested in it's perfection that she will admit it no fault. Finally, if I have to read one more memoir about how some rotted out ancient place on the other side of the world is \\"deeper\\" and so much more \\"sophisticated\\" that the US, I think I'm going to scream."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book started out quirky and fun and had all the coziness of the movie. However about 1/2 way through she started in with her politics. I ended up not caring what the last few chapters were about because it was mostly her politics and her high opinion of herself. Her writing style was fun and engaging, but she should have stuck to the food and quirks of living abroad."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"am i the only person not to like this book? not the julia i knew, there is a sourness to it, and not very well edited . some pictures have captions, and some do not, some french is translated and some is not.

Does the (crappy) movie want us all to buy the book for their cover advertising? I think it's unfair to your customers to remove a book you have available in your search in samples, and then withdraw it without comment. If you are loyal to corporations first, you could at least show some goodwill by explaining. When will it be available? Probably once we don't want it anymore. Good thing I didn't buy the full kindle and only have the iPhone app. Unreliable."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I bought this book for a friend. She found Julia to be unlikeable and the book slow and a bit boring. She promised to give it to me when she's done with it, but I think I'll choose something else!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I could not stand not seeing a five start review for this book ... or for anything related to Julia :)I only read an excerpt of this book in a magazine and was hooked and thrilled."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child was totally cold hearted about animals and indeed, how they were sacrified or slaughtered. Looking for meats for new recipes,she was delighted to come upon a rabbit soaked in its own blood. She had no qualms about cutting up a lobster while it was still alive.Her \\"cookery\\" obsession permeated her life and some of the pictures of France when she lived there are vivid. Julia too frequently peppers the text with French expressions, probably to reinforce how \\"French\\" she thinks she is. All the descriptions of the food, along with the constant reminders of her relentless bent for research and shopping, become tiresome. Julia Child is candid about who she is, but she is hardly likeable."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book has been highly recommended to read, and I want to buy a copy for myself and for a gift. However, I am deeply disappointed to see photos of the film Julie & Julia all over the cover."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The correct book was shipped. No pages were missing/folded/bent, etc. There were several small scratches/marks on the cover but those may be due to an unusually easy to scuff cardstock and the fact that the cover is white. I was, however, disappointed due to the very noticeable red permanent marker dot on the bottom binding that spread across a good chunk of pages. It may not have been an issue had this book not been bought as a gift for someone. This was a second attempt at ordering this book under the \\"new\\" category that had this blemish. I will return it like the first. I guess it is common for books to have this dot, however, at first I thought it was blood due to the irregular shape. If it were me, I would put these books under \\"used\\" or mention this characteristic in the description."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that at first, I had a hard time putting it down. Later I began to slow my reading pace so that I could linger in Julia's world for as long as possible. I didn't want the book to end. I enjoyed Julia's personality, her attitude toward life, her friends, family, her happy relationship with her husband, her passion for cooking and her love of France -- her \\"spiritual homeland\\". The descriptions of meals eaten, restaurants, the sounds, smells, climate and landscapes of the various locales stirred my own sense of pleasure. Unlike some current biographical books I have read, Julia was not at all self-absorbed. She was clearly an extrovert, had a huge joy of life, and was very down to earth.One particular story thread I found very interesting and eye-opening: her political sensibilities in a post WWII world and how that affected her relationship with her father. Living now, in 2010, I feel that the political right and left have never been further apart. Well, this visit to Julia's experience in the late 40's and 50's dispelled that notion. Julia was living in Paris, while McCarthyism was taking hold in America, much to her shock and disbelief. To top that off, her extremely right-wing father condoned all the actions McCarthy was taking. He felt that if it was out of bounds a little, that was ok because if was keeping America safe. How familiar is that? Julia's description of trying to have some semblance of a relationship with a father who was bitterly disappointed that she didn't marry a Republican, viewed her beloved France as a hotbed of Socialism and thought she was \\"falling right into the plan the Reds are developing\\" was very eye-opening. There was some comfort in sharing that experience through Julia's eyes. I could very much relate to her reactions.I love Mastering the Art of French Cooking and kept it next to me as a reference while I read this book. I like to cook but rarely have the time to devote to most of the MTAFC recipes. Reading Julia's story inspired me to set a couple of Sundays' apart to make a special family meal. I have taken on a few more recipes from \\"MTAFC\\", and as usual, they are out-of-this-world delicious. They make me feel very accomplished and successful when I serve them. Having read Julia's account of writing \\"The Book\\", I have a much greater appreciation of the amount of work and the dedication to perfection that Julia, and Simca, put into every single recipe in that book. In the past I may have tried to cut corners on the recipes. I will never do that again."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A perfect read. This is what the movie should have been called.

It's simply delightful to read of her exploits in France. It's backdrop of world history also adds to the overall enjoyment of the book. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Now that I've got your attention ... I was shocked when I saw this edition. I have it on my Kindle and was satisfied with this even though the pictures are hard to make out. This paperback was bought for my mother, who's afraid she might break the Kindle if she used it. But there were no photos of the real Julia Child, her husband, her friends and family, or even of her kitchen and cat. I would advise someone who wants a copy of this book to buy one with the pictures. I blame the publisher for this mistake and what a whopper of a mistake it is!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a review of the audiobook. I'll say up front that I love Julia Child and that I lived in France for five years. The book is a lot of fun, and doesn't claim to be more than it is -- a series of remembrances of a treasured time in her life. If you like cooking, eating, wine and/or France, you will likely find it enjoyable.HOWEVER, contrary to the publisher's blurb, the reader murdered most of the French. I had to take the printed book out of the library to verify that I recognized some of the places she mispronounced. This will probably not bother you if you don't speak French and don't know France, but it very nearly ruined the book for me. I'm appalled that the publisher didn't bother to make sure that they either hired a reader who could speak French or find someone who did to train her and check the finished result. Very shoddy indeed."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"So...JC and husband are living off of his meager salary and yet bon-vivanting all around Europe, eating the finest food available nearly constantly, buying oodles of kitchen/culinary supplies. It doesn't add up. She must have been getting quite a bit more money from her father than she admits to.That said, it's been a fun read as we've eaten at a few places she mentions. Plus she was quite intrepid for a woman of her day and that is very appealing to me. So, I have enjoyed the book a good deal."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"You will like the Julia Childs book. French foods. Hard work. Cordon Bleu. French recipes. For Americans.

Not meant to be a complete autobiography, it is a hodge-podge of her recollections. Julia remembers and tells us about every course of food and wine she either cooked or was served at many of the meetings of friends and acquaintances in the book. I was a bit annoyed about several aspects of her tales. Throughout, she criticizes her father's politics and small-mindedness at great length, displaying her hurt feelings at his lack of compassion or understanding of her life's choices but without ever owning up to that hurt. Secondly, as her partnership with coauthor and collaborator Simca falters, Julia discusses Simca's shortcomings, blaming her friend and displaying her frustration but without any balance of self-critique. Finally, her continual judgment of the intellectual capacity of various people she meets made me wonder just how intellectual she herself was; I certainly had the impression that she used the ranking of people's intellectualism as a way of self-aggrandizement. She seems to have been egotistical and ungenerous - but that drive is probably what made her such a force in the world of cooking."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I've loved Julia Child since I was 5-6 years old and use to watch her show, \\"The French Chef\\" as most children that age watch Sunday morning cartoons.

Each chapter has a story of about the right length for a well-written letter, the kind of letter that we are all excited to receive in the mail but seldom take the time to write in the age of electronic communication. The book documents a life well-lived, with great friends, travel and adventure.

Julia imposed the same energy and wit into the book as she did in real life. This was an introspective story of her life with her devoted husband, Paul, and their experiences in France.

It would have been an easier read for those of us who are French deficient to have more translations."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I was compelled to read Julia Child's 'My Life in France\\" after seeing Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia [Theatrical Release]. Ephron's screenplay adaptation is a mash-up of Julie Powell'sJulie & Julia(as adapted from her blog) together with this autobiographical work from Child. While the Powell sections of the film were nice but immediately forgettable, the Child sections were riveting if not downright fascinating. Sure, Meryl Streep's amazing acting job (a drop-dead inhabiting if there ever was one) plays a big part of that, but more than that was compelling nature of the story itself - who was Julia Child before she was JULIA CHILD? Turns out this incredible woman reinvented herself in her late 30s, a period that found her in France with her husband, Paul...Francophile, bon vivant, Foreign Service careerist and - most notably - possessor of a highly refined and nuanced palate.Ephron's movie nails the essence of this book's story: that of Child's surge of passion for French food; her obsession with details; and her indefatigable efforts to getMastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Vol 1)published. Child and her French co-authors slaved eight years over that manuscript. Today, \\"Mastering\\" is revered as an iconic, touchstone in the then-nascent field of \\"cookbook-ery.\\" [In fact, the movie tie-in has vaulted the current edition back to the top of the New York Times Hardcover Advice best-seller list.]Ephron's movie starts off with Child's first arrival in France and ends with the publication of 'Mastering'...a master stroke of adaptation. By contrast, Child's book takes the reader through all her years in France, ending with the selling of her property in Provence (when Child was just entering her 80s). I bought the abridged audio CD and spent five delightful hours listening to reader Flo Salant Greenberg - her unique voice, enthusiastic reading and mellifluous French pronunciation will make you feel that you're in presence on Julia Child herself."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I never really liked Julia Child while growing up. Maybe it was because I never gave myself the chance to know her. The movie Julie and Julia gave me my first glimpse and I was curious to find out just who this woman really was.

But I can see why Julia Child had so many devotees in her long career. This memoir is charming, frank, and hilarious in various parts -- and is overflowing with a love of food and of life. What a wonderful person she must have been, certainly not perfect but self-made, willful, and an American original.Child's descriptions of post-war France and of the small shops that specialized in bread-baking, fish, sausage, and all the other great food traditions evoke a world long past. It was extraordinarily impressive that as a TV star cook, she chose to spend so much time to put these traditions on film before they disappeared forever."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Touching and meaningful look at Julia Child's life.

(And to this day, I eat butter in her honor.)"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Product arrived fast, was a great expansion of what I'd learned about Julia in the movie. I am very glad to have read this."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Very interesting, fun, and informative. All aspects of the story is told in a delicious way, no pun intended. You can see, feel, and taste the excitement of the story"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I decided to read this after seeing the movie \\"Julie and Julia\\" on TV. Although I enjoy watching the \\"foodies\\" channels and can make a pretty decent dinner when required, I had no interest in French cooking. I STILL have no interest in French cooking, but found this book to be a wonderful biography of an intelligent, motivated, woman. Her sense of humor was subtle, her attention to detail amazing (to the point of OCD) and her gift for appreciating her environment was impressive. The book is written so that it can be put down and picked up again easily, which made it perfect for waiting at the bus stop or late night \\"I can't sleep\\" times. I confess that I want to take a peek at her French cookbook now that I know how much of herself went into it....and maybe I WILL try one or two simple recipes!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Having seen the movie \\"Julie and Julia\\" several times, I was eagerly anticipating reading what Julia Child herself had to say about those formative days she spent in France. I was not disappointed. In a well-written, fun and informative narrative, Julia described that time in her life when she found her true calling and passion. The love she had for learning the secrets of preparing the French dishes she so enjoyed was apparent in her descriptions of her days at the Cordon Bleu, her forays into the markets of Paris, and the joy she took in filling her kitchen with every imaginable pan and gadget to aid her in expressing her new-found love for cooking.As she and Paul walked around the city they discovered many small, \\"2-fork\\" restaurants, and enjoyed beautiful meals. With her outgoing personality, Julia was not shy about asking questions about the food and its preparation. She loved the charming cremerie, the bakeries, the fresh vegetables and meats that abounded in the markets, and she learned to use all of their offerings in her wonderful dishes. As she did so, she fell in love with the French people and with the country itself.For anyone who understands and can identify with the sheer joy Julia Child felt in learning to create wonderful dishes, the pleasure that can come from simple but delicious food, and the happiness inherent in doing all of this in a place - and for people - you love, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Mc Williams CHILD 8/15/1912 to 8/13/2004....6'2--ungainly,BIG and not very attractive.

Couldn't put it down even during the playoffs in baseball, and I love baseball, but don't like to cook. (my husband cooks) Such an adventure. Wow!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved this book! I plan on reading it again and again. It was so wonderfully detailed about life in France. Mrs. Child shared so much more than cooking, she shared her life with us in this cook, her ups and downs on her journey to find her passion in life. I actually began to understand the french language along the way. All this time I thought she wa just a great cook now I know she was really a remarkable woman."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Though bought as \\"used\\" it seemed to be brand new! Excellent, I love it. You become a personal friend of the author. Excellent Book. Excellent service. Better than i expected in all areas. I will order from you again."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a delightful, entertaining, heartwarming book from start to finish. I bought it because of my interest in Julia Child after last summer's wonderful movie and I loved it. I enjoyed it more than Julie and Julia -- a nicer tone and an interesting historical context. I wish I the chance to watch Julia on TV but will have to catch her on DVD. This is great book, don't hesitate to pick it up. Especially sweet because it was written by Julia's great nephew shortly before her death."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I found this book simplyfascinating and hard to putdown. I am giving a few forChristmas presents."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I've spent the last several weeks reveling in this book as Julia Child \\"speaks\\" once again. Her tales of meeting Paul, living in France, and eventually becoming a chef are written in her clear, friendly and reassuring \\"voice\\". For people who grew up watching The French Chef, this book will remind you of how dearly we miss Julia's clear, concise and gifted teaching as she opened up the minds of American cooks to the joy of cooking.Julia will speak to your heart and mind through this wonderful book.It's a must read.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Those who liked the movie Julie and Julia will probably want to read both books on which the movie is based. However, I would advise people to skip the whiny tome by Julie Powell and dig right into this gourmet read by the incomparable Julia Child! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Reading of Julia's Parisian experiences made me want to go to Paris. Even in the not-so-good times, I liked how Julia remained a tower of strength and pretty much played the hand she was dealt in those times. I had to laugh at some of the crude references in the book...especially her husband Paul's letter to his brother Charlie describing Paris as \\"lipstick on the belly.\\" Did they do that back in those days? LOL. Seriously though. I thought the book showed well two very interesting people who were truly soulmates who supported each others efforts. We should all be so lucky to have such a solid marriage as the Childs did...and to have the passion for cookery that she did."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I thought the book was fascinating and I had a hard time putting it down. It is very helpful to know some French as you read it though. She uses many French phrases and some short sentences all in French. Her observations and excitement over learning French cooking were inspirational to me. My interest in reading the book was created by watching the movie \\"Julie & Julia\\". I used to watch Julia Child on PBS also. It was nice to get to know her by reading the book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If you are a foodie, a francophile or just love a good personal memoir - get this book. It rocks!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Having first read the book Julie & Julia (by Julie Powell, and mainly about Julie Powell), then read some of Julie Powell's blog entries, and seen the Julia & Julie movie which balanced the story between the two J's, I needed to complete the picture by reading \\"My Life in France\\" by Julia Child.This was by far the star of the whole show. Full of wonderful descriptions of food and cooking, I could almost hear Julia's booming voice coming off the page. The true inspiration in the book though is the fantastic partnership between Julia and her husband Paul. Paul's role extended from tasting her food, photographing her preparations to create illustratons in the book, and even when necessary washing behind the scenes of the TV set.Reading this book, I realised that the books I have recently enjoyed the most cover exploring foreign countries and cooking/eating - two of my favorites activities!A mouthwatering book! Now I have to see if I can buy her cooking shows on Amazon."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My book club read this book. After discussion we grade each book with a thumbs up, down or in the middle. This was the first book that got an unanimous thumbs up.I was the one person who listened to the audio book. The reader is a bit shaky at first and the voice is a raspy woman's voice who sounds to be a senior citizen. However, it rolls on and then the voice becomes part of the presentation. It works great.Don't hesitate to get the audiobook if you feel you don't have time to read it.And as my title says I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A book based on letters that Julia Child sent to her husband's brother and his family. The letters must have been transporting, as My Life in France is filled with delicious imagery. Though the book was well written, I was disappointed that Julia the classy chef comes across as less than a class act. She uses a rapier on a number of people."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This beautifully written and utterly charming book is a must for anyone who is captivated by food, travel, cooking, france, life, love, and (of course) Julia! Her story -- like her legendary culinary style -- is inspiring and accessible. Whether you're a long-time Julia fan or have the pleasure of discovering her for the first time in these pages, the book is a delight. And as I finished, I wondered how in the world I had neglected to include \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" on my cookbook shelves. A classic on its own, \\"Mastering the Art...\\" is that much sweeter when paired with \\"My Life in France.\\" I'm giving both books as Mother's Day/Father's Day gifts to all the (real or wannabe) chefs in my family."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I actually read this several months ago, but then remembered it over the holiday season, when I visited Paris for the first time with my partner and parents. Admittedly, I am somewhat Julia Child obsessed. I&#8217;ve seen the entire ten year run of The French Chef from PBS; watching her as a kid (and reading my Mom&#8217;s enormous 60s-style Better Homes and Gardens cookbook) instilled in me a love of cooking (though my given name had a bit to do with that as well, I suspect). Given that, however, this biography is terrific. Even if you&#8217;re not Julia-crazed. Even if you&#8217;re not much of a cook. Even if you don&#8217;t typically read biographies. This one is a real joy.If you didn&#8217;t know, Julia Child led quite a fascinating life. She and her husband worked for the US state department, and had lived several other places around the globe before settling in France. While this book is light on her early life and time in the military (a period which would likely stand on its own as a fascinating read), it concentrates on&#8211;as the title might suggest&#8211;her time in France up through the development of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and her TV show.It is interesting to note that Child didn&#8217;t move to France until she was 37, and neither spoke French nor knew anything about cooking at the time. However, her transformation in Paris into the icon she eventually became is exceptionally detailed in this book, and reads as well as the narrative in any novel.Her love of food and cooking is infectious; I dare anyone to read this without becoming a bit more curious about the culinary world. It is also fascinating to learn how the book (and its sequel) evolved, and how the TV series was created. The picture it paints of post WW2 Paris (as well as Provence and Marseille) effectively transports the reader back into her world.So if you want the backstory to the mother of all cooking shows, read this book. The stories of her journey to France by boat, her first meal in a French restaurant, her time at Le Cordon Bleu, her development of the book and the TV show, and her overall enthusiasm for cooking will engage you more than any lame Food Network knock-off."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Saw the movie, read the book, had to have the cookbook. EXCELLENTReally, 8 more words required? That is stupid. Really, Really Really Really Really Supid."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I was born in 1974, so by the time I understood who Julia Child was, her media persona had sort of overshadowed her *actual* personality. I always knew she was vivacious, strong, and an amazing chef, but I had no idea how she *got* there.This book was wonderful. I'm not interested in France OR cooking (I'm a vegetarian, as well, so French food is usually not something I eat!) but I still enjoyed this book immensely. There's so much in it that inspired me- the fact that Julia Child knew nothing about French food besides what she liked and dove into it headfirst, the way she embraced the culture and made it her own, the way she brought that magic she found in France with her wherever she went for her life, and then the way she shared that passion with her audience after she became a media sensation.This is a terrific book about/by a terrific lady. Whether or not you are interested in cooking, France, Julia Child... I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The whole of this book is equal to more than the sum of its parts, sort of like the whole of a good dish is equal to more than the sum of its ingredients: sometimes components come together to make something magical and memorable. While reading this book, a joy entered me. I couldn't wait to get back to it each time. Like when any good book is finished, I was sad that there was no more to go back to, but this book actually bestows something joyous and lasting on a reader. I wanted to have a cup of coffee with Julia. I went online to watch segments of her old shows. Not only is this a great cook's story, but it's a human story, filled with joy (there's that word again) that is life affirming and an enthusisam that is infectious and inspiring to a reader. This is one of my most favorite books. And to think that it sat on my shelf for nearly a year before I worked my way to it. Who knew?! It's a jewel you will cherish. Some people engage life in a dance. Yes, this is a book about cooking and a cook, but the larger story your heart will carry long after you finish, is a lesson in how to engage life. Julia continues to teach us how to grasp and celebrate the seemingly smallest of moments-and that they are not really small at all. Can't you just hear her saying that in Julia-speak? \\"And they're not really small at'all\\". This book is a refresher lesson in loving life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Back in the 1970s I was on my own and, though I had grown up in a family of excellent cooks and had done a lot of cooking myself, I wanted to do new recipes so I bought Julia Child and Company. I loved the book and I swear that to this day I cook things that are variations on the recipes in that book. So when I came across Julia Child's memoir, My Life in France, I just had to read it. I loved every page of it.First of all she has a folksy, down-home way of writing that is really just like the way she talked in her cooking shows. She complains about her cranky old father, gossips about her writing partner's difficult personality, gushes over her culinary explorations of Paris, and every page drips with her endless love for her husband Paul. Of course, I have long been of the opinion that I should have been born in Paris - not Paris as it is now but Paris as it was for Hemingway and Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound and now Julia.Speaking of Hemingway, one of the first friends Julia and Paul Child made when they moved to Paris was Hadley Mowser, the first Mrs. Ernest Hemingway, and the subject of the wildly popular novel, The Paris Wife. In fact, Julia was the maid of honor at Jack (Bumby) Hemingway's wedding. I loved that and reassured me that, had I been born when and where I was supposed to, I probably would have been at that wedding. Of course, I'd be dead now, too.But the book is just marvelous. Julia McWilliams grew up in California and during WWII she wanted to join up but at 6'2\\" she was too tall to be a WAC so she joined the OSS where she met Paul Child who was to become the love her life. After the war they married and he was assigned to a diplomatic bureau in Paris. She went with her husband and soon discovered that the food of Paris was light years from the food of California! Exploring cheese shops and bakeries and produce stands and wine shops she quickly decided that she needed to learn to cook authentic French food and thus enrolled in the Cordon Bleu. Her descriptions of her absolute passion for food and for French cooking fills the rest of the books with added commentary on her travels and then he attempts to publish her first great cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. If anyone thinks publishing is difficult now they need to read this book!This book is an absolute joy because its author has take such joy in so much - food, cooking, Paris, her friends, her husband, and life. The Joy of Julia. She introduces readers to a huge array of fascinating characters and constantly tantalizes the senses with descriptions of the marketplaces, shops, restaurants and kitchens of Paris, the Marseilles, and finally Provence. A wonderful read written by an American treasure with a massive appetite for life. Bon app&eacute;tit, Julia, wherever you are!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child married Paul, her senior by ten years, and lived happily ever after. Their life is sweet and adventurous and Julia and Paul absolutely completed one another. He encouraged her to write her famous cook book and she busily set about with Simone Beck (mostly) and Louisette Bertholle (nominally) to write a masterpiece that is still essential to French cooking today.This book takes the reader to France beginning in 1948, to Julia and Paul's favorite restaurants and to dine with their best friends. Julia must have taken copious notes throughout her life to complement Paul's letters to his brother so that we are able to read in detail about the meals they ate and the fine wines (including the age of the wine!) they drank with their meal, what the weather was like and who they dined with.Now, if that sounds boring to you, you need not pick up this book. But, if like me, you are enthralled with feasting and good company all in an idyll setting, and love to read about such details; you will love this book.It was also interesting to see where reality lie between Julia Child's own account of events and the movie, Julie and Julia. I was also fascinated by the more in depth look at Julia and Paul's life.This book cements her place as one of America's most endearing chefs."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved this book. Julia Child's personality shines through, as she takes you from her early days in Paris -- like a weekend visit for the reader -- through her Cordon Bleu training, on to Marseilles and Oslo. It is fun to read, charming, beautifully written. I picked up some great cooking hints and some good ideas on what to do next time we are in Europe. I had not thought to go to the outdoor markets, nor to the great kitchen store she loved in Paris. She also mentions some wonderful restaurants and French dishes that I must be sure to try.I'm on a Julia Child's roll now. First I found a Foley fork, which she raves about; then we rented some French Chef DVDs and watched her in action. Next we watched Julia and Julie; today we ordered her two volume cookbook. She makes it sound like such fun. (Plus, she tosses her cooking scraps onto the floor!)"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I read a review of this book and recommended it to my cousin who speaks French fluently and has lived many many times in France. My cousin LOVED the book and so I read his book. When I closed the book I said to my husband.....this was simply a delightful book......I wish I spoke French. Now I am eager to start watching Julia on DVD....many of her shows are available. Because of this book......she has come to life for me again."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If you loved Julia Child, if you love France, if you love cooking -- you'll love this book. Mrs. Child was a very down-to-earth lady -- and her love of cooking and France are a joy to read about. And her love of her husband and soul-mate Paul -- those kind of marriages don't happen often -- that, too, is a delight to read. No recipes this time -- none needed. What you might want, upon finishing this charming book, is a ticket on Air France for the next flight out! Julia Child not only had a \\"bon appetit\\" for food -- she most definitely had a \\"bon appetit\\" for life. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child's voice lives with this enthusiastic and revealing memoir of someone we know and love: Julia Child. Alex Prud'homme must be given credit in organizing this delightful memoir.The enthusiasiam and hard choices that Julia(Julie)made are narrated in the most delightful manner; just like being Right There.Ah, much is delicious. Superb lunches. finding her calling in a simple way by taking cooking classes and then her mind and passion kicked in and we are swept away on the journey of discovery and relentless trial and error.Woe! for the error. Hooray for the victory! Woe for the setbacks! as here, in the end, NEVER looking back, but always looking forward to Great fun with food and life ahead!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book reads like a conversation with a terrific storyteller. It's wonderfully entertaining, giving us a glimpse into Paris in the 1940s-50's. But more than that, it reveals, in Julia's very original voice how she developed her interest in cooking, her dedication to her craft, and the perseverence that she and Simca endured in order to produce and publish Mastering the Art of French Cooking after 9 years of hard work and set backs. In that regard, it's a very inspirational book, especially as both she and Simca were both in mid-life (40+) when they began their careers in cooking.So it is both a terrific memoir and a source of inspiration for those who choose to follow their passions. Truly one of the best books I've read this year....I plan to read it again!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"My Life in France\\" has enough colorful adventures to satisfy the appetites of the many who revere what Julia Child accomplished in her long and fruitful life. I was in England as a student in the late 1950's so I identified with her dead-on take of a Europe still struggling to recover from World War II. We all expect Julia to be colorful and full of wit and wisdom, but seeping out between the pages is a real glimpse of what she was like in real life. She was organized, shrewd, stubborn and capable of cold bloodied decisions that often seemed at polar opposites of what was her known public personae. Her husband Paul was undoubtedly her most trusted critic and was totally half of her success. She seems at times to peer at him through a microscope, trying to analyse what kind of spell he exerts over her. Her remarks about his illness were cold, and left one guessing what her true feelings were. It is also obvious that Simone Beck had all the best recipes, disorganized as they were, and Julia seemed to manifest a real love/hate relationship with her. It puts the whole affair in perspective thought; Julia did not have the natural creative spirit that gave Simone her blunt confidence and dead on sense of taste. But Julia was scientific and organized. Nothing would have happened in the publishing world if it hadn't been for Julia's negociating skills and tough persistence. After all, she was trying to present a whole new taste world to an American public hooked on the TV dinner and the desire to get out of the kitchen as fast as possible. I was curious that the great Elizabeth David was never mentioned. She had enormous success in England from the 1950's with her wonderful books on French provencial cooking, and even ran a highly successful shop in London that I still have kitchen utensils from. All of the above in no way takes away from my admiration of what Julia accomplished, and how much her books have influenced my life in the kitchen. She made her way in a tough field and had the grit to do it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I don't cook and I don't speak French, but I did enjoy this book. I admired Julia Child's passion for French cooking and her incredible persistence in testing and creating recipes. I had no idea how hard she worked on each and every recipe. It was a good reminder of the importance of passion and persistence in one's pursuits.I would love to watch some of her cooking shows now (unfortunately, I mainly remember Dan Aykroyd's impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live). I admired how she threw herself into her work and immersed herself in the culture of each new country she lived in. Her enthusiasm jumped out of each page. I marveled at how much meat and wine these people could consume. The weak parts of the book were her sprinkling in of current events, her belittlement of her father, and her categorization of people as \\"intellectual\\" or not. The book's was at its best when it focused on food."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"In my early years, I recalled watching Julia Child on public television. I first thought that she was French because she made it look so easy. Reading this book is like reading her autobiography. Julia's lasting contributions to the culinary world is delivering a book of French recipes for an American audience. She became icon and spoofed on Saturday Night Live by Dan Ackroyd.In her personal life, she was happily married to Paul Child for forty or fifty years. Their marriage according to this book was quite a happy arrangement, partnership, and reminds me much of Dame Iris Murdoch and her husband, John Bayley CBE. Again, both couples are childless. Paul was ten years older than the thirty-something Julia when they married and suffered health problems.Julia doesn't dwell on not having children personally. She enjoys her life in France and an awakening to her true calling of cooking as an art form. I enjoy reading this book based on the letters and recollections of an American icon cherished not only in her native country but in France as well.I enjoyed reading about her adventures in Paris, France, and England as a newcomer with her husband, Paul, who spoke fluent French and jumped at a chance to return to Paris to work there. Julia's discovery of her life's calling makes you realize that it is never too late to learn and thrive in something that you love. Julia brought back wonderful memories that I had while I was in France. French cuisine much like anything else in France is an art form to be appreciated and enjoyed. The French know how to enjoy a meal, a piece of art, dance, music, and theatre. They also excel in producing cinematic gems that are more character driven than action packed or vulgar. Oh, I do miss France and the French way of living.There would be one fitting honor that Julia Child did not receive in life and that would be a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television but that would cost a small fortune."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Over the years, I watched Julia Child on television every chance I could, from the earliest days when she would whirl heavy pots and pans and kitchen machetes around as other women might have twirled a baton, to the later years when she was bent and obliged to leave the hefting to others but still kept her eagle eye on every step of the cooking process. I was a C- cook, and the only recipes of Julia's I ever used were a few omelette guidelines; I watched her because she was so delightful, witty, and impassioned.Her Book, My Life in France, brims over with that glorious passion. Julia's voice, her joie de vivre, her vigor, and her impatience with the lazy and the boring bubble on every page. If \\"the god is in the details,\\" then this book is heavenly, for it has a richness of details carefully selected not only from Child's memory, but from hundreds of pages of notebooks, letters, and cooking records of all sorts. In these my mature years, I have been reading mostly biographies and autobiographies; this volume of Julia Child's years in France is and will remain a favorite because of its honesty, sense of fun, and unflagging passion. It's delicious!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I just finished this book, and I am unashamed to say I have shed tears for the loss of this great woman. I am discovering the art of cooking later in life, as Julia did, and she has helped give me the courage I am needing to change careers and attend culinary arts training this spring. What a marvelous book, I felt that I was there with her in her \\"la belle France\\" and wish that I could have had the opportunity to spend time in the kitchen with her. You will not be disappointed in this fantastic read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My Life in France gives the reader a glimpse into the extraordinary and elegant life of Julia Child. The memoir adds another dimension to Julia the TV persona and looks beyond the lighthearted image. Indeed, beyond Julia's fun spirit was an unbelievable level of meticulous research and above all, fearlessness and stamina. My Life in France is a delight to read for anyone who wishes to understand the origin of Julia's passion for French cooking and her ability to transform one's vision of and taste for fine food.My Life in France"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Most Americans know of Julia Child via the parodies of her cooking show --- a frowsy, big-boned matron with a trill in her voice, hacking up a chicken with more zest than is called for, most likely because she's been chugging the cooking sherry. Well, that was, on occasion, a fair take on Julia Child, the jolly chef who taught her fellow citizens the joy of French cooking on public television.But Julia Child was much more than a 6'2\\", 158-pound precursor of Martha Stewart. She was a revolutionary. Not intentionally. She just had the great good fortune to find herself living in Paris with no job and nothing more compelling than a tentative interest in cooking. She signed up for classes at Cordon Bleu, got hooked, and soon found herself, with two friends, working on a book we now take for granted but was then unimagined --- an authoritative guide to French cooking for Americans. Published 40 years ago, 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume One' has never gone out of print. It never will. It is the gold standard.Julia Child died in 2004. Of her 11 books, none was a memoir. But she kept scribbles and letters, and at the end of her life, she began to shape this book with her grandnephew. Like almost everything she touched, 'My Life in France' is a triumph --- insightful, poetic, deadly accurate about people, and, above all, tasty. To read it is to breathe French air.Nothing in her early life would have predicted that Julia Child would become formidable in any way. Her father was a conservative Southern California businessman; her mother was \\"warm and social.\\" After college came World War II and government work in Ceylon. There she met Paul Child, an artist who designed 'war rooms' for the generals. The first meal she cooked for him --- brains simmered in red wine --- was not a success. Still, they married, and, in 1948, moved to France. She was 36. She didn't speak a word of French.Her first meal, in Rouen, started with oysters, served with a pale rye bread and unsalted butter. They were followed by sole meuniere, \\"perfectly browned in a sputtering butter sauce with a sprinkling of chopped parsley.\\" Mr. and Mrs. Child washed it down with a bottle of Pouilly-Fume. They moved on a green salad and a baguette, fromage blanc and cafe filtre. \\"Absolute perfection,\\" Julia decided. \\"The most exciting meal of my life.\\"Fortunately, the Childs were not rich --- two-star restaurants were the best they could afford in Paris. But Julia was reading cookbooks, making friends in the food markets, falling in love with Paris. At Cordon Bleu, her classmates were 11 former American servicemen who were studying courtesy of the GI Bill of Rights. She went right to the head of the class.To read this book is to peer over her shoulder and learn with her. Scrambled eggs, for example. They are not whipped, just gently blended. Smear the pan with butter, add the eggs, salt and pepper, cook over a low flame. After about three minutes, the eggs will start to form a custard. Only then do you stir rapidly with a fork, sliding the pan on and off the burner. Pull the egg curds together --- and, finally, add the butter, to \\"stop the cooking.\\" Sprinkle with parsley (or not). Serve. Dazzle.The real revelations in this book are not about food, however ---they're about work. There's a lot of it involved in the creation of a book, especially when you're creating something new. \\"WHY DID WE EVER DECIDE TO DO THIS ANYWAY?\\" Julia writes to one of her collaborators. But after eight years, the thing is done. And Knopf offers to buy it for $1,500. The galleys weigh 15 pounds. When printed, it is 732 pages long.In 1961, when 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' was published, Paul Child was 59 years old. Julia was 49. They had no expectations of a bestseller, much less a franchise. But the New York Times raved --- the recipes are \\"painstakingly edited and written as if each were a masterpiece, and most of them are\\" --- and the book sold and sold. In 1962, Julia taped three half-hour shows for WGBH, the public TV station in Boston. By the following year, she had taped 26 more.But this is not a celebrity memoir. This book is called \\"My Life in France\\" for a reason --- it is there that Julia and Paul feel most fully alive. Paul's photographs deliver the country in delicious slivers. The passages at their home in the South of France lift off the page and surround you. You inhale lavender. You feel the breeze. In the distance is the smell of lamb cooking in herbs. There is laughter, and wit, and, most of all, blessed silence. If this is not a description of Heaven, what is?Paul takes ill and dies. Julia soldiers on. She understands --- you have to keep grabbing life. Food and love and very shrewd French friends have taught her well: \\"Nothing is too much trouble if it turns out the way it should.\\"The book ends this way: \\"The pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite --- toujours bon appetit!\\" As you read these words, you finally get it --- this is not a book about food, this is a book about life. A wise life, a life of beauty, art and invention. You can learn a lot from a life like that.Start with this book"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"With every word I sensed I was there. I could smell the air, feel the cold and want a blanket. I lusted to be able to taste the foods she talked about. I laughed when she described her first attempts at food preparation. I loved that she was pragmatic and yet extravagant about cooking utinsels. Her husband was very encouraging of her endeavors. Together they shared a life and a love, but it was more, they shared a passion for travel and the tastes of other cultures. My mouth salivated as she toured the markets. Her French was horrible by her own admission but her genuine interest in the culture won out with shop owners. It is a delicious read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This, hands down, is one of the best reads of the year. We took it with us on vacation last month & my wife and I competed over reading rights whenever the kids were otherwise occupied. It's beautifully told and as compelling as a great mystery that you know has a happy ending. It will remind you of your honeymoon in France (even if you went somewhere else) and inspire you to go again. And when you finish, you'll want to find a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and keep going...."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"As a young person growing up in the Boston area, I watched Julia Child on WGBH. I will never forget her Salade Nicoise show where the lettuce ended up on the floor instead of the colander. This is why we loved Julia Child - she was real and fun and didn't take things too seriously. This comes through in My Life In France although sometimes it's a little too engrossed in the mundane details. It's an excellent read in her inimitable voice of her discovery and love of food and the trials and tribulations of writing Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Her curiousity, commitment to detail, perservence, and natural talent for communicating made Master the Art of French Cooking rock the food world when no one thought such a cookbook would sell. I loved reading about Julia's triumph."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"One of Julia Child's most compelling attributes was her ability to share her knowledge without ever being intimidating. She gave you the sense that she was as accessible and friendly as your neighbor next door, although infinitely more interesting.Of course, that \\"neighbor\\" only talked about food and recipes, and you didn't get to know her very well. This book shows how charming -- and human -- Julia Child really was (petty irritations and all). Mostly, it's like having Julia over to your house for a wonderful dinner party, in which she tells wonderful stories about her time in France. Obviously, food is a large part of that, but there are entertaining anecdotes about everything from being adopted by a cat to their worries about Paul's career to their move to Marseilles. Because the family kept all of Paul and Julia's letters home, the detail is as fresh and fun as when it first happened.The book is entertaining and fun, with the added inspiration of watching a woman grow from \\"I could barely cook\\" to the legend we all admired. Recommended."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a charming book, where Julia Child talks in detail about her years in Paris and France just after the Second World War. Juliacompletely fell in love with France and with French food and the way of life there. The relationship between Julia and her husband Paul is also lovely to read about, as they completely adored each other. Julia's passion for life, her energy, her sense of humour, modesty and intelligence shine through every page. This is accompanied by a complete lack of self-pity eg where she mentions their inability to have children.She describes in detail her first encounter with French food, her experiences studying at Le Cordon Bleu, learning to speak French, setting up her own cooking school and writing her first cookbook. There were many trials and tribulations in the years of research, testing of the recipes, collaborating with the other authors and getting the book accepted for publication. Julia was like the original Alton Brown or 'Cook's Illustrated'. Of the three authors, one of whom contributed very little, it was Julia who was constantly tinkering with the recipes in order to find the best result. Spend a month experimenting with the best way to boil an egg? No problem. She was fascinated by kitchen science, which was in its infancy in those days.Julia also describes eating at restaurants all over France and she remembers many of the menus in detail, as well as the vintage of wines they drank and how the individual dishes were prepared. She talks about shopping for ingredients in the marketplace and some of the unusual kitchen gadgets she picked up in Paris, which later appeared on the set of her TV shows.So many things were done differently in those days - you put your milk bottles on the window sill to keep cool because most Parisians didn't have a refrigerator, and just about everything in the professional kitchen was still done by hand in the old manner. It was a different culinary world and I am pleased that some of this history has been preserved in this book.The book has a lot of general historical interest too - when they arrived there was rationing and there were hardly any cars in Paris. They walked all over the city, routes that you just could not do on foot these days. Her husband was a photographer/artist and there are some interesting B & W photos of Paris & the French countryside included in the book. They also had a house in Provence long before the influx of tourism changed and spoiled the area. She and her husband met many influential and eccentric people.The book was a collaboration between Julia and her husband's twin brother's grandson, who is an author in his own right. I thought it was very enjoyable and interesting. Is this a great work of literature? No, and to be honest, few biographies are. But this book does what it set out to do very well. It is pleasant and easy to read and the story it tells is very interesting. I would recommend it for people with an interest in culinary history or community cookbooks, an interest in French cuisine, and of course for anyone who liked Julia Child. It makes a lovely accompaniament to the bible of classic French cuisine: \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\"."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"In her memoir, we discover that Julia Child was not born with a wooden spoon in her hand; her early cooking experiences were sometimes less than delectable. Her adventures, culinary and otherwise, are chronicled in amazing detail and much charm, written with Alex Prud'homme, Paul Child's grandnephew.The book opens with an introductory first sentence from Julia that speaks for itself:\\"This is a book about some of the things I have loved most in life: my husband, Paul Child; la belle France; and the many pleasures of cooking and eating.\\"The story begins as Paul and Julia move to Paris after two years in Washington, D.C. Thirty-six-year-old Julia has mixed feelings about the move. She fears that the quiet, stylish, mannerly, and tiny French would be aghast at a six-foot-two-inch \\"rather loud and unserious Californian.\\" However, almost instantly Julia is enamored of France and its people. She delights in her first French meal, sheepishly telling her husband she doesn't know what a shallot is. The description of that first meal, and the many following, is as loving as if she were describing her firstborn.Julia begins to cook a bit, helped by French friends who show her the best places to shop and introduce her to new foods such as snails and truffles. As her food consciousness rises, her ability to speak French also improves. Her next step is to sign up for a year-long course at the famed cooking school, Cordon Bleu, where she discovers a true passion for French cooking (she calls it her \\"personal calling\\"). She also realizes she has much to learn --- she can't even scramble eggs properly. Indeed, even as she grows more knowledgeable, she continues making cooking errors, resulting in bizarre dishes.Julia's passion for cooking extends beyond school. At home, she experiments, making batch after batch of mayonnaise and other dishes. She begins to write down recipes. After graduation (she fails her first final exam and has to take it over), Julia joins two women in opening a small cooking school. The three begin collaboration on a cookbook that, after countless publishing disappointments and rejections over many years, would eventually become MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, a classic that would change cooking in the United States forever.Julia and Paul move to Marseille and then to Germany, finally moving back to Washington, D.C. Everywhere, they find adventure, friends, and delicious food. Julia, of course, becomes a celebrity chef, starring in her own television series and writing several books.In MY LIFE IN FRANCE, Julia emphasizes \\"the importance of including fun and love in the preparation of a meal!\\" Both elements are abundant ingredients in this book as well. Aided in their research by a mountain of family letters and Paul Child's photos, some of which illustrate the book, each anecdote is detailed and lavishly described. Julia's voice shines through; she appears as she seemed in life, refreshingly unselfconscious, willing to poke fun at herself, and full of passion (and aren't we fortunate to experience Julia Child once again now, after her death in 2004? Many thanks to Alex Prud'homme. Without his nudging and brilliant work, we would miss out on this late-served and much-appreciated dessert).It all adds up to a delightful and fascinating read. In fact, I give it the ultimate book reviewer's compliment: I'm keeping my copy in order to reread it. Highest recommendation.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is just brimming with life, just as Julie Child did during her years in France. This book has inspired me to retrace Julia's steps through France (in 2007), approach the kitchen with more energy, and adopt a more serene approach to life in general...this book is just outstanding. I read it in 7 hours, straight through, and after lending it to those to whom I have promised it, I shall read it again...Bravo Julia for sharing your life in France with us, and Bravo Alex for seeing to it that it was published. What an amazing life, what an amazing person."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My Life in France is the most entertaining memoir I've read in 2006! It's a winner.I first met Julia Child under unusual circumstances. My consulting firm was located down the street from where she got her hair done. Every Friday night, she would be seen peering into the windows to look at our art collection. After a few weeks of this, I walked outside and invited her in to tour the work up close. She was immediately studying everything from about three inches away. She thanked me politely and charged out the door. There was no hint of the slightly tipsy person filled with laughter who hosted The French Chef. Ah . . . I felt like I had met the real woman beneath the persona.From that meeting, I gathered that she was a woman moved more than most by curiosity. I found myself also being curious about how she learned enough about French cooking to help co-author that masterwork, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Most French people in those days would not choose working with an American as a way to produce a work about France. That would be like putting salty Virginia ham into Quiche Lorraine.My Life in France nicely filled in all the blanks for me. The book was lovingly finished by her grand-nephew, Paul Prud'homme, after Julia's death and is filled with lovely photographs produced by Julia's husband, Paul Child.Here's the short version of the book. Julia had been in Asia for World War II as part of the OSS and met her husband there. He was ten years older than she was and well traveled . . . especially in France. After World War II, he joined the USIS (predecessor to the USIA) which played a friendly sort of propaganda function promoting American values and ways of doing things. In November 1948, Paul landed a posting in Paris and Julia, the Pasadena, California bred daughter of a conservative businessman, was in for the surprises of her life. She fell in love with French food at her first meal! With no job in France, she began working on her language skills and learning how to cook (a new task for her!). Soon, she decided she wanted to go to Cordon Bleu. After some misadventures, she finally passed with some modest skills designed to help a homemaker rather than a chef. But she made friends with others who loved French food and eventually became acquainted with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. The latter two had an informal agreement to publish a book on French cooking for Americans. But they had just lost their American collaborator. Julia stepped in.From there, much of the book recounts the decades of painstaking work that went into creating that first book and its follow-ons in which Julia played the role of making the recipes work in American kitchens with American ingredients and utensils. It's truly mind-boggling. My respect for her work is unlimited!The book finishes with explaining how Mastering became a best seller and Julia became a television star.Along the way, you'll meet her favorite food vendors, tutors, chefs and guests. She'll also delight you with her mouth-watering menus and how dishes turned out under different circumstances.The title of the book is a little misleading. The material also covers time spent in Germany, Norway and the United States. You also get a full look at her marriage and the great joy that both Childs brought to their love.Throughout, the book is filled with little Julia-isms in that humorous self-deprecating style that we all came to love on The French Chef. She lards the text with some piquant French phrases and quotes (which are usually translated more mildly into English).As an author, I found her process of finding a publisher and working with publishers to be quite fascinating.In her last decades, the book is a picture of grace as she devoted herself to her husband, her old friends and to French cooking.Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"How did Julia Child hook up with her other two authors and write that watershed book \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\"? And how did she get on PBS in Boston on WGBH? Here's the story, plus that of Paul Child, her diplomat husband.I found this a fascinating book because Julia Child was kind of a childhood icon--we all started cooking differently because she woke Americans up to the fact that vegetables didn't have to come in a can or box and you could do some elegant meals at holidays with things that didn't require a covering layer of marshmallows. We took a trip to Washington and did see her kitchen, reassembled piece-by-piece in the Smithsonian. It's revealing; it's a small kitchen like a workshop, with pegboard and \\"tools\\" on the wall and not as fancy as you'd imagine.This book was a wonderful insight into Julia's life and anyone who cooks and admires her work should read it. Gosh, do I miss her!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child and the places you will go. Who knew, that this tall woman with the high voice that I saw on television was once filled with lust? This is the story of Julia and her husband Paul, how they met,when they met and their life ever after. What a fascinating woman. I know that if met her today, she would smile and greet me cheerily and off we would go into the world of food and cooking.Julia and Paul met while they were in the OSS in Ceylon in 1946. They courted and married and moved to Paris where Paul was the Information Officer for the American Embassy. Their first meal was in Rouen, France and Julia had oysters, sole meuni&egrave;re, salad, cheese and coffee. This was the beginning of a love affair with food, France and Paul. Julia just adored France and she began exploring and cooking in her small Parisian kitchen. Eventually her cooking improved and she enrolled in the &Eacute;cole du Cordon Bleu. This was an experience that changed her life. Food and France and her love for the people became her theme.Julia loved to cook and to teach and she and a few friends started a cooking school. This led to writing the first book that fully explained the art of French Cooking. It took them a decade to write and find a publisher who appreciated their theme and writing, but it took off and soon they were in the third and then fourth printing. While on a book tour Julia and friends gave a lesson cooking. Soon, the local Cambridge PBS show asked her to film 3 shows and then an entire series. She was such a hit that the series went on and on and on.In the meantime, Julia and Paul built a home in Provence near friends and spent many wonderful years. Paul became ill and died at the age of 92. Julia and her nephew, Alex Prud'homme, started writing this book and at the age of 92, Julia Child died after suffering a series of strokes.This is an admirable book and a wonderful read. It is a not to be put down book and if you love good food and France, you too, will love this book. And thinking back on it now,\\" she concludes, \\"reminds me that the pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite -- toujours bon app&eacute;tit!\\"Highly Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-13-09Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Fortieth - 40th - Anniversary Edition) (Vol 1)The Way to Cook"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child jumped into life with both feet. It was a pleasure to read about her adventures in France and in cooking. I just with the book had English translations for all of the French she used in the book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Rather than a complete biography this ebulliently phrased memoir covers the years Julia and her beloved husband, Paul, spent in France (1948 - 1954). Paris was where the the woman remembered as the doyenne of French cooking got a rather late start on what was to be an enormously succesful career.Paul and Julia met in Ceylon where both worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and married in 1946. Two years later Paul was assigned to head the exhibits office of the U.S. Information Service in Paris. A painter and photographer who had been to France earlier he was well suited for the task. On the other hand, Julia had never been to Europe, came from a middle class, conservative California family and by her own description was \\"six-foot-two-inch, 36-year-old, rather loud and unserious.\\" Little did she know what a life altering experience France would be.She well remembers their first meal in Rouen which she described as \\"absolute perfection. It was the most exciting meal of my life.\\" Thus began her love of French food, in fact for all things French - the markets, the people, the restaurants, the countryside. At that time she was an average cook at best but determined to learn how the French prepared such glorious food. To that end she learned the language and then enrolled at the famed Cordon Bleu. Surely no student has ever worked harder, more doggedly or found as much joy in food preparation as Julia. She wanted to know every infinitesimal detail of each dish, including the whys and wherefores of ingredients chosen, and variants in cooking time.Eventually this devotion to French cuisine led to a partnership with two French friends (Simone Beck and Laced Bertholle) in a cooking school and from that to dreams of a cookbook for the American market. There was a very long road ahead filled with happiness, surprises and disappointments but the book was published at last. This, of course, led to Julia's television series and more cookbooks.My Life In France is filled with rhapsodic descriptions of dishes and accompanying wines as well as details of keeping house in a country still recovering from a devastating war. Due to Paul's career the Childs moved from Paris to Marseille to Bonn to Washington to Oslo and then Paul's retirement. Julia met every challenge with pluck, purpose and bonhomie. Hers was a life well lived, thoroughly enjoyed, and vividly remembered.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My Life in France is an exhilarating memoir. Accompanying her husband on his assignment to Paris, Julia Child becomes enamored with French food. The book shows how her new-found passion led the former OSS file clerk to become a renown chef and cookbook author. Along the way, readers meet the family and friends who assisted - and sometimes challenged - her. And we discover her husband Paul, the love of her life and the man behind the scenes.In many ways, My Life in France is a real-life love story between Julia and Paul and their various artistic talents. It is also a good accompaniment to Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success, because Julia's story is one of being in the right place at the right time with the right people and working very, very hard.I loved My Life in France! Alex Prud'homme does an excellent job of making readers feel like they are traveling along on Julia's journey. It is a delightful trip and one I encourage you to take."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A wonderful inside look at Julia Child's life in France.

I spend 4 months a year as a tour director in France and I have been to many of the places that Julia refers to in her fantastic book. My favorite is La Couronne in historic Rouen. I am fortunate enough to take my fellow travelers there for a gourmet lunch on a regular basis! Vive la France!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Things that Julia Child loved most in life included her husband Paul and the country France. After marrying in 1946 and living in Washington, D.C. for two years, Julia and Paul Child went to Paris. Paul was to work for the government, the USIS, at the French embassy.Before arriving in Paris there was Rouen. The couple ate at La Couronne. The waiter advised them that the Dorin family, the owners of La Couronne, had a restaurant in Paris, La Truite. Julia signed up for French classes at Berlitz, (she liked to talk and was frustrated). Paris was walkable. Le Grand Vefour was one of the more famous old Parisian restaurants. It had been in business since 1750. Service was deft and the food was spectacular. The restaurant kept a special seat for Colette.Julia arrived at the Ecole du Cordon Bleu in October, 1949. She signed up for a year-long course. Eleven former GIs were in the class, under the auspices of the GI Bill of Rights. The professor was Chef Bugnard, a gem. He had enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. Shopping for food with him in Paris could be a life-changing experience. Introductions and the instruction were important to Julia Child since the French are sensitive to personal dynamics.Paul called their kitchen Julia's alchemist's aerie. Julia met both Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle in 1951. They had been trying to produce a cookbook of French cooking for the U.S. market. They had been told by Dorothy Canfield Fisher that their efforts were too dry. Also, Americans ate a lot of meat and used a lot of processed food in their cooking. They were told to collaborate with an American who was crazy about French food.Simone, Julia, and Louisette began a school called L'Ecole des Trois Gourmandes. Right from the beginning they had three students. Julia Child found that in explaining French cooking chauvinism and dogmatism were deeply engrained. She had an urge to say that the word was not the thing.In 1953 Paul and Julia moved to Marseilles for Paul's work. The first flat they had in an Art Deco building overlooked the old port. It was learned that McCarthy's investigators, Cohn and Schine, were in Paris in search of evidence of disloyalty. It was a shame and a disgrace. They sought to interview people about the contents of the embassy library.The USIS changed to the USIA had trimmed Paul's staff of twelve to four. After a year and a half in Marseille, Paul was transferred to Bonn. The couple moved to Germany in 1954. In 1955 Paul received notice to report to Washington, D.C. immediately. He was being investigated.In 1956 the Childs returned to the U.S. for good. MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING was published by Knopf. James Beard helped with the launch. Julia was interviewed on WGBH, a book program. Retiring from the USIA Paul and Julia planned to live in Cambridge, MA. In 1962 three experimental half hour shows were taped for WGBH. The experiment was called THE FRENCH CHEF.Eh voila, (here it is)--this is a good book! One learns reading this memoir that Julia Child loved using a lot of exclamation points. The book contains a number of fine photographs, too, serving to enhance the lively text."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"First of all, I have to say that I'm not into cooking or cookbooks, but after reading so many wonderful reviews on Amazon, I decided that I had to read it.From all the great reviews that I had read, my expectations were pretty high, but the book actually exceeded my expectations. Where do I start? Julia Child along with her husband's grand nephew, who happens to be a good writer, Alex Prud'Homme, effectively draw the reader into a French life fully lived by Julia and her husband, Paul. The descriptions of the land, the food, the people and the way of life are beautifully described in this loving memoir. I also saw a different side of Julia, one that is playful, humorous and really down to earth, while at the same time she was very detail oriented and totally dedicated to her craft. The book also features lovely pictures of Paris and other places where she and Paul visited or lived taken by Paul, as he was a skilled artist and a photographer. There are words and phrases sprinkled throughout in French (some are translated in English, others are not) and it helped that I know some French. The story picks up right after Julia gets married and moves to Paris for her husband's job. She instantly falls in love with France especially its cuisine inspiring her to start cooking. What a wonderful life she had! A great read whether you're into cooking or not."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I bought this book sometime ago meaning to read it. But as I am in the 1st year of starting my new business (a pastry shop) I have not had time. But then I remembered Audio Books so I downloaded it and I am now in the process of listening to it. Julia's love of food is contagious if I was not already a lover I would be signing up for the next Cordon Bleu Class booking a plane ticket and flying to France. Her story makes me envious that I was born at the very end of 1969 and not much earlier and to experience Paris right after the war.Her description of sole meuniere made me crave it that I began planning my next restaurant outing as a way to un-wind. Her determination to make a perfect mayonaise made me smile and relief to know that I am not alone in becoming obsessed in creating the perfect recipe.If you love a good read (or listen) love food and you are a big fan of Julia Child this is the perfect book for you. It gives you insight into the woman who single handly changed how America's eat.Bon Appetite!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I LOVED this book. With my continuing growth and love of cooking, Julia Child has become positively one of my favorite people on Earth. I had no idea what I was getting into with this book when I picked it up. I knew I wanted to read this specifically because it was really coming straight from her and not some researcher. These pages brought to me the real Julia. I never knew all the details of her French living life with her husband Paul. I now know that she and Paul clearly had such an amazing friendship and special bond with each other. One thing I hoped to see in this book was a lot of food talk. I was thrilled that so much of it revolved around meals she prepared, down to the exact ingredients each time. Hearing about her friends, her parties, her writing, her political views, I feel like she is someone I would love to have known and been friends with. If you like Julia Child and appreciate all her quirks, this book will make you love her. Read it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"What a wonderful tribute to Julia and her legacy. It is a marvelous collection of strory all tied together and it just makes you laugh out loud and want to run away to France and learn to cook. Julia is strong and smart and funny and she loves her family and makes her friends a priority. She inspires us to follow our dreams. She teaches us about patience and devotion and she gives us a historical perspective of post WW France.Read it, Love it, Live it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"After watching the movie \\"Julia and Julie\\" I just became so interested in Julia Childs' life. On the screen it would apprea that the really lived a fantasitc life and reading this book, you know she did. It was a well rounded story and so interesting. I just really liked it and am going to do some research to find more books like this."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I finished My Life in France a couple of days ago and have carried it everywhere since, insisting I be allowed to read snippets aloud to a long-suffering audience (my husband) at frequent intervals. It's that good.Alex Prud'homme had the sense to get out of the way and let Julia tell her own story. Meandering around Europe and the United States, and peppered with personalities from the chefs of the Cordon Bleu, cameo appearances by Alice B. Toklas and John Kenneth Galbraith and the fear caused by the long arm of HUAC, it contains one of the world's great love stories, that of Paul and Julia Child. There's something for everyone here; fascinating travelogue, wonderful descriptions of food, vivid personalities and intrigue.I was inspired to dig out my very dusty copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and plan an \\"Homage to Julia\\" dinner. I'd forgotten what a great cookbook it is; clear, thorough, concise and encouraging. The story of how it came to be is an adventure of the best sort, seen through the eyes of one of the most generous, hardworking and courageous personalities of the 20th century who used her time in Europe to immortalize and make accessible the world's greatest cuisine. How lucky are we that Julia Child existed and that we may get to know her through this book!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I bought this book after seeing the movie JULIE & JULIA while visiting friends in Florida. I was glad to find out that one can also purchase it through Amazon.com. It is a real treasure. I can't imagine how anyone could be critical of it. It is simply a delight to read and wonderfully helps me remember how pleasant it was to watch the movie. To read the story of an individual who came to really enjoy her life by pursuing her passion was truly inspiring.Like many a military wife, Julia first came to Europe (Paris, France to be exact) as the wife of a federal civil servant. Rather than letting what could have been (and remained) a foreign environment defeat her, she went about the business of learning the language and the culture, shopping on the economy and learning to cook like the locals. Rather than letting others' bad experiences cause her to become prejudiced to an area in advance, she recognized the treasure it was to even BE stationed abroad: \\"In Paris and later Marseille, I was surrounded by some of the best food in the world, and I had an enthusiastic audience in my husband, so it seemed only logical that I should learn how to cook la cuisine bourgeoise--good, traditional French cooking. It was a revelation. I simply fell in love with that glorious food and those marvelous chefs. The longer we stayed there. the deeper my commitment became.\\" Julia then continues to write about her life in Paris and Marseille, the necessary move to Bonn, Germany and in the end to Oslo, Norway. Although she admittedly loved Paris the most, she so very positively found something good about every country she lived in. For instance she couldn't understand why the Americans she met in Germany were so conservative in their choice of brewed beverages: \\"They drank beer, but only the lighter, American-style beers. What a shame! They were surrounded by some of the most wonderful beers in the world--and with a 13.5 percent alcohol content, some of the strongest, too--but they deemed the traditional German ales 'too heavy'. We quite liked German beers. Our favorite was a flavorful beer called Nuremberger Lowenbrau.\\"I think anyone who would read this book would find it very entertaining. Personally I got lost in some of the French words for the various dishes Julia produced but fortunately she always gave an English translation so I knew what she was cooking. Additionally (opposite the cover page) there was a list of books by Julia Child fromMastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Vol 1)(1961) toJulia's Kitchen Wisdom: Essential Techniques and Recipes from a Lifetime of Cooking(2000). These are books I also plan on reading.The book concludes with one of my favorite passages: \\"Such was the case with the sole meuniere I ate at La Couronne on on my first day in France, in November 1948. It was an epiphany. In all the years since that succulent meal, I have yet to lose the feelings of wonder and excitement that it inspired in me. I can almost still taste it. And thinking back to it now reminds me the pleasure of the table, and of life, are infinite--toujours bon appetit!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book has changed my life.....If she can do what she did.....I certainly can do my petty little things that I content with daily...She is my new hero. I am 67 and never really heard of her. She has given me courage when any other book I read was so depressing I couldn't finish it. Yes life is hard, always has been and always will be as you will see reading this book and you will understanding how rejection can motive a person...to do the IMPOSSIBLE....all after age 30 and without bemoaning the loss of having no children.....Delightful look at Paris and all of France and relational insight that Americans have forgotten and the French do better than us! Shame on us for not being more friendly. Shame on us for being whiners.............Julia Child did an impossible thing at an impossible time in history and if it is just coming to the highlights today \\"so be it\\". We need more women like her in the sense........she never gives up. And she keeps her focus and creates one of the most very most famous of Cook books.....may it bring cooking back to America today....I would laugh out loud and put the book down to laugh some more....nothing is making me laugh anymore...on TV or Movies or Books........I wish she were still alive and could give us more refreshing lyrics to life."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"... to raise interest in a book. How embarrassing is that? I sat in on the premiere week of the delightful comedy romp \\"Julie and Julia\\", part of which is based on Julia Child's memoir, \\"My Life in France\\". Before the film, I wouldn't have given the book a second look, having the culinary gift to pass me by for other lucrative talents. The impressive jaunty performance of Meryl Streep as the giantess cook inspired me beyond the theater, wanting to learn more about this ebullient French chef. And I must say, what a delicious, delicious read it is.I actually purchased both books, this one andJulie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously. I started the first one, but found myself turning to Julia's book instead. Child describes her time in France with such verve and interest. After marrying international Paul Child, the two settle into Paris as Julia finds her focus in life. A true foodie, Julia breaks down barriers to attend the famous cooking school, Le Cordon Bleu. There, she learns, learns, and learns the techniques she would later translate for her American audience in her groundbreaking cookbook.Her voice throughout the book is powerful, and I don't mean the lilting falsetto she's known for. Her joy is palpable through the text; many times I found myself laughing along with her wry jokes and observations. Plus, how refreshing it is to read a book that, for once, doesn't bash French people, and specifically, Parisians. Her admirations of people from other cultures is as refreshing as the many, many, many dishes and wines she describes. Yes, it does make your mouth water, and yes, it did make me go out and purchaseMastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Vol 1)as well. I can't wait to make her much studied mayonnaise.If you enjoyed the movie, I'd recommend picking up this book first and reading it. Even if you haven't seen the movie, Child's book is a delight, a refreshing read. Just be ready with food and snacks nearby; you leave the book very hungry."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"What a wonderful recipe for life. Was that too campy. We have in My Life in France a treasure of parts of Julia Child's life that led her to the success that she became. Surely in a biography remembering all the good slants things, but the bad is glossed over but not left out.The joy that she imbues in her tale though is what emerges as she learns to cook, and immerses herself in the cultures she inhabits. If she had first gone to live in Timbuktu with her husband Paul, a very integral part of the tale and of her life, I am sure we might all be fascinated with North African cooking more than we are with our hearty desire and enjoyment of French fare.It is clear that Mrs. Child influenced many on what we do make in the kitchen. I when a bachelor came up with my own white wine take on Coq au vin, but her road on how her quest turned our successful is well worth the time to read.That she sees the world with her eyes, she shares with us and we become happy residents of each of her homes, and well ensconced with Paul Child in the kitchen watching her. She opens up her journey to learn how to cook better and the fortunate way she entered a professional class at the Cordon Bleu and then made friends with two women who already had sold the idea of writing a cookbook.It is possible that Julia Child may never have tackled a cookbook on her own, just private teaching of the art of French Cooking without that connection to the collaborators of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, a labor of love and eight years that when it bore fruit, it did so in a big way.The book tour that led to cooking demonstrations, on such shows as Today while Television was still young. That led to some trials at Boston's Public TV which led to the French Chef series and ever growing popularity of the book. All could not be achieved if she had not loved French Cuisine and was able to share that passion so articulately with the world.That she was able to do that with how to cook, she has also shared with how to live. Part of this is cooking, and part of this is just living fully and enjoying your fellows. Philosophy and advice you hear a lot, but Julia Child took to heart.Tackling this work when she was in her final years, and the book finished by her great-nephew after her passing it is worth a read. Perhaps not multiple reads but that is something that after reading this, her cookbooks seems to call to me now. Oh the need is there to rush out and get DVDs of her cooking show just to see her again and to jump on the bus of her love affair with French Cooking."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child's joie de vivre and distinctive voice shine through in this ebullient memoir which celebrates the love affair she shared with her husband just as much as the passion she had for French cuisine.Her descriptions, reflections and commentary are charming and entertaining. Her observations, keen and witty. Marvelous personal photographs from her collection help illustrate the story of her years in France.A surprising, delightful book which is a great read for food fan or non-enthusiasts, alike. Even if you don't know/remember \\"The French Chef,\\" it's a delight to spend time with the late great Ms. Child. I had the great pleasure of interviewing Meryl Streep shortly after reading this work and she eloquently and enthusiastically shared my opinion of the life-loving lady she so beautifully portrayed on screen. http://sunrisefamily.com.au/current/content/blogs/nelson/entry.php?entry=172"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child arrived in France at the end of World War II, a 37-year-old new bride who could barely boil water. In my My Life in France ,91-year-old Julia, with the assistance of her nephew, Alex Prud'homme, tells the reader, in that unmistakable friendly, booming voice how she became the American Grand Dame of French cuisine.This is an engrossing book full of high drama, eccentric characters, breathtaking scenery, and meals so lovingly described the reader's mouth will water. But most interesting of all is Julia, a fearless, curious American women who fell in love with French food at her first meal in Rouen.Resolving to learn how to cook properly for her husband, Paul, she enrolled in the Cordon Bleu, the famous Paris cooking school. And the rest is history. Or, not quite. The road to success was not so easy; Julia failed her Cordon Bleu final exam the first time she took it. She and some friends wrote the definite French cookbook for the American market, eventually published as Mastering the Art of French Cooking, but the laborious project took over eight years.My Life in France is about attitude: toward life, toward society, toward food. For Julia, these aspects were all linked. To join a society where cookery was respected as an art form was a revelation for her, yet it also felt nature. She professed a sense of coming home to this country that she had never visited before, wondering, \\"Am I French, somehow?\\"Her love of France and its culture was beautifully intertwined with her devotion to her husband, Paul. A career diplomat as well as a gifted artist, photographer, and gourmand, his overseas posting took the couple to Paris, Marseillaise, Germany, and Norway. Their life together was a shared adventure, a true love story. My Life is France is illustrated with a number of wonderful photographs by Paul Child, as well as an assortment of the yearly Valentine's cards they designed together and sent to their friends and relatives.While we think of French cooking as rich and fatting, the French attitude, which Julia taught us so passionately, will guide us toward healthy eating - slow down, taste real food, and share the pleasure.A soon-to-be-released motion picture, Julie & Julia, is the story of Julia Child's years in France as well as the trials and tribulations of blogger Julie Powell as she cooks (and writes) her way through Julia's classic, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. My Life in France provides the biographical material for the Julia portions of the film."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"My Life in France\\" by Julia Child w/ Alex Prudhomme, 2006I love how this book reminds me of Julia, from seeing her on television. You can just hear her expressing herself, in person, about something, just that way.She had a love of life and her husband. Of course she was a bit privileged and her husband earned a good salary with the fringe benefit of living in foreign countries, like France and Norway. But the privilege and life she led seems to be less important than her attitude: she truly was having fun.This book is not limited to her life in France. She describes her childhood, how she met her husband, her parents, where they lived in Washington, her politics, etc. It is more her memoir. A more fun memoir can not be imagined. It is wonderful she and her great-nephew got this done."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Rather than a complete biography this ebulliently phrased memoir covers the years Julia and her beloved husband, Paul, spent in France (1948 - 1954). Paris was where the the woman remembered as the doyenne of French cooking got a rather late start on what was to be an enormously succesful career.Paul and Julia met in Ceylon where both worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and married in 1946. Two years later Paul was assigned to head the exhibits office of the U.S. Information Service in Paris. A painter and photographer who had been to France earlier he was well suited for the task. On the other hand, Julia had never been to Europe, came from a middle class, conservative California family and by her own description was \\"six-foot-two-inch, 36-year-old, rather loud and unserious.\\" Little did she know what a life altering experience France would be.She well remembers their first meal in Rouen which she described as \\"absolute perfection. It was the most exciting meal of my life.\\" Thus began her love of French food, in fact for all things French - the markets, the people, the restaurants, the countryside. At that time she was an average cook at best but determined to learn how the French prepared such glorious food. To that end she learned the language and then enrolled at the famed Cordon Bleu. Surely no student has ever worked harder, more doggedly or found as much joy in food preparation as Julia. She wanted to know every infinitesimal detail of each dish, including the whys and wherefores of ingredients chosen, and variants in cooking time.Eventually this devotion to French cuisine led to a partnership with two French friends (Simone Beck and Laced Bertholle) in a cooking school and from that to dreams of a cookbook for the American market. There was a very long road ahead filled with happiness, surprises and disappointments but the book was published at last. This, of course, led to Julia's television series and more cookbooks.My Life In France is filled with rhapsodic descriptions of dishes and accompanying wines as well as details of keeping house in a country still recovering from a devastating war. Due to Paul's career the Childs moved from Paris to Marseille to Bonn to Washington to Oslo and then Paul's retirement. Julia met every challenge with pluck, purpose and bonhomie. Hers was a life well lived, thoroughly enjoyed, and vividly remembered.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is written quite well. I got it hoping to learn more of their marriage, but did not really get a feel for that in this book. You come away from it getting a good feel for france. She spends alot of time on the whole publishing process which I didn't care too much for but it shows how hard she worked at it. After reading this book I wanted to cook everyday, especially French food. I do not have her cook book yet but hope to get that soon as you learn how serious she took to testing her receipies."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is very charmingly wrote. I loved reading it. The whole way through the book, you get a sense of being in France along side Julia. You can feel her passion for great food. I recommend this book to any foody!! If you have watched the Julie & Julia movie, you'll really adore this more indepth look. The book spans for the time she spent in France, up until her days of French Chef on PBS. You will not regret this book, it's lovely. Bon Appetite!!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I picked up this book and started reading it right after I finished up reading Julie and Julia by Julie Powell (reviewed here). My Life in France is an autobiography by Julia Child (written with her husband's grandnephew, Alex Prud'homme). It was begun during the last eight months of her life and completed and published by Mr. Prud'homme after she died in August of 2004.The autobiography is comprised of various stories, linked of course, and which focus on Ms. Child's life from 1948 through 1954. During that time period, Ms. Child and her husband, Paul Child, began their life in Europe - most notably France - and focuses on how Julia came to love all things French - the culture, the people and the food, of course. It also focuses not just on her life there, but on how she and her co-authors wrote her famous treatise on French cooking: Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It details their struggles to find a publisher and get the cookbook slimmed down (it was apparently a TREMENDOUS book - bigger than what it currently is). Julia Child also looks at how she began cooking on TV - she was one of the pioneers in cooking live on TV and owes that success not only to her book but to WGBH, Boston's public television station.Like many people my age (31), you probably remember seeing Julia Child cooking on TV. She was a staple on television - I swear that she was on all the time - but I don't remember much about her besides her mannerisms. I was too young to be allowed anywhere near a stove (some say that I'm still too young to be near a stove). I've never been to France or tried to cook anything French (besides the dubiously named French Fries) but I loved this book. Julia's voice is charming - I think that she would have been a person that I would have liked to call her a friend. She was funny, witty and observant and this all showed through in the book. Maybe, due to my love for food and wine (when I can drink it!), I really loved the details about the food that she made and the wine that she drank. Her details about the places in France that we lived or visited were just as fascinating.Generally liked this book...but you can decide yourself whether to purchase it for your collection or not."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julia Child seems to have possessed a rare joie de vivre, a insatiable curiousity to learn, and an utter zest for life. This was a woman who made a point to learn and experience the language, local customs, and cuisine of all the places she and her husband were assigned, rather than locking themselves away in a closet with other Americans \\"after hours\\".Not only was this an outstanding snapshot of life in France in the post War decades, it was just a fun read. I usually zip through books, but I found myself slowing down and literally savoring this one, just so I could imagine some of the dishes she described. I could almost smell and taste them. She took such care in detailing them, and seems to have remembered in the finest detail almost every dish that she served for every event or get-together.She and her husband seemed to have been genuinely nice people, and I especially loved the centerfold with pictures of the Valentines they created for their friends. It was a small touch, but really brought the \\"characters\\" to life. Anyone who could create the bubblebath valentine would be just a fun person to have around, and that feeling permeated the whole book.Please, please read it. This is one of the few books that actual read like sunshine."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Alex Prud'homme is a fantastic writer, and it seems he captured Julia's voice exactly. It's incredible the wealth of detail she recorded from her days in France (I wonder if some was embellished). I was particularly inspired by Julia's marriage with Paul. I was deeply dissatisfied with Paul's character in the movie -- he was nothing like in the book -- caring, shy, intensely intellectual, brilliant."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I have been watching Julia Child with my mother since I was a little girl, so naturally, this book was a great present for her this Christmas. The book is funny, smart, and very very educational at the same time. Julia not only has wit and charisma, but she also has a great deal of passion for cooking. Anyone who loves a good story along with cooking and french food, this book is perfect!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My Life in FranceISBN: 978-0-307-47485-8Julia Child with Alex Prud'hommeAnchor BooksAs many of us have, I picked this book up at the bookstore because of the movie Julie and Julia. I had received a copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" by chance and have found that, that cookbook has changed the way I cook.This book is simply a memoir of, for the most part, how \\"Mastering\\" became. It is about Julia's life in France among other places and her views on the world. It is also the love story of Julia and Paul Child. Since I love to cook, I love France, and I love to hear about peoples lives this book is a natural for me. I was pleased to be able to connect many things I have experienced with experiences of Julia's.Since reading this book I will never apologize when something I cook does not come out exactly right. (Easier said than done by the way) I also now plan to send more Valentines Day cards. Many things within it have left an impact on the way I see things.This book I have to admit is not a page-turner. I did not find myself rushing through any thing in order to be able to get back to reading. I prefer to look at it more like so many cookbooks that I enjoy, a book to be wandered through a bit at a time. Isn't that what good cooking is all about anyway, taking your time and allowing the flavors to blend.Bon Appetit"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child married Paul, her senior by ten years, and lived happily ever after. Their life is sweet and adventurous and Julia and Paul absolutely completed one another. He encouraged her to write her famous cook book and she busily set about with Simone Beck (mostly) and Louisette Bertholle (nominally) to write a masterpiece that is still essential to French cooking today.This book takes the reader to France beginning in 1948, to Julia and Paul's favorite restaurants and to dine with their best friends. Julia must have taken copious notes throughout her life to complement Paul's letters to his brother so that we are able to read in detail about the meals they ate and the fine wines (including the age of the wine!) they drank with their meal, what the weather was like and who they dined with.Now, if that sounds boring to you, you need not pick up this book. But, if like me, you are enthralled with feasting and good company all in an idyll setting, and love to read about such details; you will love this book.It was also interesting to see where reality lie between Julia Child's own account of events and the movie, Julie and Julia. I was also fascinated by the more in depth look at Julia and Paul's life.This book cements her place as one of America's most endearing chefs."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I just love Julia.

I have no problem with the read......what I have a problem with is the shape of the book. Too expensive tosend back so I'll keep it but beware.......you might do better purchasing this book in person where you can inspect the one you purchase. The one I received has many many pages wider than others and some narrower than others. On top of this.....there was a bug.....a small one but still, a bug smashed inside one of the pages.I ordered this for my Kindle but wanted the book as well to look through the photos. This book appears to be a 'second' or 'flawed' that would have been found in the $2.00 bin at a book store.My rating is not for the words but for the shape of the book. I rated it low to draw attention to the kind of book you might receive. $17 + is not an amount I believe should have been charged for this. If that doesn't bother you, great! At least if you read reviews you are warned.Still a good book......"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I enjoy cooking and have recently been interested in Julia Child's work in the field. I also enjoy a good biography. The combination of the two in this case, did not turn out so well. The tempo was very slow throughout the book, occasionally picking up tiny bits of steam, only to revert back to the same humdrum pace. The information is all there, and if you are interested in how Julia's passion for food, and more specifically of french cuisine, developed over years in France, you should still read this book. But perhaps you should visit your local library and check it out first.

Too bad."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I picked this book up to read because I so very much enjoyed the film, JULIE and JULIA recently, which was based on this book and Julie Powell's book. I was hoping for more personal anecdotes and information about Child's life with her husband, but after more than a hundred pages of detailed info about French cooking, with a bit of bland travelogue stuff mixed in, I just plain got tired of it. I skimmed over the rest of the book, finding a few interesting pages here and there, about the family background and education of the two, and the difficult last years dealing with Paul's failing health and giving up their seasonal home in France. In the end, however, I found the going just too darn bland, despite all those spicy cooking stories. Child's co-author says in the book's preface that the Childs were always very private people. It seems they stayed that way to the end. The writing is good, bu there's nothing particularly interesting here. Sorry, Alex. Fortunately for moviegoers, Nora Ephron was able to piece together an altogether charming story from this book and the other one by Powell. The film I will recommend highly. The books are another thing. Maybe women will enjoy them. - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It was interesting because of the history portions about Julia Child. The portions relating to Foreign Service personnel living aboard following WWII was informative. Nothing about the book itself was written to be a novel, but rather more of an historical memoir of her life. Taken as that, it is fine. Just don't expect it to be a griping, exciting adventure."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Let me say that I have trouble giving mre than three stars to a book that has no real ending. This book started out as very interesting and then kind of trailed off into nothing for the last few chapters. I agree with the other reviewers who say that you can get a pretty good picture of post war Europe as seen through the eyes of an American woman who was not unintelligent. However I also agree with the reviews that say you will probably like Julia Child less after you read this book. She comes across as a somewhat bright person (but far from brilliant) who was probably suffering from a mild case of obsessive compulsive disorder. She focused on two things that were important to her; French cultural immersion and cooking. If those were your areas of interest you would have been able to carry on a nice conversation with her. If they weren't, you would have had nothing to say to each other. Her cooking comes across as mechanical and somewhat less inspired than some of her contemporaries that she talks about in the book. She portrays herself as more of an engineer than a chef.One thing in the book that irked was the constant use of un-translated French. This seemed to be hit or miss. A comment made by someone that seemed important to the story would be translated for us, the next would not. One of the things about the book that was interesting and annoying at the same time was Julia's description of the McCarthy witch hunt in the 1950's and the impact it had on her husband's foreign Service career. This was something that was obviously of great personal concern to them at the time but I came away with a feeling of \\"I think she doth protest too much\\" especially about the issue of her husband's sexuality. This was a can of worms that she probably did not want to open in the reader's mind(s) and she made me wonder about the nature of their relationship. Her husband forfeited a great deal of money by his departure before retirement from the Foreign Service. This adds to the reader's perception that you might have been more interested in being a fly on the wall while some of these things were taking place than simply hearing Julia's version of events."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This was a very good book. I just read a book called Simple and Simply Delicious by the french author Sylvie Rocher and enjoyed both books. I've traveled to France and recommend both of these books to anyone who has been to or would like to better understand the magic and beauty of french life and french food."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It is hard to reconcile the delightful and generous Julia Child who codified and introduced French cuisine to American audiences on TV and in books with the boorish, petty and whining character found on these pages.Her reminiscences of long gone establishments, great meals and day to day adventures makes for enjoyable reading. It is her constant carping and complaining that gets tiresome.She has haughty disregard for her coauthors of MAFC. She complains about the British people. She complains about the German people (\\"Land of Monsters\\"). Italian food is \\"tasteless.\\" She complains about Americans. She loathes her father's conservative middle class status (but her ethics still allow her to take his money and lavish trips). She complains about G.I.s living in Paris. She complains about having to have her picture taken for the cover of a magazine... her TV production schedule... her career bureaucrat husband's superiors... her publishers... it goes on and on and on.I am going to choose to believe this was not the real Julia Child. Rather the result of an elderly and infirmed woman's musings edited posthumously by her grandson, who writing career consists largely of writing a bio on Rosie O'Donnell.For now, I am going to put in a DVD of the Julia Child and Jacques Pepin home cooking series and clear my palette from the bad taste this book left in my mouth."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I picked up this book when I saw that it was one of the sources used for the Julie and Julia movie, which I look forward to seeing, after enjoying reading that book (the story of a woman who decides to cook all the way through Julia Child's cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking), even though I was not a fan of Julia Childs before. I've probably never seen one of her shows in entirety.However, as soon as I started My Life in France, I was captivated by Julia Child's spirit - her joy for life and her can-do spirit.This book chronicles her late-start in her life-changing love of food (life-changing not only to her, but to others all these years later who have caught her vision) when she and her husband (she also got a late-start on marriage) moved to France.If you like travelogues, you'll enjoy this story of Julia Child's immersion and complete infactuation with France, its food, and its people."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Published a couple of years after Child's death, \\"My Life in France\\" is a great book for anybody to read, whether you have been a lifelong fan of Child or are just learning about her. My only real memories of Child are from watching her PBS shows in the 70s when I was a kid and marveling at the tall chef with the distinctive voice.The book is entitled \\"My Life in France\\" but is also about Child's time spent in Germany, Norway (which Child seems to love and I wish she's written more about her time in Oslo) and the United States. We learn about her family - her conservative father and spirited sister- life with her husband Paul and all the friends she makes along the way as she learns to cook and becomes the legendary chef.I am not much of a non-fiction reader (maybe the last non-fiction book I read cover to cover before this one was 17 years ago) but this book is a fun read. Child makes a great, engaging narrator and I read this book in only a few days. Since I'm now inspired now to try my hand at some recipes by Child, I think this book did the trick."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I really enjoyed this book and Julia's journey in cooking. A great read... and if you want to go to France without leaving your home..this is the book.. the problem is when you're done reading... you'll be looking for a flight to Paris... or to your kitchen to cook up a storm!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Inspired by the delightful movie trailer for this summer's Julie & Julia I borrowedMy Life in Francefrom the library.Julia Child, born Julia McWilliams the daughter of an ultra-right wing Republican, was raised in a \\"comfortable, WASPy, upper-middle-class family in sunny & non-intellectual Pasadena CA\\". Although having served with OSS during WW II in Ceylon & China, she describes herself in her early thirties as \\"unpolished\\". She had seen nothing of the world outside of her native U.S. and her war posting. Julia describes her husband Paul:He was a cultured man, ten years older than I was, and by the time we met, during World War II, he had already traveled the world. Paul was a natty dresser and spoke French beautifully, and he adored good food and wine. He knew about dishes...that seemed hopelessly exotic to my untrained ear and tongue. I was lucky to marry Paul [when Julia was 34]...I would never have had my career without Paul Child.This fascinating book, written with Paul's grandnephew & freelance writer Alex Prud'homme, was based on Julia's memories and the letters written between Paul & his brother Charles Child from 1948-1954, and gives us a glimpse of the world that shaped Julia Child, the French Chef.Julia's life in France began in 1948 when Paul was posted to the United States Information Service in Paris. Post-war Paris was a mecca for North American authors & artists. Into the 1960s, one could find bargain flat rentals and bargain food. And it was good food - authentic French bourgeoises food before the country's cooking, under pressure from low fat, nouveau cuisine, all but disappeared.Julia had shown no interest in cooking while she was growing up and was a rudimentary cook when she moved to France. She did, however, have interest in food - especially in eating the wonderful French food that was exemplified at her first meal in Rouen: portugaises (briny oysters on the half-shell), pain de seigle (pale rye bread), beurre d'Isigny (light table butter), sole meuni&egrave;re (fried in butter and sprinkled with lemon juice & parsley), salade verte (green salad), baguette, fromage blanc and caf&eacute; filtre. She called it the \\"most exciting meal of (her) life\\". That night she fell in love with French food and devoted her following years in France to learning how to cook it - and to cook it properly.She attended the prestigious Cordon Bleu Cooking School, and talked to friends, restaurant owners, and chefs. But it was when Simone Beck & Louisette Bertholle asked Julia to collaborate on their proposed book of French cooking that Julia's future began to get a little clearer. Madames Beck & Bertholle wanted to write for the American market, but needed a native American English speaker to write the recipes in such a way that the \\"average\\" American could follow them.Julia began testing recipes scrupulously, doing market research to ascertain what ingredients would be available to a typical American Photobuckethousewife, and rewriting. It would be a project ten years in the making, and for much of that decade, Julia was cooking. She made it her mission to understand why a recipe succeeded and, perhaps more importantly, why a recipe failed, if it did. I was amazed by the amount of work that went intoMastering The Art of French Cookingand suspect that there has never been a more thoroughly tested collection of recipes ever published. Mastering the Art of French Cooking for Canadian readersOver time, Mme Bertholle's role in authoring the book decreased considerably and, although both Julia & Simone were co-authors, in the end, the chef that America came to know was the American - the one who toured, and who appeared on television. That she loved \\"cookery-bookery\\" was plainly evident. And so came the creation of the Julia Child whom most of us know and whom many of us love.I wish I'd paid more attention to Julia Child when she was on the air. Television never was my thing and I guess French cooking wasn't either as I never bought her cookbook Mastering The Art of French Cooking Trying to catch up, I've now reserved DVDs of her 1962 television show The French Chef from Zip.ca. I hope they will help me keep Julia and Meryl as Julia separate in my head.If you are a fan of Julia Child, if you are a fan of French cooking, or if you plan to see the movie Julie & Julia this summer, then this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A wonderful insight into her life and food adventures. This book is a joy and inspiration for foodies everywhere. Bon Appitite!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I first bought this book when it first came out in 2004. I really don't know why this book grabed my attention. I of course knew who Julia Child was, but thats about it. My Life in France sat on my bookshelf for almost 4 years before I opened the book. Why I waited so long I have no Idea this book was a facinating read. Any fan of bio's or cooking will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julia Child's zest for life and personality comes through loud and clear, as does her tremendous work ethic and love of all things about French food and wine. My only complaint about the book was that there are french phrases used throughout the book that are not always translated, which I found frustrating. Also, occasionally, there were awkward jumps from one \\"story\\" to something that seemed totally unrelated in the very next paragraph. However, even with these minor flaws, I highly recommend the book - Julia Child had an amazing and very interesting life and it is worth the time to read her memoir."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia makes everyone want to experience French food, cooking and wine. For those of us who have a passion for cooking - she brings it to life. She is inspiring. For my next dinner club - we will be using recipes from \\"mastering the art of French cooking\\" . One things stands out while reading about her life - everything simply falls into place for her. it was her strong passion and love for cooking which lead her to a successful career in it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Alex Prud'homme (Julia Child's husband's great-nephew) wrote My Life in France in the voice of his great-aunt after spending many afternoons interviewing Child, then in her nineties. This \\"memoir\\" faithfully captures Child's lively personality and her distinctive voice, down to her idiosyncratic expressions: \\"Phooey!\\" \\"Ouf!\\" and \\"Bravo!\\" The photographs included in the book add further authenticity.My Life in France is not a complete life story. Rather, the focus is on Child's time abroad with her husband, Paul, who worked in various diplomatic capacities over the years. During this time, Child shed her provincial ideas and discovered her love of gourmet cooking and French food. The book includes a detailed account of the genesis and the sometimes frustrating development of Child's masterpiece, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. This cookbookbrought French cooking within the grasp of American home cooks and is now widely regarded as a catalyst in the development of the appreciation of good food in America. My Life in France will appeal to lovers of French food and will inspire those who enjoy cooking."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This informative memoir covers Julia Child's and photographer husband Paul Child's years in France, mostly Paris in the fifties, with humor, and her joyful experience learning the French way to cook at the famous Cordon Bleu.

I really enjoyed it and hated for it to end. which is why i am not reselling my own. as i will re read it someday!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"What a fantastic, adventurous life Julia Child had the great fortune to lead! I learned so much about Julia as a person by reading My Life in France, and the details in this book made it that much more fun to go back to her first cookbook (I have a copy from 1965) to create more of those wonderful French dishes. The inspiration really came when I discovered that Julia didn't even take her first cooking school until the age of 37! As a 37 year old myself, it truly opened my eyes to the possibilities that are on the horizon. Julia passed away before the book was finished, which made me recognize how Alex Prud'homme's writing captured the very essence of Julia in this wonderful work. Don't worry if you are not into food, wine, or cooking, if you love the human spirit you will love this book. I'll never make scrambled eggs any other way...."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Before I read this book, I had a preconceived notion of Julia Child. She had taken on an almost cartoon-like character in my mind, due to a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit, and other various comedy acts. I had never watched one of her cooking shows, or had read one of her cookbooks. Yet I was also aware that most of my favorite chefs and cookbook authors mentioned her as a source of inspiration. I decided to put my prejudice aside and learn about this woman.I loved reading \\"My Life In France\\". Julia turned out to be inspiring, warm, witty, and a new role model for me. She took up cooking in her mid to late 30's. Her first cookbook wasn't published until she was almost 50. She found her passion in life, and embraced it completely. One sentence in this book just jumped out at me, \\"Good results require that one take time and care.\\" Julia seemed to live her life this way. I also loved the fact that she was a 6'2\\" American living in Paris, who physically couldn't blend in with the crowd. This didn't prevent her from following her dreams, or embracing life and new experiences. She faced obstacles head on, and didn't dwell on lifes disappointments. She seemed to take good care of her husband, family and friends. Those relationships came first, and the rest seemed to fall into place. What a lovely lady."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This has risen to the top of my favorite books list. It's so well written, with plenty of imagery and descriptive language that I felt I was in Julia's kitchen with her. I learned quite a bit about her relationship with her husband and both their careers. The best was reading about how the recipes and the books were written.If you are planning to write a cook book or are very interested in cooking and chefs, you should definitely buy this book."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Anything you can say about a sumptuous meal could be said about this book so why not call it as I see it? The book was just yummy. Delicious. Rich. Satisfying.During the course of it I felt as though I were in France right there with Julia. The delight she took in describing the meals (and the total recall she had of them!) she had through the years was sensual and fun and enthralling. Her adventures and misadventures in writing her breakthrough book on French cooking made fascinating reading for this writer who marveled at the inner workings of how her masterpiece came to be.I remember watching Julia Child from time to time and thinking she was a larger than life personality but through this book I have come to admire and even adore her."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this look at Julia Child's life and work.

We were in awe of her spirit, humor and carefree cooking style while executing gourmet french meals. Little did I know then, how much I would continue to find inspiration from Julia's life.I read Julia's book awhile ago and was thrilled to hear of a movie being made from her memoirs, so I picked up the book again and reread bits here and there. I find true inspiration in how she lived her life, doing what she loved to do, with excitement and wonder in her teaching and cooking, mastering them as best she could. Her insatiable appetite for learning recipes in the world of french cooking and in life itself was awesome. I especially enjoy her quote at the end of the book that goes \\"And thinking back on it now reminds me that the pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite - toujours bon appetit.\\"If you are looking for a recipe on how to have your life be magical and brilliant, I highly recommend two authors, who are also true inspirations to me, Ariel and Shya Kane.

I am very happy that I bought the book through Amazon as well, simply because I paid less.My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"\\"Every field was an explosion of fragrant and colorful bougainvilleas, brooms, mimosas, or daisies. Warm, salty breezes blew off the Mediterranean. There were dramatic rocky cliffs along the coast, snow-topped Alps looming in the background...I found my senses were nearly overwhelmed.\\" ~ pg. 49When friends started to tell me that I must watch \\"Julie and Julia\\" I put the movie on my Netflix list and didn't think too much about it. Then a friend sent me a recipe adaptation of Boeuf Bourguignon and I adapted the recipe even more (I use less Burgundy). After trying that recipe I became even more interested in the movie and recipes. I had actually reviewedJulia and Jacques Cooking at Homethe year I started reviewing and had watched a special on Julia Child's life sometime before. At one point (I think because of my reviews) I was invited to see Julia Child. I think it was around $400 so I wasn't able to meet her because at the time all my money was going into testing recipes for my own cookbook.However it wasn't until I watched the \\"Julie and Julia\\" movie that I became very interested in Julia Child's life. \\"My Life in France\\" is completely charming in every way. Since I visited France in 1996 I could relate to Julia Child's love of Provence and her love affair with Paris. I loved reading about Cassis and Marseille as it reminded me of the bakery we found and how delicious the fresh fish was at a restaurant by the Mediterranean Sea.Alex Prud'homme effectively captures Julia Child's voice by interviewing her and by obviously reading many of Paul and Julia's letters. There is probably no way anyone could remember such an amazing amount of details like the exact weather and the menu at restaurants. All these details about food make the book absolutely tantalizing. Julia's love of life comes through so well in the captivating warm prose.I could relate to the years Juila Child spent working on her cookbooks to the point of obsession. Her second book took nine years to produce. She really struggled to birth her books and had to deal with moving from country to country with all her kitchen equipment. It is fun to read about her rhapsodizing over kitchen stores. She was fascinated by kitchen gadgets.Once Juila Child discovered her love of cooking she never looked back. It is amazing how her entire life revolved around cooking. She made writing recipes into a total adventure. At one point she does some investigative reporting when she wants to learn to make beurre blanc. Somehow she had the money to go to some of the best restaurants in France.The main thing I loved about this book is how it effectively documents the stages Julia Child went through to become an icon. She truly had to work for her fame although at times it seemed like she was just at the right place at the right time.My only complaint about the book is that some of the French words don't come with any translation. You are at times left to imagine what was said.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I never had much interest in Julia Child until reading Julie and Julia by Julie Powell and then watching the DVD of the same name( Meryl Streep was wonderful as was Amy Adams). The movie incorporated parts from this memoir, so I decided to read it.It could more aptly be named My Love of France or My love of French Food.Julia married Paul Child after they met while both working for the OSS in WWII. They lived in France while Paul was assigned to the embassy there. Julia knew little of French culture but immediately fell in love with it's cuisine. Julia tries to keep herself busy, taking French lessons, but ultimately decides she wants to learn to cook at the famed Cordon Bleu. She throws her self into cooking with the same gusto that she eats. This leads her to Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, her cookbook co- conspirators.The first half or so of the book focuses mainly on her time in France but continues through to her and Paul's other diplomatic posts and eventual return to the US.my review: This was quite interesting, Julia Child is an amazing woman and accomplished so much in her lifetime. She threw herself fully into every project, whether it be the Cordon Bleu, her cookbooks, her show The French Chef.This is a woman who truly loved French food and cooking and really wanted Americans to be able to cook such cuisine at home without sacrificing the true experience of enjoyment.Julia and Paul seem to be such a perfect couple, both so supportive of each other. I don't think Julia could have so accomplished so much with out his support and devotion and very creative ideas.I enjoyed reading about Julia's life and all of the delicious food that she describes throughout. I would not read this on an empty stomach!But there is more than food in this book; she discusses the political climate of the US, McCarthy's reign. Paul is even called back to the US to be questioned about potential communist ties and what kinds of books he reads.Paul and Julia travel quite a bit but France remains their true second home. They build a cottage there and visit several times a year.Julia Child is not a sentimental woman, but she is passionate, opinionated, loyal, and driven to excellence.my rating 4.5/5"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I really liked this book. My memories of Julia date back to the original French Chef series on PBS. I was in high school, and my grandmother and I would watch together. I'm sure I learned many basic cooking techniques, although we never actually made any of her recipes! Finding out more about Julia's life was absolutely fascinating. This biography covers just the right span--it focuses on her awakening to French cooking and follows through as she became famous for her books and television shows. She seemed to have such a zest for life and spirit of adventure that came through quite clearly. I don't know much about French food, and I don't know the French language, but I thought this book was a delightful tale. The style is such that I could \\"hear\\" her voice as I read it, something pretty tricky to accomplish. Note: If you saw the movie \\"Julie and Julia,\\" much of this will initially seem familiar, but the book goes into more detail (of course) and explains her actions more clearly. If you are interested in the REAL Julia Child, I think you will enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My Life in France, by Julia ChildI bought this book on June 29, 2009 (found the receipt inside), and in just over six months I've read it three times. While I do tend to reread, that is a lot for even me in such a short period. But I just love this book so much that it's so easy to pickup again and again, and each time I enjoy it anew.While reading I heard Julia Child's distinctive voice in my head, speaking each word. \\"My Life in France\\" feels like a literary version of her television cooking shows, which I remember watching on PBS when growing up. After reading about her experiences taping her first shows in 1962, I scrounged up a DVD copy of the original shows, and it was fascinating to watch those after reading her thoughts and impressions on the process.\\"My Life in France\\" is an absolutely fantastic retelling of Julia's years in France and of discovering her purpose in life: cooking. She began by shopping at the local markets, to improve her abysmal French, and then eventually ended up attending the Cordon Bleu, the famed cooking academy. While cultivating an active social life in Paris full of dinner parties and outings with her husband and lifelong love, Paul, Julia met many in the French gastronomic world. Two of the people she met were Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who were trying to write a French cookbook for American chefs. Their early attempts at publication failed, and the two were advised to bring an American onboard for much needed perspective - enter Julia. Thus began their collaboration on a massive labor of love that would eventually tally in at over 700 pages - the slimmest they could make it.While much of the memoir focuses on her entry and later success into the cooking world, and her research, cookbook work, teaching, and restaurant visits, Julia also gives plenty of detail about normal life, from apartment problems to her addiction for shiny kitchenware. Julia includes much about her husband as well, who was interesting in his own right.My one complaint is that French words, especially for the names of dishes, are sprinkled throughout, and translations aren't always provided. I have a few years of French under my belt and knew most, but I couldn't translate some of the cooking terms. A listing at the end would have been helpful. The ending seems to lose some steam, as entire years go by with scant mention.Otherwise, an excellent treat of a book. Bon app&eacute;tit!4/5."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Growing up with Julia Child as part of the television scene was a treat for many women of the baby boom era. Even though most never learned to cook true French cuisine, just reading the recipes and descriptions is worth the price of the books. In this story of the experiences and work behind the cookbooks and the television shows, readers get an idea of how devoted to learning and teaching the art of French cooking Julia Child really was. It was a life's work that never stopped delighting her, and this tale has the same effect on its readers.Following the release of \\"Julie and Julia,\\" the movie, people became interested in the original. Julia Child is one of a kind and although her story reads much like a private journal, her uniqueness shines through. She loved France, its cuisine, and its people. What she loved was the old ways, most of which would be lost if she had not written Mastering the Art of French Cooking and other cookbooks. This memoir adds beautiful details to the story.Those who enjoy this and Child's cookbooks, might also enjoy French Women Don't Get Fat.

I've read it twice now and liked it even better the second time. This give a great insight to how and why she started cooking. It paints a great picture of Paris during the late 40's.

It made me want to know more about her life and buy a couple of her cookbooks Highly recommend it.My Life in France"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This was a wonderful memoir about Julia Child. I especially found it interesting that she fell into cooking at the age of forty. Her passion to learn about cooking and gastronomy, as well as, her love for good food and wine were contagious. It made me want to get in the kitchen and whip something up. I think what Julia said at the end of the book, sums up what I learned by reading My Life in France, \\"Learn how to cook-try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!\\".While I was reading My Life in France, I watched the video \\"Julia Child!

Told winningly, Ms. Child's grandnephew does her proud by giving excellent editorial voice to her memories. A fine feast of a book!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I have been a Julia Child fan since the 1960s when my mother practiced recipes from \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\" I enjoyed her television appearances throughout the years and saw her once in person in conversation with an interviewer. She had enormous magnetism. Being a francophile, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I read it almost straight through and was sorry when it ended. The book was put together using her and her husband's letters and datebooks to jog her memory. Oh, to have been in Paris in the 1950s when the city seemed to open its arms to Americans. And the food -- Ooh La La! What Julia Child made of this ambience is remarkable, since most of us (well, maybe me) would have spent too much time hanging out at cafes. I was fascinated by the way she dove into cooking and pursued it like a science. She meticulously and persistently experimented until she got it right and makes it sound like anyone could cook a complicated French dish. This book is also the story of her marriage which apparently was a successful collaboration. Paul Child, an older, reluctant bureaucrat with considerable artistic talent encouraged and supported his wife. She in turn adored him. Alex Prud'homme states in his introduction that the source of this book was a blend of the letters that Paul and Julia wrote at the time. I suspect the more poetic descriptions were Paul's. His photographs are certainly very evocative and I would like to see more of them. I was very impressed by the arduous work on the book, her perfectionism, which must have driven her two collaborators crazy. Which brings me to reason I have given this book only 4 stars and not 5. As another reviewer pointed out, she seems to go out of her way to denigrate both Louisette and Simca as if she had been unburdening an ancient grudge. I was quite frankly surprised to learn that she remained friends with those two women in later life. She apparently never made her true feelings known to them. I wish they hadn't been revealed to the reader."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I do not read a lot of books, and when I do they are usually cookbooks. This book was amazing, it is as much a love story as it is a book of Mrs. Child's life. One review said that the book did not mention her breast cancer in the 70's,but the book is the story of HER LIFE IN FRANCE. I recommend this book 100%."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I wanted to write this review as a compromise position between \\"this is the best book EVER!\\" and \\"this book disappointed me.\\"My reaction to this book was precisely both!I very much enjoyed reading _My Life in France_. Not a huge fan of descriptive writing, I admired the description in this book for being clear, to-the-point, and evocative. I was impressed by how focused it remained (books about celebrities so often go off-track). It is about France and cooking: period. Other biographical notes are mentioned only in passing.This brings me to the part of the book that didn't satisfy me, however. An author has every right to voice her opinions about politics, publishing companies, friends, and family. What I missed in this book was a little more analysis of those opinions. The occasional statements about John McWilliams (her father), the Foreign Service, etc. are not contextualized as they would be by a biographer.Rather, these statements seem stuck-in to flesh-out Julia's character; unfortunately, I felt like I knew her less in those moments (and more when she was commenting on her books and food). I wasn't sure if her co-writer inserted these statements from the Childs' letters; if Julia made these statements to her co-writer without expanding on them; or if she didn't feel the need to expand on these statements since the book is mostly about France and food.I don't fault her co-writer, Alex Prud'homme; I think the task he had before him was a daunting one, and I think the result shows a great deal of finesse. The out-of-context nature of some statements is a flaw but a minor one.Overall, I was left with the impression of Julia Child as a unique, distinct individual who made a remarkable career for herself out of passion, dedication, and hard-work. Although I'm doubtful how well I got to know her, I do feel like I was introduced to a real, vital, and fascinating human being."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Review by Donn G.

Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years.We know that Julia Child and cooking are connected together at the hip. Contrary to my expectation this book is not all about cooking. Rather it was for me an adventure story of life, travel, people connections, and living in France immediately after World War II that is all very entertaining. It was hard for me, even as a man, to put the book down!I was taken by surprise that Julia hit the ground in France at age 34 with her husband Paul and she never really cooked before. Her first meal in a French restaurant was a predestined lunch stop that became a major wake-up call for her life. She really should have gotten a Nobel Prize for Food Research because of her tenacious pursuit of accepting only the absolute best tried and true recipe formula for making all the things she cooked and baked.If you don't come away from reading this book with absolute respect for Julia, as well as Julia and Paul as a great marriage, then you were not put together with the correct ingredients before you were baked! If so, may you drown in the best of French wines!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I could write a book titled \\"My Life with Julia.\\" As a newlywed in the early 70s my husband and I ventured across the globe to a new life in Perth without the culinary lifeline our mothers normally would have provided. Dinner parties were the mainstay of our social life in Australia. Hence we needed to learn in a hurry. We cooked our hearts out in a little flat using a few purchased cookbooks, one being Julia Child's Mastering The Art of French Cooking. The food was delicious. Decades later in a bookshop I cast my eyes on a little book titled \\"Julie and Julia.\\" It was a quick and fun read but soon prompted my renewed curiosity about the woman called Julia Child. So I browsed Amazon and found some DVDs of her cooking shows and this delightful book, My Life in France. The book is a wonderful read and most satisfying as a culinary adventure, a travelogue and as an autobiography. Her story is fascinating and there are many wonderful photos and illustrations included. It deals with her life in France and the events leading up to the publishing of her famous cookbook. A few years after I read this book the movie Julie and Julia came out starring Merryl Streep. I was surprised to see how well the film version managed to portray the warmth and enthusiasm of such an unusual individual as Julia Child.

I know much was left out but every recollection is golden. Her love affair with Paul continues to be mysterious. Their love for each other made everything possible. It was amazing how she disliked her father so even when she was an adult. She did wind up going back to her roots in Santa Barbara. She was a toughie."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A fun book about the life of Julia in France after the war. Lots of personal facts about a great cook."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Reading Julia's words, the reader shares in her discovery & love of France & the birth of her passion for cooking. I found it to be a delightful, insightful book & it has urged me to become more adventurous in the kitchen. Hightly recommend."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a great read for anybody who loves cooking and enjoys food or just a great book. If you've seen the movie, the book will be even better. I can picture Julia speaking when I read this book and her grandnephew did a fantastic job adapting the book in both Julia and Paul's words. You get a wonderful picture of how much Julia and Paul loved one another and how much he inspired her. Not only is it an easy read, but enjoyable to the very end. Highly recommended a thousand times over again."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book left me wanting more. I can only hope that some day Alex will compile Paul's letters into a companion piece. Both France and French cooking come alive through these pages. Wonderful."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This book is a wonderful example of how to create a beautiful life.Julia Child's life with Paul is an example of how to derive joy from living with passion and teamwork, doing something really well, creating harmony, changing with the times and making it up as you go along.If you have ever done any reading about \\"manifesting\\" what you want, you'll see it in action here.This is worthwhile reading even if you have no interest in French cooking.If you have seen the movie, this will give much more backstory on what made Paul Child tick."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"My goal was to read this book and Julie/Julia before I saw the movie. I did do that and I am happy I did. The movie doesn't do My Life in France justice although it does capture the Childs' love for each other and Julia's love of food. But how could it? I thoroughly enjoyed My Life in France, after only seeing Julia Childs in caricature or SNL sketches it was fun to read how this amazing woman carved out a place for herself by doing what she loved. An inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"An enjoyable read that takes you through the life and times of Julia and Paul Child's post WWII time in France. If you enjoy travel, food, and an inspiring story of a woman who reinvented herself in her mid 30's then this is the book for you. It was light, funny and a great inside look into how Julia became the French Chef we all know and love."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I was married on Bastille Day and in 2004 celebrated my 25th wedding anniversary with a two week trip to Paris. We rented an apartment just across Petit Pont from Notre Dame and delighted in shopping at outdoor food markets and neighborhood provisioners and dining in cafes, bistros and restaurants throughout the city. As soon as I got home, I bought a copy of Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. I was already a pretty good cook but that book made me a better one. I remember Child more from Dan Ackroyd's impersonation than from her long-running TV career and didn't know much about her when I picked up My Life in France. In addition to providing a wonderful depiction of a shattered continent recovering from a global war, Child's memoir provides the very American stories of a daughter struggling to free herself from an overbearing patriarch; of a lover with the courage to embrace the man of her dreams, however offbeat he seemed in the oh-so-conventional 1950s; and of a bright and lively woman searching for a vocation to give her life shape and meaning. That she was close to 40 before she found her man and almost 50 before she found her vocation only add to the reader's pleasure in her successes. I haven't physically been back to France in five years but with Julia Child's memoir I took the trip without every leaving home.[...]"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"As you read the pages of this book, you hear Julia's laughter, strength and passion.

The seller described the item exactly, shipped quickly and I would buy from them again. The book is exactly what I was expecting and a wonderful add to my collection on Julia Child. Reading this book was like having Julia read it to you. I could hear her voice with each word. It showed the true side of Julia that most have not seen and her description of being in France made me want to visit the country and see \\"Julia's France\\"...not the tourist France. Julia Child and Paul Child are to me the epic love story of the century and a delight to read about. They both supported each other and loved each other with such a depth. I hope that others will take the time to read and really discover Julia Child."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I love the condition and the make of this book. I was impressed with the writing style and the frank way Julia Child told of her life there. The first meal in France was a mouth watering tale.In all I had a great experience with this book. The only concern I have is that I understood I would get it faster--I was on a time table for my book club and I needed it delivered sooner."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"As much as i've heard and saw of Julia Child, I could've not imagine such a beautiful and rich life. How her marriage and, more importantly, her friendship with husband Paul lasted and endured through the years is the marvellous core of the book.Her amazing way of describing food will make it possible, with a bit of imagination, to almost smell and see whatever she is talking about, and she talks about a lot of it! foodie alert!The beautiful settings of Paris, South France and special places in Europe are part of a bygone era, but so amazingly and lovingly narrated that you feel that one could take a plane and find them just as the couple saw them.Her charisma, discipline and love for food and proper good living are ever so inspiring. For people who still believe in manners, chivalry, who value friendship and good conversation, this book will be most assuredly something that will nurture their hearts and joie-de-vivre loving brains.Bon Appetit!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I wish I had known this book existed sooner! I didn't know about it until it was credited in the movie \\"Julie and Julia.\\" The book arrived in perfect condition within a week. And, it was hardback. (I might have wished it was smaller; otherwise it would be perfect for reading on a long flight.)At first, I was put off by Julia Child's style. However, her tone, her content, and her style all came together for me, and I was indeed sorry when I finished it because it was such a pleasurable read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Fast delivery, fair price, new condition.

I found Julia Child's memoir of her years spent in France totally engaging. As a true foodie myself, I was hooked from the moment she described her first taste of French cuisine, a dish called sole meuniere (or as she puts it, a \\"morsel of perfection\\"). But what I loved most about this memoir was that it really gives the reader a glimpse into what Julia's life was like, even before she acquired celebrity chef status. The book, a collaboration between Julia and her husband's grand-nephew Alex Prud'Homme, is very well-written and I felt as if I nearly hear Julia's distinctive voice reading certain passages aloud to me. This memoir is a delicious blend of food, cooking, travel, book publishing, and life...I only wish more memoirs and biographies could grab me as this one did!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I really enjoyed getting some background history from Julia Childs. She was a hoot to read about!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"love this book. will read it over and over.picked it for my book club and they love it too."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Although I wish the book had had pictures and the French bits had had translations I still can't bear to give this book anything less than the full 5 stars. The movie Julie & Julia was my only exposure to the legendary Julia Child (too young for the TV show) but the depiction by the also legendary Meryl Streep compelled me to get this book.Julia is intelligent, hard working, strong, funny and most of all tenacious, determined to get the most accurate information for her recipes, it really made me admire her as a person. Reading her memoirs of her time in Europe and her writing/TV career felt like spending time and reading letters written by a dear friend from a different time. I wish I could thank her for sharing her life with us."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I adore this book, I got into Julia Childs cooking sometime ago and after reading the cookbook I wanted to know more about the person. This book takes you along with Julia while traveling around France. You feel like your beside her taking pictures. So from the cookbook to this and now an obsession. I can't wait to start a new chapter in the Julia saga."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I remember watching Julia Child on TV with my grandmother as a little girl, still in black and white at times (I'm only 33), making some marvelous gastronomical creation. I loved her quirkiness but true devotion to her craft (in hindsight of course). Now, as a foodie, I was really excited about the movie Julie & Julia but I had wanted to read Julia's book first. I can honestly say it was a lovely book. Yes, the usage of French phrases were a bit much, I felt I was missing a little but it was her reflection on her life, which France was very much a part of. Paul and Julia truly loved one another and their story is so pure. I take back one of those age old lessons that hard work and perseverance produces what you want.. it may take some time but the end will justify the means. I was given \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking V 1& 2\\" for my birthday, staples in any kitchen!Again, a truly lovely book. Pick it up, I think you will like it."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Great speedy shipping, book was new and in good shape!I recommend this seller!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I could almost, at times, imagine Julia Child's voice telling the stories. I grew up watching Julia Child alongside my grandmother, and even though we rarely cooked French food, Julia was instrumental in my learning to love food and cooking.My life in France had me captivated from the start. Learning Mrs. Child's background, and how she learned to love cooking, food, and all things French was inspiring. It was great to learn how one of the most influential people in American cuisine became who she was.The prose itself is lighthearted, and easy-to-read. It's entertaining and a must-read for anyone who loves Julia Child or her work."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is the truth, that I'm almost embarrassed to admit: First off, my limited knowledge of Julia Child was reduced to perhaps a snippet of her show on television in passing, but more than that, Dan Aykroyd's send up of her on Saturday Night Live.Here's the other thing: I thought she was British.Whoops.California girl, Pasadena California.So I'm not sure what drew me to this delightful and informative bio, other than perhaps I thought it would do for France what Francis Mayes has done for Tuscany, it's people , and it's food.Her prose is breezy and sweeping , since she's covering nearly fifty years in a short amount of time. Her love for her husband, and the various parts of France are in strong evidence, but her passion for food is what obviously drives her. The fascinating thing is seeing how that passion and near obsession is cultivated, through her gourmet education, and later writing her cookbooks and doing her television show. I suppose the ultimate would be to hear her voice while relaying these stories, but it's easy to imagine her as she's telling them. Or maybe that's still Dan's voice in my head. Either way, they're great."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Alex Prud'homme joined his great-aunt Julia Child to create this perfect memoir, based largely on family correspondence and Prud'homme's interviews with Child in the last year of her life. My Life in France works on a remarkable number of levels to create a complex, satisfying and enthralling read. Among other things, My Life in France is:--A vividly-rendered travelogue that will transport you to the streets of Paris, the Marseille waterfront and the hills of Provence.--A tour de force on the cuisine bourgeoise that Julia Child loved and popularized in the United States.--The love story of Paul and Julia Child or, as they frequently referred to themselves, \\"PJ\\" or \\"Pulia\\".--A publishing saga of the herculean efforts associated with the writing and publishing of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, a process that took approximately a decade for volume one and eight years for volume two.--An autobiography of Julia Child, revealed here as ebullient, dedicated, and almost ruthlessly single-minded in her mission to bring authentic French cookery to the American masses.Any one of these subjects would be worthy of a memoir. To find them all explored cogently and completely in a single, comparatively slender, beautifully written volume is a marvel. Congratulations to Mr. Prud'homme for shepherding this book to completion, and a hearty 'Bon Appetit' to the memory of Julia Child, a woman who lived life well."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"A beautiful memoir of an amazingly well-lived life. For anyone with a love of la belle France, this will be endlessly entertaining. Those who remember Julia Child's groundbreaking cooking shows will hear her oddly distinctive voice coming through these pages. It's a love story about her relationships, especially Paul, her talented husband. Wistful, sentimental. You'll wipe away tears by the end of the last page."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"If \\"postwar childhood\\" for you means post-WWII, as it does for me, then \\"haute cuisine\\" meant TV dinners, frozen pizza, and J-E-L-L-O. My mother could cook, and she had spent a year in France, but we often made do with something that bore little resemblance to food. I suspect it was to satisfy the children.And then a miracle happened. Public television came to us, and it brought \\"The French Chef.\\" As I watched Julia Child work her 30-minute miracles I began to realize that food doesn't come from a box or a bag. I began to understand as well that good food of all cuisines isn't something to be afraid of or embarrassed by, but rather it is something to be enjoyed and savored.So it is with \\"My Life in France.\\" If you ever watched \\"The French Chef\\" or any of its many progeny you owe it to yourself to read this book. You will hear Julia Child's laugh on every page, and begin to understand why her programs were so enjoyable. Even more, you will pick up your copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" perhaps for the first time in years, treat it with a little more reverence and respect, and read not just the recipes but the prologues which accompany them in a very different light.You will also understand her boundless friendships both in and out of the cooking world, and her love for her husband Paul. This really was a couple joined at the hip.You owe it to yourself to read this book, even if you have never cooked so much as a piece of toast. Bon apetit!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"But to call a Julia Child an icon would irritate her, judging by the intimate and humble memories shared in this final book, completed with the help of one of her nephews.Apparently he taped hours of intensive conversation about her life, and wisely chose to allow her to tell her own story, in her own voice. If he has made editorial additions they are interwoven seamlessly. The pace is slow at times, and the amount of detail concerning the creation of Mastering the Art of French Cooking might be overwhelming to one not seriously interested in cooking. An amazing amount of fastidious and repetitive work went into the creation of her masterpiece.I can't add much to the praise already expressed by other reviewers, except to mention that reading this compelled me to finally read Noel Riley Fitch's biography of Julia. Either she referred to notes and diaries to refresh her memory before embarking on this project, or she had excellent recall, because the two books agree on all major points. The main advantage in reading Fitch's book is to get background on Julia's life before her marriage to Paul - and it was an interesting life already - and analysis of some major aspects of her career in the food industry."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"What a delightful read! Just made me feel good all over to read the story of how Julia Child's career got started and the years that followed--her books, TV shows, and all that. Her love affair with food, France, and life were a joy to read. It helps if you have some familiarity with French (which, alas, I don't), but it doesn't take away from the lovely writing and the story itself. If Julia and French cooking interest you, you are bound to enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Julia Child married Paul, her senior by ten years, and lived happily ever after. Their life is sweet and adventurous and Julia and Paul absolutely completed one another. He encouraged her to write her famous cook book and she busily set about with Simone Beck (mostly) and Louisette Bertholle (nominally) to write a masterpiece that is still essential to French cooking today.This book takes the reader to France beginning in 1948, to Julia and Paul's favorite restaurants and to dine with their best friends. Julia must have taken copious notes throughout her life to complement Paul's letters to his brother so that we are able to read in detail about the meals they ate and the fine wines (including the age of the wine!) they drank with their meal, what the weather was like and who they dined with.Now, if that sounds boring to you, you need not pick up this book. But, if like me, you are enthralled with feasting and good company all in an idyll setting, and love to read about such details; you will love this book.It was also interesting to see where reality lie between Julia Child's own account of events and the movie, Julie and Julia. I was also fascinated by the more in depth look at Julia and Paul's life.This book cements her place as one of America's most endearing chefs."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I grew up watching Julia on TV; she was a favorite with my father. I already felt like I knew her, but reading the details of her life, in her own words, made her come alive. Now whenever I see or hear her name mentioned, I can hear her chortling. She came to cooking late in life and attacked it with such glee that the whole world followed her! She had an infections zest for life and is a role model for women of all ages. Julia was businesswoman, chef, writer, eater and enthusiast all rolled into one oversized package. This book will give you the real Julia Child."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I don't care for cooking shows and really never paid much attention to Julia Child. I did like what I saw but didn't go out of my way to watch her. I'm not sure why I bought this book but am glad I did. Her descriptions of French life are fascinating and she can be hilarious. She must have had a fun life - I wish I had been more aware of her presence on television. Not everything is so pleasing, however. She was very hard on family and friends and, especially, the U.S. Government, which was difficult to understand since she and her husband had no problem taking his salary from that same government. She was also no gramarian, trust me. BTW, if you like this book you will love everything written by M.F.K. Fisher."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I became aware of this book through reading a magazine excerpt in advance of publication last winter, and I could barely wait to get my hands on a copy. It did not disappoint; the book was a revelation and continues to affect me months later. Young Julia fairly jumps out of the page in a new and fresh way that dispels images of the caricature older Julia. In her completely open style, she draws you in so that from page one you are right there with her, walking the streets, smelling the air, tasting the food, and meeting the people of Julia's France. She and her co-author neither overdramatize nor pull punches in describing her experiences at the Cordon Bleu, her first successes and failures with preparing French cuisine, and her extraordinary relationship with her husband. The book is funny, sad, loving, and (sometimes brutally) honest. Julia's amazing combination of determinedness, aplomb, and old-fashioned hard work ensured her success in every ground-breaking endeavor she attempted - whether it was learning to cook traditional French food, opening a cooking school, compiling and editing a definitive French cookbook for Americans, or demonstrating how to cook on TV for the first time. It's one of the most inspirational memoirs I've ever read; I recommend it to everyone I know. It's a great book to read along with a friend or a book club - there's much in here to elicit comment and wonder."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a wonderful book that's evocative of not only France but a whole way of life lived long ago. The writing is very warm and personal and invites you in to see a career and a marriage up close in a way that feels so natural. A great read."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I just loved Julia Childs' \\"My Life in France\\". She was such a delightful woman. I really enjoyed the descriptions of food and fun. I always liked Julia Childs' TV shows and now that I have read the book I know her better and it has been fun looking at the old cookbooks. I look at them differently now."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"For the first time we are able to see the true julia, the part that viewers don't get to see. I had the great pleasure in meeting Miss Julia several times over the years, my mother had known julia for many years. sitting in her home with my mother over coffee I would just sit and stare at her for hours, she took it all in stride and would laugh when she caught me. she would give me a bowl and wooden spoon and have me stir something. when she was answering fan mail( my mother would help)some one asked why a cake didn't turn out like julas her answer. you didntuse love, because anyone can make a cake but making it with love makes all the difference in the world. the cooking world lost a great chef and more important we lost a great person who would bring a smile to any one she met wether in a tv studio or on the streets of cambridge massachusetts you met a person you would never forget. were lucky that she lives on in her tv shows and her many books but for a lucky few we were able to meet the real julia, a big smile and a dry wit. we miss you .your star still shines bright as ever. ps the book will show parts of julia's life you never knew, and her love for paul that even after he passed he was still such a part of her life, like he was still standing next to her, the book also shows how she became one of the foremost cooks in american cooking history."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This is a happy book. Child's joyful recounting of the first years of her long, successful marriage to Paul Child describes her discovery of France, and especially Paris, and food, which became her life-long vocation. Every line of this memoir is filled with energy, enthusiasm and delight. Moreover, and not incidentially, Child's tale provides a fascinating glimpse into life among the ex-patriot, American foreign service community in Paris shortly after W.W.II and during the early fifties. There are also accounts of the history of some of Child's favorite recipes; I took to reading \\"My Life in France\\" with a copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" at my side, and my family has benefited in the form of ratatouille, French potato salad and, this evening, leek & swiss cheese quiche. Definitely a rewarding read!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Bravo! I could hear her wonderfully distinct voice that I grew up hearing in my mother's kitchen as I read. I truly love this book and praise the author for truly bringing Julia to us. The pictures are wonderful, however I would have liked a few more descriptive captions. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"The Julia Child from television came off as playful, fun, instructive and, well, conservative in the best senses of that word. The Julia Child from the book comes across as playful, fun, instructive, driven, highly intelligent, fiercely liberal, opinionated, steely, amazing. It's a strange feeling to have this aunt-like TV figure my life turn into a complex human being. I credit Child and Prud'homme for not mincing words about her relationship with Paul, her mild-mannered artistic soumate; Simone Beck, the beloved adopted sister she butted heads with; her stern ultraconservative father she never could get close to and even the Joseph McCarthy, who gets a well-deserved dose of venom from Ms. Child.In her later years you certainly got large glimpses of steel and resolve, collegially bickering with Jacques Pepin on their show and flirting with the young men on \\"Baking with Julia.\\" This book shows the development of a true culinary genius as she becomes enamoured of French cuisine and culture, able and willing to avail herself to learning, studying, obsessing but most of all *connecting* with the French people who are of course the reason this culture and cuisine exist. Here the Julia Child you'd love to have create your dinner party becomes the Julia Child you'd want to invite as your special guest."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"I loved this book. It may not make me a better cook, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Julia's introduction to french cuisine, cookbooking and the early days of TV. You heard Julia's voice and wit on every page."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"It all began with a new bride wanting to learn to cook and progressed to owning a share in a cooking school, writing classic cookbooks that will be in print for many years, and becoming a television celebrity.During her last years, Julia Child and her husband's grandnephew, Alex Prud'homme, met frequently to record her memories. The heart of the narrative is her first years in France, where she arrived in 1948 as a newly wed whose cooking repertoire was comprised of a bad job of boiling water. The serious home cook, who has dabbled in a variety of cuisines (and most certainly French), may reap the most enjoyment, yet her story is intensely interesting, on a personal and public level, and very well written. There were moments when I wished I had a French dictionary at my side, but those moments weren't frequent enough to spoil a good read.Considering her age at the time of the writing, Prud'homme most certainly would have been responsible for the organization and undoubtedly did the bulk of the writing. But his contribution and his great aunt's voice are seamlessly interwoven. As I read, I could hear her warbling, high-pitched voice and was reminded of her wit from her television cooking shows.I read the last page with a smile, shut the book, and felt as satisfied as if I had just finished making her recipe for Cream of Mushroom Soup and found it to be perfect in every respect. I get the feeling that Julia looked back on her life with that same sense of satisfaction. She doesn't apologize for her privileged background, and she doesn't complain about being a somewhat homely, well-educated, quite bright, six-foot-two-inch woman who didn't marry until she was well into her thirties and never had the children she and her husband wished for. She mentions her sadness at not being able to share a close relationship, or even a viewpoint, with her father, but she doesn't wallow in it. She incorporates names, but never drops them. She is unpretentious, natural, and disarmingly honest.So many people look back with harrowing tales of disappointment and unhappiness; Julia gave us her joys and successes to share. I liked her before I knew anything about her life; now I like her a lot more."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"Don't we all love Julia? This book basicly explains how Julia became the \\"French chef.\\" This is the second biography of Julia I've read and the author is obviously very fond of the old girl. A totally charming read. Food, France, travel, culture, personalities,accomplishments. Perfect."},{"Title":"My Life in France","review":"This was a very inspiring book. We learn that Julia did not have a 5-star culinary upbringing, and barely knew how to cook until she moved with her then newly-wedded husband to Paris where he served in the U.S. foreign service. She tells of her first meal in France upon arrival by boat, and how she was inspired to learn everything there was to know about French food. Education at the Cordon Bleu commences shortly thereafter, and the rest, as they say, is history.What was interesting to learn was the length of time it took to get the \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" written, and then edited and published. It shows that, contrary to what casual observers think of people who have succeeded in life, the road there is long with sidetrips along the way.As one who aspires to cook well, but seem to fall short now and then, this was very inspirational. I recall seeing a TV biography about Julia Child which stated that Julia did not even know how to boil water until she was 40, which then turned into an excuse to my husband that there is still hope for me! While the book proved that story to be wrong, her trials and tribulations prove that where there is a will, there is a way. And that perfection does not happen at once, but is earned by hard work, as in many of life's endeavors."},{"Title":"A Cage of Ice","review":"This was Duncan Kyle's first book which got him onto the thriller scene. Reading 'A Cage of Ice' shows he came in with a bang. John Edwards, the main character, receives a mysterious package from the Soviet Union. Later the same day he is nearly killed by a car and his landlord is mugged for the keys to Edward's room. He is confused, not only because of the bizarre attacks but because the package is addressed to 'Professor Edward.' He is Dr. Edwards. The plot comes together quite nicely, and Dr. Edwards ends up on a mission through the Arctic. This thriller set the stage for Kyle's other books, and he went on to become the greatest thriller writer ever (in my eyes.)"},{"Title":"A Cage of Ice","review":"I got thru this \\"thriller,\\" after casting it aside a few times in frustration. Halfway thru the book the device of throw up a storm, find another anchor becomes glaringly apparent. I started wondering what was in the potboiler bag next to throw into the stew. On top of that the reference to the global warming hoax is tiresome. If you can stomach the result you MIGHT like the story. There isn't much in the way of likeability about the characters, tho."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Russian Mennonites","review":"This book gives an abbreviated overview of Russian Mennonite history. It's a good springboard for those who want a full understanding of this important community. The lessons learned by the Russian Mennonite experience have much to say about today's challenges. This includes the relationship with the government, engagement with those outside the community, and how to handle both prosperity as well as difficult economic times.A good companion to this book is the documentary \\"Through the Desert Goes Our Journey.\\" It highlights one of the more interesting episodes in Russian Mennonite history - the Great Trek to Central Asia. In the 1880's, hundreds of families left their prosperous estates, and migrated to the khanates beyond Russia's eastern frontier. This episode illustrates historical Russian Mennonite life and attitudes, and the documentary advances the story to show its relevance today."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Russian Mennonites","review":"Wally Kroeker has written a short work about Russian Mennonites. It does give some factual information about the history, but fails to adequately explain the faith behind the works. Mr. Kroeker tends to view the tenets of the Anabaptist faith as cultural peculiarities.This book might be a good inexpensive work, but Mr. Kroeker needs to spend a considerable amount of time with the Old Colony or the more conservative Kleine Gemeinde to get a better grasp of exactly WHY they do the things they do. That's whats missing!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Russian Mennonites","review":"A superficial review of the history of Mennonites who migrated to Russia and later left for the West.

Its format is easy to read. Directions are clear enough to follow without being overdone.

It's great."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book approaches this subject with ease and I really enjoy it. We are learning another language to help others learn about the bible and what Jehovah God wants for them in the future. This book really assists us in conveying the bible's message clearly to others. Thanks so much for this book!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book introduces students to the world of Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Following the book's introduction which provides an overview of how the book should be used, there are two sections which go into great detail about the different types of Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Students will be exposed to 15 different topics on Spanish pronouns and prepositions. Some topics include subject pronouns, interrogative pronouns, prepositional pronouns, direct object pronouns, indirect object pronouns, double object pronoun constructions (indirect+direct), reflexive pronouns, para and por and verbs and adjectives with characteristic prepositions. Besides the main subjects of Spanish pronouns and prepositions, the book also presents appendices highlighting verb conjugations, answers to the exercises from both the Spanish pronoun and preposition sections and an English-Spanish vocabulary list.This book is designed for those who have some knowledge of the Spanish language, those who wish to broaden their insight into the workings of Spanish pronouns and prepositions, and those who are simply attempting to brighten their shine in the Spanish grammar arena. Whether you are an advanced learner or beginner, this book is a great tool for sharpening your Spanish language skills. While advanced learners have the edge of skipping through chapters due to their advanced level, it is recommended that beginners not skip any chapters as the book is designed in a sequential manner that builds on grammatical concepts and vocabulary that were discussed in previous chapters.If you've been searching for a book to assist you with honing your Spanish grammatical skills in the areas of pronouns and prepositions, you've just ended your search.Some other Amazon products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are listed below:A resource that highly recommend for adding new words to your Spanish vocabulary isQuick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cardsIt is a tremendous bargain for the price since you get 1,000 of these cards.For learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs, the best product is theVerbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)software. This Verbarrator actually replaces the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs one of the most fun parts of learning Spanish. And, of course, the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. It is one of the best investments you can make in your learning-Spanish studies. Another feature that I like about this interactive software is that it really helped improve my pronunciation.The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish isThe Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series). This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable. To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This is one of the best workbooks I've found for work with private students in Spanish."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I bought this book because I was having trouble forming sentences. I also bought \\"Complete Spanish Grammar\\" and \\"Spanish Verb Tenses\\" from the same \\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" series. Between these 3 books I have learned so much super valuable information about Spanish that I can't say how pleased I am. I certainly recommend this to anyone learning Spanish."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"The book is really great for when you need a lot of extra practice and whatnot.

I'm at an intermediate level and have been finding it hard to get out of beginning Spanish and move comfortably to more advanced levels. Thank goodness I finally found the \\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" series. I wasted my time with most of those other books and programs. These books provide excellent explanations and enough exercises to allow you to truly learn and understand the language. Of course you might have to buy more than one, since they each focus on different aspects of the language, but it's worth it. So far I've purchasedPractice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions,Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb Tenses, andPractice Makes Perfect: The Spanish Subjunctive Up Close. I'm working with the first two at the same time--I've found that they supplement each other pretty well."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This is exactly what I needed to learn Spanish. I hate verbs and pronouns and love these books. I now feel confident with my grasp of the fundamentals of the language. I kept telling myself \\"just do it\\".

I sorta consider this book to be a marathon for my brain and the real rush comes when you finish!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"After struggling with Spanish for seven months in a Mexican language school, I found this book. It very clearly and effectively explains and teaches what I suspect is a ticklish aspect of most languages: prepositions and pronouns. It has helped me immensely, and it will help you, too. Gracias to Ms. Richmond, the author."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"Who would have thought that something with a title: Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions would actually be enjoyable. And yet this book was very enjoyable. I challenged myself by working on different sections whenever I had a spare 20 minutes or so. It beat working on a crossword puzzle, and learning Spanish is even practical."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I'm a first year spanish student. The curriculum has been moving kind of slow so I wanted to do some independent study. I bought this book and it has been so helpful I can't believe it.

It has advanced my study ten-fold."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"...This book is a STEAL.

Buy it, trust me."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book and the other book (Spanish Verb Tenses) by the same author are simply superb. It explains grammar with the clarity not known in text books or even in a class room. If you struggle with these key elements of the language, pick up these books and you will improve drastically.I found the last activity at the end of each section to be very beneficial, it is a translation activity wherein you translate a paragraph. It reinforces how to use the concepts you just learned on a whole and not just in individual simple sentences.Not to mention, every single answer is in the back of the book, a key feature that some self learning books seem to lack!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This is a workbook, it explains the information then requires that you use it in the book by doing the exercises. This is the best way to learn, by doing. I took the book to my Spanish class and the teacher already had it. I recommended it to the other students. I bought another workbook by the same author on Spanish verb Tenses because I liked her process so well. Five stars because I am learning more than I expected."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I have been studying Spanish for five years, for the most part independently, using CDs text books and other forms of learning tools. I had a good sense of the language and could converse in simple sentences, with a patient listener. The main reason I could not move forward at a greater pace was a lack of command of the subject matter contained in the book.I teach English to immigrants and my current student speaks it better than most. She can tell me when I make mistakes in Spanish, but cannot provide the rules (not many of us think of grammar rules after high school). This book does that and achieves it in a fashion that I think is so \\"right on\\" that one cannot go wrong.Thank you Ms. Richmond!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"Fantastic series!What kind of learner am I?I teach in a university-based adult education program, where many of my students are native Spanish speakers. My high school and college Spanish classes were a distant memory, but when I chose this book and its companions (complete grammar and verbs), I DID remember enough to communicate at a basic level. I've found this series excellent for improving my Spanish enough for my students to comment enthusiastically after a relatively short time. I have no instructor, but I learn well from books, and I already knew how to pronounce Spanish words. For someone else in my position, I can't recommend this series highly enough--it's the best I found after extensive searching, library loans, etc.Getting the most from this product:I also recommend getting all three books (complete grammar, pronouns/prepositions, and verbs) as I did. I've found that it's been helpful to work through a few sections in one book, switch to one of the others, and move ahead in similar jags through all three at once. I can tell when to switch by when I start to feel like I'm getting in over my head--I think it would be difficult to learn alone using just one of these.Another tip: This series is pure grammar, but there's plenty of culture and literature available free online. I've supplemented the books by reading Spanish-language newspapers online (my favorite seems to be the BBC/Latin America), pasting the text into www.freetranslation.com to check my reading as needed. Often, I've translated these in their entirety for practice (the free translation's enough to understand, but not a particularly good translation). I also found a Spanish-speaking penpal by visiting Spanish chatrooms, and write back and forth frequently as a way to practice my written Spanish. These activities have provided the learning richness that simple grammar texts aren't intended to offer.Who shouldn't use this?However, if (for example) you know no (or almost no) Spanish now or remember very little vocabulary, this would be a poor choice. It definitely assumes some level of familiarity with the language. Also, if you're an auditory learner or need a human instructor, you won't find it in this (or any other) text-only book."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This workbook is clear,concise, extremely helpful and well-conceived. It has enabled me to learn, relearn, review and master the simple things which we believe we know when in fact we don't. These serve as the basis for our daily conversations."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I purchased this book to use during the Christmas break in-between semesters of college-level Spanish 1 and 2. It proved to be an invaluable tool. I was able to complete about half the book before the second semester started. It wasn't too soon thereafter that I realized that practically all of the topics covered in my Spanish 2 class I had already learned in Dorothy Richmond's book. She presents each topic in a logical progression, going from the known to the unknown. Short explanations with examples are followed by pages of exercises (with the answers in the back of the book.) For any serious student of Spanish who wants to get a jump on the language or stay sharp over the summer in between courses, or in-between semesters, this book as well as her other two books (She has one on verbs and another on vocabulary) are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book , and all the other books by this author, have been indispensible aids in learning spanish for me. The instructions given in each lesson are written so that you can really learn how to write and speak spanish correctly. The explanations of language usage are far better than those given in any standard textbook that I have read. There are tons of exercises which you can do immediately after reading the lessons contained in each chapter, and the correct answers are given at the back of the book so that you can correct yourself immediately. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"Dorothy Richmond is so good at explaining grammar rules in a straight-forward manner. What I like most is that you're spending a lot more time doing exercises to use what you've learned than you are reading explanations. This book and the Verb Tenses book should be on every Spanish learner's bookshelf, no matter what level you're at. If you're thinking of buying it, just do it =) I have yet to go through her \\"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Vocabulary\\" book. I hope it's as great and helpful as her other books."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I am very pleased with the book.

It's really cheap, explains every important concept in a very simple way and includes lots of exercises to practice. I've been using this book since the summer after I finished my first year of Elementary Spanish at college. I think it was very useful, especially in my second year of Spanish when I still didn't understand many grammar concepts but was given a text book written entirely in Spanish. This workbook explains things very clearly in English, which is important for beginners. Now that I am close to fluent in Spanish, I still use this book now and again to look up things I'm fuzzy on, and I definitely plan to use it as a Teaching Assistant for students next year."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This comprehensive book is packed is with easy to follow instructional material for grasping the Spanish language. highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book is the single most helpful book I have found for learning Spanish.

I had to immediately give a review after I was able to determine when to use Por or Para with 100% sucess and no errors. I have been struggling with this for 2 years that my Spanish instruction had started.I would say that I am a 7 or 8/10, 10 being fluent Spanish and 8 being Business Spanish.

I have only just started working my way through it, but I like the way that the exercises are designed in such a way, that by constant repetition, the grammar really starts sinking in without having to stop and think about. I agree that pronouns and prepositions tend to be neglected in other books yet they are among those elements of Spanish grammar that constitute the major stumbling blocks for learners. The author is to be congratulated.My only reservation is that this is such a good book that I can't bring myself to write my answers in the spaces provided!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"It is an excellent book in the same format as the green one.

As a student of Spanish I have the hardest time learning when and how to use pronouns in Spanish. It seems so hard! Then I purchased this book, and things suddenly began to clear up. It's still not crystal clear, but now at least I understand when, why and how to use different pronouns even if I can't actually remember to do it. Despite the fact that some reviewers have noted about this book being geared toward Latin America, I still give the text 5 stars because for most non- native speakers of Spanish in the US the dialects you will come into contact with the most will be from Central and South America. So if pronouns and prepositions are making you crazy try this book out, I know it helped me and I am sure it will help you."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I am through the first 7 chapters of the book and have learned a great deal. This is a great book for beginners in Spanish classes or those that are trying to learn Spanish on their own.

This is quite a feat.A class of intermediate students of Spanish is always problematic because they come with disparate problems, although a few generalizations can be made. Ms. Richmond obviously comes at the problem from years of experience and in her book has addressed a wide variety of problems. One reviewer correctly points out, however, that she could have been a bit more mindful of the fact that many students using her book are doing so independently and thus her explanations need to be more thorough. For many students, this will not be a problem because they will be \\"thinking with the text\\" and will grasp her reasoning.This is a great point of departure for students in need of a review of all the most important aspects of Spanish grammar, but they will likely need much more in-depth work with three areas that no textbook or general grammar text can do because of space limitations.Sincerely,Eric W. Vogt, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I highly recommend getting all three books in this series as they work really well together.

Whether one wants to learn to write or to speak the language these exercises add to one's fluency.The exercise sentences and the paragraphs to be translated are often witty and never boring. I found this book particularly helpful as a supplement to totally auditory language courses, such as Pimsleur, where one never sees the actual spelling of words, or has explained the grammatical structure of the language.

Plus its not grossly overpriced like most textbooks."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This book and the other Practice-Makes-Perfect workbook by Dorothy Richmond (&quot;Spanish Verb Tenses&quot;) are the best Spanish books I've ever used. I just got back from 2 years in the Peace Corps in Honduras and I studied these books every day. They REALLY helped me learn more Spanish! In addition to the concise, easy-to-understand instruction sections, there's tons of exercises to do (with the correct answers in the back of the book) and as I did the exercises, I picked up all kinds of things that I'd been wondering how to say. I also liked this workbook a lot because it covered all those difficult things I never understood before, like how to use &quot;lo que..&quot;, direct and indirect object pronouns, the passive voice, the difference between &quot;para&quot; and &quot;por&quot;, and many other things. (This book is especially great if you already know some Spanish because you need some vocabulary to do the exercises, unless you don't mind looking up lots of words in the dictionary.) I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This review is going to be really simple. I completed the Spanish course at the State Department's Foreign Service Institute. But I couldn't have done it without this book.It is hands-down the best one on the market for Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions. And WHAT A VALUE!!!What's best? The authors leave enough space to write in the book. And at this price, you will want to write all over it. I have had less luck with workbooks that ask for a paragraph, but make you enter it in your own notebook.Also there is a good glossary at the end of the book so you can easily look up unknown words without having to lug your dictionary around.I can't say enough good. Buy it."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This workbook masters two important grammatical concepts that present difficulty for Spanish students. Thanks to the clarity and thoroughness of the text-workbook, students and those looking to perfectionize specific weaknesses in their understanding of pronouns and prepositions will immediately recognize that this book is an excellent resource. It is well organized, first tackling pronouns of all categories then prepositions with a strong emphasis on &quot;por&quot; and &quot;para&quot;. Each chapter offers a clear explanation of the topic at hand, followed by a wide variety of examples of its usage, ample practice exercises and a practical translation at the end of every chapter. Once having completed the exercises, there is an answer key at the back of the book which is extremely beneficial in that the student can readily identify his/her strengths and weaknesses. As a Spanish teacher, I found this text and the exercises to be a useful supplemenatary study aid that enables Spanish students at all levels to fortify their knowledge and understanding of the grammatical topics covered in the book. This workbook can also be an eternal reference. This is definitely a worthy purchase and very economical considering the wealth of information that is offered. A strong recommendation is given, this a great grammar resource."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions is a great book for practicing these often forgotten parts of speech that are critical for achieving fluency in Spanish. 14 units, 3-12 pages each, each cover a different use of pronouns in Spanish, and prepositions (especially por and para) likewise receive extensive coverage. Each unit opens with a bit of reading, but the practice starts quickly. The book's translation exercises are especially valuable for learning vocabulary and forming sentences in context. The answers to all the exercises are in the back, so you can get instant feedback on how well you are doing.I've noticed a problem with this text, however. While each unit includes at least several exercises, I feel that this is often not enough to gain a firm understanding of the material. With so many different uses of pronouns, for example, it is easy to forget the one done six units ago. And since the text teaches the uses of so many different prepositions, more practice with them would be helpful. As a result, I believe this book could be improved by including additional exercises in each unit, plus several review translation exercises that incorporate the content of multiple units.Even with this minor problem, this book is easily the best workbook that I've seen for learning Spanish pronouns and prepositions. And for $10, it's tough to go wrong (Spanish workbooks inferior to this that are used in my college cost $20-30 or more). Go ahead, buy it!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"For the price, this book can make a valuable contribution to everyone's goal of learning Spanish, but though I welcomed the practice, I did not feel the methodology was outstanding. For example, in each exercise you are basically limited to the grammatical point you have just read about so you don't really have to challenge yourself to recall what you learned 15 pages earlier. I think the translation exercises in the preposition section could have incorporated more pronouns to multiply practice, for example. So you finish the exercises using \\"lo que\\" and you think you have it, but that is usually because you do not revisit it later. There are no comprehensive exercises. In the preposition section there is much discussion distinguishing por and para, however in my mind I don't see much of a helpful distinction between one's purpose for doing something and one's motivation for doing something (which we are told is how you may to choose between the two in some instances). Also, we are told that when a person is receiving something from us use para, yet later many, many verbs are listed which require por and yet are defined as taking an action toward someone. Not surprisingly, despite all the theories we ultimately discover me must nevertheless memorize dozens of preposition-specific verbs anyway. If you finish the book you will see what I mean. This is not a fault of the author but a characteristic of the language. I especially like the perforated answer keys and wish other publishers would adopt the practice. The true/false sections are interesting reading at times, but take up a lot of the print allocated to exercises and should perhaps be condensed in future editions."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I used this book in a Spanish class given by a native Spanish speaker (yes, she was Spanish as in both the country and the language). She demonstrated NUMEROUS examples in the prepositions section where it's just not used that way in Spain. This book is written from a Central/South American perspective, yet that's not clearly stated, nor are the differences noted. Try taking your prepositions learned out of here into Spain and you may find yourself using them in a way that's funny to hear by native speakers...and worse, you could be misunderstood or misunderstand someone's directions.The pronoun sections are good and straightforward.I'm rating it four stars for its five-star pronoun section, and knocking off a point for the problems I noted above. Get it for the work on pronouns...you'll be glad you did (it's worth its cost for that, at least)."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I think that anyone interested in studying Spanish, especially if they want to study it on their own, should have this workbook as part of their repertoire. I have found it invaluable. I recommend it highly. (I have also purchased and studied her other workbook on Verb Tenses and the reviews for both books are similar.)I have given the book a 4 star rating rather than five for the following reasons:1. Lack of an index: I find it hard to comprehend how a contemporary academic book can be published without an index. There is a tremendous amount of valuable information contained in this book but being limited to the Table of Contents or to ones memory of where a specific item can be found is debilitating. This is a terrible ommission.2. There are times when the Author appears to have been in a rush and has not either given sufficient examples or explanations on why a particular rule was invoked. One is left to wonder if there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the point being made or if there is simply a typographical error. Those who are reading this book on their own, without the benefit of an instructor, would benefit greatly from some additional explanations (and cross references.) It is clear from the book's Acknowledgements page that Dorothy Richmond wrote this book because of the persistent nagging of her students to provide additional examples, but most readers will not be in her classroom, rather, they will be virtual students, highly dependent upon additional textual clarification."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"Stuck on por and para? Her explanations are so terrific that I could take a quiz in her book and not only get all 30 correct, but even be able to cite her &quot;rule&quot; for using the correct one. I have been struggling with por and para for 6 months and she is the first to make it crystal clear.The exercises are simply superb. Her explanations make things really clear, then you get to practice, practice, practice. As she moves through the book, she sprinkles in the things you learned in previous chapters, so you get to review again and again.She uses lots of vocabulary and even provides it for you so you don't have to be looking it up constantly. This books will really clarify pronouns and prepositions for you, but it will do much more, too, with all the vocabulary and sentence structure that you will get to practice.The book is well laid out, has lots of room to write in the answers, and has all the answers in the back. You will NEVER get a better value for your money than this book.

These are by far the best language books I've used. However, I'd studied Spanish before, so they may be too challenging for a beginner, especially if you don't feel you pick up language quickly. Explanations are brief and the focus is on examples and lots of practice. If you're good at acquiring language, these are perfect books for learning a lot of vocab and grammar rules quickly. If you prefer a slower pace or are just studying Spanish for the first time, you may be better off beginning with another series. This isn't your typical \\"Spanish for the traveler\\" beginner course with dialogues about ordering food, checking into a hotel, and doing other tourist stuff--that's why I like it, and why a lot of other people may be disappointed. If you want a lot of practice using Spanish to express all sorts of things, though, this is a great series. But, no matter who you are, don't do what I did--start with the pronouns and prepositions book, NOT the verb tenses one!"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I came to Spain last August with little or no knowledge of Spanish, other than what I'd learned to repeat from the Pimsleur CD series. I then took a one-month intensive Spanish course at a good language school on the Costa del Sol. In September, I moved to Barcelona and found that my crash course had given me an excellent foundation in communication in Spanish. But I was learning by the seat of my pants, never having taken any formal classroom instruction in Spanish grammar. Pronouns, prepositions and verb tenses in general were vexing me, and I felt stymied. Then I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas and started looking at grammar books. Dorothy Richmond's books were highly recommended by reviewers, including teachers of Spanish, and now I know why. In a clear, methodical way, this book (which I purchased with Richmond's \\"Spanish Verb Tenses,\\" which I also highly recommend)understandably and concisely explains the relevant grammatical rules, draws analogies to similar constructions in English, and leads the student through a progressive series of written exercises that neither leap ahead too quickly nor bore the student. I look forward to doing my lessons every day, and many mysteries of Spanish usage have been cleared up for me. I bought a second copy for my daughter, even though she's had years of high school Spanish and is far more fluent than I. This book is indispensable for both the intermediate learner and those wanting to sharpen their already acquired Spanish skills."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I'm using this with a teacher to learn Spanish, but could almost do it on myown with this book.

Very usefulThis handy book along with a fantastic CD course I purchased entitled Behind the Wheel Spanish have really gone far in improving my Spanish."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"I had studied Spanish for 8 years in school, and I never bothered much with learning prepositions or pronouns: such little words, what's the point in obsessing over them?After having left school, I started working for a company with a high number of Spanish speakers. When I would try to converse with my co-workers, I found myself getting tripped up on simple words. I knew what I wanted to say-- I knew the nouns, adjectives, and verbs-- but I just couldn't connect them all together to make a coherent sentence. It was really embarrassing because they are such basic words. Maybe my co-workers could still understand what I was saying, but I just did not feel comfortable with knowing that I was sounding like Tarzan.This book was exactly what I needed. It hones in on very specific types of pronouns and prepositions-- from the most basic (subject pronouns) to the more advanced (use of cuyo, lo que, RID formula, passive voice, etc.) to the downright tricky for English speakers (para vs por).After having gone through this book, I was surprised to have learned so much valuable information-- though I was also slightly embarrassed because I realized just how many mistakes I had been making when I conversed with fluent speakers. But I realize that that is part of speaking another language and trying to become bilingual: you have to make mistakes in order to learn. Sometimes the little things really do matter! As the writer explains in the book, unlike with nouns, adjectives, and verbs, there really is no way to get around expressing most pronouns and prepositions. Substitutes just don't work! You have to know them (and how to use them in sentences.)I would definitely recommend this book for intermediate students, or for more advanced students to use as a review. This book is probably not the best choice for beginners (you would definitely have to use a dictionary for all the exercises), but since the information is so valuable, I would recommend it for future use and reference."},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). This book is one in the highly praised Practice Makes Perfect series. Written by Dorothy Richmond, the author of many other great Spanish language books, the writing is light hearted and engaging despite the dry subject matter.Finding ways to make studying pronouns and prepositions more fun is a challenge, but one that the author succeeds at, creating a book that covers some of the more difficult and frustrating details of the Spanish language in a way that is both easy to understand and entertaining.Pronouns and prepositions often pose a problem to students of Spanish because they work quite differently than they do in English, and yet they are important for key concepts. Ignoring them or using them in the wrong way can change the meaning of your sentence, and leave the person you are trying to communicate with confused. While the words themselves may be small, for example \`lo', \`por' and \`mi', their impact on your fluency is big.There are many exercises provided to help you test how well you have grasped each concept, and these interactive lessons are a great way to practice your knowledge and apply what you have learned. Unlike some other text books, the book allows space for you to make notes and complete the exercises on each page, rather than needed to have a separate notebook. This makes it easy to carry around and use as a study tool wherever you go.Although the book assumes that you already have some Spanish vocabulary there is also a glossary at the back for easy reference if one of the exercises uses a word that you are unfamiliar with. The translation text exercises at the end of each section provide interesting vocabulary, and strengthen your understanding of how the element is put into practice.This book is not designed for complete beginners, who may get bogged down and overwhelmed by the in depth explanations of each grammatical element, but is a great resource for intermediate students who already have a good grasp of basic Spanish grammar and want to perfect their use of pronouns and prepositions.All of the explanations are clear and the book is laid out in a logical order, making it easy to follow. If you are trying to get over these particular stumbling blocks on your way to fluency then this book is a good resource.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish."},{"Title":"Blues for a Black Cat and Other Stories (French Modernist Library)","review":"In Blues for a black cat, Boris Vian's literary genius shines with rare intensity impossible to find in modern works. While I read a few of Vian's works in the past, revisiting this book was the perfect escape from the mundane world of today's literature. Without getting into any plot or revealing too much about this compilation of short stories, Blues for a black cat, is an insane, entertaining, humorous, profound, powerful avant-garde literary rarity. Vian's style remains unique decades after the original publication, and while seemingly incoherent on the surface, it is intentionally so. Vian plays with words and objects, breathing life into them, making them take on a life vastly different from what we are used to, changing directions and staying on track at the same time, and inserting a deep incision in to our consciousness. Through humor, Vian touches upon uneasy topics -- shallow interpersonal communications, lack of spirituality, empty lives... and above all, our humanity. Humanity, with its faults, seems to be a common thread throughout Vian's works (at least those I had the chance to read). The list of subjects in this book will be too long, but one story will forever remain, in my opinion, one of the best short stories written about WWII (or any war for that matter) -- Pins and Needles.As Vian himself says: \\"Routine dulls impressions.\\" Readers be assured, there is nothing dull about his writing. His prose is full of gems, his ramblings are amusing, his literary rebellion is unrepeated by the generations of writers that came after him. While not pure surrealism, his approach to reality, to make the most mundane breathe with a new life, is fascinating.Julia Older's excellent translation finally brings this important piece to the English speaking audiences.Blues for a black cat would be a great sample of Vian's work for those not familiar with this author."},{"Title":"Hiking guide to Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area","review":"This book does a great job mapping out trails and providing day trip recommendations.

It can be a bit dry at times, but it's very good.There are a lot of complex, deep ideas as well as a few more obvious themes dealing with morality, politics, science, and society in general.

My brother took a summer junior high class on science and sci-fi at Northwestern University and it was his required reading, but he kept having to come nag me to get it back. After his class ended I stole it and literally read it to pieces (on my second copy now and it's looking a bit tattered as well). Asimov quickly became one of my favorite authors and I ravenously devoured his entire Bibliography.Robot Dreams is a collection of sci-fi short stories dealing with robots, AI, aliens, etc. but always, the human condition. Every story ended with me sitting quietly pondering the gravity of the moral or flying to my parents for more information or extended discussion.My favorites from the collection are The Last Question, Lightverse, Hostess, The Last Answer, Spell My Name With An S, and The Machine That Won The War, but they're all incredible. Anyone looking for an intro to sci-fi, look no further. Anyone already in love with sci-fi but unaware of this collection, put it at the top of your to-read list. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"I am an avid Isaac Asimov fan but with full time school and almost full time job I have little time for entertainment reading. These short stories are the perfect solution."},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"ROBOT DREAMS is a collection of 21 Isaac Asimov short stories. Going into the book, I has assumed - based on the title - that this was a set of his robot stories. It turns out that it gets its name from one of the stories in the collection, but that the rest are a mostly random collection of Asimov's science fiction work.I've read my share of Asimov \\"Best of\\" collections, so many of the stories here I had encountered before. Still, for me there was a nice mix of pieces I'd read and fiction that was new. The main thing lacking in this particular book is that other times I've read these stories, Asimov would have written an introduction for each story, giving information on the history of its publication and any pieces of trivia he felt like sharing. In this book, there is only a single introduction for the front of the book, not for each individual work.There are several stand-outs. The title story is quite good. \\"The Last Question\\"/\\"The Last Answer\\" are not explicitly related despite their similar titles but touch on similar themes of mankind's relationship to God. \\"Eyes Do More Than See\\" is still haunting, many years after reading it for the first time. \\"Spell my Name with an S\\" is darkly funny, and probably as close as Asimov ever got to being Douglas Adams. \\"The Ugly Little Boy\\" has actually improved with age (or my ability to appreciate it has grown stronger in the previous years).The unique addition to this particular edition are the illustrations by Ralph McQuarrie who is most famous for his design work on the original Star Wars trilogy. It's good stuff. I don't know if anyone other than a collector would buy the book solely for the pictures, but they're quite nice drawings which add a nice little flavor to the stories.As I said, there really isn't an overall theme in this collection outside of the very general label of science fiction (there are, for example, no Black Widowers stories). The stories here are very typical of Asimov. Of course, virtually everything I've read of Asimov's is very typical of Asimov; the man was remarkably consistent. So, if you like Asimov, pick this up. If you don't, avoid it. And if you're unfamiliar, this is as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"This is a great collection of Asimov's best short stories.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"A pretty good collection, part of a pair based around the Robot stories, with some others included.

I'm also glad that the author wrote the book into a collection of short stories, than rather a full length novel. A lot of the story's worked in a similar world, with repeating concepts and rules; the first rule of robotics is for a robot to not harm its maker, human. The second rule is that a robot must always follows its masters orders, and the third is for a robot to have self preservation. So the reader would not be jumping into an entirely new world every time a new short story started.I don't want to bring up any of the situations in the book as not to spoil it, but I will say that there where very vivid details and allot of colorful writing in it.A lot of the stories were so inspiring and well thought out, I think some of the situations portrayed in the book may well happen in the future if technology was advanced to that point. I think a lot of the ideas are fairly realistic too. maybe some day we will look back on this book and think how could some one who lived so long ago be so smart.I don't want to bring up any of the situations in the book as not to spoil it, but I will say that there where very vivid details and allot of colorful writing in it. this book is a real page turner, it's very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"The book is excellent.

They are the first two, and the first one is also a story from _I, Robot_ (which I just re-read). The second one is &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; from which the book takes its title, and it is another Susan Calvin robot story like those from _I, Robot_ but was written in the mid-'80s (_I, Robot_ was written 30 years earlier). It is in the same mold with the earlier stories, but with a nod to advancing technology (small computers, for instance).Many other stories in this collection center on &quot;Multivac,&quot; an immense computer. The name is an obvious derivative of UNIVAC, a large, vacuum-tube based computer of the early 1950s. UNIVAC became famous for predicting that Eisenhower would win the 1952 election based on early returns (against pundit predictions that Stevenson would win). That led directly to one story, &quot;Franchise,&quot; which takes the ability to sample a small number of votes to predict a total election outcome and drives the idea to an absurd (but nevertheless interesting) extreme.There are a variety of other stories, from ones dealing with beings without bodies to one talking about an alien medical investigator who has come to Earth to find out more about a disease. All are worth the read, and some are truly fascinating and end in very unexpected ways.Ralph McQuarrie provides the cover illustration and several others for individual stories; they are of the style familiar to anyone who has seen original art from &quot;Star Wars&quot; (which he worked on). Asimov's introduction is amusing; he explains what he got right in predicting the future--and what he got spectacularly wrong.

I read it in between his robot novels and Foundation novels, and it holds its own quite well against those.Only one of the stories is in any other collection I know of. &quot;Jokester,&quot; &quot;The Billiard Ball,&quot; and &quot;The Last Answer&quot; are some excellent ones, but I agree that &quot;The Last Question&quot; (as it is named in my book; not &quot;Final Question&quot;) is the best story I have ever read.

I ordinarily hesitate to sing the praises of something on the assumption that there might be something out there that I haven't read that is better; however, The Final Question is without any shadow of a doubt, the best short story I have ever read.Let me elucidate. Starting with the seemingly innocuous question, &quot;Can entropy be reversed?&quot;, Asimov proceeds, in a style all his own, to turn the reader's world upside down. When you've finished this story, you can do nothing but close the cover and sit and think for a while. In a piece that is a textbook example of the way a short story should be written, Mr. Asimov somehow manages to address that most basic of all questions, &quot;What is the nature of our Universe, and by extension, what is the nature of ourselves?&quot;As an avid reader on all subjects, I enjoy being challenged by what I read but, speaking politely, the climax of this story, barely more than 15 pages in length, knocked me flat on my behind. No story I have read, before or since, has managed to turn life's basics quite so much on their ear as did this one.I read somewhere that Mr. Asimov always felt that this was his favourite piece of writing, and I have no problem understanding why.Read it...If you thought your world was dark before, I guarantee that &quot;The Final Question&quot;, indeed, all of &quot;Robot Dreams&quot;, will shed some light on the subject.Sincerely,Tony Hoffmann"},{"Title":"Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)","review":"This is a fine collection of the Good Doctor's tales.

Some of them are indifferent, but two of Asimov's own favorites are here: \\"The Last Question\\" (my own choice for his very best short story ever) and \\"The Ugly Little Boy\\".

The I, Robot and Bicentennial Man stories are all also included in The Complete Robot.Robot Dreams, as others have pointed out, is actually a well-rounded compendium and has only a few robot stories.

The book is comparable to a rather dry but insightful tour of Dante's Florence, full of the scholars, mob leaders, artists and warlord rulers who were backdrop to the poet's work. We see, for example, Shah Shoja Mozaffari, who conquered Shiraz in 1353 and subjected it's vibrant people to harsh control, closing the bars, opium houses and brothels -- at which Hafez wrote:They have closed the tavern doors.O God don't let them open the doors to the house of deceit and hypocrisy.If they have closed them for the sake of the selfish ascetic,be strong, for they will open them for the sake of GodWhere many works focus on Hafez himself, here we have a focus on his dramatic surroundings. The citations of poetry are sparing, but more powerful for Limbert's context. Like China's Li Po but more saintly, this hard-drinking, huge hearted Hafez gives voice to Iran's real soul, in verses which still rankle the country's rulers:Everyone, whether drunk or sober, seeks the beloved.Every place, whether it be mosque or synagogue, is the house of love.--author of Correcting Jesus: 2000 Years of Changing the Story"},{"Title":"Shiraz in the Age of Hafez (Publications on the Near East)","review":"I'm from Shiraz and I love Hafez.

Likewise, it would be a circular argument to say that anyone who finds Bloom's stance self-defeating is merely an anxious ephebe trying to justify their own mediocrity, to dissemble their own belatedness, to obscure the deeper issues of poetic originality.Or would it?I've been ridiculed for saying this, but *The Anxiety of Influence* is a very harsh, very difficult little book. And yes, most writers *do* tend to shrug it off with defensive laughter and glib overconfidence. \\"Bloom's theories don't apply to me, after all. *I* don't feel the anxiety of which he speaks. I'm as young as Adam in the literary Garden of Eden, and my work is as important and worthwhile as I wish it to be.\\" Thus tolls the death-knell of the M.F.A. student in Creative Writing.Bloom's vision of the Canon has nothing to do with a required list of books, with the \\"carrion-eaters\\" of Tradition, paying uncritical knee-tribute to precedents and precursors. Bloom is simply reminding us that literature is not created in a vacuum of Edenic self-deception (the bland, cheeky optimism of the writing workshop), but rather in the poetomachia of the solitary apprentice testing himself against the creations of the past and present, a gladiatorial dialogue with the collective personae of Anteriority. In other words, the greatest literature is in competition with *itself*, an internalized version of the Canon that each strong poet carries within. The competition is both loving and malicious, and the \\"precursor\\" is always a composite of texts and artists, including contemporary authors fighting for imaginative and thematic territory, spurring each other on to higher achievements while stampeding the fallen.For polemical purposes, Bloom simplifies the \\"composite precursor\\" in his reading of the English Romantics, testing themselves against the canonical strangeness of one John Milton. By casting the Miltonic Satan as the modern poet *in extremis*, Bloom creates a critical mythology as compelling as it is melodramatic, working through the byzantine evasions and torque-laden inversions the ephebe undertakes to carve out an imaginative space for himself. The \\"revisionary ratios\\" are derived from the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, conceptualizing poetic creation as a heroic self-purgation and regeneration, achieving originality with an apparent loss of power, then returning to the fold for fresh melee and assimilative combat. Bloom's conscious objective is TO MAKE THE POET'S JOB MORE DIFFICULT, the smash complacency where it lives, in the Eliotic idealizations of \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\\", which argues (catastrophically, in Bloom's view) that poetry is the benign and empyreal handing-down of the Muse's wedding-band from precursor to ephebe. But as Bloom persuasively argues, Eliot's stuffy and pretentious election of Dante as his true poetic father desperately obscures his true debts to Tennyson and Whitman, and his poetry may be weaker as a result. The casualties of Eliot's \\"poetic pacifism\\" lie forgotten in the charnel-house of unknown soldiers who've mistaken academic careerism for the deeper mysteries of canonical anguish, who've taken the low road of insularity against the combative \\"wakening of the dead.\\"To suggest that this sort of gladiatorial perspectivizing is \\"self-defeating\\" is rather like calling Nietzsche a \\"nihilist\\" because he chose to philosophize with a hammer -- that is, dedicated himself to scraping away all the evasions, the happy-go-lucky subterfuge -- to provide a more truthful genealogy of art and creativity and, more importantly, an Ethics on precisely what is required of writers (born this late in history) pretending to canonical strength. *TAoI* is as Nietzschean a text as you will find, a polemical kick in the stomach, brutal in its necessities, staring deep into the horizon of literature and conceptualizing the intra-poetic psychic warfare of poets WHO WILL NOT DIE. It is a nail-bomb thrown into the seminar-room of creative writing workshops, exploding the glib complacency of young writers who've forgotten that Time is unforgiving in its choice of literary survivors.To put it another way, Bloom never says that originality doesn't exist, only that our idealized, Eliotic perceptions of originality are immature and self-defeating, an excuse not only to *be* mediocre (as young as Adam at the dawn of Creation), but to revel in and celebrate that mediocrity. That said, those who are coddled by Academe will probably find Bloom's book vulgar, incomprehensible, melodramatic, even paranoid in its implications. While others, stoically self-critical, will find themselves reading a completely different book, and a glorious one at that.As the previous reviewer suggested, there may be room enough in the academic industry for a communal fellowship of writers and teachers, but there is an important qualitative difference between the respectable productions of, say, a Mark Van Doren, and the monstrous achievements of canonical prowess Bloom examines here. Mediocrity needs to justify itself, to make excuses for its smug complacency, but just as 99.9% of our generation's literature is \\"written in water,\\" so the canonical survivors of the future will be forced to take even more extreme measures to be remembered, to stand in the square where martyrs are made. Bloom's book, in essence, attempts to dramatize and account for these \\"extreme measures.\\"*The Anxiety of Influence*, for all its conceptual flummery and Rube Goldberg convolutions, stands today as a brilliant thought-experiment on the lengths genius will go to stamp itself in bronze, to carry on and flourish in a universe of Death (or its literary equivalent, Compromise). Even if you find his main argument pedantic and repulsive, Bloom provides dozens of pyrotechnic micro-arguments in each chapter, not to mention some brilliant and provocative readings of classic poetry. Bloom is a great talker and showman, and those who dismiss his theories as frivolous poppycock may still be charmed by his brash, Hazlittean personality. The important thing is to take the time to understand where Bloom is coming from, and not to project one's own anxieties onto this difficult and rewarding text."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Yes Bloom is a great and inspiring critic, a great creator himself. Yes, Bloom's work is filled with tremendously interesting insights into Literature,remarkable unexpected connections between creators who seemed so distant from each other.No, Literature does not follow the simple law of progression, or the simple Law of a creator's strong reaction to the strong creators before. There are figures in Literature who in some way seem to be reacting to no one( Hopkins is one good example) and figures whose whole discourse is in absorbing the creation of others not to transcend them but to celebrate them.( Borges) There are also creators who however they may be influenced by others, as Kafka was influenced by Dickens and perhaps Kierkegaard, have such a unique way of seeing the world that they seem to be born of themselves. In Literature it is not necessary always to stand on the shoulders of Giants much less knock the Giant down if one is to move forward.The laws of literary creation are as mysterious and individual as the next new voice which comes to the world. Quixote may over- ride the romantic chivalrous literature Cervantes parodies but he does this in a comically humane way that no one before or since has or could surpass."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"No, Bloom's book is not fun in the traditional sense of the word; rather, it is a fun way to peer into the psychological tropes that govern poetic composition and an enjoyable method to use when analyzing poetic texts. I used the book as a foundation for writing a paper about John Milton's influence on 18th-century English poet Thomas Gray, and each stage of poetic growth that Bloom discusses provides endless possibilities for explicating the meta-textual meanings of any poem when placed in context to its predecessors. Bloom's writing style is highly erudite and may seem dauntingly academic at first, but his ideas are often very clear and proceed in a highly logical manner (despite various tangents about the origins of Bloom's chosen terms).The book may require more than one close reading to fully understand Bloom's dense and complex theory, but in each read, one finds more passages fulfill the book's overarching thesis. The book may not be of much use to someone who is not interested in poetry or literary studies, but worth a read if you're into studying poetry or literary critical theory of any type. Bloom is also one of our century's most important (if debated) critics, and should be required reading for all interested in English literature and theory."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"I have previously described myself in a review as the most spaced-out poet on the planet, without describing the awful legal context in which such a view of myself is absolutely necessary. This book makes the context clear, but a general reader still might not understand how concrete this difficulty is because THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE is overtly a book about poetry, and hardly at all about exercising judgment. The page of the book where I left it open the longest, and where the book subsequently opened most easily, and which I read most often in the five weeks in which I was interested in this book, was page 58, which describes a poet who \\"experiences anxiety necessarily towards any danger that might end him as a poet.\\" Without dwelling on the personalities of the people involved, it seems to me that the anxiety which this book is about is clearest in the case of the presidential election of 2000, in which the ability of the Florida Supreme Court to act as the ultimate judges of that opportunity to count ballots was subject to the power of the United States Supreme Court to judge the election in some way which would produce a result which would be opposite to what a majority of the Florida Supreme Court desired. (...)and poets can be much more open about what they are doing than judges, so it isn't too surprising that this book is about poets.Freud and Nietzsche form a nice frame of reference for what is happening in this book. I kept looking for mentions of Rilke, which wasn't fruitful until page 99, the first page on \\"Daemonization or The Counter-Sublime.\\" There it says, \\"History, to Rilke, was the index of men born too soon, but as a strong poet Rilke would not let himself know that art is the index of men born too late. . . . the dialectic between art and art, or what Rank was to call the artist's struggle against art . . . governed even Rilke, who outlasted most of his blocking agents, for in him the revisionary ratio of daemonization was stronger than in any other poet of our century.\\" There is a page just before page 99 which quotes Emerson on the highest truth about all things going well, \\"long intervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account.\\" (p. 98). Emerson shows up again on page 138, with the idea, \\"Who seem to die live,\\" to precede the final section of the book, \\"Apophrates or The Return of the Dead.\\" This part doesn't relate well to law, particularly for a system which keeps thinking that a judgment like the death penalty might be considered final at some point."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"There are some books which are difficult to grasp and understand fully because of their complex content and others because they are poorly written. For me, this falls into the former category. I think this is an important book far beyond the study of literature and poetry. I was first alerted to it in a book by Richard Rorty who drew on it for broader philosophical and cultural insights and that is where I see its value. I have no idea if it works as a \\"theory\\" of poetry but it certainly captures one important aspect of the challenge of cultural and individual change and growth, namely that sometimes both societies and individuals feel the weight of their precursors as inhibiting. Bloom puts this challenge very vividly: it is \\"the horror of finding oneself to be only a replica, a copy; or becoming only a reader, i.e. drowning in the precursors.\\" Is this perhaps why we readers feel we must write these reviews?"},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Harold Bloom is an erudite and scholar writer and professor and his critic of literature, the formation of a writer, a strong writer in his own words, is contained in this &quot;box of Pandora&quot; that is the name i choose for The Anxiety of Influence, the most important book i've read concerning this theme: what is an author, the formation of an author, the agon with the older writers, specially Shakespeare and the anxiety, the enormous anxiety and suffering for becoming a strong author, an agon, the internal struggle of the writer.

But be prepared--this isn't fast food, it's highly charged and fibrous nutrition--it may lead to literary obsession and an overfed intellect.When I start a Bloom book, I always say, \\"Cheers.\\""},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Harold Bloom, borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis, interprets the poet's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic Oedipal struggle, arguing that the (\\"belated\\") poet's literary productions result from a conflict with a \\"strong\\" father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the \\"repression\\" of his own poetic self and the strong misreading (or \\"misprision\\", as Bloom calls it) of the work of a predecessor. Bloom's conception of the \\"canon\\" is a hierarchical, continuous and genealogical model of direct succession, as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities, ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency, opening his text to the strong aura of the canon, and testing his productions against it. However, Bloom's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence, belatedness and originality, and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously. This admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial. Another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of &quot;influence&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness, for the poet cannot be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching. Bloom's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents, and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works, reflects the postmodern &quot;fin-de-millennium&quot; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted, and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works, but merely repeat the past. Not only are his conclusions totally untenable, but his whole treatise, on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents, fails to provide for a more dynamic, more forward-moving (as opposed to reversing, revising and troping) theory of poetry, a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully. It would be interesting to discover what Bloom would make of Henry Adams's remark: \\"Everything is respectable and nothing amusing. There are no outlaws.\\""},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Prof. Bloom writes in a very difficult style and his conceptual leaps are sometimes difficult to follow. But if you love great poetry, it is certainly worth struggling against his erudition to find what lies beneath, a true love of language."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Behind the impenetrable language lies ignorance. On page 115 Bloom writes: \\"Hence Nietzsche, lovingly recognizing in Socrates the first master of sublimation, found in Socrates also a destroyer of tragedy. Had he lived to read Freud, Nietzsche might somewhat admiringly have seen in him another Socrates...\\"Where did Nietzsche \\"lovingly recognise in Socrates the first master of sublimation\\"? The answer -- nowhere. It has become fashionable to attribute to the philosopher any provocative or unusual opinion, or to use him as a back-up for the author's poorly conceived idea.Nietzsche had an agonistic relationship with Socrates whom he accused of the \`tyranny of reason' (in Twilight of the Idols, among others) and charged with the death of tragedy. His attitude to other one-time idols (e.g. Schopenhauer, Wagner) was similar: combative reverence. Nietzsche was gravely preoccupied with \`self-birthing' and the \`right of priority'; that meant, figuratively speaking, killing anyone whom he had deeply loved and worshipped in order to assert the 'independence of the soul'. Hardly surprising, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar was his most revered play (read his own account in The Gay Science, II: 98). Indeed, as Kaufmann aptly observed, Nietzsche had a sort of \`Brutus complex'. Here was an opportunity to label it all as \`the anxiety of influence', the opportunity Bloom sorely missed! For one of the most insightful treatments of Nietzsche-Socrates ambivalent dynamics I suggest reading Bertram's \`Nietzsche'.Would Nietzsche have admired Freud as \`another Socrates'? Certainly not! Even with all his love of agon, he wouldn't insult Socrates by making such comparison. Asserting that toddlers plot to kill their fathers in order to bed their mothers, as Freud did, borders on delusion. \`Passing by in silence' would have been Nietzsche's likely treatment of him. Bloom's uncritical admiration for Freud's pseudoscience says more about Bloom than it does about Freud. Not to mention the fact that Freud plagiarised so many of Nietzsche's and Schopenhauer's concepts, while publically denying that he had ever read their works. Of this, I imagine, Bloom is also ignorant."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"People such as Camper-Mann simply don't understand Bloom's ground-breaking book. It is not a typical academic piece of theorizing. Bloom begins with his own aesthetic responses, and discovers that writers who came later in a tradition have a real difficulty finding an original vision or creating original work. Bloom then tries to work out a theory to account for this.At no point does Bloom suggest that a deterministic process is at work here. The great poets defy determinism and struggle against it. It was not pre-ordained that John Milton would appear in the 2nd generation after Shakespeare. Milton's own creative will carved out a place for him among the great poets. However, Milton appeared after the greatest poet in the language, and his attempt to stand up to the Shakespearean achievement had a massive impact on his poetry. In the same way, Wordsworth and Shelley wrote differently for having read and absorbed Milton. These are historical facts that Bloom tries to account for.As for T.S. Eliot, he was profoundly influenced by Walt Whitman's poetry, but turned back to Christian ideas in a way that Whitman and other modern poets had refused to do. That is what's wrong with Eliot's work. Christianity is not a very profound source for poetic inspiration in the modern age."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"Harold Bloom's _Anxiety of Influence_ is a must read for any student of literary theory, just so you know where he stands in theories of modern poetry.

It's major flaw is that it doesn't even attempt to account for female poets(although Bloom recognizes Emily Dickinson as one of the strong modern poets)."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry","review":"David Bloom is probably the leading proponent of literary influence theory, and his thoughts have even spilled over into other arts (specifically into music -- see Mark Evan Bonds's AFTER BEETHOVEN and Joseph Straus's REMAKING THE PAST, for example); but his four books on influence are esoteric, to say the least. References require such a vast knowledge of poetry, literature, mythology, et al that his writings are beyond the casual reader. If you want to sink your teeth into something substantial, even controversial, start here!"},{"Title":"A Ready-Made Life: Early Masters of Korean Fiction","review":"A Ready-Made Life is a collection of translations of Korean short stories written during the 1920s and 1930s, a period when Koreans writers and intellectuals were just beginning to experiment with the short story form. The collection offers a diversity of stories whose styles range from comedy to romance to politics. Korean is a very difficult language to translate into English but Fulton and Kim do a good job of capturing the Korean authors' styles of expression. The only weakness of this volume is that it sometimes doesn't provide much explanation for certain peculiarities present in the stories. For instance, characters in some of the stories included in the volume have one letter names such as &quot;P&quot; or &quot;M&quot;. I was left curious as to whether Korean authors actually had a common practice of using Roman letter names for their characters or whether these letter-names were somehow derived from Korean by the translators. Yet this is a minor defect that could be corrected by a few explanatory footnotes. Takes as a whole, this book provides a good introduction to Korean literature from a period that has been neglected by Koreanists in both Korea and the United States."},{"Title":"The Beatles Book Of Lists","review":"Spignesi's BEATLE BOOK OF LISTS is written with a real sense of fun and enjoyment. It chronicles various minutiae to be found in the careers and music of the Fab Four, sometimes quirky but always amusing. Unfortunately, there are some apparent inaccuracies in some of the information recorded (most glaringly in a reference to the date of John Lennon's wedding and the birth of his son Julian) which tends erode some of the author's credibility. Generally though, a sense of fun permeates the pages, and the author's respect and appreciation for the Beatles is evident throughout. THE BOOK OF BEATLE LISTS is certainly a worthy addition to a Beatle collector's library, and a good book to have as a reference for Beatle trivia questions."},{"Title":"The Beatles Book Of Lists","review":"This is a comprehensive and witty book full of info about the Beatles. Each section is seperated and every fact is easy to find. I guarantee, even die hard fans like me will learn something new!"},{"Title":"The Beatles Book Of Lists","review":"I think it could have been a little more intestering. The almost day by day account gets a little boring after you have been on it for &quot;months&quot;. Also, the author put too much disbelief into the Paul is Dead thing. It is much more fun when the author believs it themself, and puts much more detail into the clues."},{"Title":"Cruisers of the U.S. Navy, 1922-1962","review":"It's too bad that Cruisers of the U.S. Navy, 1922-1962 is out of print, as this is one of most indispesible modeler's references available. The author is a renowned German naval historian whose speciality is the US Navy(!) and all of his books are meticulously researched.All the cruisers from the Omaha class to the Long Beach, the first nuclear powered cruiser built (and depending on your viewpoint, the last purpose built cruiser of the US Navy, as the Aegis cruisers were originally designated as destroyers-see Friedman's excellent study) are included. All details, including armament fit, camo schemes worn, electronics, ships careers and final disposition are included.The photographs included are good for the most part and include enough photos not seen elsewhere. Stefan Terzibaschitsch has one of the largest collections of US Navy photos in Europe and this shows in the book. One useful photo is a camouflaged USS Vincennes (sp?) shortly before her sinking in 1942. All drawings are 1/1250 scale (standard scale for miniature warship models in Europe)but are clear enough for most modelers. One interesting drawing is that of the USS Phoenix in her later guise as the Argentine General Belgrano, which was sunk by the Royal Navy during the Falklands War."},{"Title":"Cruisers of the U.S. Navy, 1922-1962","review":"Was very pleasantly surprised by this book. I had purchased the author's earlier book on U.S. battleships, and while good it didn't reach the level of this one.Every class is covered, with the important ones, like the Northhampton receiving additional pages. Each member of its respective class gets a full chronology of its service, re-fits, and eventual fate. All the essential info is there, included armament and radar equipment configuration, very important to a modeler and naval historian. Perhaps not as in depth as Friedman's treatise on the same subject, but unlike that one, this doesn't read like an encyclopedia and contains much more photos than Friedman's. Terzibaschitsch shows his well-rounded knowledge, which has been improved by better editing than his previous works, and in my opinion delivers a higher bang for the buck, by providing the most beautiful photos anyone can hope for. Some of them, make that quite a few, I have only seen on this book. From official naval yard to private sources, this is a professional reference on U.S. Cruisers. The bulk of the book is on WWII subjects, not much on the newer designs, but that's the title of the book, thru 1962.Worth $100 or more, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"wow. this book was terrible. melanie's character was terrible. the plot was terrible. the writing was terrible. jinx was terrible. i'm so glad that this trend was no repeated in following books, which have been a HUGE and welcome improvement.even though the series still stumbles, i've been buying these books for 11 years and will continue to do so. i hope that the editors reconsider their decision to end the series."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"Unbridled Fury was a great book. But i agree with another reviewer about the whole famous horse thing...it was ok the first time but it seems they have been doing it almost every book now! its getting kinda old. Anyway, i think its great that melanie was able to find another horse to work with. although it seems to me like they are just re creating another image. Alot of the things that jinx did, image did too. Even melanie said that...(when jinx broke away from his handlers and raced away on the track). Image did the same thing when melanie saw her. that kinda gave me the impression that they couldnt think of something else for jinx and they made him do whatever image did. idk....anywhoo this was a great book and i recommend it to anyone who has read the TB series."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"Okay, I think that this was one of the worst, most dreadful books in the TB Series. I didn't like the plot, characters, or Jinx. But I guess I'll give an overall review of this book:It all starts out with Melanie & Christina riding at Belmont Park. Mel's real bored and there's alot of ranting from her about how sad she is because her special, precious horse Perfect Image will never be racing again, and there's no other special horse for her to work with or to look forward to. So when she goes back home to Kentucky, she goes to some old fancy party, trying to score up some rides. While there, she hears someone talking about some sale at a farm, and she gets all excited when she hears that there's a horse related to Seabiscuit from there. So the next day, she goes to see a big, chestnut 2 year old colt named Hi Jinx [who is related to Seabiscuit.] And then the colt nearly runs over her, and then bolts on the track riderless really fast, and Mel instantly falls in love w/ him because of his 'awesome' speed.So she and Jazz agree to buy him, but when Jinx gets to Whitebrook, he starts behaving absolutely terribly, and ruins his stall, bites the grooms, and throws Melanie off when she tries him on the track, and later on chips a horse named Fast Gun's bone, and her aunt Ashleigh tells her she can't keep Jinx @ Whitebrook 'cause he's too much trouble, and Melanie starts crying and all that drama. But, in the end, Jinx turns out to be the perfect horse when Mel just lets him do what he wants on the track.So that's pretty much it. Like I said, I didn't like the book one bit, but I'll still continue to read the TB Books, I just REALLY hope the authors can come up w/ something better."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"All right! Finally a horse descened from the greatest horse ever, Man O' War! I really like how High Jinx looks like Man O' War too. I hope the auther will let him win the Triple Crown! The one thing I don't like is that on the back cover it says he looks like Seabiscut, who is a bay, while Man O' War was a fire red chestnut, like Jinx."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"First of all, I have not yet read this book, so don&#65533;t get excited! I&#65533;m an Aussie and our TB books are much slower over here, the most recent release at the moment it Hoofprints in the Snow!But to my point: I just wanted to comment that I am very disappointed at the latest attempt at the authors of TB (Can&#65533;t keep track of them) at attract audiences to their book. I.e., the use of horses with bloodlines tracing back to famous thoroughbred. Sure, it would work once, maybe even twice, but it&#65533;s starting to get old now. I mean, it&#65533;s just too obvious an attempt when you start bringing in references like Seabiscuit, who has recently been in a movie and as such will have exposed the general public to wider knowledge of him. Enough, guys, you&#65533;ve done it to death! The photos are ok, nothing wrong with including one of those &#65533; but stop the references!In other news, I&#65533;m looking forward to the next few TB books, watch out for my reviews ;)Chris"},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"I loved this book!

And now Melanie isn't acting so bratty anymore.Melanie needs to find a new horse to race since her filly, Perfect Image is injured. She doesn't think she'll ever find another horse like Image again. But that's all about to change. One day she meets a beautiful chestnut colt named Hi Jinx, a direct descendant of the famous Seabiscuit! So Melanie buys him.But when he gets to Whitebrook, Hi Jinx starts acting up! I won't tell you the ending, but Jinx finally behaves at the ending.One thing though, in the book, Jinx is a chestnut horse. But on the cover, he looks more like a bay. Look, the books are good, but the covers could improve."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"I agree with another reviewer-- ENOUGH famous horses. I do like the bios (the Romance horse was good in Parker's Passion-- I always liked eventing a smidgen better) but the references are a tad too much, especially when some of them aren't correct. Wasn't Flag's Up Farm the farm where Alleged was trained? The Roberts farm? I don't recall all of it's stock being shipped off... and was it even in Kentucky?:sBut I do like the Melanie is getting a new horse. I was fearful that the series would be ending! The one thing I am starting to miss about TBs is their realism. In the first few (1-20) there was so much about the racer's times and running style... and that's starting to disappear. Still, it's one of the best realistic horse fiction out there, so thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"This book was pretty good, it was a little flash backie, but worth the wait to get back to the accual story. I agree with some of the other reviewers that theirs a couple too meny horses with a famous backgrounds in this series. I was disapointed when I read one of the other reviewers remark on how they thought that the author ran out of ideas for Hi Jynx's personality and made it just like images when the whole book was about how Meliny treated him like image when he wan't."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"For all Thoroughbred lovers, I personally loved Hi Jinx more than Image, I don't know why. He made me think of Native Dancer, my favorite racehorse. But what is happenin between Mel and Jazz?? For some reason i think Mel is startin to like Kevin again. Its 2 bad though, I like Jazz. I never liked Kevin or Dylan. But read this book- I agree that the whole 'famous bloodlines' thing is annoying, but otherwise this is a pretty great book."},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","review":"This is a great book.

I am very impressed with the down-to-earth language and clear ideas that he presents in this book. I am not a medical professional and often get lost in the first paragraph of medical descriptions of ADD, ADHD and Learning Disabilities.After struggling with a local school system's ignorance and unwillingness to question archaic teaching methods, I appreciate the way that Vincent compares ADHD to other medical impairments.If a child has a visual impairment, and needs accommodations in the classroom, would you expect a school administrator or teacher to say any of the following?1. The parents need to go for parent training - the social worker will call you to schedule an appointment.2. By the end of 5th grade, this child needs to be able to take down notes from the board and must learn to function at the same level as peers, irrespective of the impairment. (Substitute your own \\"must\\" here. \\"Must be able to sit still in class\\" or \\"Must be able to write five paragraph essays\\".)3. The child just needs to try harder.4. The impairment will go away as we promote the child through the grades without addressing the situation.No parent should tolerate these comments if a child has a visual impairment or hearing impairment (although I expect that some school administrators that I have met will offer these comments).Similarly, a child with ADHD or any other impairment should be accommodated. Vincent does a good job of comparing ADHD to other visual and hearing impairments which gives parent another tool to educate people who are not familiar with the current research on ADHD.I advise parents who engage the school system for accommodations should start off by getting a child advocate. I will give you the name of a great child advocate in Connecticut, if you ask me. I suggest that you do not try to negotiate with your school district without a child advocate. Your school district has a different agenda to yours, so be warned.Vincent also does a good job of describing current medication. How it works, the percentage of time that it doesn't work and similar details. I found it very enlightening and helpful.I recommend this book to all parents who are raising kids with ADHD, ADD or a Learning Disability, especially if you are considering medication."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"My son who is 5 1/2 is ADHD.

And to me, living with an ADHD child and him leaning to cope is a total adjustment. I am not one that believes a pill solves everything, nor am I an advocate for non pharmacological treatments. I believe I'm like every other parent out there, I want what's best for my son.There are so many books out on the subject, I was lost and a bit confused. I saw this, and the other good reviews, and hoped this was the best place to start. For my family, it was. The author takes you beyond the medication, explaining what is going on inside the child's head, and laying out a clear-cut, concise method of small changes that yield big results. Like any parent, I wanted something tangible I could do to help my son make his life easier, and this book shows you the steps you can take.Another thing I love about this book is that it doesn't expect you or your child to be perfect. It puts out there that you will get frustrated, you will lose your temper, and that you're human for doing so. They also have great suggestions on how to apologize and not make you feel guilty for doing so.Thank you to the author for helping my family make this transition as seamless and painless as possible.

It is cutting-edge, thought-provoking, and at times, counter-intuitive, but will deliver unprecedented results for any open-minded reader. It is a very different but highly proven model for ADHD which, unfortunately, is still new to many professionals. The plain truth is that this book represents the most effective ADHD treatment philosophy to date, just as the A.P.A.'s response, and the author's national and international awards suggest.A MUST-READ for any parent or teacher of an ADHD child. The text book by the same author is a MUST-READ for any mental-health professional.This book will change the way your home sounds every night.

I liked the style and directness of the writing--the suggestions are succint and do-able.

Because of the advice in this book we made several simple changes to our routine(e.g. heavy protein breakfast, omega-3 supplements) that really helped in addition to medication.

Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"This book is a winner. I have bought and read many different books on ADHD - from all perspectives - and I like this one the best. It is balanced on the medication issue, with accurate and well-researched medical explanations of the benefits and shortcomings. The title makes it seem anti-medication but the author does recommend medication (with certain caveats, and easy-to-understand explanations of the reasons it may not work well in some individuals), so don't be put off by this if your child is on medication. His goal is to go beyond a simple prescription to give the parent other helpful information that can provide a well-rounded approach to helping their ADHD child. The book is very practical, with questionnaires, checklists, or homework at the end of each chapter.If you are new to this topic, buy this one first. If you are a veteran but need more tips on how to help your child, this book still has plenty to offer you."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"I have over 100 books on this subject and try read anything that will help my ADHD son.

Chapters address simple basic problems and guidelines, including the importance of a lesson plan, how to teach children to manage their anger, why nutrition is critical and why yelling rarely solves anything.

I have read several books on the subject, plus reseaching ADHD on line. If you employ the same methods by which you were raised, not having ADHD, or the methods your parents used to raise you, you are missing the target by a mile. ADHD children are different in many ways and you must learn how and what to do for them as individuals. They are precious little people with vast potential for love and success in life. Only by you learning how to help them manage their lives, in a loving caring manner can you help them. This book offers proven methods to help the child at home and in school and in life. I do recommend this book. You also need to read other books on the subject and try to find a CHAD group or other support group for yourself because you are not alone in your struggle to save your child and family. I also recommend ADDitude Magazine as well as, Making the System work for Your Child and The Gift of ADHD, all from Amazon.com. It takes a village to raise a child. Good luck."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"I am parenting five children with ADHD and have read a lot of ADHD literature. Dr. Monastra's book is the most useful I have read ever. Particularly helpful are his suggested accomodations in school, the \\"Time Stands Still\\" strategy and Parent \\"Self-Care\\" suggestions. His best chapter is called \\"Temperment May be Inherited...but...Emotional Control is Learned.\\" He advocates ways to teach children emotional control that are so effective they should be shared with every parent with children :), ADHD or not. His book is life-affirming and practical. Thank you, Dr. Monastra, for making such a positive difference in the ADHD world."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"Of all the books I've read about parenting children with AD/HD, this is the most useful. The author, Dr. Monastra, runs an attention-disorder clinic that offers a class specifically geared to parenting children with AD/HD. He has taken that class, simplified the content, and broken it down into eleven lessons. While it is of course no substitute for attending a ten- or eleven-week class, the lessons are clear and highly valuable. He explains the condition from a brain-function standpoint, discusses the different medications (what they do and when each type might be most useful) and outlines simple techniques that can help address some of the biggest areas of difficulty. The book was very readable and engaging. Dr. Monastra understands that many parents of kids with AD/HD have AD/HD themselves, and he designed the book with that fact in mind. He also provides his \\"top 40\\" list of typical behaviors that parents may feel they need to address. Overall, I felt like I was reading about my own child, and his advice was extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"Like many of you, I've scoured the net for any morsels of information which could be of help in understanding and helping my ADHD child. This book has not only provided me with further insight, above and beyond the ABC's of ADHD, but it has become one of my primary resource books. I find myself returning to the chapter about medication in order to better understand what my own doctor has expained to me verbally. I go back to the chapter on diet to make sure we haven't fallen away from the very practical recommendations there. And I often go back to the different tips to help control emotions, etc.But what has pushed me to write this review is the sheer number of times I have quoted Dr. Monastra, to my son's teachers, to his Doctor, to our family members.... clearly this book has left a long lasting impression on me as a parent (my son's \\"case worker\\"). If Dr. Monastra were to charge royalties for the number of times I have said \\"... and if he were blind, would we ask him to just try harder to see... \\", I'd owe him a lot more than I paid for this book!Yes, I can definitely recommend this book as it is practical, easy to read, and contains information/insights you will not likely find elsewhere."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"Dr Monastra clearly identifies this frustrating problem for parents in clear, easy to understand language. While supporting medication, he gives useful advice on how to handle your child to optimize their behavior. Highly recommend, found it very useful and will use many of the ideas he had. Wish we lived closer to his office, would definitely want him to take care of my son (no higher praise!)."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"I have read a lot of books on ADHD and I really like this one. It's very easy to understand. Some of these other books use big words, I prefer the simple terms like they use in this book.If you are a parent of a child with ADHD and feel lost or wondering what to do or where to go, read this book. There are lots of times I wonder if I am doing the right thing. Meds, no meds... what to do? This book talks about how certain medications work on children. It also has a lot of great info. on some of the types of testing you can have done.If you don't want to buy it or aren't sure check it out at a library. I just wish I could get some teachers to read this and understand our children. This books explains why kids with ADHD do the things they do.Also, he talks about making sure your children get protein at breakfast so they will do better through out the day. This is what you are supposed to to with kids, but ADHD kids especially. We need to make sure they are getting enough protein.. especially in the morning."},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","review":"I picked up this book and read it within a day. It is very informative about ADHD and gives excellent information that is very well presented to parents. I really liked Monastra's approach to diagnosing ADHD. If you have been told that your child may have attention problems, then you must read this book! It is also excellent for anyone who works with ADHD kids so that they will understand what ADHD is and how kids with ADHD are affected by the disease. When my pediatrican diagnosed my child with ADHD, I wish she would have handed me a copy of this book. I would have been better informed at an earlier stage of the game."},{"Title":"Biography - Jaramillo, Stephan (1970-): An article from: Contemporary Authors Online","review":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DOCUMENT!!!It is an utter waste of money and ultimately it will leave you scratching your head wondering, \\"what is this?!\\""},{"Title":"The Six-Cornered Snowflake and Other Poems (New Directions Paperbook, 700)","review":"This book provides a wonderful introduction to a gifted and delightful poet we should hear much more about.His work is a lyric delight. Nims is learned and is author of a wonderful introduction to poetry. He is a poet who deserves to be more widely read. Complicated but not overly obscure his work requires some effort. A good counter-balance to John Ashbery and his imatators."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"Absolute delight; Dickenson writes like a dream, with unending imagination and invention. The two not-so-old ladies remind you of every tough-minded and slightly dotty old aunt you ever had. Aches with life and laughter and sadness and hope shaded with the knowledge that this life is all too temporary, and we better find out who we love and love them, soon."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"The cover on the first printing of this book caught my attention. You see, my Aunt went blind and used to have my Dad (who never learned to drive) tell her when cars or a stopsign were approaching. I was not disappointed. This book is marvelous. Dickinson is a fabulous writer, and develops his characters so that you are certain you know them. His writing reminds me of Anne Tyler (trade Baltimore for Chicago).One of the ways the elderly lose their rights is the loss of the driver's license. Also the sisters' sparring is just like my Mom &amp; Aunts ... loving daggers. You will love this book."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"Brilliantly witty dialogue between two elderly sisters as Dickinson's weaves their shared past with the slow motion present of old age. They snap at each other like only sisters can. The blue collar Chicago neighborhood where the sisters have grown up and raised their own families is decaying rapidly. Yet all their life experiences have occurred within these few blocks so they stay despite the urging of their adult children. Dickinson gives us an exquisite sense of the sisters' interior lives as small daily experiences trigger memories of their husbands, their small triumphs and their fights. Will they fade quietly into the sunset? Not without giving us an amazing ride. You will be cheering for them until the end of the book. You will be laughing along the way."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"I saw this book at a thrift store and passed it by. The next time I came to the store the book was still there. I picked it up and was hooked by the 3rd page. Being very close to my own sister I was given a glimpse of what our future would be like if we were in the same situation. The sister's journey is a wonderful one. I enjoyed every page and was sorry to get to the last one. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"This book was out of print for a while, and I'm delight to see it's back. This is one of those books that people pass around saying, &quot;you HAVE to read this.&quot; The basic premise -- a blind woman driving while her sighted sister (who can't drive) give directions --- doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the book. Beautiful, scary and funny all at once. I can't recommend this book enough"},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"The premise of two widowed sisters, one blind, one alcoholic making a cross country car trip to confront the son of the blind sister on his lack of contact with her sounds unbelievable at first, but the way Dickinson handles it, it all makes sense in the end. The movie, the Straight Story, which was a true story and came out after this book, also dealt with this drastic last ditch attempt by seniors to mend fences with relatives whom they had lost closeness with. In the Straight Story a farmer crosses the country on a tractor/lawn mower because he is visually unable to drive a car to see a long estranged brother. In Widows' Adventures the blind driving sister takes directions from her sighted sister from Chicago to California by taking back roads and driving no more than 20-30 miles an hour! Ultimately, it is not the driving itself that provides the treat of reading the book, although the sequence in which the ladies almost get caught by a police officer is hilarious, but the self discovery that occurs when they decide to go on the physical and emotional journey."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"I absolutely loved this beautiful, touching, and very funny book about two sisters on the road trip of their lives. Two widowed sisters, one blind, the other a bit of an alcoholic, they are on a cross-country automobile ride. It sounds simple and trite, I know. There are mishaps along the way, many of which you might be able to guess at, yet this sweet pair of women is truly engaging and Charles Dickinson deserves more attention for the work he's done."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"As an early-thirtysomething man, I didn't know what to expect when it was recommended by my mother and aunt. It is definitely a keeper. Both women are excellent characters. The author brings the women, their families, and the settings to life. A surprise twist at the end is icing on the cake."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"A great, fast, fun read. Do it"},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"Charming, light read, with subtle dark overtones, particularly in the emphasis on the gradual disintegration of society. Author lives in Palatine, works for the Chicago Tribune, at least he did when his book was published. It had a fast moving plot about two widowed sisters, one blind, one addicted to beer, who drive to L.A. from Chicago. An enormous amount of unresolved issues, including domestic abuse, parent-child, and sister-sister relationships. Some funny moments. Never lost interest, but not a great book. Could make a good movie. Sisters were only 70ish but author seemed to portray them as 80ish. Why didn't one sister learn to drive? Why were they both so distant from their children? Was Ray gay? People in L.A. are all living in barred camps it seems. No real meat in this novel, although situations have potential for it. I still thought this way on a second reading six years later."},{"Title":"The Widow's Adventures","review":"This was such a great read, fun and adventures galore... kept you guessing.

This book has interesting songs for adult learners who are tired of playing children songs or the simplified version of the old classical music.

'Very easy - excellent practice for reading 'hands together.' Although on the page, each piece looks quite simple; once you are playing them - they come alive. The song-selection is an education in itself. Pieces from Broadway standards, music theater, popular movies, even some pop and television themes - all in one place. This is an excellent book for improving sight-reading skills or to just sit down and enjoy an evening with. Many of the pieces are 'must-knows' for the well rounded piano student."},{"Title":"100 Best Loved Piano Solos","review":"The songs in this book are great and there are plenty of them. However, when I see the words \\"big note,\\" it generally means that the songs are incredibly easy--usually without much that involves both hands playing at the same time. These songs are easy (and, yes, the notes are bigger). They are also arranged nicely so that you sound more advanced than you are when playing, but I would have called it Easy Piano. It is beyond the skill of the person for whom I was buying it and I'm kind of frustrated about that. I guess that's what I get for buying music online when I can't look at more than the first page."},{"Title":"100 Best Loved Piano Solos","review":"You need an intermediate level to play this songs.

Sal was nowhere in sight! Apparently the mother had picked berries for some time thinking that the little bear following her was Sal. More alarmingly, when the mother found Sal, Sal reported having followed a large bear around for some time. Probably the cub's mother who had also mistaken Sal for her own cub. Alarming! Confusing! But Sal said it was fun! Fortunately no one was hurt, but parents should keep close track of their children when picking berries for the winter on Blueberry Hill!Author/illustrator Robert McCloskey has created a delightful set of images to bring his timeless tale of mistaken identity to life. My son, Christopher, had a hard time deciding which was funnier: \\"Blueberries for Sal\\" or \\"Curious George Takes a Job.\\" Sal is definitely more charmingly life-like, bringing back the by-gone era of canning fruit for the winter. This book serves a multi-layered purpose of teaching the importance of listening and staying close to parents as well as the culture of earlier American families and the adventure of a wonderful outdoor setting. A great book!"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"I attend West Virginia State College.

This gentle story of Sal and her mother and Little Bear and his mother picking blueberries on the mountain is one of her favorites. There is enough repetition in the story that I can pause and my granddaughter will fill in with \\"Kerplink, kerplank, kerplunk\\" or whatever other words fit in the story. Losing one's mother and getting lost are great concerns for children, so the happy ending of this classic is very appealing to little ones.

The story has some funny turns when both mother and child get separated and wind up finding the wrong family member. Imagine that! Well, all's well that ends well. And, guess you wondered what happened in the end don't you? You'll have to see for yourself. McCloskey sadly passed away on June 30, 2003 most of his life he illustrated and wrote children's books. He wrote eight books during his life. All the book reflect on family experiences, small-town life, and life in Boston. His story, 'Make Way for Ducklings' is set in Boston. McCloskey is one of the few authors that depicted Americana in a light-hearted vision through his illustration. He will be sadly missed.

And jam. And muffins. This delicious tale has aged beautifully -- how right the Caldecott people were when they chose to give this book an honorable mention. From that mouth-watering first scene, to the peaceful panorama of the hilly blueberry patch on a fine warm day, McCloskey\`s sweet (but not cloyingly so) tale and charming drawings of a little girl, a little bear, and their mothers, who mix themselves up while picking (and eating) blueberries, is a delectable reminder of the simple pleasures in life. My little boys empathize with Sal\`s sincere intentions, and thrill to the excitement of such a close encounter with the bears."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Robert McCloskey is a well known children's writer and this book is one of the reasons why (the other is Make Way for Ducklings).

Blueberries for Sal is a great introduction to this author for the younger listener who might not have the patience or understanding for \\"Ducklings\\" or \\"One Morning in Maine,\\" another beautiful McCloskey book. My two-and-a-half year old just adores this story and could hear it over and over. Here, little Sal (who is much older in \\"Maine\\") goes with her mother to pick blueberries to can for the winter and finds herself all mixed with a bear mother and child who have come to gorge themselves on blueberries. Sal's and Little Bear's frustration at being expected to keep up with their busy mothers rings true with toddlers and they adore the hilarious mother-child mix-up that ensues. Every child should read this one, if only so that children learn that people used to can their own food!"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"The classic, very old picture book from 1948 has lost nothing of its charm, and the illustrations are very laboriously drawn with great eye for the detail (little Sal's too big bib'n'braces falling from her small shoulders, for example). The inside cover illustration where Sal plays with the rubber rings for the preserve glasses reminded me of my own childhood when my mum made jellies and preserves.There's lots of text so I recommend from 3 years up and probably more for girls (as they tend to have a longer attention span).

Fortunately, there is enough food for those with the sense to gather it, such as the mothers of the young protagonists. One is a human, and one is a bear. I won't spoil the thrilling conclusion, but there are several life-and-death encounters in the pages of this short story. Potential tragedy lurks at every turn of the page. You will be on the edge of your seat! I recommend parental discretion for this story, it might give your child (or you) nightmares."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Blueberries for Sal, is probably one of the most powerfully constructed children's book of all time. What I mean by that, is that each element of the book (story, illustrations, lessons, morals, entertainment value) is all equally displaced and of the highest quality. You can really tell as an adult that a lot of care went into putting this book out, and I remember as a child rereading this book over and over again, which definitely means in my mind that the book is good, or at least entertaining.The story is about little Sal, who goes with her mother to help her pick berries. Sal loves berries and ends up eating all of hers, so she wonders off away from her mother to find more. Along the way, she runs into a bear. That bear has a cub, and that little bear is put into a similar situation with Sal's mother. I won't spoil the rest, but I assure you it is very grabbing for young readers and generates appreciation for caring parents.I'd also like to point out that this book is appropriate for both boys and girls, as I read it countless times when I was young (I'm a guy), and my young daughter loves it now.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"This is a simple book of a Little Sal, and Little Sal's mother, and Little Bear, and Little Bear's mother, who get mixed up with each other on Blueberry Hill.It's very realistically written and illustrated, and the exciting part isn't too scary for little ones.I will note that it's a bit long - maybe better for kids with longer attention spans than shorter ones.

My 2 1/2 year old boy loves, loves, loves this book. It has a bit more of a plot than someone his age is used to. The first time we got to a point where the story switches for the moment from the story of Sal and her mommy to the story of Little Bear and his mommy, he stopped me and paged back to look at the pages abiout Sal some more. Once we got past that, he came to love BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL. We read this one over, and over, and over. I have the sense that this book stretched out how much story he could manage, as it is longer and more complex than any storybook we had tried previously.BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL has also been a great seasonal story for us in fall and early winter. The book is set in fall, and it has allowed us to talk about seasons. Our boy is quite interested in the idea of winter and how the people and the bears are both getting ready for winter.BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL was one of our bedtime stories tonight, and I have a promise now to make blueberry pancackes for breakfast again.

As she's eating blueberries along the way, she becomes separated from her mother. Her separation becomes a true adventure when she encounters a baby bear picking his own blueberries. A delightful reunion with her mother takes place at the same time that Mama Bear finds her own cub.Your children will be delighted as I was when this book was read to me by my mother when I was a child.

Waking up, she follows \\"Mom\\" pushing through the underbrush...who turns out to be a kindly Mother Bear. Little Bear, meanwhile, has done the same...ending up following Sal's Mom!Sorting out the children and Moms, with both families leaving full of blueberries, helps us all to understand just how alike we are -- all beings who inhabit this lovely earth.Told with humor and great illustrations, this is an excellent gift in hardback for the new baby, or for any child's birthday or going-away gift, ages 1-10.

The story centers around McCloskey's own daughter, Sal and his wife picking blueberries on a hill in Maine. While picking blueberries Sal and her mother become separated but are unaware of it. Instead each unknowingly ends up picking blueberries with a member of the bear family. Sal's mother and Mother Bear both discover they have been picking blueberries with the wrong child and go in search of their own children. Each mother finds her child and so ends the day of blueberry picking on the hill. McCloskey's illustrations for this book are done in blue ink and are superb! This book is not only my favorite from childhood but my daughter's as well."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk. This is the sound that Little Sal makes as she follows behind her mother dropping blueberries into her perennially empty pail. Why does the pail remain empty even as Sal keeps dropping (kuplink) in (kuplank) blueberries (kuplunk)? Because she withdraws and eats them equally fast.Hustle, hustle. This is what Little Bear does as he tries to keep up with his mother. They are also out for blueberries, coming up the other side of the hill.Sal and Bear (both Little) are so engrossed in eating berries that they become separated from their respective mothers. Before you know it their paths are crossed - Little Sal encounters Little Bear's mother and vice versa. And how do things get sorted out? Each mother listens for the distinctive sound - by now you know which one - and in the end is reunited with her cub.This vintage book, over fifty years old, is a timeless classic. My daughters never tired of it, and neither did I!"},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"This picture book originally was published in 1948, but it's depictions of small children are timeless. A bear cub goes on a berry-picking outing with his mother at the same time that a human child also goes on a berry-picking outing with his mother. Soon the respective parties are engrossed in eating blueberries. Their sweet tooths and greed for more berries lead them to get mixed up and eventually follow the wrong mothers, so that a bear cub is following behind a woman and a child is following behind a bear cub. But it is the symbol of \\"mother\\" that gives the small ones their sense of security no matter who or what, which allows for the plot twist to succeed and reach its resolution. At the same time, it made a universal observation about \\"mother\\" while providing insight into young children.This book is best read aloud to youngsters in order that its literary qualities may captivate the listener's imagination. The dramatic plot with a twist is engaging in well-ordered progression. This imaginative picture book should sit on your child's shelf beside a copy of another great Robert McCloskey picture book - \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\"(1941)."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"I love these classic books and I remember it from being a kid myself.

Or are they really that different? With McCloskey's incredible eye for natural detail from a child's point of view, this story tells a hilarious tale about a human mother and child (the eponymous Sal) who go blueberry hunting and run into their bear counterparts, who are storing up food for hibernation. Not only are the sound effects hilarious (my son loves to chant the KERPLINK! KERPLANK! KERPLUNK! part along with me) the story also teaches a lot about comparing and contrasting characteristics in the natural world, and the striking and original blue-and-white illustrations make this book unique.

THEY WERE COOL."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"I was skeptical about the McCloskey classics and have to admit was surprised when my 26-month-old really enjoyed the book. It's simple and easy to follow - the text and story are perfectly suitable for a read-a-loud for 2 year olds. Also the simple but easy to follow drawings engaged his interest and were a nice alternative to the flashy and elaborate colorful pictures usually found in children's picture books and a great simple alternative to our flashy fast-paced media culture. I also thought it was a great opportunity to help develop attention span. The length and complexity of the text was just the right level of challenge - beyond what he was used to hearing but he didn't tune out because the story line itself was one he felt he could understand or at least figure out. I'm finding all of McCloskey's books great for word choice. Most of the words are within our 2 1/2 year old's range but there are always some that are quite new and challenging so I'm glad that the text isn't dumbed down. It gives him exposure to more and unusual words that he's not likely to come across in everyday conversational language. Additionally, the comprehensible story line and the pictures can provide the support that he needs to be able to figure out the meanings of some of the novel words. So actually, I thought this was an excellent book for transitioning to more challenging text and more detailed story lines, which 3 months later at 29 months, he has done - now he's listening to \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\", another great and more complex McCloskey book for the toddler/preschool crowd. From a diversity viewpoint, it's important to be ever so slightly cautious. The book was written in the 1940s and it reflects the gender, race and class stereotypes of the time but not to an extent that makes it objectionable as long as it is only one of a few of such books in the child's collection. The story itself is very, very cute and a good book about respecting other animals and seeing them as having feelings and needs as well as humans. Because there's a sequel with an older Sal, it's also a great opportunity to introduce the child to the concept of a continuing story (which they will encounter at a later age in chapter books and series)."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"My granddaughter absolutely loves this book, and why not? It is a warmly conceived tale of mothers loving their children...beautiful drawings and prose. But, as a biologist now retired and living in wooded Appalachia, I can't help feeling some discomfort with the story line. I know I would not let any small child wander off during berry picking season. Yes, there are bears...and many of them have cubs. It's a simple fact that needs to be respected and heeded. Many children's books are full of fanciful animals serving as characters with human charms and emotions. I have no problem with all of those. Perhaps it's because McCloskey otherwise draws so carefully from nature that I squirmed a little as I turned the pages.

Little Sal soons starts eating all the berries she picks, plus some from her mother's pail. Encouraged to go off to find berries to pick by herself, mother and Sal become separated. On the other side of the mountain, Little Bear and his mother are coming to eat all the blueberries they can to get as fat as possible so they can survive the winter. They, too, get separated.Soon, Little Sal stumbles onto following mother bear and Little Bear is following Sal's mother. Eventually, the mothers discover the mistake, back away in shyness from the other's child, and look for their own offspring. Along the way, the children run into bird mothers and their families as well. Everyone goes home with the correct mother, and the last drawing has Little Sal with her mother in an old-fashioned kitchen with a wood stove working on the preserves.The story is gently and beautifully told, and wonderfully complemented by the illustrations (also drawn by Mr. McClosky).It is a good introduction for children to the way that all human and animal families work, the need to prepare for the future, and that one has to pay attention to where one is going. It will also interest them in blueberry picking, which is a wonderful family occupation. It is also very heart-warming the way Mr. McClosky has taken the potential fright out of a situation where a child has wandered off and run into a mother bear. The child can draw her or his own lesson that they would not want that to happen to them, rather than having the story provide terror.Mr. McClosky has expressed a benign but significant role to nature that will serve families well. I wonder if he ever visited the Galapagos, because the animals there and the people act much like in this story.Overcome your disbelief stalls about how children can learn from stories with this outstanding book. I rate it one of my top five of all time for younger children. It was a favorite of all four of our children. I hope it will be for you and your children and grandchildren, as well.Think of this story the next time you eat some blueberry preserves."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"A children's book about a little girl named Sal who goes up into the hills to pick blueberries with her mother and eats as many blueberries as she puts into her pail! She encounters a mother bear and her cub also picking blueberries; but, soon the little cub is trailing Sal's mother while Sal is trailing the mother bear. McCloskey's blue and white illustrations are perfect for this story and it resulted in the book being a 1949 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children. It is a must for the shelves of any parent of a preschooler or the shelf of any serious student of children literature."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Famed author Robert McCloskey (\\"Make Way for Ducklings,\\" \\"One Morning in Maine,\\" and others) wrote and illustrated this gently humorous parallel tale of two moms and their daughters on a blueberry hunt. One pair is human, and the other pair is bear!. As they proceed up opposite sides of rolling hill covered in blueberries, each member of the species copies the other: The moms focus on the task at hand, remembering the harsh winter ahead; the children (\\"Little Sal\\" and \\"Little Bear\\") focus on the immediate pleasures of eating blueberries--so much so, that each gets lost.In a deftly portrayed switch, McCloskey shows the Little Bear following Little Sal's mom, and Little Sal following the Little Bear's mom. The two lost children are unafraid of following the mismatched grown-ups (ok, so McCloskey takes some liberties in this very light book). Eventually the two moms turn around and see who is following: Little Bear's mother discovers Sal and turns away: (\\"She was old enough to be shy of people, even a very small person like Little Sal.\\") Meanwhile, Little Sal's mom discovers Little Bear, and the mother back away: (\\"She was old enough to be shy of bears, even very small bears like Little Bear.\\") Each pair reunites and returns home, with an adventure and berries to savor over the winter.McCloskey's deep blue-black drawings complement the appealing symmetry and innocence of the book, and the period furnishings, uncluttered landscape, and fashions add to the book's sentimental and enduring attraction. This is a very good bedtime story for little ones who can appreciate an affectionate and tender book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Blueberries for Sal is a favorite book from childhood and is still one of my favorite books to this very day.

She especially loves the phrase \\"Where, oh where, is my child?\\" She got that one dead-on. This is an excellent book for retelling and could be acted out very successfully in a short dramatic play in kindergarten. The plot is simple and fun and leads to great discussions about how humans prepare for winter (gathering the harvest, preserving foods by canning them) vs. animals who hibernate (that would be the bear). This book is, of course, need I say it???? A winner. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this one. And little Sal (Sally? It's a girl) is as cute as a button.

In this classic tale the ever androgynous looking Sal and her mother go blueberry picking in the wild outdoors. Sal, voracious for blueberries, loses her mother and attaches herself to a mother bear, just as the bear's child loses its mother and attaches itself to Sal's. The swap is easily cleared up and in the end no harm is done. Sal's mother, seeing that her child is a baby bear and not her own kid, doesn't seem particularly alarmed by the odd turn of events. She is wary of the bear (a wise thing to be) but finds her own child quickly and easily. This is a charming little story. Sweet and simple. McCloskey's illustrations and text have lasted for at least fifty years, and will undoubtedly last another fifty. Some scenes are absolutely entrancing as well. As Sal walks around a large boulder in search of her misplaced parent, McCloskey's lines display a real sense of human movement. This is such a charming story that I would recommend it to anyone anytime.

Blueberries for Sal preserve a distinct since of life when tin pails and wood smoke, bobby pins and rambling dirt roads were routine.

Makes a nice gift for any that age group."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"The story is sweet, set in an earlier time but does not come across dated. There is an opportunity for math lessons (Sal keeps eating her berries = subtraction; tremendous mouthful = size/proportion) here. Beyond that, kids just love this story. I don't know if it is that there is one main character, a child, and another prominent character, a bear, or what, but I have given this as a gift and it is always a favorite."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"This book originally found it's way to our house in an old box of kids books that were my husband's as a child.

I've read our tattered old copy over a hundred times, and I still think it's a GREAT book."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Being from Maine, I may be a little biased, but I think this is one of the best children's books ever written. It combines wonderful illustrations with a fine story that blends humor and drama as the blueberry pickers get mixed up. The story has been a childhood favorite for years and remains as fresh as it did at its first release in 1948."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"I loved this book as a child because I saw myself in Sal who was curious and spunky and had a serious independent streak. She was and is what is called a Tom Boy. And like Sal and her Mom, my Mom and Aunt Ann would take me with them to pick blueberries or what we call huckleberries here in the west coast, and on the hillsides of Mt St Helens, Mt Rainier, Mt Shasta etc.Knowing that we saw black bears and always had to be prepared if cubs were around, made this story &quot;real&quot; to me. And I love stories where the girl isn't a whimp, but is allowed to be herself and is shown doing both normal activities but activities that show a more rural or self sufficent idea.I also like the story because it is a great Mother and daughter tale and shows that even the human animal like the bear and her cub, have such caring personalities. Oh and I also indetified with the eat more berries than you pick theme.Unless someone has tasted a sweet freshly picked blueberry or strawberry etc they have no idea how wonderful the taste and smell is and that you really cannot stop at just one. I wonder how many parents who have taken the kids along to pick berries have done so knowing that the kid will probably not produce much fruit for canning or baking, and may even come home with a tummy ache. But that it is a great outing and make for great memories."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"I bought this hardback version to replace the cheap little paperback ordered from my sons preschool (yep- its a keeper!) I love the size & quality. It comes with a nice dust jacket but we always remove those since they get ripped & damaged so easily. The hard cover is just as beautiful, pictorial & glossy. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was made in USA. Its a huge book that is perfect for sharing with your child. No disappointments."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Beautiful symmetry of nature, family, and Nurture! The delicateness of this book begins with its cover: a young girl sitting in a bush picking blueberries. Interestingly, this book only has two colors on its cover-royal blue and taupe, the rest of illustrations are in royal blue. Although the book lacks color, Robert McCloskey did not lack imagination. The book explains how a mother teaches her young to save food for the harsh winter to come. It is a valuable lesson of love, patience, and staying together. The children (little Sal and a baby bear) ignore their respective mothers and wander off, eventually are reunited and continue their task of blueberry hunting. The quantity of writing allows room for discussion of images, cause and effect and possibilities as you turn the page. The book also implies the wisdom that comes along with being an adult, \\"She was old enough to be shy of people (bears), even a very small person like Little Sal (Little Bear)\\". Of course, my chest pouted out as I told my boys that moms know best. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any mother as a perfect bedtime story. There are no dangers presented in reading besides being whisked away in a charming tale."},{"Title":"Blueberries for Sal (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","review":"Blueberries for Sal depicts the love and protection of mothers in a sweet, down-to-earth way. Sal and her mother pick blueberries to freeze for the winter, while Little Bear and his mother traverse another part of the hillside eating blueberries to prepare for hibernation. When Sal and Little Bear end up following each other's mothers instead of their own, the story and its illustrations only get cuter.As with all of McCloskey's books, the illustrations are charming and speak as loudly as the well-written words.To read more of my children's book recommendations, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"A Second Visit","review":"A Second Visit by Pierce Mullaly is an easy reading autobiographical book of wonderful stories of a young boy's life in the early 1900's. It touches on the hard realities and the innocent joys of a life in a family of 6 boys in a different era. Wit, humor and some surprises weave together to bring life to days gone by. As the daughter of the author, it is a pleasure to read stories of my 92 year father's childhood that I had never heard. I recommend this book from age 10 to 110. It is fun, refreshing and heartwarming."},{"Title":"A Second Visit","review":"This writer has an amazing memory for detail. He lived during the era covered in the book and recalls some whimsical and sometimes heart wrenching events. If you are looking for a book that depicts the flavor of what was going on in Lincoln Heights and the surrounding areas in the 1920's, this would be a good read for you. The author keeps things moving and the words are chosen well.

The format is straightforward \\"rags-to-riches\\", telling how Tom \\"Tigger\\" Dobson, an ordinary working-class lad from a Northern English town, meets a coach who promises to make him a world-beater. With just one winter's hard conditioning, Tigger becomes strong enough to meet and beat the best of the day - in those days a good 5,000 metres time was anything under 14 minutes, and only one or two men in the world could run a 4-minute mile. What's more, it was the era of strict amateurism, when athletes not only got no prizes or other payments, but even had to pay to get into the stadium like everyone else.Loader describes the pain, frustration, and occasional exhilaration of the runner's life vividly. His characters come alive - Tigger himself, his coach and friends, his long-suffering girlfriend Jean, and the man whose reputation he covets - Gerry Somerford, the \\"Golden Boy\\" of British athletics. Tigger's nemesis, the stocky blond Russian Suvarov, who burns off his rivals with merciless bursts of mid-race pace, is Kuts to the life.It's not all plain sailing, as Tigger's sudden rise to success is interrupted by various setbacks that threaten his ambitions, his engagement to Jean, and his relationship with his parents. At one point he even comes close to breaking up with his coach. Events build to an exciting emotional crisis that will stay with you for years, if not for life."},{"Title":"Jim Henson: Muppet master","review":"The photographs in this book are very engaging. Seeing the Muppeteers' at work drives home how amazing their accomplishments were and continue to be.This book discusses the Muppets as an artistic medium and how many life skills and habits meshed to produce the success and sustainability of Muppetry. A person can be inspired to relish life experience and to develop great work attitudes after reading this book. Everyone will come away with an appreciation for the world of Muppetry."},{"Title":"Understanding Wine Technology: The Science of Wine Explained","review":"Clearly written and a quick read, but don't be fooled: there is a lot of solid technical information here, including one of the best published reviews of filtration, and an excellent overview of additives. Clarity here is due to good writing and careful exposition, not by dumbing down the topic. The book was written for classroom use, for instance by students preparing for the WSET Diploma Examination, and also succeeds as a text for someone who understands the basics of winemaking but wants to know the why as well as the what.However, the chapter on fermentation is a bit brief for its intended role as a textbook, and faults merit only a few pages. A lack of a bibliography (other than a few scattered references to journal articles) also counts against it. I recommend supplementing with another text such as Rankine's \\"Making Good Wine\\" (ISBN 140503601X) or a reference work such as Jackson's \\"Wine Science\\".(Note: A newer edition is now available, it might address some of the above criticisms.)This is a book worth owning and reading, but it will not provide all the answers."},{"Title":"Understanding Wine Technology: The Science of Wine Explained","review":"This book does a terrific job of simplifying the complex science that goes into winemaking. Ever wonder what some of the terms mean on the back of a wine bottle? This book is a quick read that provides consise and relatable explanations. It is not a book on how to make wine. It is not a book for scientists. It is a non-technical book for anyone that wants to learn more about the process and options from the dirt to the glass."},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"&quot;Katy Cat and Beaky Boo&quot; has all you need to stimulate your child's speaking-ability: well-known things and animals to name, numbers, colours, patterns, sizes, acts, prepositions, a short and simple text, and it can all be combined. I use the book every day in my work as a speak- therapist working with children suffering from dysphasia. They love reading it and lifting the flaps (which are mended more than once!) and they want to return to it even when we have had other exciting things on the programme. (My own 8-year-old daughter broke the code of reading knowing this book by heart, and it's the book she prefers to read aloud to a younger friend.) The drawing-manner is simple yet recognizable, the colours clear and cheerful. As a grown-up reader you're amused by its artful humour. Every time you read it you experience a new conversation with your young co-reader, still on a higher level. The pace in respect of the child. If you'll buy only one book for your young child, this should be the one."},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"My 2 1/2 year old still loves this book. We've had it since she was around 18 months although I think it would be a good book for even younger babies. The book takes you through a series of comparisons that show Katy Cat doing something on the left hand page and a series of lift the flaps on the right hand page that ask you to find an analogy for Beaky Boo. One example is 'Katy Kat lives in a house' (the page features a very animated picture of Katy in her house) on the opposite page it asks where Beaky Boo lives. Each flap shows some type of living structure and underneath the animal that lives in each structure. Your child will enjoy the book on different levels as they get older. My daughter by now has memorized where Beaky Boo is on each page and gets a kick out of uncovering it as quickly as possible. It's also a good exposure to some uncommon animals. Lucy expands beyond the standard farm collection and includes things like sardines and squirrels. It also has sprinkles of color matching, counting and similarity choices. But the best thing about it is it's fun to read (Katy Kat and Beaky Boo just kind of roll off the tongue) so you won't get bored as they say 'again, mommy, again'"},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"Like the Maisy book, Lucy Cousins used vibrant colors and bold black outlines to present the Katy Cat. My 2.75 years old son loves this book much more than Maisy books. It teaches the concept of shapes, pattern, numbers and colors. The items under the flaps always give a surprise. For example, when you lift up a flap with prickly in shape, you will see a porcupine. My son loves the last page very much. After lifting the flap about the number of animals / insects, he would go to the opposite page to hunt for the exact number of creatures. Compared with Maisy, I found Katy Cat book is more educational and fun. Quite disappointed that there is only a few Katy Cat books."},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"I purchased this book for my first Grand daughter who was 2 and it is excellent. The names are very creative, it is educational - teaching colors, differences in shapes, and finding specific objects - requiring the child to pay attention and actually decipher. It gets the child to be able to be part of the story and is a good book for \\"praising\\" when they find Beaky Boo.All four of my grand children thought this was their favorite book and I have had to buy 2 copies because it was read repeatedly.I highly recommend this book for children between 1 and 6."},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"This has been one of my daughter's favorite books for a long time now! It's a great use of the lift-the-flap----Katy Cat talks about some trait of hers (how she sounds, what she wears, what she eats) and then asks Beaky Boo, a puffin I believe, what he wears, eats, etc. There are different choices of flaps to pick. We love opening the wrong one and saying \\"Nooooo, that's not it...\\" and finally finding the right one. And just saying Beaky Boo always brings a laugh! I think the book helps early reading skills too. On the animal sound page, one of the flaps says on top \\"Mooooooo\\" and my daughter has come to understand what that says (or she just recognises the shape---either way, it's a start to reading). Lucy Cousins is really an amazing author and I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Katy Cat and Beaky Boo","review":"Cute, cute cute...

There are lots of pictures demonstrating the different signs used in case a situation occurs where you may have to help a hearing imparied person. The book also includes pictures of the actual alphabet in sign language. This is a good introduction, however if you are somebody interested in learning sign language itself, I would recommend taking a class at a community college rather than reading any books on it. Learning things hands on is usually the best way to not only learn something, but also in retaining information."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Underwater (How To Photograph Series)","review":"The author does not include the basics of photography (f-stops, film speed, etc) in this text as other authors do. (For an excellent chapter on the basics, see Jim Church's Essential Guide to Nikonos Systems.) Rather, the author intends this text for photographers with some experience. I appreciated his opinions and reasoning. Rather than try and present all types of strobes, Norbert Wu states what he finds successful and why he uses them. Considering his list of accomplishments, I take his recommendations seriously. The chapter on films I found very helpful. The photo captions were great, too. I also liked that the book was very to-the-point. Again, this text is not meant for a beginning photographer, but rather someone with a few frames under his weight belt."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Underwater (How To Photograph Series)","review":"Mr. Wu primarily covers the difference in the photographic requirements underwater as compared to land photography including the effects of using a specific manufacturer's film. If your knowledge of photography basics is minimal you will be best served to grasp these elsewhere before reading this concisely written book. He all but eliminates the clutter of the basics. I felt he may have been too brief. It is definitely not exhaustive. I think that more examples of the various lenses available and their effects, camera manufacturers who make special cameras for this purpose, and lighting requirements that exist underwater could have been expanded without going beyond the scope of the writer's intent. If you need or want more detail, then this book is not for you. Overall, I think it's a good refresher book."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Underwater (How To Photograph Series)","review":"doesn't give any advice for seasoned photogs.

It helps you to understand the difficulties of hair coloring. Patricia Spencer (the author) is very detailed when it comes to explaining the different techniques and procedures of hair coloring. If you knew nothing about hair color and you were to read her book, you would think that you were an expert. The author also explains the how to remove hair color, the different products to use and how to use them. I thought this book was very helpful to me when I needed information in career training. It's a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who is an up and coming cosmetologist. maxince.curry@greatoaks.com"},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"A good second book for this series.

Also provides a peek into the workings of Quark's family circle!"},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I *really* enjoyed getting not only some backstory on Kathryn Pulaski, but also some knowledge of what she did *after* she left the Enterprise. It's nice to have some blanks filled in so expertly!This story increases the complexity not only of the plotline, but of the virus itself. Great character interaction between Dukat and Pulaski. Good insight into life on Terok Nor before the Feds stepped in.Another step further along the twisted double helix of this story. Let's hope the next one is just as intriguing."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I loved the return of TNG's former Doctor, Dr. Pulaski. And her trip to DS9, durring the Occupation, was great. It gives better depth to how, in the fictional world of Trek, the occupation was going on durring the adventures of the Enterprise.Quark and Rom's escapades were excellent too! Great, and funny! This is well worth your time to read. It's so good I read it in only a few short days. Which made me sorta mad, becuase now I'm having to wait for the next two books to arrive. (It's that good! I want to find out how this plauge gets to Romulus.)Read this, you'll be glad!"},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Well, I loved the first one and knew that the sequel was probably not going to best it. I was right. However, there's really only one hole in the plot that prevents it from reaching that position. The characters are well done, and unlike what I expected, they Kira Nerys didn't turn out to be so much of a cardboard cutout as I expected her to be (seeing as this is her years before DS9, so she's slightly different). But it all turned out swell. We finally get to know Pulaski a bit better, and this helped me most of all to appreciate her character more than I did before. My only real problem is with the plot. Don't get me wrong, it's cool, it's exciting, but it's just not as gripping as the first one. We pretty much know from the first novel how it's going to end, and there just aren't enough surprises (The link between the Bajoran Resistance and the virus is revealed near the beginning). The only other problem with the plot is the ending. I can't pinpoint it, but there's just something missing. It's a teeny weeny bit too short for a novel of this magnitude. No, the first one was better. But this novel is a worthy sequel nonetheless. I give it four. So there."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Double Helix: Vectors follows Dr. Kate Pulaski as she leaves the Enterprise, replaced by returning Beverly Crusher, at the end of TNG's second season, to Terok Nor (soon to become Deep Space 9) where a mysterious plague is killing both the Bajoran slaves &amp; their Cardassian overseers. With the help of her Bajoran ex-husband, a dedicated Cardassian doctor, and a few Starfleet medical personnel, she works to find a cure, despite Gul Dukat's concern to protect his position. Kira Nerys, at this time a Bajoran freedom fighter, and Odo also take part. Quark, Rom, &amp; Nog provide a little comic relief, &amp; Picard &amp; Crusher appear briefly. Again, the science is not too difficult for someone with little background to follow. This novel does borrow from the previous one to a small extent, but it can stand alone. Red Sector, next in the series, would appear to feature Ambassador Spock and Dr. McCoy. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I enjoy seeing Dr. Pulaski, who is almost never used. However, this book is mostly a waste. It is a slightly more escalated version of the first &quot;Double Helix&quot; novel. I am not sure it was necessary at all. All the storyline plot development could have been handled in a short story or novella. Also, the time frame for the Bajorian occupation is wrong. Kira remembers things that she simply cannot, such as free Bajor (we learn in the TV series that Bajor was under occupation for 80 years), ext."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I'm not much of a fan Katherine Pulaski, so this may be why I didn't enjoy this story nearly as much as the rest of the Double Helix mini-series. It does have some background details of Quark, Kira, Rom, Odo, Dukat, and Terok Nor. However, I didn't like very much the great ongoing details of all the people how suffered from the virus."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I'll admit that I've never been a big fan of the previous offerings into the Trek line by these two authors (Their TOS Day of Honor book being a huge expection for me). So, imagine my surprise when about half-way through I actually found myself enjoying this novel. It's a satisfying read and the authors really do capture the personalities of the characters well on the page. Giving Pulaski a bit of character development on the printed page is nice and the visits with Gul Dukat, Quark and Kira before we meet them on DS9 is nicely done. Also, the strength of this one (unlike the first novel in the series) is that the virus serves as the centerpiece of the novel without too many subplots to distract the reader.The series is showing hope....Let's just hope it continues with Carey's novel."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"This was a decent follow on the first book of the series. It was very good to see Dr. Pulaski get in the spotlight, considering she'd pretty much had been written off the show and never made it to the books. I felt the character development was very good and the Ferengi portions were written very well. The only true complaint is that the author's seemed to done a poor job of closing out Kira's story. Overall though a very well written book and thanks to the author's for a good read."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Vectors was an interesting follow up to the first of the Double Helix series. I was also glad to see some new characters, such a Dr. Pulaski. I enjpoyed reading the adventures of the bartender, Quark, his brother Rom, and Rom's son. I also laughed at Kellec, who was a Bajoran doctor and Pulaski's ex husband. Gul Dukat, a Cardassian ambassador, however, was a bit too serious. I didn't really like his attitude towards Kellec... it was almost racist. Anyway, I very much enjoyed this book, and if you've read book 1 of the series, it's a definite must-read. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"I'll admit that I'm a big Star Trek fan (have basically watched every episode, have most of the books (especially Double Helix!)). So, about half-way through, I was a bit surprised when I was kind of bored. This book could have a little improvement. All of the other Double Helix books, I have to admit, had quite a lot more action. This book seemed dull almost. Basically it was a doctor finding a cure to a disease that a Cardassian outpost was infected with. Plus, that annoying Ferengi was running around the whole time too! It almost ruined my enthusiasm about the Double Helix series. Overall, I'd say it has room for improvement."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Special only that it brings more about the life of Dr Katherine Pulaski. This task was assigned to her in between Season 2 and 3 as she leaves the Enterprise D and Dr Beverly Crusher arrives to replace her. I like the protrayal of Dr Pulaski as a no nonsense doctor. She tells Kira off when Kira wanted to pull off her own agenda to reveal the brutality of Cardassian rule. I like the character of Dr Pulaski and I was glad to see her back in action."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"The setting is the giant space station that became Deep Space Nine. At the time of the story it is known as Terok Nor, controlled by the Cardassians as part of their overall military occupation of Bajor. A terrible plague has broken out on the station and on Bajor. A designer virus deadly to both Bajorans and Cardassians has been introduced into the community. While the incubation period is of unknown length, what is quickly documented is how rapidly the disease progresses once symptoms appear with death certain.Dr. Pulaski's ex-husband (Kellec Ton) is Bajoran, a physician and living on Terok Nor. He is working closely with the Cardassian physician Narat. They work relentlessly in an attempt to isolate the causative agent but are hampered by the mutual suspicions between the two species. The Bajorans believe that the Cardassians introduced it to kill the Bajorans without suspecting that it could also infect them while the Cardassians believe the reverse.In a attempt to survive, a plea is sent out for Dr. Pulaski to head a small Federation medical team that will work at Terok Nor. It is a delicate request, for the Cardassians do not trust Star Fleet or the Federation. Yet, Gul Dukat, the leader of the Cardassians on the station, agrees to allow them there, but only if they are transported on a Cardassian freighter. Under no circumstances will a Federation ship be allowed into Cardassian space.Dr. Pulaski and her small team work frantically to find the causative agent amidst the mutual and deadly suspicions. Kira Nerys is also a fundamental component of the story as she somehow manages to move rather freely between the station and the surface of Bajor. Open warfare breaks out between the Cardassians and the Bajorans on the station, for the Bajorans now feel that there is no other hope for survival.Of course the reader knows that Pulaski and her medical colleagues will analyze the problem and find a solution. What matters in this case is the proper setting of the tension and inserting enough confounders to maintain reader interest. In this case those aspects are weaker than they could have been, the cure is discovered and the story ends with a clear setting of the stage for the next increment of this lengthy six part tale."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Pretty big drop from the first book. I just read it last week and cannot remember any good parts or any bad parts. I remember thinking how boring Kira was but that's about it."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"Good story, well-written, with good pacing and good characterizations. One thing it does surprisingly well is that, being set in the early days of the Next Generation series, we see several characters (Gul Dukat, Kira Nerys, Quark, Rom, Nog, & Odo) at earlier points in their lives than we have in the Deep Space Nine series; it would have been very easy to either have those characters seem essentially the same as they were at later points in their lives (with Dukat, at least, there doesn't seem to be much change) or to have them have experiences here which should have changed them such that they would not have been who we saw later, experiences that they should have learned from lessons that we instead saw them learn for the first time later. Instead, the authors seem to have done a fine job of avoiding that pitfall, and instead have provided plausible early iterations of the characters, who could plausibly have developed into who we saw later from, in part, the lessons they learned here.The other thing that they do well is that in spite of being book two of an ongoing series, this book is a reasonably complete story in and of itself; yes, the subplot involving the creator of the designer plagues is carried over from the first book, and Pulaski refers back to Crusher's cure of the first plague in book one while researching the cure for this one, but one could easily read this book without reading that one and not feel that one was missing anything important."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"What can i say that i haven't said already about those wonderful star trek books.Rondall Banks"},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"A mysterious villain known as The General has been releasing his biological agents across the Alpha Quadrant and testing his creations to see if they are the perfect killing machines. In the first book he released a plague that targeted subjects of mixed inheritance (parents of two different species) on a backwater Federation colony troubled with racial tensions. This time he has released a plague targeting two races: Cardassians and Bajorans on the backwater Cardassian space station Terek Nor, later known as Deep Space Nine.The book shines a light on life on the space station when it was still occupied by Cardassians. We get to see the ruthless yet pragmatic Gul Dukat in charge as he tries to save his station, his career, and his very life. Quark and a newly arrived Rom and young Nog provide comic relief. While Kira, still in the Bajoran Resistance, has her second encounter with Odo.The book even goes one step further by explaining the departure of Dr. Katherine Pulaski, who filled in for Dr. Crusher on the Enterprise-D for over a year. So we get to see the goodbye that was never shown as she leaves the ship to lead a small team (herself, Nurse Ogawa, two interns) on a dangerous unofficial mission to help her ex-husband, a brilliant and courageous Bajoran doctor, fight the plague. Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher also have memorable cameos that further the plot.Nitpicks: 1) an Amazon reviewer pointed out that Kira got her facts about the Cardassian Occupation wrong, acting like she was born free when in fact her world had been occupied for over 80 years. 2) the Kira-Odo storyline seemed boring. 3) once again the ending was rushed.The love-it-or-hate-it medical thriller aspect of the first book is toned down this time and turns into a more general DS9-style \\"station in peril\\" story. Although the first hints that a conspiracy is at work does finally appear. Overall, I really liked the book. Thought it was much better than the first one. The look at Terek Nor and Dr. Pulaski alone makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"Vectors: Double Helix #2 (Star Trek Next Generation: Double Helix)","review":"THE PLOT:This is the second of six books dealing with biological terrorism by an unknown foe. In this installment that takes place at the end of Kate Pulaski's tenure on the Enterprise and before DS9 begins, Pulaski runs off to Bajor to help her ex-husband solve a plague that is infecting the Bajorans and the Cardassians during the occupation. The Cardassians believe it is the Bajorans; the Bajorans think it is the Cardassians. Again, however, the plague has an 100% fatality rate.WHAT I LIKED:Pulaski's character is fine, as are the \\"new\\" characters that are introduced.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:Gul Dukat is far too mature, Odo is about average, and Kira Nerys is far too trusting of the Federation. In fact, her involvement makes almost no sense considering her character at the start of the DS9 episodes. The story doesn't have the same solid medical workup as the first one in the series, and the characterization isn't quite as good but it is also not as jarring.THE BOTTOM LINE:A fast-paced storyline but without much depth.

In essence, cryptomnesia is the remembering of information, without remembering exactly where that information came from. I am sure that most people, if they put their minds to it, can dredge up things that they know that they don't know exactly how they know.Along with the discussion and explanation of cryptomnesia itself, Baker goes on to explain how this very well could explain many of the paranormal beliefs shared by many people, including reincarnation, alien abduction, and ritual satanic abuse.In addition, this book has one of the best explanations for the layman of the current knowledge about how human memory works. Even if you are not interested in how our memories can delude us into believing things that are simply not true, the discussion of memory itself is quite informative. This book also goes on to explain that delusions, hallucinations, and influence by the power of suggestion is much more common than many people think, and are not indicative of mental illness."},{"Title":"Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within","review":"The book was well-written and raised some interesting questions. How many of these accusations against Catholic priests are real and how many are memories that have been created by over-zealous psychiatrists/psychologists/therapists? The same must be asked about Michael Jackson. I don't know of many of these accusations made while the abuse was an on-going event -- which is what causes the author to question accusations made years after the fact. Although, I also question the some of what the author says. I myself have a year missing from my memory but I have never made an attempt to fill that year with anything that might make logical/illogical sense. I know many others that have large gaps in their memories -- one inparticular whose childhood I remember better than he does. What would happen if we went to therapists that believed in the hynosis analysis of that missing time? Would we also be dredging up memories of abuse? Interestingly enough, I have little doubt that we would, especially as we both have active imaginations without help of hypnosis.

Well, but I worn you, you must have a good sense of humor to enjoy it and not be easily shocked by pictures like the one on page 39, taken in the streets of New Orleans during Mardi Gras. (The book also contains some beautiful or intriguing photos by Walker Evans and David Graham and others...)For many years (about 30) since my arrival in the US I kept asking myself what is the best way to describe our sense of humor, that of people from Romania (because yes, Andrei Codrescu is from the city Sibiu in Transylvania, and he mentions it in the introduction to his book, and I also come from Dracula country) or other Eastern European countries. Now I have my answer for I found it well expressed on the front cover of the book, in the statement made by John Berendt, author of the \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\": irreverent and droll. In this book, says John Berendt, Andrei Codrescu is his usual self, informative, irreverent and droll. The same Andrei that travells in a red convertible limousine through the US in the movie he made some time ago, called \\"Road Scholar\\" (same sense of humor, same powerful way of perceiving things ...)So, if you saw that movie made by Andrei Codrescu, a feature-length documentary (mentioned in his book on page 177) about strange Americans and you liked it, you will also love this book. If you missed the movie, read the book, it looks at American people, places and \\"phenomena\\" with the same eyes. The \\"Rhode Scholar\\" becomes the \\"Road Scholar\\" (note the pun!) who travels throughout the US not taking the things, people and places he sees too seriously, as he does not take himself too seriously (a mistake that many people from the \\"Ivory Tower\\" do, for which \\"not laughing\\" = \\"seriousness\\".) For me, orginally from the same country as Andrei, the book and the movie seem so very familiar, for I would have most probably observed the same things, and looked at them with the same sense of perception and \\"strange\\" humor and LOL (to use a computer jargon term meaning \\"Lots of Laughter\\").If you want to have a good taste of the book before buying it I suggest spend a few minutes to read a very short story (\\"Christina of Pasadena,\\" two-pages long, pp.165-167) in a bookstore sipping from a cup of coffee... ). It will give you the flavor of the book. In this short story the author looks at Southern California as a God abandoned Heaven (one point of view, the East Coast one, but you can understand the subtleties pro and con this view in a book by David Rieff - Los Angeles, Simon and Schuster, 1991). Andrei is irreverent about the West as he is about the East Coast, and about Paris, France (a city I love, but I would also be the first not to disagree with Andrei that the Parisians let you humiliate yourself for an hour before you find out directions in the street from them, p. 234). However, what Californian can disagree with Andrei's statement that after ten in most places there is no soul to see in the streets, and driving around greater Los Angeles area, \\"SoCal malls look like badly glued postage stamps about to be blown away any minute by Santa Ana\\". (I never said it to myself this way, but now that he did, I am sure I felt it very much this way all along ...) I thought the way the author describes the French-accented girl he met in a small Greek restaurant as \\"suffering from happiness\\" (as many Californians do...LOL), and his amusing observation at discovering her predestinate first name was Christina (\\"God made Her sign\\") were hilarious. (All women will enjoy this!) Of course the author had to insert some verse too as to remind us that he is a professor of English at Louisiana University, and a poet, which sum the story up:\\"On a faux-Greek restaurant near Pasadena Alit the Christ of Happiness Christina.\\"This is not his only poetry in the book, for one of the chapters (\\"Boston\\") is a poem, and there too he ties his American experiences with thinking about Romania (the driver of a car in which Andrei hitchhiked to Longan Airport was working for an organization who \\"could and did\\" parachute former nationals back behind the Iron Curtain where they earned a hefty paycheck for blowing up bridges\\". But well, Andrei preferred to get back to his bed in California. At least then, for later he went to Romania and wrote his view on the events December '89 in a book called \\"The Whole in the Flag:An Exile's Story of Return and Revolution.\\"The author is indeed a gifted social critic, as he is presented on the back cover of the book. However, he does it in a better way than most, for rather than making a lengthy boring analysis he presents it all by sharp droll observations. In \\"Hail Babylon!,\\" as well as in his movie, \\"Road Scholar,\\" Andrei Codrescu gives us the perspective of the ex-foreigner, who ends up in becoming a keener chronicler of the American spirit than many born in this country. With his last short story, \\"New York\\" he clearly shows that foreigners know this country better than the natives. He finds himself in New York, on an assignment by Conde Nast Traveller which commissioned hordes of investigators to various cities on the planet to determine rudeness levels (p. 233). Andrei selects an odd-shaped, strange-looking landmark, the Flairton Building, completed in 1902 from plans drawn by Burham &amp; Company, which he believes captures all the humor and the pathos of the metropolis. He starts asking people in the streets if they know where this building is, by showing them a photograph of it. All the people he met but one knew well where it was, a woman from Kiev, and Algerian shop owner, a Chinese, a Frenchman, a Haitian... But he insisted to find a New Yorker, and when he did, well, this one did not have the faintest idea where the building was (pp. 231-240).I liked the book for many reasons apart from its sense of humor and for recognizing myself in it as an Eastern European observer of America. Because it is breathing knowledge, by mentioning names of people and phenomena I knew about (Milan Kundera, the Czech novelist living in France, Ionescu, who \\"wasn't French for nothing. And, of course, he was Romanian,\\" Brasaii, a famous photographer, said to be of Romanian origin too, Erza Pound, Walt Withman, Louis Mumford, the Dada movement, etc). Because I learned about others whom (shame on me) I had no idea about, like Walker Evans. (To find out more about this photographer's work of America of the Depression years, and Cuba, I browsed through a wonderful big-format book in the Midnight Bookstore on The 3rd Street promenade in Santa Monica and I will definitely go and see the collection at the J. Paul Getty museum just five minutes by car from my house). Because it shows the America I so differently imagined when I came here in 1973 in Los Angeles, when I could not find the skyscrapers I saw in the movies of my childhood, and that most people from that part of the world have such an unreal image wonderfully suggested by the author's mentioning the question that he recalls his uncle asked long ago: \\"How could there be a Depression in America when there are so many cars?\\" Because the author's observations about our urban landscapes (and I have an interest in urbanism from my background in architecture from then the only Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in Romania, \\"Ion Mincu\\") makes us think that it is time to reevaluate them. Because you will discover or find cities you know or read about in the light you think about them or a new one: \\"Boston is a kind of Rome. Only colder\\" (p. 225). \\"New Orleans is a creature of the river, much as Egypt (before the Aswan Dam) used to be a creature of the Nile\\" (p. 4). \\"New Orleans is in many ways the opposite of Jerusalem. It is most definitely not a holy city\\" (p. 5). \\"San Antonio in microcosm mirrors America\\" (p.95). \\"Oxford, Mississippi, the town of writers - I did not know that ... (of which the most famous was William Falkner) (p. 57). The fascinating city of Las Vegas where the card dealer the author meets is Polish. And, I was about to forget, because of the fact that at times I recognize the Romanian way of writing, which I miss in English books, permitting to start sentences with the \\"interdicted\\" \\"And\\" (or at least this is my laic perception!) Two sentences start with \\"And\\" (p. 233) and I find it so pleasant to read the continuation ... his way, my way, the familiar way...This is a book by the only person from Romania that my colleagues \\"in the Ivory Tower\\" have heard about"},{"Title":"Hail Babylon!: NPR's Road Scholar Goes in Search of the American City","review":"Andrei Codrescu's sharp observational wit is put to good use in this insightful book. Mr. Codrescu, as always, looks under the rocks most of us don't even see, and then he finds gem after gem. I am from San Antonio, covered in the book, and next time I go back, I'm definitely looking under some of the rocks Mr. Codrescu did. The book is funny, witty, appreciative of the places he visits and really contains great historical and social information.

This under-appreciation may, in part, be due to elements of Mauss's sociological presentation. The book includes some complex tables and statistics in the course of its argumentation. These generally trace attitudes amongst Mormons toward various races and cultures. But the larger project of the book--following the development of LDS beliefs about lineages as they played out alongside the LDS Church's missionary enterprise--can be easily grasped by any non-specialist. The puzzling position the LDS took in regards to withholding the priesthood from blacks is contextualized alongside Mormon relations with American Indians, Jews, and other peoples.

It is written in the form of letters, between Princess Joanna (daughter of Edward 1), her (alleged) lover Ralph Monthermer, Henry Trokelowe (the man sent by Joanna's father to investigate the relationship between Joanna &amp; Ralph, &amp; the possible implication of that relationship to the death of Joanna's husband), &amp; King Edward 1. Reading the book I felt as though I was reading someone else's private mail. Some of the letters were very moving. I thoroughly enjoyed the book &amp; can recommend it highly. I don't want to give anything of the story away, but there is a dark secret about Joanna's husband with which the author tantalizes the reader to begin with, &amp; later gives more details."},{"Title":"The Love Knot (SIGNED)","review":"Written in epistolary form, The Love Knot is the story of the love affair between Joanna, Duchess of Gloucester and daughter of King Edward (Joan of Acre); and Ralph Monthermer, Welsh knight. Witness to their love affair is the cold, shred clerk named Henry Trokelowe, who is charged by the King to discover what happened in the matter of the death of Gilbert de Clare, Joanna's husband. His behavior is starkly in contrast to that of the lovers, whose passionate affair drives the action of much of this novel.The letters are written by several of the characters: from Joanna to Ralph and vice versa; and from Trokelowe to the King (and there are a couple of letters at the end from the King to various people, to tie up the loose ends of the story). Each of the characters writes in a very distinct, unique style. Trokelowe, having seen people destroyed by love, is a skeptic on the subject matter, and has even written on the subject of the danger of lovesickness; so it was interesting over the course of the letters to see things from his point of view.In the meantime, I was very drawn in by Joan and Ralph's romance, which wasn't at all run-of-the-mill. Joanna, having seen her parents have a loving, happy relationship, wants the same for herself, and it's this desire that propels her action throughout the book. The novel is short, and it only covers a period of about three months, during the spring and early summer of 1297. Therefore, it necessarily leaves quite a lot out, which in some ways is a shame, since there's such a wealth of material here that the author could have worked with (for example, Joanna gave birth to her oldest child with Monthermer in October 1297--ten months after the death of Gilbert de Clare--so it's possible that by the time this novel takes place, she would have known about the pregnancy).

What are the influences that determine which problems the members of a science work on, and how they will deal with them? How do the work and views of scientists influence their societies? My scientists are naturally all economists, but the questions are pervasive.\\"Since \\"History is written by and for the educated classes,\\" he suggests that while we cannot determine from direct documentary evidence what the attitudes of the lower classes toward laissez-faire were, \\"it is an hypothesis that is plausible to me and I hope tenable to you that these lower classes... have been strongly attracted to the economic regime of laissez-faire capitalism.\\" (Pg. 30) By contrast, it is the intellectuals who are \\"the beneficiaries of the expansion of the economic role of government.\\" (Pg. 33)In his essay, \\"Do Economists Matter?\\" Stigler states that \\"My central thesis is that economists exert a very minor and scarcely detectable influence on the societies in which they live.\\" (Pg. 63) He later points out that on a number of policy issues---shop closing hours, pure food and drug inspection, municipal utilities, transportation, labor unions, etc.---\\"we shall find that as a rule economists did not write on the issue... or otherwise participate in policy formulation.\\" (Pg. 129)In one of the last essays, he says that the literature of economics perhaps is read \\"by a number of economists only moderately larger than the number of writers... if the literature were irrevocably destroyed, most of it would utterly perish from human knowledge.\\" (Pg. 223)Stigler's self-effacing style make this an interesting collection, although it certainly is not one of his \\"major\\" economics works."},{"Title":"Before...12:01...and After","review":"Okay, okay, I know this is Amazon and it's killing bookstores (so the poorly managed bookstores say) and everybody's buying e-books -- but I still like books.

Each fought for social justice and in some way influenced our educational system. Munro gave a different perspective of what an educator activist was by including Addams and Wells. They were known for women's clubs and settlement houses. The work of these ladies influenced education although the brunt of their activities did not occur in a school or as formal teachers.Crocco shared the difficult lives of Elizabeth Allen and Marion Wright as they fought gendered norms of the time. Allen was involved in many associations and fought for issues such as tenure, pensions, and a disability system. The stress in Allen's life may have caused her death. Wright, an African American woman, is recognized for her dissertation. She gave up her children in order to continue to climb the educational ladder. She committed suicide possibly due to consequences of her struggles and guilt of leaving her children. Her life is an example of the price that women had to pay to break out of gendered (and racial) norms. However, the fact that she chose to pretend her children did not exist makes you feel less empathy for her and makes her harder to relate to.Weiler told of the lives of Helen Heffernan and Corinne Seeds. Both women influenced education in California. They worked to educate teachers and progressively reform education. Weiler also shares how they worked to create a more egalitarian society through their work in education."},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"The authors of the book, Pedagogies of Resistance, tell a tale about six women educator activists from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

It's a tale recounting how reform was enacted, how it developed and how it evolved to transform schools, districts, government, education, and people.

The book portrays each woman effectively both in their personal life and their professional life. The accounts of the journeys that these women embarked on give us a true picture of what it means to be a progressive education activist in the Progressive Era and today. It also provides today's teachers with true accounts of how to be a maker of change. The women in this book were also forced to confront their own ideas of education and what it means to be a professional and to have a career.In Jane Adams and Ida B. Wells, we meet two women whose work in settlement houses and women's clubs seek to promote a vision of education that was community based and directed toward social equality - an effort that was largely ignored by educational history. Marion Thompson Wright and Elizabeth Almira Allen enlisted others in their work that created a grass roots movement that collectively resisted centralized forms of education and supported a vision of education of social equality. For their work, they received less professional recognition than men in their field did. Their views created controversy and as a result, their personal lives remained scarred.Helen Heffernan and Corinne Seeds were committed to social equality and saw public education as central to that task. For their accomplishments and struggles they have been rewarded by being forgotten, largely due to their gender.From the stories of these women, we truly see how women struggled for a voice and for equality while instituting reform. &quot;In complex and constrained cultural milieus, women have managed to create expressions of feminist agency shaped by their own historical specificity and human particularity.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"In Pedagogies of Resistance, the authors Crocco, Munro, and Weiler take a look at six different women educator activists. The extensive look into the women's lives in and out of education demonstrate how important women were in improving public education then and for educators today. An example of one of these accomplishments, which is discussed on page 58 of the book, would be the statewide pension system. The authors attempt to incorporate important men activists into their book to reveal the willingness of a nation to help women in the profession of education. The authors approach to identifying the men activists takes away from the women's accomplishments. This seems to take the significance from the women and places it on all figures in society. I am not saying that both men and women did not have an influence on education, but, by doing this I feel that the authors have defeated the purpose of their book, women educator activists.If the reader is able to look past some obscuring items, then I believe that they will find the book to be informative and at times uplifting."},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"This book, at times, provides an interesting look at some of the different experiences and work of women educator activists of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.A broad look at the views and actions of these women reminds one that men weren't the only ones who had an impact on education in the past, and are not the only ones that can affect it in the future. Their struggles with opposition and resistance in their professional lives, as well as the effects that may have been felt in their personal lives, may make one wonder why they stuck to their convictions. With support from others and their involvement with different institutions, some of their actions had lasting effects. However, at times, the names of these people, institutions, and publications that provide concrete examples of, or support for, the women's work are overwhelming and crowd the book.While this book includes issues of race relations and gender that the women encountered, The white architects of black education: Ideology and power in America, 1865-1954 by W.H. Watkins is a nice complement. It discusses the notions, actions, and educational roles of several prominent white, male figures during a similar time period.

M.S. Crocco, P. Munro and K. Weiler. New York and London: Teacher College, 1999. 132 pp.The period in which six extraordinary women educators were very active was a crucial one in the history of the United States. It happened in the preliminary development of feminism: women's club, suffrage and civil rights organization, teachers' associations, settlement houses and the suffrage, which eventually won the vote for white women. The book begins with the time during which women like Jane Addams and Ida B Wells developed their views of education as a wide-ranging endeavor that could be the basis for social change. Within public education, leaders like Elizabeth Almira Allen of New Jersey fought for public school women teachers' right to job security and pensions. Although they were well-educated, reflective, and articulate leaders, Wells and Marion Thompson Wright were constantly placed as both different and inferior because of their gender and race. Pedagogies of Resistance strand them on its key note as women of strength by portraying how they were both empowered by the possibilities of educational careers, but at the same time they were alienated and consistently demeaned, as their authority was continually undercut by their caste status. As for Wright, she also had to face the entrenched sexism of Howard University, where she taught. Crocco, Munro & Weiler, furthermore encompasses how \\"(Corrine) Seed's and (Helen) Heffernan's challenge to the established social order manifested itself not only in their advocacy of progressive and democratic schools of California, but also in their willingness to defend outsiders groups such as the children of migrant farm workers during the Depression or Japanese American children during the World War II relocation.\\"The authors accomplishes their purpose of illuminating and highlighting courageous lives and work of six activist women educators during 1880 to 1960, as educational leaders and professionals. They convey how these women's collective focus and vision of education developed a base for establishing lessons of democracy. Providing all members of society with the same sense of empowerment these six women themselves had found was in sharp contrast to dominant ideas of the elite intellects at the time. \\"Their advance ideas about democracy foreshadowed the arguments of the current multicultural education movement that democracy must be multiple, inclusive, and collective. This was a time of intense conflict over the shape and purpose of education, as radical unions and socialist organizations, intellectuals and teachers and academics influenced Deweyan ideas contested the growing dominance of conceptions of standardization and social efficiency (Crocco, Munro & Weiler, 1999, p.118). These women educators did not just implement other's ideas of progressive education, their contribution and work extended the provincial concept of what progressive education meant in domains not previously considered.In conclusion, the reader will perceive that the book's central theme is set and accomplished with Munro's persuasive stance on page 21. She writes, \\"I contend that these collective efforts at building community were a form of democracy in action. Interactions among academics, women's clubs, and immigrants served an important educational function by providing a mechanism for people of various classes to \`speak together' as a means for widening understanding of different communities and enlarging active involvement in the work of social change (Crocco, Munro & Weiler, 1999).\\" These network and organizations shaped women's culture and identity that was pivotal to America's social and political development. The authors build the book well on this social-political development in the early 20th century as it influenced educational reform and theories of curriculum to rethinking educational history from an alternate perspective."},{"Title":"My Spain: A Storyteller's Year Of Collecting","review":"This was a wonderful read.

The \\"Author and Primary Source Index\\" includes chapters on The Bible, Literature of Egypt, Literature of the Hebrew People, Literature of Mesopotamia, and Literature of Greece and Rome.Appendices are provided for helping a contemporary reader begin a study of history from the sources, and for bringing a Biblical approach to studying pagan sources. In addition to young scholars of history and the classics, this book would also be helpful to parents seeking to belatedly acquire a \\"well-educated mind.\\"The value of this magnum opus is further enhanced by the inclusion of a two-CD set, \\"Primary Literary Sources for Ancient History,\\" which includes the complete text of over 1200 ancient works by 80 classical authors. The sources on this disc include every most important authors from Arrian to Plutarch to Strabo. This CD set alone is worth much more than the asking price.The Bluedorn's sourcebook is an indispensible resource for every serious student of history.

If you are educating several children as well as attending to your household it is understandable that you wouldn't even try to seek out such material.With Ancient History from Primary Sources A Literary Timeline the work is all done in a very approachable, logical format. In this volume you will find the names of primary source authors listed in chronological order, with a short bio as well as which of their works are extant. The accompanying CD has the writings that are cited. An actual timeline is in the book paralleling the different cultures with the list of writings placed in their appropriate time period (Hebrew& Christian, Egyptian, Mesopotamia, Greek, Roman). This volume also includes important resources for parents i.e. Using Primary Sources to Study History, Four Approaches to The Study of Ancient Literature, Bible Chronology Puzzle and several other interesting appendices.Once again I enthusiastically thank the Bluedorn family for sharing the insights the Lord has given them over the years, therefore enabling our present journey in home education to be a smoother one."},{"Title":"Ancient history from primary sources: A literary timeline","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading through Ancient History from Primary Sources: A Literary Timeline by Harvey and Laurie Bluedorn. This book, which has 3 accompanying CD's is divided into 3 sections, with 6 appendices finishing up the book. The recommended ages for this book are generally 12 and up, but the Bluedorn's also voice that each family will have it's own standards and some may use this with children a bit younger.The first section begins with some general guidelines where it divides Greek and Roman authors into 3 basic classifications. The three classifications being listed as: useful (but pre-read), mature Christians, and questionable and/or graphic. I found this to be very helpful myself in that choosing my sources will be a bit easier, even though the Bluedorn's state again, that each family will have varying guidelines. The section also covers how to critically evaluate a historical document, including detecting historical fallacies. The information given on what makes a source primary, secondary, or principal was quite enlightening.The second section is the timeline itself covering the period of creation to A.D. 476 (the fall of Rome), and takes up the whole section. The civilizations covered in this timeline are: Biblical, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman...with references to the primary sources that fit into the timeline. They even give citations to the section and paragraph in the books to easily find the excerpt in that particular primary source. (These are found on the CD's)Section three is the 'Author and Primary Source Index', and this is what I personally found truly invaluable in this book. Here you get info on each author such as: full name, date of birth and death, a short biographical sketch, list of works available today by this author, and significant excerpts from his works. There is even a nice survey of the scriptures here.Following the above sections, you come to the 6 appendices found in the back of the book. These are: four approaches of studying ancient literature, nothing is neutral, was Paul a classical Greek scholar?, the Bible chronology puzzle, sources consulted, and history curricula and resources. The appendice dealing with the history curricula and resources lists the curricula recommended to use that also mesh well with this great supplement.I would not even think of purchasing this book without the 3 accompanying CD's. These have the complete works of the authors listed in the source index. No more searching for ancient primary sources, or waiting on inter-library loans...your sources are at your fingertips. This book and cd set give you terrific access to the very best of all the primary source material available today."},{"Title":"Ancient history from primary sources: A literary timeline","review":"There's a lot of noise being made these days about revisionist history; it's hard to know who to trust. In such an era, the value of primary sources--documents by those who were there--is all the greater. I've always been a proponent of going straight to the source... the trouble is that, with thousands of years of documented history behind us, the paths to the sources can be hard to find.That's what makes this book so valuable.The Bluedorns' timeline stretches from Creation to the fall of the Roman Empire in A.D. 427, marking off important events and personalities along the way. Referenced all the way through the timeline are the primary documents that record these events, getting as close as possible to them. Not only that, but the book comes with a CD-ROM that contains these pieces of primary literature themselves!Ancient History From Primary Sources is a great reference book, laying out the history of the ancient world in easy-to-follow format. It includes the Bible throughout the timeline, helping connect the sometimes disjointed view of history that those of us who've grown up with the Scriptures are prone to. Moreover, the book contains lengthy chapters overviewing the Bible, the literature of Egypt, the Hebrews, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome.As is the case with the rest of their books, the Bluedorns write from a conservative Christian viewpoint. Folks who share their worldview will appreciate the head's-up they give on various moral issues in ancient literature, and the heavy attention they give to understanding all things through the framework of Scripture.[...]"},{"Title":"Ancient history from primary sources: A literary timeline","review":"Excellent! This orderly compilation of rich historical sources is a breath of fresh air. It is for those preparing for or in process of teaching/studying ancient history. This refreshing book with accompanying cds are purposed to \\"make it much easier for anyone to study history from real sources of history.\\" Simply stated...it does just that. This book covers Creation through A.D. 476 and includes a rich supply of well organized literature and a brief explanation of the historical figures.What I appreciate most is the clear explanations of the contents to speed my searches in both the book and the cds. It is thrilling to discover on the cds the literary works written in their original language as well as in English. The Bluedorns have also given us the permission to make personal copies for our convenience in teaching or studying.The Bluedorns clearly state that they did not intend for this work to be a curriculum in itself but an aid in diving deeper into the study of ancient history. Well done, I say...Again, they have handed the Classical Christian Homeschooling community a gem that will save us hundreds of hours of research, as we try to give our children the most thorough education possible."},{"Title":"Ancient history from primary sources: A literary timeline","review":"A great all-in-one-place resource for historians, history teachers and homeschoolers.

The essays are by recognized authorities, and provide a generally balanced view. Particularly good is the essay on his complicated attitude towards Judaism, and the several essays which deal with his influence outside of the strictly musical sphere. The only thing missing is a biographical overview. For one who is interested in having more information about Wagner than what is available in Grove or Grout, this book, along with Gutman's biography, will provide a very fine introduction to Wagner."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I think it would be helpful to point out that the author strongly believes that this training should take place during a specific time period early in the dog's life. I was hoping for help with my one-year-old dog, so this was a disappointing discovery for me. One pleasant surprise was that it also focuses on training your child to train the dog, with plenty of clear photos. The book is a quick and rather enjoyable read, and the method seems simple and practical. I am going to try it on my dog, even though the author says that missing the critical age for training will mean I'll need a healthy measure of luck to succeed."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This book came recommended to me by brother who has a beautifully trained hunting lab (who does double duty as great big family dog in a teeny tiny house!). We are a dog family with many combined years of rescues and pure breeds (depending on who landed on our doorstep at the time). This current generation is the best ever thanks to methods in the Wolters books. Already our 13 week puppy is well beyond our resident geriatrics. I just bumped into the breeder we purchased her from and she stated even they are astounded just how wonderfully well-natured and confident our pup is and still retaining great drive. (The breeder, by the way, is not a fan of Wolters...due the popular criticism that floats around).It is naive to assume all children and all dogs should be treated in the exact same manner, regardless of temperament or behavior. Agenda based criticisms of this book are as shallow as this assumption. The author of this book offers a well guided technique for training, time tested for many years now, AND possible solutions to guide owners through problem behavior. Discipline techniques are there to protect the dogs and their owners...my mother with a lame leg could be greatly injured by her 95lb Poodle if he charges past her on the stairs...as well as my 2 year old daughter. A dog that bolts from the front door may have its life ended in moments by a passing car (ask my neighbor). These measures are also only recommended IF there is a problem situation. Overlooked in criticisms are the many warnings to not over train or over discipline (your children as well) and the constant reminders for consistent and logical discipline. (I found this book a great reminder as a parent as well).I have discovered that many of Wolters fans are people whose lives depend on their dogs and their dogs lives depend on their training. His book has remained popular for many years for a good reason: it simply and effectively accommodates many people and many breeds and literally leads to a lifetime of happiness."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"Wolters is (in my opinion) one of, if not the, best and most knowlegdeable author(s)for the training of dogs, especially the Lab.I have all of his dog books. Family Dog has been especially importantbecause it gives the general information on puppy selection and phasesas well as training philosopy without pictures of birdsin the dogs mouths or any information about using the dog for hunting.Which is great if you don't plan to hunt your dog, but also indespensible reading foryour partner in training and raising a puppy in my case it is the perfect companionto Water Dog (also by Wolters).My wife has read Family Dog and now understands the importance of many things in the training of our new puppy which she wouldn't have if only given the choice to read Water Dog.Family Dog is written well enough for a child to read as a primer for your new puppy (in fact Wolters Daughter is included as the primary trainer)."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I am truly sorry that some of the reviewers were unable to grasp the Gestalt of Wolters' training method and focused in on the \\"spanking\\". I have followed this book to the letter (except I bring my pups home at 6, not 7, weeks) and have always gotten lots of compliments on how well-behaved and happy my dogs are. I bought this in the early 70's when I purchased my first Black Lab. I'm now on my 4th Black Lab and still use this method. Over the years I have loaned this book to friends getting a new puppy and helped them with their training. Each of those dogs has become a model citizen (some winning obedience titles) and none of us ever had to \\"spank\\" or \\"hit\\" our pups.I find this book especially helpful to those who've never had or trained a dog before. They are nervous about training and fear failure. I show them Family Dog and point out that the 6 year old granddaughter was doing most of the work with Tar (1963 edition). This gives them hope and confidence that they can train their pup too. After all, if a 6 year old can do it so can an adult. Unless that adult is trying to open a prescription medicine bottle!!!!My personal example of putting his Gestalt into practice is when I \\"train\\" them not to jump into the front seat of the car. I put them in the back seat and we calmly drive along. As soon as the pup climbs into the front seat the oddest thing happens...the car swerves back and forth, the brakes are hit hard then the gas then the brakes again so the poor pup is uncomfortable and not liking it at all. I stop this for a couple of seconds and if the pup goes back to the rear of the vehicle all the commotion stops. If puppy stays in the front the car goes crazy again. Genius! The dog never blames me, she thinks it's the car and much prefers the back seat. This has never taken more than twice for any of my Labs to learn. I suppose some would call this mean or abusive, but it's certainly less abusive than letting a 75lb dog interfere with driving. Uh oh, now people will lecture me on car restraints for dogs...don't bother---already have them, but they still need to be trained not to do this just in case. And every dog I've ever had loved riding in the car and going on road trips---just not in the front seat.Thank you Mr. Wolters for 4 of the best-trained and most beloved Black Labs."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This is the BEST book to help you learn how to train your puppy. The book is from the 1970-80 era; however, has just what you need to train your dog. Very easy read, relates training methods with children as well as adults and made me proud to be a dog owner!

Simply a must read for lab owners!!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"We have used Wolters' techniques with several generations of Labradors. His approach focuses as much on rewarding good behaviour and not as much on punishing unwanted behaviour. It's not to say those aspects aren't addressed in the book. But negative response is not given much real-estate in the book. He stresses consistency and trust, which is certainly 99% of building a good relationship with any dog. Whether the dog is being trained to do tricks or not is irrelevant. What the dog is learning is that he is not the \\"alpha\\" in the family. Obedience is a state of mind for the dog. To obey is to trust. And I believe that's what Wolter's specializes in - trustful obedience.The only limitation I would say is that certain breeds may respond differently. We tried this approach with a Beagle and most of it worked. But some of the methods for housebreaking had to be reversed. In our case - the beagle had to be isolated in a small bathroom after peeing on the carpet because he began to see traditional housebreaking methods as a game which resulted in going outside to play. So we did have to find a trainer who specialised in beagles. In the end - we got a male beagle who is hysterically friendly, doesn't chew, doesn't dig and doesn't bay *as* much. (He's a beagle - there are limits.) If you can train a male beagle with this method - it MUST work!Overall - this is a solid approach. I have my 9yo reading it in preparation for a potential new puppy and my son is excited to start training a new dog."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This is a common sense approach to training a puppy. The specific times for training were interesting, however not useful since my puppy was already older than the specified ages. I liked that the training wasn't all sunshine and roses, every once in a while a swat is necessary.This book made sense, almost too much sense.

Far preferred the trainer Brian Kilcommons and his book Good Owners, Great Dogs. I need all the nitty-gritty, not a broad brush. I felt the Wolters book was the latter and I didn't get as much out of it. Also, even my husband who has no trouble setting limits, felt that some methods (such as knocking the dog down the stairs if it tried to pass you) were unnecessarily harsh. We want a well-behaved dog, not one with a broken back. We also felt setting the dog up for an improbable dog-napping and having a stranger start hitting the dog for getting in the open door was way out there."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I bought this book to help with my then-10 week old black lab. I purchased the book based on the great reviews I saw, unfortunatley I didn't scroll down far enough to read the negative reviews. I did enjoy the preface of the book, explaining the scientific need to begin training at a precise age. There was also a strong base of positive reinforcement. But I knew I was in trouble when I got to the section on how to prevent dog-napping. The author suggests having a person, a stranger to the dog, entice the dog into their car, then throw the dog to the ground and thoroughly hit the dog. The author assures that the dog won't go into a strange car again. I'm sure! I'm also sure the dog will be terrified of any stranger - whether in a car or not! This, along with a section in which the author advocates beating the dog with a leash until they cry out, only when misbehavior occurs, of course, made me physically sick to my stomach. I threw the book in the trash, where it belongs, and hope that this review will discourage others from purchasing this out-dated book advocating hitting your dog.

When I actually received my copy, I read it in two days. The book was such a disappointment! In every chapter he insists that you spank or hit your puppy. In one part he even says \\"thrash the dog with fervor\\"! He suggests that you hit your puppy with a folded over lease until the dog cries out! I don't know about you, but I have a lab and even if someone is hurting them, they don't usually cry out. This author is recommending to hit the puppy until you get that response. Then he says that you should teach your children to hold their hand up to the dog in a threatening manner to keep the dog in place! This is out of date and barbaric means of training a dog. I am not an animal rights activist, I'm just a pet owner. But I see no reason to teach people that the only way to have a well behaved dog is by hitting it into submission.

We have had many dogs, mostly goldens, and we followed this book and ended up with exceptional dogs.

Wolters was not Dr. Spock, but to suggest that he was a bad trainer, &quot;lazy and undisciplined&quot; is to do him a gross injustice. I saw the man and his dogs in action: he clearly loved them, and they loved him. Wolters urges his readers to praise their puppy at every opportunity. Only when they deliberately misbehave, and then only when they are of an age (2)to know they are misbehaving, does he suggest a swat on the bottom. In today's politically correct society, that surely amounts to beastiality, but dogs don't read The New York Times or enroll in PETA, so you're safe. As an aside, using Wolters' books as training guides I ended up with a wonderful, obedient dog whom I never had to hit, not once, in 12 years. I (and my dog) owe Wolters a debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This book was recommended to us by the breeder we bought our lab from and it turned out to be one of the best books we have read on dog training. Wolters does a great job of spelling out week by week and situation by situation what to do. It is also great because it tells how to incorporate your child into the training - and not many labs like to listen to children. It was great. Our dogs are so well behaved because we followed the routine set in this book.Some are turned off because he does talk of physical punishment -but it really isn't neccessary if you follow the steps from the beginning. If you don't agree with that part, don't do it like we didn't. But the rest of the book is defenitely well worth it."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"17 years ago we used Mr. Wolters' Family Dog &amp; Water Dog methods to train our black Lab with great success. We've recommended his books to many others who have in turn done the same. Now as we plan to bring a new puppy into the family for our 15 yr. old son, Wolters' books will be required reading, once again. Of course, we will need to purchase new copies as our original editions have long since gone. Very few things in life don't need improving on--we count Mr. Wolters' books among them!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"We have used the entire Wolters series (Family Dog, Gun Dog, Water Dog, etc.) to train our labrador. We recommend this book to ANYONE with any type of dog but especially for labs!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"Like other readers, I used this book when training my first Chessie 12 years ago. It was simple and quick and I have rarely had a problem with my dog (it is a Chessie after all and Wolters even warns about them). Now a new puppy is on the way and hopefully my children can benefit from the guides in the book. In the first edition Wolters had his 10 year old son photograph it and his 5 year old daughter train the lab, so I hope this edition keeps some of that 'famliness'. Incidentally, Wolters has a lot to do with the methods used for training Seeing-eye dogs.I am sorry that folks see this book as outdated, or feel that if Wolters says 'swat' then you must. But if you want a well behaved dog, that doesn't pull and comes when called and lets go of the retrieved item, then this book will simply aid you to getting your dog to do just that."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I bought this book many years ago. It has clear wording and thought it an extremely helpful guide to training our yellow lab. I knew she would be big and I don't like large dogs with bad manners. She turned out to be very obedient. I loaned it out so many times, I can't keep track. I never got my copy back. I have to get another one, as we are getting a new dog soon. I can't say enough about this book. I recommend it to anyone getting a dog who is serious about training it right."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I have been extremely pleased with the results with my 20 week old Black Lab \\"Anna Kate\\" a grand daughter of Galileo (Ducks Unlimited Model T-Shirt Chocolate Lab). I purchased this book in the nick of time when Anna was 9 wks old. I began immediately in following the training principles of Mr. Wolters. I would have not have had the confidence to start disciplining my pup at 12-16wks if I hadn't read the book. Now Anna responds excellently to Sit, Down, Come, Stay, and others such as Shake, High 5, Belly Up and Get Busy. I have never had a dog Stay while I ran away. Anna will even drop down from a dead sprint at the Stay command. Now, the only negative thing I have to do is just say \\"NO\\" in a deep voice and she responds immediately.I have impressed several of my friends and I always talk about this book!!!! Before you buy your next puppy, I strongly recommend purchasing this book!!! You will be glad you did!!!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I have found tremendous joy in training and raising my Lab pup! I have read Water Dog and Family Dog (and watched the Gun Dog Video) and have found all to be excellent training manuals. What is most interesting to me is that really, the trainer is the one doing the most learning... the learning comes natural to the dog. So essentially, the books are teaching YOU how to most effectively work with your companion. Most everyone will ask me when I'll take my pup to school... I tell them that I most likely will not have to because Wolters' books (and many other resources) have taught me that training is simply a matter of devotion to the dog. It does take time and effort but no more than that which is necessary (recommended in this book 10-15 minutes a day, gradually increasing time as the pup grows older) to have a disciplined, happy member of the family. Oh yes, and the training done in this book is by Wolters' 6 year old daughter which illustrates his point in just how elementary the training can be."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"We started using this system with our black lab puppy when he was 11 weeks old (older than the 8 week starting point strongly suggested by the book) and got remarkable results. After just one week he started to respond to sit, stay, and come and had dramatically improved when walking on a leash by using their approach and the heel command. We'll definitely stick with the 10 minutes of lessons per day through his 16 week birthday. In fact, we've decided not to go to the local puppy training classes because this is working so well. We definitely endorse their system."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This is an awesome book. I highly recommend it to anyone. I bought Richard Wolters book \\"The Water Dog\\" about 20 years ago for my previous lab whom I took hunting with me. It gives extremely simple, easy to understand command instructions for situations with your dog that you never even anticipated. You need an easy and effective tool when training a puppy and especially a puppy that you're training to stay inside. Wolters writes in plain English about the benefits of taking the time to train your dog well. We have already begun implementing methods from this book and have found that they truly work. I would recommend this book to anyone training a retriever to be a family/inside dog! Great find."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"Very helpful book..I'm the first time owner of a black lab puppy..

It is perfect! The pictures in the book show a seven year old boy training a lab puppy.

Don't be disconcerted with a 1963 copyright -- it's still very valid."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I have found this book to be a most excellent and time-proven method to training the best &quot;family dogs&quot; on the face of this earth.

However, I found the training methods to be outdated. What this book does do well is to discuss very specific developmental stages, from birth onward, and explain why seven weeks is the best age to bring the puppy home. The last section on physical care was also somewhat helpful. As for the rest of it, I don't think I'll be employing any of the training methods discussed. In the parts of the book that discuss teaching manners, the author calls for \\"spanking,\\" or giving your dog \\"a good cuff on the nose.\\" The author says spanking with a newspaper is cruel, as it teaches the dog to fear loud noises, yet he suggests tin cans strung together to throw near the dog if he's stealing food, or barking at night, etc. So, at times, the author was contradicting himself. And I especially think that having a stranger \\"spank\\" your dog to teach him not to get into strange cars is probably dangerous, both for the stranger, and for the dog owner, liability wise. I would think a dog would not be too keen on strangers after having been man handled by one."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I bought this book because of a recommendation of a lab breeder and hunter, along with a black lab puppy, 7 weeks old. Wolters book is based in large upon the &quot;spank the dog the right way, and you won't have to do it again ever&quot; approach. The book is very old fashioned, even the black and white photos from the 70's support that. Meanwhile even developmental psychology for puppies has come a long way. I could not take anything from the book because most lessons end in the recommendation that the dog needs to be spanked, hit or otherwise mistreated (how about the section where the door needs to be slammed on the dog who wants to scoot inside first???? NOT an option for us!). I know some really well behaved dogs owned by hunters who will train them by hitting them. But if you are not comfortable with that, don't buy it.Our dog is now about 2 years old, was trained with the help of the non violent Puppies for Dummies from Sarah Hodgson, and responds to all the hand signs, quiet voice corrections and the low voice. And all that without getting hit once. She is not hyper, but really laid back, and is not afraid of us. So you can raise a dog that has a good self esteem without being bossy, even if you don't beat sense into them!!!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"A well written book with simple instructions to train your dog. Althought I personally do not agree with his methods of physical reprimands, the ideas and information is very valuable. From the very beginning the training is simple and strait forward. I will use many of the ideas suggested in this book with our new puppy. The key is consistancy and repetition."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I found this book to be a great read prior to getting my first puppy and found many of its recommendations effective. Other reviewers have found fault with the sections dealing with negative reinforcement. I think some of the things that were acceptable training methods have since proven ineffectual, but some trainers still advocate them; this book is an example of that. It is unfortunate because there are some great ideas in this book and generally speaking, it seems to be a solid method. My aussie has responded well to crate and housetraining using some of the recommended procedures in this book. I don't think this is the end-all for \\"family dogs\\" but it is a good addition to a library of training books as long as you avoid the few violent sections."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This fully illustrated book covers everything from choosing the right puppy in the litter to training all the basic commands.

Of course anyone can follow the tips in the book. Our Australian Shepherd puppy is now 9 weeks and although she hasn't done all of the training she is coming along pretty well so far. I would recommend this book to anyone who is overwhelmed by the idea of training a puppy because they break things down so simple."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"Helpful book although outdated. The book relies on photos for explanation but the captions are not well written in many cases and the photos break into the text with a haphazard irregular pace.Certainly useful and I am using it as a starting point to training a lab for game hunting but I think I could have gotten by just with the book game dog which I am also reading.I also question some to the aggressive ways he encourages training. For example, preventing your dog from getting in the car of a stranger and other techniques involve the use of spanking. It seems that method of training is outdated as well."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"I bought this book to give to my brother and his family. They recently adopted a dog from a local shelter, and I wanted them to have a good book to use as a reference guide should they decide they wanted to train their dog. I found out about this author from my brother-in-law who is an avid hunter. The book he had was geared more toward hunting dogs, so I was happy to find an updated book which deals with the family dog. I enjoyed reading the book while implementing many of its useful ideas while my dog ( a big, yellow lab) was a puppy. The author doesn't discuss in detail crate training, which we chose to do, but he does offer a lot of good advice. The dog I currently have is a wonderful, well trained dog. I give the book a lot of the credit. Check out the book - it's worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"If you are getting a dog and want to know how to make it into a good pet. GET THIS BOOK. It is awesome!!"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend that has many hunting dogs when my family brought a Wiemeraner puppy into our house. There are many reviews here that are very harsh based on the fact that yes, the author does advocate spanking the dog. The reality is that when you bring an extremely intelligent active dog into your life, you will need a lot of discipline when training them if you want to have a well behaved member of your family. 3 years later our dog is a joy to be around and people constantly comment on how wonderful she is. She has never jumped on anyone, has no food aggression, was able to sit and stay by 3 months old, and even my 9 and 11 yr old daughters can handle her well. The main point to remember when purchasing this book is that if you follow the guidelines the author sets up you wont HAVE too hit your dog! They will be a well behaved member of the family and will appreciate the consistency of your approach and they learn that at a very early age! If you are the type of person that can not be consistent with rules for the dog, then don't get this book, its not for you."},{"Title":"Of molecules and men, (The John Danz lectures)","review":"Sir Francis Crick provides a clear, compact exploration of the shape, size, and significance of the gene, the molecular basis of all life. He begins his discussion asking for a definition of aliveness. Then he traces clearly the path to our present knowledge of how the gene is structured and points out that its existence is totally a product of Darwinian evolution. This means that the gene is not the product of a prior plan, but results from a series of accidents. He also believes that most of the elements making up the gene can either now, or soon will, synthesize genes.He describes the position of several scientists who posit an invisible, purposeful substance or influence which cause life to exist within the gene, called vitalism. He is highly critical of this position as being based on wishful thinking, or an attempt to support a theological assumption.Crick is a partner in the Watson-Crick team who first described the structure of the gene in the 1950s. Watson wrote a very controversial account of the \\"race\\" to discover the gene's structure in his book \\"The Double Helix.\\"\\"Of Molecules and Men\\" is a delightful read, elegant, sparce, and by a genuine authority. Itis a surprisingly brief and informative examination of what the gene is which is enlightening for any reader.E.T.

In an answer to a reader who asked why I love Joanna Campbell so much: I don't like Karen Bently because her writing was too happy and the horses were always wining. Cindy was obessed with wining. I don't like this new series of authors, not because they are bad writers, but because they failed to follow the story line and added a whole set of new characters without telling us what happened to the new ones.

Why do you have to go and write about what you think you know? Geez, that's selfish. The world doesn't need another jumping series, but I guess that is what we have now isn't it? Why don't you want to be original? Are you scared? Did you think that you can't handle it? What is the reason? Why jumping and eventing and camp! of all things?

I do think it concentrates a little much on the people, not the horses, however, and the racing ones are the BEST. i really reccomend this book, though."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I do wonder where all the others went but it sure didn't STINK!The only thing I don't like about the book is why they called it&quot;Melanie's Last Ride&quot;? Melanie would have been able to ride in New York right?"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Okay. Let me get somethin' straight here. Why does everyone think these new books are so bad? Maybe I like the old ones better, but these new ones are good. I really liked this and Camp Saddlebrook. But, hey, give all these authors credit: it's hard to write a book! Believe me, I'm writing three horse books right now titled: Dream Horses, A Horse With Justice, and the third one isn't titled yet."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I did like this book, and I loved the first books in the series( the ones with Wonder, Pride, Shining, Sierra, and Ashleigh, Samantha, Tor and those guys.) But personally I think the books should go back to RACING! That's why I started reading them. The jumping stuff is okay, but Christina is a little brat! And what ever happened to Cindy?! She was a bit obsessive with being a jockey, but still. I mean, she wasn't even mentioned in Ashleigh's X-mas Miracle, or any of the ones after that. And also- what happened to Mandy? I want to know if she went on to bigger and better things. I wish Joanne would come back to this series, the new writer doesn't even know what the horses' names are. She called Wonder's Pride Townsend Pride in one of the books. I loved the &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; kind of suspence you got in the books on racing. I'm missing a few of the books in the series, but I'm planning to get them and keep reading. But I feel the books should go back to racing. I hope Melanie does. I will keep reading the books with Cristina in them though, just to keep up with the series. I think Cristina should be second next to Melanie in the future books, at least for a while. In this book I like the way Melanie got in trouble a lot, but still found a way to pull together, since she didn't do anything wrong."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I just wanted to say that I really like Melony and she has a lot of promise in future books!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Okay...here's the situation in my case. I am 15, in 10th grade...i first got the books in 4th grade. My dad gave me the first two books as a gift for some holiday...from then on i would get two more books until i caught up w/ the pace that joanna campbell was writing them. I was hooked on these books from the first line of the first book, and i own all of them...that is all of them until i got fed up w/ the changing story. I am so sick of the different authors, the shallower content, and the ever changing plot. yeah that may sound fine, because i am too old to find the books challenging, but who doesnt like to read books just for the fun of it. I also dont like that they are coming out so fast that there are typos and grammatical errors. where are the editors???? I even found that once Campbell stopped writing them, the other authors would get the facts of the story mixed up in their later books. Ugh!!!! i'm tired of it....i was hoping to collect the whole series....well now i have no intention of collecting this series that has changed so drastically!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I have a question. In this book it says Trib is a buckskin. But the cover, and parts of the book, has him as a paint. I hope that the series will come back. Sammy, Cindy, Max, Heather, Tor, Mandy, and Asheigh. You're proboly thinking, hey, Ash is in the book? She isn't! This is not the same Ash! Joanna, please oh please come back and make the series about racing!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"This book is okay. Melanie is a lot better than Christina who is a real brat."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I don't particually enjoy the latest books either but look at it from the authors point of view:joanna campbell did really great things with the series and the characters, then she turned over to the other writers, so naturally, after one great writer readers will be very critical of the author's way of writing. The advice given to writers is &quot;write what you know&quot; that's what these people did. They know jumping so that's what they write. Maybe they don't know the first thing about racing, think about how upset you would be if somebody who didn't know racing starting writing a whole series based on something they knew nothing about. I'm a dressage rider and if started writing about racing people would laugh at me. So try and approach these new books as if you never read Joanna's work and don't even think of them as the same series. If you were writing the new books you wouldn't want people trashing your work. You'd want them to try and enjoy your books and not always be compared to Joanna Campbell's. If my riding skills were always compared to a fellow competitors, it might discourage me from riding altogether. surely you don't want to ruin a writer's career by your bad opinions?"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Ok, look I totally LOVED the book Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle because besides that book just being all around great, I really admired Christina in that book.....she was brave, nice and not bratty. I liked her attitude in that book. So then I heard about these books coming out in the series about her and I was really excited and I started reading them and really DISLIKING them. Christina has SUCH a bad attitude and she's so bratty, stuck-up and spoiled. So either they change Christina's attitude or get the books back to racing....and if they don't then the TB series has just lost another customer! So change the series so your readers can enjoy the books again!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Ok, I know what y'all mean by the series is changing a lot but I like what has happened...well kinda. Melanie is my fav character because Christina whines WAY too much... and I hope what the other girl said was true, that Melanie goes to racing!!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Okay, so I haven't read this book yet but I wanted o say something. I think the new charachters are cool and everything, but what happened to the old ones? Especially Cindy???She wasn't exactly my favourite charachter but all of a sudden in number 24 she had suddenly dissapered!So had Len, the old barn manager. What happened to him??? Did he die??? I'd like to know. What happened to Cindy??? And what about Sammy??? Did she ever marry Tor???"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I just read this book and its not that bad! I like the racing ones better, but face it, these are more realistic. How many young girls train RACEHORSES the way Ashleigh, Samantha, and Cindy did. I think Joanna is really smart to alternate books between jumping and racing. GREAT idea and a GOOD book!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"I think it's a good book. I like how Melanie is becoming better and now has a good friend in Christina. I wish the books went back to Samantha,Tor,Cindy,Max, and all of the old horses. Possibly even follow up on Glory's and Champion's offspring."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred Series #29)","review":"Okay so maybe the books have gone down hill. But still that is no reason to critisize Joanna Campbell last week I looked up Camp Saddlebrook and found a review by Joanna campbell in it she said: 1)she didn't write the book 2)no one consulted her before turning the series to eventing 3)she is angry too 4)In one of the upcomming books the series Melanie will become hooked on racing and Sammanta will come back from Ireland and become Melanies mentor after that the series will alternate 1 book about racing 1 book about eventing. So anyway if people want to stop reading the series then go ahead but hang in there loyal fans Joanna says it will get better and Im going to belive her. As for everyone putting down Melanie stop I agree with the reader from New Mexico she's had a hard time and is trying to mend her ways. I also agree with the reader from Bountiful the series was more exciting when it was about racing but its all in the love of horses. And the person who wonders why we all like Joanna campbell so much and says that the series wasn't good even when she wrote probably isn't truely horse crazy because the series was wonderful before no it's good. so please stop putting it down.

It was set up perfectly when Glory's Joy was born, and I thought Honor Bright was going to make a good star. But it didn't get far enough to reach full potential! Is this series up for sale, and whatever crappy &quot;author&quot; wants it can buy it and write a few books, until they are booed down from their pedistol by their &quot;adoring&quot; fans? The series used to be mediocre, in my opinion, but it has progressed to downright INSULTING! Don't expect me to waste over four dollars on what is worth only the paper its printed on!

I don't think the writer is very inspired. I'm not reading these. I refuse to because they are stupid. I might read a few of the racing books in the future, but as far as the jumping stuff, I'm not going to read pointless babble. And if the future racing books are just as petty and unrealistic, I'll quit reading those too. Just because it has some races in it doesn't make it wonderful. May the writer remember that.

Now with Christina and all these other kids its taken 5 books just to get them about one month, it seems like, into the future. Gosh!! An then there is the problem with Sterling. I mean, with the horses I've worked with in the past once we've solved their problem they usually don't do that anymore. But in these books Chritina is ALWAYS having problems.

Someone suggested that I give her a whirl, knowing how much I enjoy Jane Austen and Miss Read, Elizabeth Cadell and DE Stevenson. I landed on this book, A Double Affair, and found myself completely absorbed in the characters from the very first. This book is almost the last in a long series, The Barsetshire series, so even though I was meeting everyone for the first time and there was gads and gads of past history I was unfamiliar with, I was not lost for context.This woman is witty! If you are a fan of Jane Austen at all, you have just got to try this author. I found myself chuckling with her interspersed observations about her characters, as if she were sitting in a cafe watching their lives unfold before her and recording it for our enjoyment. The books are kind, there is friendship and courtesy, but there's nothing \\"high faluting\\" about them.Now I have to go figure out which book is the first and start there. There are many many books in this series, so I should have plenty to enjoy for a good while."},{"Title":"A Double Affair","review":"Angela Thirkell's long-running saga is beginning to show signs of running down at the start of the story.

Nevertheless, this is definitely worth a look for people interested in meta-ethics (and in metaphysics). There's no doubt that Putnam is a major contemporary philosopher, and he seems to be in the process of developing a distinctive meta-ethical view. Part of that process is on display in the lectures constituting the first part of this book.The focus of Part I, which encompasses the first two-thirds of the volume, is a sustained attack on the assumptions that Putnam believes underlie ontology (the study of what types of things exist) as it has descended from Quine's &quot;On What There Is&quot; and as it is practiced among contemporary analytic philosophers. There are two assumptions he hopes to undermine: (i) the assumption that there is a single right answer to ontological questions, and (ii) the assumption that that there is some close connection between ontological issues and issues of objectivity, since objective disciplines are those in which we can and do truly describe objects (i.e. facts, entities, properties, etc.). He thinks both of these assumptions are false, and that this allows us to draw certain conclusions about the nature and status of ethics. The most important conclusion is that we don't need some special ethical metaphysics--ethical entities, facts, or properties--to have ethical objectivity. So the argument here is largely negative, inasmuch as Putnam's fundamental aim is to clear away certain philosophical errors that have led people to be suspicious of the objectivity of ethics. (Naturally, this suggests that Putnam is committed to a positive project of arguing for some form objectivism about ethics--but the positive project is largely ignored here and the outlines of his objectivism remain unclear here.)Putnam first argues against the assumption that there is a single right answer to ontological questions. Here he argues for what he calls 'conceptual relativity,' according to which the existence of the sorts of things with which ontologists are concerned is a matter of convention, of the way in which we choose to talk here. Consequently, there is no single right answer to the question of whether something (e.g. sets of objects) exists or not. There's no independent fact of the matter here; there's nothing to decide between the various answers. We have different ways of talking about these things, and Putnam thinks it's a &quot;silly&quot; question to ask whether one way of talking is to be preferred to another. It's not simply that we don't know enough to determine the right answer; it's not that the question is one we lack the resources to answer. It is, rather, that the question of which answer is &quot;right&quot; really hasn't been given a clear sense. But ontology as it is currently practiced rests on an assumption that these things aren't conventional, that there is a single right answer to these questions. Thus, if the thesis of conceptual relativity is true, there isn't any such answer and ontology is a hopeless enterprise.According to Putnam, the other general problem with ontology is that it is connected to an assumption that there is an intimate connection between objectivity in various disciplines and the existence of objects (facts, entities, properties) as the subject of those disciplines. This is relevant to ethics because he thinks we should think of ethics as possessing &quot;objectivity without objects.&quot; One of the traditional problems with understanding ethics as objective is understanding just what moral facts, properties, etc. are like. Putnam wants to argue that this apparent difficulty rests on a confusion about the nature of objectivity, for there don't have to be objective moral value entities or non-natural properties or moral facts in order for us to understand ethics as being objective. And he argues for this conclusion by drawing a comparison with logic and mathematics, disciplines that seem objective--they seem to admit of truth and falsity, to allow for allow for rational argument, etc.--and yet don't seem to be about distinctive sorts of objects. Putnam thinks a proper appreciation of the subject will reveal that the same is true of ethics.Importantly, Putnam's advocation of a sort of pluralism underlies his thinking idea here. Language, he wants to claim, does many different things, and failing to recognize this can lead to the problematic assumptions contemporary analytic ontologists tend to make. Putnam himself draws the comparison of his ideas here with the Wittgensteinian idea that there several distinct language games, and that none of them is the ultimate to which all the others must be reduced. Moral language, logical language, mathematical language--these are all objective, and yet they don't describe facts in the way that scientific language and language about ordinary empirical objects do. They do something else, and it's only a failure to appreciate the manifold ways in which language is used--the many different uses to which it can be put--that leads us to think that all these uses of language involve trying to describe special sorts of facts. Thinking that we need to posit special ethical facts, properties, etc. to understand ethics as objective is to inappropriately apply standards from another discipline to ethics. What we need to realize about ethical objectivity, about ethical truth and rational ethical argument, is that an understanding of it is something we pick up only from within ethical discourse and practice.As interesting as some of the ideas here are, this book could stand to be about twice as long as it actually is. The first part was originally a series of lectures, and it reads that way: it's unnecessarily repetitious in places, and too sketchy in others. Furthermore, it's not altogether clear what Putnam's positive view is supposed to be since he never explains just what ethical objectivity is supposed to consist in. And while Putnam's characteristic erudition is on display here--he draws on a thorough knowledge of, inter alia, contemporary analytic philosophy, logic, mathematics, and the history of philosophy--too often his invocation of other philosophers is used to paper over weaknesses in his own arguments."},{"Title":"Ethics without Ontology","review":"Hilary Putnam is a distinguished and prolific American philosopher whose views and philosophical interests have changed many times during a long career. His recent book \\"Ethics without Ontology\\" (2004) is a compiliation of two series of lectures he gave during 2001. The first part of the book consists of four lectures Putnam delivered at the University of Perugia while the second part consists of the two Spinoza lectures Putnam gave while serving as the Spinoza Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. Both series of lectures have as their theme a reshifting of the concept of \\"objectivity\\" particularly as applied to ethics. In attempting to explain the nature of objectivity, Putnam tries to decouple ethics from ontology and metaphysics, a coupling which, he believes, has produced a distortion in the attempt to understand ethics. This distortion results on one hand from Platonism with its inflationary metaphysics and on the other hand from the converse of Platonism in an eliminative or reductionist metaphysics. Such eliminativism or reductionism, Putnam argues, leads to a broad skepticism, including a skepticism about the objectivity of ethical judgments. Putnam's major philosophical hero, in explaining how ethics can be objective without being metaphysical is the American pragmatist John Dewey. Putnam finds Dewey's ethics situational and particular in character, fallibilistic rather than dogmatic, and inclined to see ethical judgments as provisional -- cast in terms of better or worse -- rather than as absolutes.The four initial lectures have largely a brush-clearing goal as Putnam tries to separate the concept of objectivity from Ontology. In the first lecture, Putnam sets forth his goal of divorcing ethical understanding from a theory of being -- of \\"what there is.\\" In addition to Dewey, Putnam praises the thinking of Emanuel Levinas, Kant, and Aristotle. The second and third lectures are the heart of Putnam's approach as he argues that there are variant concepts of existence and of identity (using as an example a type of formal logic known as \\"mereology\\") and that different kinds of conceptual forms and of discourse can be regarded as objective without commiting one to the existence of the subject under discussion. In these lectures Putnam argues that we can speak reasonably in a variety of different conceptual schemes and that, for some questions in mathematics or logic, the question of \\"existence\\" does not arise in assessing the truth of the claims. Putnam's claim is that statements can be true and rational without being descriptive (about objects). In the final lecture of the set, Putnam applies his analysis to ethical statements and pronounces the death of Ontology in considering ethical questions.In the Spinoza lectures, Putnam has a more positive goal. He develops a concept of philosophy as \\"reflective transcendence\\" which he understands as a willingness to step back from received opinion, commonplaces, and religious dogma and to think critically. Again, Putnam's conclusion is that \\"reflective transcendence\\", which is rather a traditional way of understanding the goal of the philosophical enterprise, does not require ontology.In his first lecture, Putnam traces three periods of philosophical entlightenment, the first Plato's, the second the seventeenth-century Enlightenment and the third an ongoing entlightenment project began by the pragmatism of Dewey. He says interesting, if hastily-developed things, about metaphysics, social philosophy, and ethics under each of these three enlightment projects. In the second lecture, Putnam attacks various post-modernist critics of the possibility of -- or even the concept of --- philosophical enlightenment, including Foucault, Derrida, and Richard Rorty.Putnam's lectures are engagingly written and display an enviable breadth of erudition and thought. As a result of their format as lectures they move rather too quickly. They are suggestive, rather than full philosophical treatments. In particular, I thought that Dewey's pragmatism needed to be developed more fully to make it a convincing alternative to Ontology. Putnam praises Dewey's pragmatism a good deal, but does not give it a sufficient fleshing-out to permit even a warrantly assertible conclusion of Putnam's claims on its behalf.For all his criticism of Ontology, Putnam practices philosophy in an ambitious manner. He decries overspecialization and mere technical skill and seeks in \\"reflective transcendence\\" to \\"regain the integrated vision which philosophy has always aspired to\\" (p. 1). This is a challenging, thoughtful work.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Ethics without Ontology","review":"Chapter 1The \\"New Synthesis\\".

I'm grateful for a book that makes Celan's beauty, sadness and experiment so visible in English. A labor of light."},{"Title":"Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan","review":"Paul Celan is now considered one of the great postwar poets, perhaps the greatest poet to come out of the Holocaust, and the 2nd most influential German poet after Rilke. His most famous poem, \\"Todesfuge\\" (Deathfugue) is considered the most important poem on the Holocaust.But beyond all that hyperbolic praise lies a poet who defies easy description, whose poetry is both demanding, difficult, beautiful and lyrical, and who deserves to be read by a wider audience.Felstiner provides us with one of the 2 best bilingual editions of Celan's most important work (the other is by Michael Hamburger), and supplements it with a very well written introduction and translations of Celan's most important prose writings, including the Buchner speech \\"The Meridian\\". These prose pieces will be essential for students of Celan, and cast an important light on the poems.The translations of the poems themselves are quite good, and at times brilliant, such as the innovative way that Felstiner translates \\"Deathfugue,\\" subtly interweaving the original German more and more in the repetitions of the chorus until the poem ends with two lines entirely in German. The effect is chilling. Felstiner deserves the translation award he won for this book solely on the basis of this one poem, which shocked me anew when I read it in his English translation.If you are unfamiliar with Celan up to now, this is a good place to start. If you are already an admirer of Celan's poems, this will be a welcome addition to your library.

He wrote so that he could clench in his sore fists the very world that clenched him in its.

I don't know if a lifetime's worth of study and analysis can ultimately decipher what is innately indecipherable, but I suppose you can, in a way, make the same claim for the poetry of Dickinson and Crane..complex and powerful poetry with perhaps all too obvious driving forces, but with roots that tap into depths both private, and mysterious. But while my mind can't always make sense of language and verse so richly allusive, metaphoric, neologistic, and symbolic, my heart understands every jot and tittle. To me, Celan's poetry is simultaneously an anguished cry and triumphant shout from the ashes of the Holocaust. Using the favored language of his parents, the language of the poetry of Heine and Rilke that he and his beloved mother loved, the native language of her murderers, he twists, transmutes and ultimately transfigures it into a sublime artifice that allows him to go on living in the face of an unthinkable past, a cruel and hypocritical present, and an uncertain future that would tragically end under the waters of the Seine in 1970. Paul Celan thus becomes the greatest post WW2 poet of the German language. In his Bremen speech Celan wrote:It, the language, remained, not lost, yes in spite of everything. But it had to pass through it's own answerlessness, pass through frightful muting, pass through the thousand darknesses of deathbringing speech. It passed through and gave back no words for that which happened; yet it passed through this happening. Passed through and could come to light again, \\"enriched\\" by all this. In this language I have sought, during those years and the years since then, to write poems: so as to speak, to orient myself, to find out where I was and where I was meant to go, to sketch out reality for myself.The above mentioned difficulty with Celan is compounded by the fact that for the individual who cannot read German, much can be lost in translation. There is a distinctly different rhythm to German verse, and many German words have multiple meanings, some explicit and others oblique, which force translators into critical decisions in the selection process. I have read both Felstiner's and Joris's translations of Celan, and prefer the less literal method of Felstiner. A further bonus in this volume is having the original German text adjacent to the translations."},{"Title":"Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan","review":"Paul Celan stands as one of the most influential and visible poets of the second half of the 20th-century. The work he produced from World War II to his suicide by drowning in 1970 has been lauded by subsequent poets, taught in German history courses, and set to music by Berio, Birtwistle, and Rihm. The central theme of most of Celan's poetry is the slaughter of European Jewry in the Holocaust, as the poet was born in a German-speaking Jewish enclave in Bucovina and there lost his parents and his home, scars which even a successful new life in Paris could never erase. This volume of selected poems with English translations by John Felstiner (author of the biographyPaul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew) is a fine introduction to his work.Celan's poem \\"Todesfuge\\" (Death Fugue) is one of his earliest mature pieces and the most common introduction to his poetry. It's opening lines \\"Black milk of daybreak we drink it at evening / we drink it at midday and morning we drink it at night / we drink and we drink / we shovel a grave in the air where you won't lie too cramped\\" are a powerful depiction of the death camps and fully repudiate Adorno's claim that poetry after Auschwitz is impossible.Some critics have claimed that \\"Todesfuge\\" was Celan's only great poem and had it not been for that, then we would have never heard of him. That poem was certainly his break into the literary world, but other material in this volume is just as fine. \\"Einfuehrung\\" (Stretto) is something of a rewriting of \\"Todesfuge\\" in considerably more desperate language and my favourite of Celan's poems. Here the motifs of the first poem are shattered into pieces (\\"Grass, written asunder. The stones, white / with the grassblades' ... Ashes. / Ashes. ashes. / Night. / Night-and-night.\\") which in turn are dissolved into their component atoms (Hurricanes, / Hurricanes, from all, / particle flurry...\\").In \\"Tenebrae\\" Celan reverses the relationship of God and his people in Judaism and explicitly evokes the violence of the camps: \\"Near are we, Lord, / near and graspable. // Grasped already, Lord, / clawed into each other, as if / each of our bodies were your body, Lord.\\" One of Celan's main concerns was how speech might remain meaningful when so much of life had become meaningless after the horrors of the war years. In \\"With a Changing Key\\" he writes: \\"With a changing key / you unlock the house where / the snow of what's silenced drifts ... Changing your key changes the word / that may drift with the flakes. / Just like that wind that rebuffs you, / packed round your word is the snow.\\"While much of Celan's work is haunting, I cannot make much of his last works. With the last collections he saw published in his lifetime ATEMWENDE (Breathturn) and FADENSONNEN (Threadsuns) his poetry became so hermitic and so obsessed with polysemy (multiple meanings) that it effectively means nothing. Take, for example, the poem \\"Coagula\\" which in its entirety reads: \\"Also your / wound, Rosa. // And the horns' light of your / Romanian buffaloes / in place of a star above the / sand bed, in the / outspeaking red / ashpotent / alembic.\\"Now, some of the linguistic games of these late poems are entertaining, but I cannot sketch them here because I'm assuming readers of this review have no German, and they indeed cannot be preserved in English. Like all translators, Felstiner has attempted to give the poems some intelligibility by basing his translations on our knowledge of Celan's life, but in doing so he collapses the possibilities inherent in the German text.In reviewing this volume of selected poems, and consequently the poet's entire career, I'm not sure how to rate it overall and therefore have given it three stars. Celan is certainly a poet worth getting acquainted with, but I can't help feeling that he was going astray into irrelevance with the late poems that only the author himself would have understood. If you are a fan of modern European poetry, or interested in the Holocaust and its influence on literature, you might pick up Felstiner's translations if you cannot read the original German. Felstiner's translations and commentary might also appeal to those interested in Celan's Jewishness, the main concern of the translator.I must say, however, that I rather prefer Michael Hamburger's selectionPoems of Paul Celan. In its final edition, Hamburger translated slightly more poems than Felstiner. Hamburger was also able to make use of recent scholarship in translating \\"Coagula\\" which Felstiner didn't have access to. Finally, Hamburger's introduction and essay on translating Celan show the poet's linguistic brilliance."},{"Title":"Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan","review":"I am not an expert reading of Celan.

Burn is informed without being impersonal (part of what makes his style old fashioned.It is difficult for the general reader to find good modern accounts of Agricola's career. This book does the job. Aerial surveys and some dedicated digging have added a bit more to information available when Burn wrote (we know more about sites of Roman marching camps and forts, for example) but nothing essential in his narrative has been affected. Burn's account of Agricola's unusually extended tour of duty as governor of Britain (a full 6 years) and especially of the invasion of Scotland will tell most readers all they want to know. Indeed, Burn covers most of what there is to know.What if Agricola had succeeded in his life's ambition to conquer all of Highland Scotland and Ireland as well? Speculation on possible consequences is endlessly interesting. But the governor did not succeed. Agricola went a long way - his fleet accepted the submission of the Orkneys - and won a key battle but it was too little, too late. He was not given the necessary resources, which as Burn points out simply may not have been available.

So the apple man is made of apples and the book lady is made of books, etc. The illustrations are full of imagination and help children associate letters with certain pictures. A delightful book that kids love having read to them."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"I was quite surprised when I first opened this book. The title does not do justice to the fact that this is one of the best ABC books available. The illustrations are quite amazing, full of intricate details and laced with humor. My six year old already knows her ABCs well, but thoroughly enjoyed looking at this book and thought the illustrations were absurd and hilarious. Laughter rang from the back seat as she read. It goes beyond &quot;A is for apple, D is for dog&quot; and brings a fresh change of pace to ABC books bringing laughter and enjoyment to a child and awe and applause from a grown-up."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"I am a student of West Virginia State College, currently taking a class on Children's Literature. Mr. Samples (A Wonderful Teacher) has instructed us to review a Caldecott Honor book and write our thoughts on it. I read this book and was very pleased to see that it was not only well illustrated and would be enjoyed by children of all ages, but was also a great ABC book. The rhyming of the beginning and ending would make this a good memorizing/practice book for younger children learning the ABC's and the illustrations are funny (using each item as the person's outfit) so that the child reading this would stay interested and learn with fun!! I definitely recommend this book to all parents and teachers who are teaching a child the ABC's!"},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"I bought this book on school recommendation for talking about careers. Reading the summary of it and how the character shops in the market place, I didn't realize it was an ABC book. While it is beautifully illustrated, it only teaches the ABC's and not much else. This is mostly a picture book that kids and adults will enjoy. There's not enough reading to make it a bedtime book."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"I am in agreement with the other reviewers who commented on the poor quality of this reproduction of what was a fabulously illustrated children's alphabet book with a lovely verse and the lesson about giving to tie it all together. However, I went ahead and bought the book for a baby gift and I was very disappointed in the overall faded appearance of the illustrations compared with the original award winning version. It was my children's favorite alphabet book; and the new version doesn't even come close to the original as far as quality of the illustrations, which is what picture books are all about, isn't it? They should really look into re-doing it again. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you have seen the original, there is no comparison."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"Both of my children adored this book, and I recently bought it for a great niece. The illustrations are detailed, fascinating and very lovely. The simple narrative unites the book and makes it more interesting than many alphabet books. One thing I especially appreciated is that the final illustration showing the main character leaving Market Street after shopping at every booth really *does* have one of all 26 items in it. Children notice things like that and mine were very happy that they could work through that last picture and find everything from A to Z in it!"},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"This is a book for parents to read to children that don't know their ABC's. The pictures are great too."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"Both my girls had me read this over and over and over again when they were little. Just gave it as a book shower gift and it was very well received. Great illustrations."},{"Title":"On Market Street","review":"This is a book that you love because of the amazing pictures. There is only one word per page, such as lollipop on the \\"L\\" page but the illustrations lead to great conversations and let the imagination open up.

It is a good book for young children."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"This is a terrific and dark read about an obsessive brother/sister relationship and the lady with a shady past who threatens it. I'm not going to make this a long review. I don't want to reveal too much, but if you like noir, you'll be rewarded with this book. It has all the seaminess and sharply drawn characters you expect to find in noir. The story is told by the sister who reveals more of her character than she realizes. The Raymond Chandler influence is obvious, especially as it's set in 1950's L.A. However, you'll also find a lot of James Cain in this.

Although I've never been to LA I feel like I gotback from a really cool visit there in the 1950's. Ms. Abbott'sdescriptions pefectly capture an era and your imagination. I hope andpray she is writing a sequel or something else. This book reads like areally cool movie. I am only jealous that I didn't write it myself. Irecommend it to everyone. And unlike Bridget Jones and her frothypals, I think guys would dig this too."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"You know that urban myth, story, or whatever that says if you put a frog in boiling water, it'll jump out. However, if you put a frog in cold water and turn up the heat, it'll be boiled alive because it can't recognize the changes around it? Keep that in mind as you read Die a Little (2005), Megan Abbott's rich noir debut.Recently, my mom asked me what I meant by the term \\"noir.\\" I told her that it derived from the term the French gave to the dark, black-and-white films in the immediate post-World-War-II years. These stark films, usually crime dramas, focused on people living in a world rent open by the horrors of global war and near genocide. Cynicism was openly displayed. Morality seemed to take a siesta for six years and many people wondered why it all mattered. The films, and later novels and short stories, usually had gangsters, femme fatales, cops, private investigators, and all sorts of people life seemed to turn away. And in many of these stories, regular people stumbled through a shadowy door, a door they rarely noticed and, if they did, walked past quickly or on the other side of the street. Because what these regular people saw when they opened their eyes on the other side of that door changed them forever. They can't un-see what they've seen. They just try to get back out of the door as quickly as possible and try to forget. But they can't.Lora King is one of those people. She's a school teacher and the sister of Bill King, a junior investigator with the DA's office. With their parents dead, they are the only family each of them has and they cling to each other like drifters on a life raft. They do anything to protect each other, they love being with each other. They are content. Until Alice Steele shows up and changes everything.But, like the frog in water, the change is not instant. No, it's gradual, a simmer that slowly captures you, the reader. It starts off with Alice and Bill getting married--saw that coming, didn't you?--and, just like that, Lora has a sister, a new family member, and someone with whom to share Bill and his attention. Alice dives into being the best housewife in the history of housewives, throwing lavish parties, baking all day, and, presumably, satisfying Bill in bed, probably every night. However, Alice's domestic actions hide a past, a past that Lora starts to question and investigate. She's the regular person who has gone through the dark door. Unlike other protagonists in some stories, Lora steps in willingly. And stays. And looks around. And then goes deeper, looking for the truth. What she finds disturbs her, makes her worry about her brother's safety. And then people--men--start noticing her. But it's not the men she's worried about. It's Alice.Megan Abbott has earned rave reviews for her first three novels, Die a Little, The Song is You, and Queenpin, the last of which earned her an Edgar Award. In her first book, she takes us back to 1950s Los Angeles. Like many old-school authors who actually wrote in that decade, Abbott's book evokes the Eisenhower era in a pitch perfect manner. Honestly there is a certainly timelessness to the tone of the novel. I listened to the audiobook version via Audible so I didn't read the dust jacket. I didn't know if the 1950s was referenced or not. I just went with it knowing it was a period piece. It wasn't until some character mentioned Maime Eisenhower that I knew it was in the 1950s. But the book lives in that wistful feel of yesterday, when all was better. Or so we thought.The little nuances Abbott inserts into the prose really give this novel a sense of place and time: the Philco TV, Doris Day records playing at a party, Louis Prima on the radio. Even the little nicknacks of a 1950s housewife--copper baking pans, Joy of Cooking cookbook, themed parties--enveloped me as I listened to this story. If you can't quite get a mental image of the 1950s reading Die a Little--don't know how you couldn't--just watch \\"Mad Men\\" and then bring some of those images back with you. I know the years of the TV show \\"Mad Men\\" are the early 1960s before Jack Kennedy was shot. But historical eras are not always defined by years. The \\"1950s\\" as an era lasted from Ike's election in 1952 until the gunshots rang out in Dallas, TX, in 1963. As such, the visual quality of \\"Mad Men\\" and the visual prose of Die a Little share a common bond.The prose style is interesting and subtle. The main characteristic of the prose is the voice. This is a first person story with Lora telling us everything. When she is relaying current events, she uses the present tense. When she's letting you know something that happened in the past, she uses the past tense. I'll admit that it certainly made the flashback scenes immediately evident. Sometimes, third person narrators have to use the past perfect tense to note flashbacks: \\"When L. B. Jeffries had seen his neighbor, Lars Thorwald, apparently kill his wife, he reacted with shock and dropped his binoculars.\\" (Bonus points for anyone who can identify that movie.) As easy to understand as the tense shifts are in this novel, I'll admit that they usually work better with a third person narrator. The conceit of all first-person narrations is that the \\"I\\" person is telling you, the reader, the story. Thus, by definition, it's all in the past. Having the \\"I\\" narrator--Lora King--tell you \\"I move across the room and pick up the phone\\" breaks down the conceit. It's not altogether bad, it's just apparent.One of the modern rules of writing we authors have ground into us is to avoid adverbs. If the adverb is not evident from the dialogue, then rewrite the dialogue. Or fix the prose. Back in the day, when Chandler, Miller, Keene, and others were banging out their Gold Medal books, adverbs were all the rage. Well, not really but adverbs were used in place of extra prose and, in the days where these old authors wrote hours a day and finished books in mere weeks, this was acceptable. Not so today. The beauty of Abbott's prose is the profuse use of adverbs. They're everywhere. Adjectives, too. But this merely adds to the nostalgic quality of this book. It really reads as if it were written back in the 1950s, with a deadline staring Abbott square in the face.Unlike other noir books, this novel is not fast-paced. In many noir books, the action starts on page one, maybe even paragraph one, and never lets up. It's easy to do with 60,000-word books. Not so with Die a Little. Remember that frog I mentioned earlier? Well, you, the reader, are the frog. You know there is something wrong with Alice, you just do. You probably even know it merely by looking at that gorgeous cover. But Lora doesn't. She proceeds slowly--at times too slowly--as she investigates things she isn't supposed to know about: drugs, prostitution, rape, violence against women. She takes tentative steps, each time delving deeper into a part of LA she had not idea existed. But it's to save her brother so she'll go wherever she has to go to save him.The climax of the book--not giving anything away here--is not some shoot'em up blockbuster where Lora stands with a gun in her hand, a wounded Bill at her feet, with cops and gangsters converging. No, just like the rest of the book, the ending is restrained, almost like the decade to which it owes its origin. But it's not without tension and resolution. It is entirely within the framework presented. Lora is a schoolteacher, not an action hero. The methods she uses to get what she wants is entirely within her character. To be honest, her methods are somewhat in the same vein as Angel Dare, the lead character in Christa Faust's 2008 novel Money Shot. In both books, Lora and Angel are true to themselves. Angel, at the end of her story, as I mention in my review of the book, has a choice: be herself or be something she's not. Either way, she has to live with her choice. At the end of Die a Little, Lora faces a final taunt from Alice. Alice, you see, confesses that she's played Lora from the get-go and, Alice thinks, Lora liked what she saw when she opened that door to the darkness. Alice gives example after example, up to and including the sex Lora had with a man from Alice's past. Through it all, Alice believes, Lora liked it all. Lora's answer is, well, you'll just have to read this entertaining book.What I Learned As A Writer: Word choice and pace. Word choice is the easier one. Abbott clearly is in love with words. She uses them expertly throughout the book, evoking exactly what she wants in the reader's mind. It's the kind of treatment of words and prose that makes a wannabe author like me grab the book and a highlighter and just mark through gorgeous passages. Come to think of it, I just might.Pace is a tricky thing. Old school authors started at a fast pace and maintained it through to the end of a book. But those books were nice, short, 180-page affairs that cost dimes or quarters. Nowadays, we are faced with the 500-page tomes that cost $25 in hardback or $8 for a paperback. As such, it's almost impossible to maintain a fast pace through 500 pages and some authors have tried and failed. The beauty of the slower-paced novel is that the writer can build momentum toward a thrilling conclusion. Tension becomes present on every page. Is this the scene where Lora blows everything open? Is this the scene where Lora learns something she wishes she didn't? And it's not just tension, it's suspense. Die a Little is a suspense novel in the old style, with the threat of evil lurking just on the next page. I did that with my first novel, a historical mystery, and Abbott did it with her first novel. I like the slow-burn, gradual suspense build-up pace of books like this one as long as it delivers. Die a Little delivered.

I look forward to reading more of Abbott's work."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"A heck of a debut, a heck of a book. These characters sparkle in dark glamour, the writing slides you into a lost time, a lost place. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"Usually, I'm not one for mysteries or thrillers. I just find the characters too simplistic and the events all too predictable. This book is the total opposite! It's the perfect mixture of character and plot development. Once I got past page 20, I could not stop reading. I was late for work and late to pick someone up because I was so engrossed in the world of Lora, Alice, Lois and Bill.I read one review that complained about the small tidbits of information that were released, just enough to keep you guessing, but to me, that was one of the main strengths of this wonderful book. It was ambiguous enough to let the reader make their own judgements, but not so obtuse as to be confusing and pointless. The language is gorgeous, the characters dangerous- but human and totally recognizable. The plot is tightly crafted and the overall effect is breathtaking.I just hope that the movie gets made soon, and that the beauty of this narrative doesn't get destroyed. Although, the poetic nature of the language seems so central to the book, it will be interesting to see how it translates. Buy and read this book, before the movie comes out."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"As avid reader and a noir enthusiast, I came across a paperback copy of \\"Die A Little\\" in a bargain bin. What first caught my attention was the cover art and I immediately bought it. I had never heard of Megan Abbott before, and I found myself intrigued by the story of a schoolteacher in 1950s Los Angeles who finds her comfortable existence disrupted when her brother, an investigator, becomes involved with and then marries a woman with a mysterious past. Alice Steele, who works as a wardrobe assistant in the movie studios, has that strange quality of showing very little of herself even when she appears to be baring her soul. Lora and her brother Bill have a close relationship, but that begins to change once Alice is on the scene. Lora begins to sense that something about Alice just doesn't seem right, and she decides to do some detective work to aid her in finding out more about her sister-in-law's past. After a while, I began to think that Lora might wish she had left that door closed . . . . .Abbott does a terrific job in showing the time period without becoming cliched or over-indulgent. You know you're in a decade that started out as very conservative but showed strong hints of change that would emerge later in the 1960s. The book is written in the present tense, which took a while to get used to, but it was a wise choice, because it makes the reader feel as if they are in that time, with Lora, discovering and observing with her. The first person narrative also avoids going overboard in the style of speech and jargon that was in noir-style novels of the period. Just enough to feel authentic, but not over-used and blatant to the point where you might think the author is overdoing it and trying too hard. Abbott creates a near-perfect balance and atmosphere that draws you in like a moth to a flame, the same effect that investigating Alice's past has on Lora. Without giving too much away, Lora finds herself increasingly taking on the persona of the kind of woman she never wanted to be.Subtle, fascinating and powerful, \\"Die A Little\\", Abbott's first novel, is a winner, and my favorite of all her books I have read so far, and all of them are great."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"Gorgeously written story about protecting those we love from the darkness that these characters are so attracted to.

Their lives hum along until Alicia Steele, a costume designer for the Hollywood movie crowd, enters the picture. Alice steals Bill's heart and they wed. Lora, jealous and maternally protective, discovers Alicia's past is dark and pitted with sadistic boyfriends, narcotics usage, and possibly murder. As seen by others, Lora and Alice are companionable as \\"sisters\\", but looks are deceiving. The lush descriptions recreate the underbelly of Hollywood. But the contemplative and careful Lora narrating this lurid tale offers a noir where readers can observe as much going outside of as inside of the main character."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"I was mildly depressed to read in the liner notes that the author is a PhD writing teacher. I also must confess that after waiting for about a hundred pages for something interesting to happen I gave up.The first affectation to irritate me was the narrator's use of the present tense to describe things that clearly occurred in the past. There must be a reason for this, but trying unsuccessfully to figure out what that reason is was a distraction. Good writing says what it means and means what it says.This book's writing style in general is verbose and tedious, overladen with unnecessary qualifiers and sentences that go nowhere. It is an affront to good writing that the liner notes liken this book to Raymond Chandler, who didn't waste words. In response to possible accusations of sexism, Sara Paretsky doesn't waste words, either.Another affectation that got up my nose was the use of \\"you\\" to mean \\"me\\", as in, \\"... a face caught in the mirror, a smear of what you were a few hours ago. You totter, you catch a smudgy glimpse, you see an eyelash hanging a bit, lipstick bleeding over the lip line.\\" Not me, sister; none of that ever happened to me.

They are decent middle class hardworking people who are very close to each other until Alice Steele enters their lives. Bill is besotted with her and within a few months he marries her. Lora tries to like her but she feels that Alice is trying too hard to be the perfect housewife.Seeing inconsistencies in her behavior, Lora investigates Alice's background which leads to her to thinking her in-law is involved in something criminal. A friend Lois from Alice's former life acts trashy as she depends on Alice to bail her out when she gets into trouble. Alice befriends the wife of Bill's friend, who shortly thereafter commits suicide just prior to Lois being murdered. It is only when Bill is prepared to break the law to abet his wife does Lora act to put an end to Alice's influence with the help of a very connected criminal who bears no love for Alice.DIE A LITTLE is a dark urban 1950s Hollywood noir where even honest lawmen break the law if they can get away with it. Lora is a fascinating character who loves her brother too much to let him throw his life away on a criminal and is a bit jealous of the hold Alice has on her sibling. There are no heroes in this book, only people who do what is necessary to get their own way. Megan Abbott is a fine writer who uses the first person narrative as a way of increasing the tension and the gradual feeling of overwhelming foreboding.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"Megan Abbott's novel is a rare and refreshing combination of noir and literary fiction, both hauntingly dark and brilliantly written. What's interesting is that the novel contains two femme fatales, one who inhabits the role as naturally as she breathes and the other who, by unconsciously courting the \\"darker elements\\" to protect her heroic yet naive brother, grows into a dangerous and deadly enemy.

It is cinematic. A great debut."},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"I just got this book yesterday--and read the whole thing overnight. I have always loved James Ellroy, and Abbott's first book is a beautifully written addition to the hardboiled LA noir literary landscape. I was especially moved by the poignant and lyrical prose that Abbott uses to detail her more poetic and haunting contribution to the genre. The characters are pitch-perfect. The men are sympathetically conflicted, racing back and forth between clenched toughness and masked fragility. And the women are complex, sophisticated, and insightful--infinitely more layered than the only two variations of femininity in traditional noir, the femme fatale and the innocent belle.What's best about Abbott's novel is the way in which she elevates the entire genre. This is not simply a great example of hardboiled fiction: it is an intricate literary narrative with tremendous grace and style--from the achingly beautiful reverie of its opening, to the shockingly uncanny reverses of its taut plot, to the poignant quietness of its ending.Judging from what I think is her first effort, Abbott promises to be a major talent. I will be fascinated to see what she produces next!"},{"Title":"Die a Little: A Novel","review":"Nice job, Ms. Abbott! Your novel was so tough to put down, and the writing was excellent--so much better than most of the tripe American authors slap down on a page. Your heroine was wonderful, and her hint of decadence made us like her more since it was surrounded by her innate goodness, conservatism, and family orientation.Particularly arresting was that moment when Lora sees Alice looking through the family photo album late at night--your description of Alice's expression was truly haunting and secured me as a fan of your writing.You were able to elicit from your phrasing a dense, murky atmosphere that felt so real. I felt like I was in southern California in the early '60s every time I picked up the book to continue reading of Lora's, Bill's, and Alice's tale.The characterization of Alice was gripping. Just when she's \\"arrived\\", she realizes she can't quite (and doesn't even want to) give up her sordid past. Your description of how she can keep up her public face 99 percent of the time makes the 1 percent appearance of the dark Alice all the more scary.I can't wait for your next novel!.

From the Ottoman assualt on Suez to the allied turning to take Beersheba, Allenby's march on jerusalem and Lawrences arab rebellion this was a war of intrigue and brass. A wonderful conflict embodied in not a few films and one worth reading about. Certainly this was an exotic war with Desert Arabs serving alongside British officers against Ottoman Turks and their British advisors, amongst the background of the old biblical trade routes.THis is a good start, a slightly dry but easy read on the subject which is sure to wet the taste of anyone, from those interested in the middle east to those fascinated with World War one or simply history Buffs.A good read.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War","review":"On this obscure subject it would not take much to please me --- this campaign is oft overlooked but full of interesting figures on the fringes of Empire and combines the Arab Nationalist Movement with Lawrence et al., with the grit of the British Army under Allaby.The narrative is not so much dry, but is on such a scale that it fulfills no reasonable accomplishment of scholarly or pop history: there is little of the political machinations at the macro level and few personal accounts that lend a &quot;face&quot; to the fighting. Unit action is described at Divisional and Brigade Level, which is the worst level for military narratives -- that is the stuff of official Divisional histories --- but not the stuff that makes a good read. Narratives need to come alive and this one falls flat on its face. There are few military books that I do not finish. This one I had to give up after about 2/3 s of the way through.A real shame because I think that this could have have been a real stirling effort. Even the divisional actions are really berift of enough maps with details (Some actions are decribed in the dialogue in villages that are not on the map). This is a problem with other military histories in general, but it is pathological in this book. Arabs are faceless and Lawrence seems more like a bureaucrat than a fighter.I am sorry Mr. Bruce, you need to do better next time, especially with something as important as this campaign."},{"Title":"Nanny to the Rescue!: Straight Talk and Super Tips for Parenting in the Early Years","review":"...I can actually comment on it.

This is a must read for all those parents out there who are tired of all the rude, misbehaving children they see who run all over their parents out in public and all too often, are amongst their friends. By following Michelle's suggestions, you will NOT be the parent that everyone is afraid to tell the truth to about how your children really behave."},{"Title":"Nanny to the Rescue!: Straight Talk and Super Tips for Parenting in the Early Years","review":"After reading Nanny to the Rescue, I was very impressed with the straight forward answers that Michelle LaRowe has given to everyday questions that new parents , grandparents or child care providers have and how these questions were answered. This book has shed light on alot of subjects and has certainly opened my eyes as to the simple ways those embarassing moments we go through as parents can and should be handled in a very calm and effective way. When I see a parent struggling in the supermarket with a toddler in tow who is screaming because he cant have that sugar coated cereal that he sees on television and the mom is arguing back with him, I would love to go up to this mom and hand her a copy of Nanny to the Rescue. I would recommend this book to anyone who is blessed enough to have a child in their life."},{"Title":"Nanny to the Rescue!: Straight Talk and Super Tips for Parenting in the Early Years","review":"I loved this book.

I don't really think so. I've worked for over 17 years in the childcare/home management industry and I can let all of you in on a trade secret. When I go into a home with numerous books, magazines, news articles etc. about parenting it is a huge signal to me, as well as my fellow nannies, to walk away from the job. All of this information is actually too much. Sometimes the best advice is to listen to your instincts and do what is right for you and your child, not what everyone is telling you to do.I've worked for parents that are so wrapped up in following the advice of the \\"experts\\" that they lose sight about what is really going on in their childrens lives.One piece of advice-be consistent-it's not easy but if you can manage this you would be amazed at how well things will be!!If you must read one book about parenting I suggest The Three Martini Playdate, A Practical Guide to Happy Parenting by Christie Mellor-it includes chapters on Bedtime: Is Five-thirty too Early? and Children's Music: Why?Why would I recommend this? It is very funny, the author does not profess to be an \\"expert\\" and after a long day where nothing has gone right (and we all have those days) this book will make you laugh and when you are taking care of children, whether they are yours or someone else's it is very important to keep your sense of humor and laugh!"},{"Title":"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology","review":"This is fringe literature.The author begins by demonstrating that this mystical stuff is much more powerful than traditional science - Jesuits lost their minds studying the I Ching, for example.

He poses this idea in the form of a question - so you can't outright accuse him of anything, but he has a cartoon drawing below the statement, highlighting his theory.Just dumb.

The state of human affairs is beyond hope and rescue. Man is not evolving - he is devolving. The Gods abandoned this earth long ago due to the depravity of the humans they created in their own image. They tried to wipe them out with the Great Flood, but like a virus or bacteria, humankind continues to spread its hate, selfishness and toxicity which will eventually destroy the environment.A \\"cosmic beam\\" is not going to change anything within human minds or \\"souls\\", although I agree that cosmic events may stimulate cataclysms on the planet which would obviously have a profound effect - but will that change human nature? Humans will always be the same - just look back in history to realize that we haven't changed in 5000+ years. We are still a greedy, selfish, depraved and stupid creature totally out of touch with nature as we continue to decimate the planet.I like the author's candor about his new age feelings but find it very difficult to read this type of book with any belief or true understanding. One can look for and conjure up mystical meanings in just about anything and we have seen so many new age predictions fail. Remember when 2000 was going to the year of total disaster? Hmmm...So, all those who are waiting for some miraculous occurence or event, some magical new \\"awareness/conciousness/love/dawing of the age of aquarius\\" it just ain't going to happen.

For me it was impossible to understand what he was talking about with all the numerology.A lot of the Mayan art work contains monstrous creatures who are always frowning and looking sad. That's probably a warning about the possible dangers of getting involved with the I Ching. At the beginning of the book it states that some Jesuit monks had experimented with the I Ching and they went insane. (The I Ching appears in the tv show 'Dark Shadows' as a way to open doors to other domains.)I wasn't able to read the last chapter because I started to sense the horrible occult energy coming from the book. Then I heard a voice say 'we are the keepers of the light'. I can't imagine who was telling me this.This often happens when I read books which are based on occult or satanic ideas such as for example The Da Vinci Code.On the positive side there are some beautiful illustrations that I think the author created himself. The author is certainly an unusual person who has a background in art history. Another reviewer said the author thinks he's a reincarnation of one of the Lords Of Time. Certainly anyone with such an intense interest in Mayan history must have had past life experiences as a Mayan.

This book is what I call a &quot;long lingering lesson,&quot; meaning the longer you allow Arguelles' message to linger in your thoughts, the more poignant the lesson becomes! For me reading the Mayan Facor was like sipping a glass of 1996 Bordeaux; when I was done I was refreshed, yet thirsted for more, and the world didn't quite look the same anymore!

Argulles has apparently amassed quite a little following by charging people for &quot;further information,&quot; but this book really is all one needs to understand his bizarre interpretations of Mayan spirituality. Nonetheless, it is a strangely good read."},{"Title":"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology","review":"This is the first book I have read in a series of Mayan religion and culture. This book is absolutely necessary for anyone studying the Mayan culture. It provides an unorthodoxed look at there culture and religion. It will furthermore open ones mind to the abilities of our predecessors, and show that there is much more to be learned of our history as humanoids. This book has fantastic technical merit. I am not a archaeologist or a anthropoligist or even a paleontologists. Therefore i can not credentially state that this book is true. But I have read many Mayan books now and after much experience it has opened into a labyrinth of mystery. One that may not be solved but so fabulous to learn. For anyone looking at this book you need this, for education or for spiritual growth of your own discipline. It will propel you to better and broader horizons. I would like to thank the author for revealing another side of what i see as a biased history of the Mayans. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology","review":"I know many people look to Maya spirituality as a guide for their own spiritual journeys and I think that is great. In some ways, it helps promote intercultural understandings. This book does not do that however. Arguelles' work is a mixture of pure conjecture, misrepresentation and bad scholarship. Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of real Maya spiritual practices will be able to identify the errors in fact and application of his unique perspective on time and the Maya Universe.Arguelles' book entices unwary souls who are searching for enlightenment, but does them and the Maya people a severe injustice. IF you want to believe in Harmonic Convergences and the like then go ahead and buy this book. If you want genuine insight from real practicioners of Maya spiritual knowledge and from people who know and respect Maya culture, this is not the book for you.I would recommend the following anthropologists' works &quot;Time and the Highland Maya&quot; by Barbara Tedlock, Dennis Tedlock's annotated translation of &quot;The Popol Vuh&quot; with K'iche shaman Andres Xiloj, and &quot;Tortillas for the Gods&quot; by Evon Vogt.

It reads like an acid ramble -- cosmic assertions tumble over startling insights, with no notion sustained beyond two sentences, properly connected to others, or backed by evidence. I kept waiting for him to settle down and present out some facts and build his case, but he just keeps laying bricks on air. I researched some of the more checkable facts, and found him generally wrong: for example, Isamu Noguchi's &quot;The Sculpture to be Seen From Mars&quot; looks nothing like the &quot;face on Mars&quot; (which was an illusion anyway), which he says shocked him into realizing the transmission of universal information. The irony is that despite savaging Western science as unable to understand the Maya, he is so absorbed in his own insights and revelations and discoveries that he never tries to see the Maya through their own eyes, as any good scientist would, and so fails to truly respect the subject he supposedly exalts."},{"Title":"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology","review":"When this book first came out it presented radically new ways to interpret history, time, and consciousness. However the concepts in this book are all over the place and lack any coherant grounding into the Mayan Calendar. Occasionally facts about the Mayan Long count are presented in error.More often imagined correspondences and inventions such as 'The Loom Of The Maya' are presented as cosmic fact when they are products of Joe's imagination. Joe is a great artist and should present himself as such and not apostle of the next Baktun. The only way you could believe you are reading truth here is if you allow yourself to turn off discrimination and accept whatever wild stuff he says.I have no doubt that Joe, has opened himself up to either off-world information and/or the depths of his own imagination. But this 'artistic' plethora was never grounded either in historical facts about the Mayan nor in logical thinking. The work remains a very loose artistic interpretation with Mayan influences.Example from this book: \\"Instantaneously releasing themselves through chromo-molecular transport into the farther reacher of the galaxy into whence they had come, the Mayan sages nonetheless also prepared for a return.\\"Ok, that one had the word Maya in it. But where does this concept of chromo-molecular transport come from? We have no evidence of this concept in Maya life either past or present. It, like much other in this book, comes from Joes imagination.Ultimately and unfortunately Mr Arguelles became convinced of his identity as a reincarnated Pacal Votan (Lord of Time) and created another system of Mayan glyphs called the Dreamspell. Dreamspell is not based on the pure interpretation of the Mayan Tzolkin. It is an invention that detracts from the original Mayan teachings.So while the book does provide some interesting, if not incomprehensible, introduction to the Mayan calendar it is based on imagined predicates of what later becomes an incomprehensible Dreamspell system. The author has been changing this concept and his websites almost continually.More authentic sources on this subject are John Major Jenkins, Barbara Tedlock, and Carl Johan Calleman. In fact Calleman can be considered a disciple of Arguelles. Callemans 'Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time: The Mayan Calendar' and 'The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness' form the crux of an authentic system of study and understanding based partly on MAYAN galactic concepts. However even Calleman provides a mix of Mayan and non-Mayan concepts without letting you know which is which. So you could call Callemans 'The Mayan Calendar And The Transformation Of Consciouss' by another name as 'The Mayan Factor 2'."},{"Title":"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology","review":"This is an amazing work.

It is a seminal work which should be on the bookshelf of every psychotherapist and counselor. Carkhuff and Berenson demolish much of the mystification of psychotherapy, as they clarify whiich qualities are critical in a counselor, in forming the \\"counseling relationship.\\" I was shocked to learn that-as a whole--the counseling profession has no effect on its patients. How could this be? The authors explain--with ample documentation--that while some therapists are very effective, others sport abysmal performance. Their patients actually WORSENED during therapy. Not only that, but the general pattern appeared to be that those at the top of the academic/professsinal \\"totem pole\\" (namely, analysts and psychiatrists) were the LEAST effective with patients/clients. I had suspected such, but to have this perception validated by solid research was a revelation.In their studies, these two employed a kind of simplified five-point \\"Tone Scale.\\" \\"2\\" was designated as neutral in efffect (no harm incurred, but no case-gain), while anything above \\"2\\" signaled a positive outcome, and a rating below \\"2\\" meant case progress was impaired, and the client left sessions in worse shape than when he/she entered. Most analysts and psychiatrists rated \\"2\\" and below. Many with less education, training and experience rated \\"3\\" or above (on a number of dimensions).

This was one of the books that put \\"legs\\" under that movement toward humanistic psychology and effective counseling and therapy. Beyond Counseling and Therapy was the books that opened the door to a truly professional look at the amazing world that counseling had shown me at that time. Taking the work of Carl Rogers and making it measurable, valid and reliable opened up the ability to truly study what worked in helping people.Today, as we take it further in both the fields of psychotherapy and the growing field of coaching we need to re-ground ourselves in THE FACILITATIVE CONDITIONS that Carkhuff & Berensen (and Truax in other books) spoke about: genuineness, empathy, unconditional positive regard, etc. Despite all the techniques and theories that abound today and all the emphasis on the cognitive, it has been shown time and time again that it is the PRESENCE of the helper and the RELATIONSHIP of that person that makes all the difference in effectiveness.Go back in counseling's history and steep yourself in this book to recapture the heart and soul of this work we're honored to do.Michael Arloski, Ph.D., PCC - Author of Wellness Coaching For Lasting Lifestyle Change"},{"Title":"Atomic spectra and atomic structure (A Dover paperback)","review":"Updated classic paperback text that covers a broad area from Balmer series to Nuclear Spin.

I have an older copy which I used during my undergrad years, as it was recommended reading for my undergrad research work."},{"Title":"Atomic spectra and atomic structure (A Dover paperback)","review":"Please note that this review is based upon the paperback Dover edition of this book (the second edition published in 1944) that I have had for many years, not the photocopied version listed here. As such, there was no problem with the clarity of the text or other features that may be deficient in the photocopied version. Thus, a prospective reader is advised, if possible, to seek out a used Dover edition.An immediate question comes to mind when considering this book - why should one spend time with a physics book that was written in 1933? I like this book because I think that it still holds up because the structure data that it explains is still valid. When this book was written the problem of explaining spectra lines was at the cutting edge of physics and the solution to this problem lay in the newly developed field of quantum mechanics. Today, the problem of spectra lines has largely been superceded by other quantum mechanics problems and the analysis of spectra lines is relegated to a few introductory lines in textbooks or to specialist literature. This book treats the subject as it was in 1933 - the vehicle to understanding how quantum mechanics explains the nature or the electronic structure of an atom. The book is based upon the Bohr atom and explains the origin of the Balmer lines and gives a clear description and explanation of the Zeeman and Stark effects (at least in terms of 1933 QM). The discussions are clear and provide a somewhat more physical interpretation of electronic energy levels than those of more abstract modern theories. It provides a great introduction to atomic spectra and is a great adjunct to more modern approaches.I recommend this book to those who want to understand the origins of quantum mechanics and the origin of spectra lines. While the Bohr atom is largely obsolete, it does provide a physical picture that I find helpful in understanding the nature of the electron energy levels."},{"Title":"Wasp Farm","review":"Many of us associate wasps with the uninvited guests at the family outing. Politely requesting the common yellow jacket to disarm and retreat never seemed to produce the desired result. In a flash, you are the recipient of a wound inflicted by an elite stinger. This imagery may conjure feelings of pain for us commoners; however, longtime entomologist Howard Ensign Evans delivers the elixir by educating his readers on the intricacies of wasp life.In his book, Wasp Farm, Evans takes us to a place where wasps, not humans, are the ultimate landscape engineers. By sharing his own personal experiences, the author brings us into their world, an 8-acre parcel of meadows, sandpits and forest in upstate New York. He explores the life of these conundrums through his own observations of the habitats in which they live, their physical features, behaviors, and lives as predator and prey. A variety of topics are covered, but wasp evolution is the major theme. Through logical analysis and contemplation, not necessarily scientific means, the author makes inferences and generalizations about wasp evolution and provides numerous examples of radiation and convergence.The chapters in Wasp Farm are organized into a logical format and each serves as a prelude to the next. Evans begins with a preliminary discussion of Wasp Farm and how it came to be. He effectively describes primitive wasps in the early chapters. For example, Priocnemis minorata (hunter of spiders) is common in the Northeastern states and emerges from its winter slumber in early April. It begins the new season by burrowing deep into the forest floor and spends much of its life hunting for spiders. Its stinger is not used primarily for defense, but instead acts as an apparatus for administering tranquilizers during the final phase of the hunt. The venom temporarily paralyzes a spider just long enough for her brood to feed on a living organism. Some spiders have been kept alive for 33 days by a single sting! Conversely, Cipogon sayi nests in pre-existing burrows of wood where it constructs a series of cells for its progeny. As the chapters progress, more advanced species of wasp are introduced and compared to the relatively primitive species in terms of similarity and improvement. Cleptoparasitic wasps, such as Evagetes parvus, need not hunt for spiders, but instead another species of wasp. By inconspicuously infiltrating the nest of Anoplius marginatus, E. parvus replaces the egg of A. marginatus with its own. Once the larva emerges, it will feast on the incapacitated spider. The final chapters conclude with the most advanced of the wasp species, the socialites: paper wasps and yellow jackets.Prior to reading Wasp Farm, I assumed that all wasps behaved in an identical manner and had the propensity to sting at first sight. Fortunately, Evans enlightens and provides us with a deeper understanding of wasps. Most species of wasp are in fact solitary and go about their business without a care for humans. Once their emergence in either early Spring or Summer, the sexes mate and the male is virtually useless thereafter. Sounding familiar? Females rule this world and bare the responsibility of providing for the persistence of the species by digging burrows, hunting, laying eggs and much more. If it were up to the males, most wasp species would surely perish. Interestingly, the stinger that humans associate with pain is actually a modified egg-laying apparatus. Presumably, it evolved over millions of years through natural selection and evolution. If you are allergic to the wasp venom, it is certainly the female that you are leery of. Only certain male wasps have evolved a pseudo stinger, but fear not. Unlike their female counterparts, their stinger did not evolve from an egg laying apparatus and therefore lacks venom glands. Some wasps even utilize tools and all species have an interesting mechanism for sex determination. Read this book and you too can impress others with your newfound knowledge.Howard Ensign Evans received a master's degree in entomology and a Ph.D. in insect taxonomy. He has written a number of articles for scientific journals and was also curator at the Harvard Museum of Zoology. He has successfully written a number other books pertaining to wasps. Another recommended title is Studies on the larvae of digger wasps (Hymenoptera, Sphecidae).Anyone who is turned off by insects, particularly wasps, should read this book. It will certainly provide a refreshing point of view and newfound appreciation for these creatures and the ecological niches they fulfill. Wasp Farm is a clearly written masterpiece that will appeal to all ages, both male and female. Compared to other books in Biology that are highly structured and esoteric in speech, Wasp Farm grasps the reader's attention through the use of clear, concise language in addition to the effective use of illustrations and photographs. You will surely expand your insect knowledge and vocabulary for the author frequently uses Latin terminology. Do not fret if you are unfamiliar with the language, for the end of each chapter provides adequate definitions for each genus and species.This book succeeds in convincing one that they need not spend any money to see unique life forms on this Earth. By venturing into one's own surroundings, you can explore the fascinating lives of these creatures and revel in their complexity."},{"Title":"Wasp Farm","review":"This book provides an informal introduction to some aspects of wasp observation. The author, Howard Evans, was an entomology professor at Cornell University. While working at Cornell, he lived on a small farm outside of the town of Ithaca and spent much of his spare time in the summers observing wasp behavior at his farm. In this book, Evans describes some of his findings during his observations. The book is presented in the form of short essays around various topics of wasp life. The essays cover such information as the wasp family, wasps and evolution, egg-laying, wasp nests, wasp prey and methods of transporting prey, attracting wasps, spider wasps, great wasps, sand wasps, bee wolfs, and social wasps. The book is illustrated with plates of black-and-white photographs. Suggested readings for further information appear at the end of each chapter, and there is an index.When I first picked up this book, I expected to learn all about the pesky wasps that construct paper nests in our woodshed. Evans explains that these are social wasps, and while he does provide a chapter about social wasps, his main interest is in the different types of solitary digger wasps, which the majority of the book is about. Evans seems to see them everywhere, not only on his farm in Ithaca, but also when he was growing up in the Midwest, and in the desert as well. Although they are quite common, I had never noticed them before reading this book, and I certainly knew nothing of their particular feeding and egg-laying behavior. Evans book is quite informative, although I wish in places it had gone into greater detail and been a little less informal."},{"Title":"Wasp Farm","review":"Wasps are all around during the summer months here in Virginia and I was curious about them so I went in search of a book to learn more and found this one - glad I did. It hasore information that I could have guessed on wasps - It talks to what they eat, how different wasps form &quot;nests/burrows&quot;, howthey carry food, why they're a beneficial insect, and even some wasp lore. Latin names are used when discussing different wasps. The text is easy to read, conversational most. I enjoyed it and gota lot out of the many details. It has photos and drawings too."},{"Title":"Wasp Farm","review":"\\"Wasp Farm\\" is easy to read, interesting, fascinating, even funny. It's one of the better popularized works on natural history I've read. The book was published already in 1963. My copy used to be the property of the Franklin Public Library in Ohio.The author, Howard Ensign Evans, bought a farm and eight acres of land in upstate New York with the sole purpose to study wasps. Hence, the name Wasp Farm. His wife was in on it, too. The kids were not. The family eventually had to sell Wasp Farm and move to Suburbia. Personally, I can't stand insects, but I like the author's single-minded determination. I guess Evans is the Aldo Leopold or Thoreau of wasps!Evans deliberately kept his farm and the adjacent garage in unkempt condition, nor did he remove weeds or brambles from his land. Pruning the apple trees was another no-no. Unsurprisingly, Wasp Farm soon attracted more than its fair share of bugs. That, after all, was the point.The wasps described in the book belong to the families Vespidae, Sphecidae and Pompilidae. Most are solitary, but one chapter deals with the social wasps, including yellow jackets and the Black Paper Wasp. Among more exotic creatures covered are Isodontia, the only wasp that builds nests of grass, the scavenging Microbembex, and a spider wasp that walks on water and even dives (!). The author also discusses whether or not the wasp known as Ammophila really uses tools.Since \\"Wasp Farm\\" was written in 1963, some of the research may be out of date. Or it may not. A scientific book from 2001, \\"Solitary Wasps\\", still quote a research paper written by Evans over 40 years ago! I suppose it's hard to get research grants to study Microbembex.Reading \\"Wasp Farm\\", on the other hand, wasn't hard at all. Recommended for both wasp-lovers (a small minority, I gather) and the general reader."},{"Title":"Wasp Farm","review":"Wasp Farm, by Howard Ensign Evans, published in 1963, aims to increase public knowledge and interest in sciences in general and entomology specifically. This natural history book is organized into 15 chapters, 12 of which deal primarily with specific types of wasps. The first chapter talks about the writers attempt to create a \\"wasp farm\\" for which the book is named. The last two chapters deal with the evolution of wasps, recap the various groups of wasp, and give some mention to the existence of more obscure wasps with somewhat different behaviors. The Evans is a PhD in insect taxonomy and spends a great deal of time focusing on the distinctions between various types of wasps and highlighting the variety of behaviors even among species native to the same area.Wasp Farm is a well written book on the classification and behavior of various wasps. It reads at about a high school level and requires little prior knowledge of the subject. Basic concepts are addressed as they are needed without being overstressed to the point that the book would become tedious to those with more background. The writer comes across as knowledgeable without the ivory tower feel some writers fall into. Specifically, ideas a communicated without the use of overly specialized words or overly complex sentence structure. Overall, the book is both accessible and enjoyable for a wide variety of people. Both laymen and seasoned scientists are likely to feel satisfied by the scope of information covered.While no errors or out of date material was apparent in the book, one should keep in mind that it is over 40 years old. The observations and facts in the book are unlikely to change but may no longer be as complete as possible. No bias was evident in the book aside from the author's greater fondness for solitary wasps over social wasps. Even this didn't manifest outside of a few anecdotes about meeting people introduced as wasp experts who focused almost entirely on paper wasps and the somewhat uninspired section on paper wasps in the book.This book is not so much a dry collection of facts, but a documentation of the writer's discovery of those facts. This method of writing creates a very interesting and easy to read narrative. This is not to say that the book is devoid of factual content. The book focuses heavily on the behavior of various wasps such as nest structure and offspring care. The writer, by his own admission, has a particular love of solitary wasps and is somewhat less than enthusiastic about social species such as paper wasps. Perhaps this is why his section on paper wasps seemed forced, born of duty rather than passion.Perhaps as interesting as the description of wasps is the subtext of the scientific method. The author stresses the importance of careful and detailed observation along with intelligent experiment design. On occasion Evans addresses theories or observations he considers to be jumping to conclusions. The less glorious aspects of research such as digging out a nest or waiting in the hot sun for a wasp to return from hunting are honestly portrayed. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in zoology and would consider the book a must read for those going into entomology."},{"Title":"Railroads Their Origins and Problems","review":"For a time in graduate school I was enthralled with the agrarian revolt of the latter nineteenth century, especially as manifested in the Grange and Populist movements. I read voraciously about it, and one of the books that I studied was Charles Francis Adams's \\"Railroads: Their Origins and Problems,\\" originally published in 1878 in the midst of this protest. A core complaint of the agrarians was the oligarchy of railroad magnates that controlled the primary means of transportation for products to market. The farmers rebelled against what they thought was price gouging and pressed for a series of laws regulating the railroads in the Midwest and Great Plains states, known collectively as the Grange Laws. This led to a national effort to regulate the railroads, and other industries, culminating in 1887 with the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act.Part of the problem that those regulations sought to remedy is detailed in this important book by Charles Francis Adams Jr. A member of the elite Adams family of Massachusetts, Adams was nonetheless a partisan of the agrarians in their efforts to regulate the railroads less out of a sense of justice than his belief that economic chaos reigned in the industry. Adams rose to prominence during the Civil War and thereafter was appointed to the Massachusetts Railroad Commission.One of the fastest growing, loosest, and potentially most lucrative sectors of the American economy in the latter nineteenth century, railroading was the internet bubble of its time. Adams tried to work with the railroad magnates to create greater order in their industry, for the good of all investors (but only tangentially for the public at large). He believed that by exposing negative traits to the public these railroad magnates would reform themselves. He was wrong. For reasons of self-interest, greed, and corruption his efforts along those lines never bore significant fruit.In frustration Adams wrote \\"Railroads: Their Origins and Problems\\" in 1878, after having already exposed the railroad war between Jay Gould and Cornelius Vanderbilt in \\"Chapters of Erie\\" (1871). \\"Railroads: Their Origins and Problems\\" was an attempt to lay out the problems with the railroads and to prescribe processes whereby this massively significant transportation system might be stabilized. In the book Adams focused on issues of corporate power, the government's role in the industry as regulator or perhaps owner, and the problems of the unfettered freedom in the business that had led to the ruin of many. He argued for a more aggressive regulatory environment as something necessary for the good of investors. By coming together to create stability in the marketplace, he asserted, all those involved in the business would benefit. Not to do so would lead to one of two outcomes. Either many companies would become bankrupt and the industry would be decimated or state governments would step in to create a regulatory environment that would become a \\"crazy quilt\\" of various laws and conflicting philosophies. Neither outcome was desirable, Adams believed. This is the analysis that Adams lays out in this book, and the group action of the railroad owners eventually helped to create order in the system.This book is an important statement of the requirement for government regulation. It helped pave the way for the Interstate Commerce Commission and other bodies aimed at maintaining order in the Gilded Age of the latter nineteenth century. I am pleased that Cosimo Classics has reprinted it so that it is available once again for modern readers."},{"Title":"Women in Purple","review":"A history of three Byzantine empresses, all of whom lived during the Iconoclasm controversy of the late eighth and early to mid-ninth century (another appropriate topic considering the recent violence in the Muslim world over the cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammed). Herrin suggests that the power held by these women is the result of the weakness of the empire in the face of an expanding Islam, which itself was a motivation for the Iconoclast movement. (\\"The Muslims are winning battles; therefore the reason we're losing must be that God doesn't approve of representative art.\\") Interestingly, Irene (who actually ruled on her own as \\"Emperor\\" after deposing and blinding her son), Euphrosyne (the daughter of that same son), and Theodora (the wife of Euphrosyne's stepson), all were on the side of the iconophiles, and it was their stance that was victorious in the end. Herrin also makes the case that if Iconoclasm had prevailed, western art, which took much of its inspiration from the Byzantine empire, would have been much poorer. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Women in Purple","review":"I recommend this book without reserve.

She points this out in her essay &quot;On the Sources Used for this Study&quot; (page 258 hardcover) at the end of the book in the &quot;Sources and Notes&quot; section.On a couple of occasions, Ms. Herrin's feminist perspectives seem to escape her careful unbiased scholarly approach, but these are insignificant by comparison with her accomplishment."},{"Title":"Women in Purple","review":"I recommend this book without reserve.

So I was shocked and disappointed when I read: \\" Byzantium is famous for its empresses.The classical world revealed few equal to them, apart from Cleopatra and Agrippina; the Islamic world, none.\\"(p.3)One of the most famous empresses in Islam was the Empress Nur Jahan of the Mughal empire in India. According to Wikipedia \\"Begam Nur Jehan was the twentieth and favourite wife of Mughal Emperor Jehangir, who was her second husband - and the most famous Empress of the Mughal Empire. The story of the couple's infatuation for each other and the relationship that abided between them is the stuff of many (often apocryphal) legends. She remains historically significant for the sheer amount of imperial authority she wielded - the true \\"power behind the throne,\\" as Jehangir was battling serious addictions to alcohol and opium throughout his reign - and is known as one of the most powerful women in the history of India.\\"Another woman who is a famous empress in Islam was the Empress Roxelana of the Ottoman Empire. Her husband Suleyman the Magnificent took her advice on matters of state and international politics. She was so influential that 2 of her letters written to the Polish King Sigismund Augustus are preserved to this day. One of her charitable works was that she had a womens' hospital built in Istanbul.I could go on and on. As a Professor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies, Judith Herrin has done NO research in this area. I was extremely disappointed with her ignorance on empresses in the Islamic world."},{"Title":"Tisa","review":"I have never read the book but my name is Tisa and I would like to read a book about my name. My mom made up my name so I would just like to see how someone else came up with the name. Thank YOu"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"&quot;A Year in Provence&quot; is one of my all-time favorite books. I spent a semester in Aix-en-Provence when I was in college and fell in love with the region . . . and Mr. Mayle does a wonderful job of bringing the tastes, smells, sights, and sounds of Provence into your living room. &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; is his first (I believe) work of fiction set in Provence, and it does not disappoint. The story succeeds on so many levels, the characters are described so well that you expect to recognize them walking down the street. Mr. Mayle's talent is in creating these characters, and richly describing them so perfectly, without rambling on for pages on end. The prose is never boring, the story is always jam-packed and exciting, the characters always have so many different levels and layers, and they are all somehow interconnected with each other. The book is fun -- you aren't going to find anything serious or thought-provoking here -- and absolutely wonderful. &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; is like vacationing in Provence -- it is an enjoyable experience, and you will find yourself re-reading it so you can re-visit with an old friend. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I'll begin this review by giving &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; a total of SIX stars instead of the obligatory five. Stay with me and I'll explain why.Being such an incredible fan of Mr. Mayle's previous books on Provence I was slighly apprehensive about his delving into the world of fiction. Untested waters to be sure but I held my breath and waited for &quot;Hotel Pastis &quot; to appear at my local book store. When it finally arrived I, without hesitation, picked up my copy and that evening sat down... ready to be disappointed.Obviously, quite the opposite has occured. Looking back over the past few years when I first read this novel I actually have to laugh at my apprehensiveness (ummm... is that a word?).&quot;Hotel Pasts&quot; is, at least for me, one of the most enchanting, funny and in some small, strange way, romantic books I have read in many a year. Mr. Mayle simply makes you really care about the people that populate this book and you truly do want to see an &quot;happy-ending&quot;! The novel is written in an extremely fast-paced mode and moves along with the speed of sound! Never a dull moment! Without going into the plot of the novel, the main character Simon Shaw and his &quot;man Friday&quot; Ernest are both so cleverly drawn and fleshed out that I keep hopeing for a sequel to this work. Especially Ernest, part valet, part confidant, part friend and qualified Rolls-Royce mechanic is simply so fascinating that his character alone is worthy of a book.Obviously,as in any Peter Mayle novel ( and in real life) things don't always go as intended for our &quot;heroes&quot; and that is where the fun truly begins. This book simply has it all...French comedy, romance, bumbling crooks, ex-wives, a malignant local journalist and, perhaps most important of all, the French country-side, in all it's glory. Perhaps, in some way, the villages of southern France are as much of the novel as the characters. Altogether an extemely well-rounded first novel that is as fruity and smooth as a bottle of pastis!Do yourself a huge favor and run to your library or local book store and pick up your very own copy. I've bought countless copies as gifts and speaking for myself have read this wonderful book on 'six' seperate occassions. And while you're at it pick up a wonderful bottle of wine and an an Edith Piaf record. You may not be in France but...you certainly won't be home either! Bon Appetit!!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"If you want &quot;heavy&quot; reading that makes you think beware of Peter Mayle. His books are more fun than...well...anything! If you love France, food, and a little foul play...then welcome abord. In &quot;Hotel Pastis,&quot; Mayle works the special brand of magic that he first showed us in &quot;A Year in Provence.&quot; The only book that's ever made me want to leave Italy! For awhile, that is! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I had been thinking about reading some of Mayle's works for quite a while and I finally decided to start from the beginning.This is truly a delightful book. The premise is a bored and highly successful London business man (Simon Shaw) gives up his career to open a hotel in France. It's probably a dream for a lot of us (even those who are not so rich and successful) and that is probably why it is such a captivating book. It tells a story of a life that you wish you could try.It's also full of fun characters. The best (and I think more likeable than Simon) is Ernest. I never really figured out the relationship between Simon and Ernest. I wasn't sure if they were co-workers and Ernest just went along, if he was Simon butler, or what. But it didn't matter. Ernest is the more likable of the two in my opinion. And he's the one who really gets the hotel up and running. Simon (like a lot of successful business men) gets bored with an endeavor once the \\"new\\" has worn off.Other fun characters include Simon's ex-wife, the hotel's new chief, Simon's new girl friend, the rich college kid, and a whole band of robbers who train to be bicyclists as part of a scheme.I'll definitely be reading more of Mr. Mayle's works in the future.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection.

Having lived in Europe and traveled extensivly in France it brought back wonderful memories. At first I was reluctant to try the novel, wondering if he could pull off the fiction as well. And Hotel Pastis proves he can do both very well. In fact the novel was even more fun that the non fiction. Light reading, ideal for a plane trip or a similar situation, humorous but with enough suspense to keep you turning the pages. A delightful read. Keep it up Mr. Mayle."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Found this book especially delightful as it is a fantasy of mine to quit my advertising job and move to the south of France. As usual, couldn't put the book down and had to go out and buy a hard copy once I returned my borrowed copy. However, if I have one criticism of Mayle's books, it's that he doesn't end them. I am always just a ittle peeved at him for not tying things together a bit more. For example, whatever happened to The General and his gang? Did Simon ever fire Zieglar when he got the chance? I felt the author missed the opportunity for some more dramatic storytelling. Even if he plans on picking this up in a sequel, it was still a bit too abrupt and unfinished for the book to stand on its own. Otherwise, it was a five-star read throughout. Found the same trouble with &quot;Chasing Cezanne.&quot; We never discovered what happened to the man who orchestrated the art swindle, or whether our protagonists ever made any money off the art exchange for their efforts. Again, it seems like we got left hanging right in the middle of a chapter.

The plot is somewhat better developed than in \\"A Good Year\\" and his characters are distinct; however, what really takes the spotlight is Mayle's descriptions of the jewels of Provence.

This is a nothing book, mindless twaddle. Mr. Mayle is competent at non-fiction, but as a fictionalist he has all the talent of, well, a former adman."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"This book zipped by, and held my attention, but I think whether you like it will depend on how much you agree with Peter Mayle's personal opinions. I found a number of elements in the book irritating. The main character, Simon Shaw, is bored with his life, but it never once occurs to him to do anything for charity, although he's rich enough to own several sports cars that he never drives. In general, the characters are used to express the author's likes and dislikes. For example, Mayle thinks that people who worry about cancer are silly, so the cool characters all have \\"healthy, tanned faces\\" and some of them smoke, while the fussy and stupid characters hide from the sun, and wave the smoke away in horror. Some of what seems witty to Mayle didn't work for me at all. I don't see anything clever in putting a replica of Brussels' \\"Mannekin Pis\\" in a garden, or referring to a bit of sexual foreplay as \\"Breakfast of Champions\\".The author's attitude toward his female characters struck me as odd, but that may be due to generational or national differences. Shaw calls his secretary by her first name, while she says, \\"Mr. Shaw.\\" Shaw loves to watch women eat, and hates it when they spend a lot of money, but, paradoxically, the heroine of the book is constantly complimented for being slender and extremely well-dressed. (To be fair, Mayle does insert a few non-slender women who are also depicted as attractive, but it's obvious that the heroine is the queen bee.) Many of the female characters depend upon alimony for their living, and they talk as if living on men's money is the natural order of things. Perhaps Mayle knows a lot of women like this, but I found it depressing.The story of the novel is curiously divided. Several Marcel-Pagnol-esque chapters describe a gang's preparations for a bank heist, and these seem unconnected with the ritzy world of Simon Shaw. I think Mayle should have written two separate books, rather than trying to mix these two styles together.On the positive side, the book's personages are memorable, though not realistic, and the Provence setting is attractive. However, I don't think these pluses overcome the book's minuses."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"IN KOREAN, &Agrave;&Igrave; &Ograve;&Agrave; &Agrave;&Agrave; &Agrave; &Ntilde;&iquest;&iexcl; &Aacute;&ouml;&Agrave; &Iacute;&Agrave;&Igrave;'&Ugrave;. &iquest;&igrave;&iquest;&Ntilde; &Egrave; &Agrave;&uacute;' &quot;HOTEL PASTIS&quot;' &Oacute;&iexcl; &Agrave;&iacute; &Egrave;&eacute; , &Agrave; &Agrave;&Igrave; &Aacute;&ouml;' &Ograve;&Agrave;&Igrave;'&Ugrave;. &Aacute;&Agrave;&uuml;, 1)'&Ugrave;&Ograve;&Agrave; &uuml;&Agrave;&Agrave;, 2)&oacute;&Egrave;, &oacute;&Egrave;&iquest;&iexcl; &Eacute;' &Egrave; &szlig;, 3)&iacute;, &Aacute;&Aacute;&ouml;&iquest;&iexcl; '&Ntilde; &Ntilde; &Agrave; &Agrave;&szlig; &iacute; &Agrave;&Ouml;'&Ugrave;.&Agrave;&Igrave; &Agrave; &Agrave;&iacute;, &quot;PASTIS&quot; &Ntilde; &Agrave;&iacute;, &Agrave; &Aacute;&ntilde;&Uuml;&szlig;&Uacute;'&Ugrave;' &Agrave;&Igrave; &eacute;&uacute;&iacute;, &Oacute;&Aacute;&ouml;&Agrave; &Agrave;&iexcl;&iquest;&iexcl; &Agrave;&Igrave; &Agrave;&Igrave;'&Ugrave;. , &Ntilde;&Agrave; &Aacute;&Aacute;&szlig;&Agrave; &Agrave; &quot;UNITEL&quot;&iquest;&iexcl;&Agrave; &Agrave;&Agrave; ID &Aacute; &Ograve; &Agrave;&Aacute;&Agrave;, 4&Agrave; &Agrave;&Agrave;&Agrave; &iexcl;&Aacute;&ouml;&Aacute;&ouml;, &szlig;&Agrave; &Aacute;&Aacute;&Agrave; &Oacute; '&oacute;, &ntilde;&Aacute;&ouml;&Agrave; &Agrave; &uacute;&Agrave;&Igrave; &Aacute;&iexcl;, , &Ntilde;&iquest;&Agrave; &iquest; &Auml;&Aacute;&Ugrave; &Agrave;&aacute;, , &Aacute;&Aacute;&ouml;&Agrave; &ntilde;&Agrave; &Aacute;&Ntilde; &quot;&Ouml;&Aacute;&quot;&Agrave;&Igrave; &Aacute;&Aacute; &Agrave;&Igrave;'&Ugrave;.&Aacute;&Aacute;&Agrave; &Ograve;&Agrave;&Igrave;'&Ugrave;. &lt;J.B.PARK&gt;"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Unfortunately, I had the impression that this book was knocked off without much thought in order to make a bit of money.This writer can do so much better."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Having been transported to Mayle's world of Provence in two of his non-fiction books, I was curious to see how he would turn his hand to fiction.

Hotel Pastis is Mayle's first venture into fiction (if one overlooks the occasional \\"embroidery\\" in his first two works, which are considered necessary for a \\"good tale,\\" as well as a successful technique in his advertising career.)Mayle fled the corporate world of Madison Ave. for the sun of Provence. He still carries some of the baggage, and bad memories with him. Consider: \\"...was likely to behave in classic committee fashion - dithering, backbiting, compromising and sitting as firmly as possible on the fence\\" (p 64). The protagonist is Simon Shaw, rich, newly divorced, \\"looking for new challenges,\\" as the expression has it. He links up with Nicole Bouvier, and decides to transform a gendarmerie into the charming hotel with the title's name. As usual with Mayle, he sprinkles his English prose with the Herbes de Provence of French, just for enough flavoring to ensure you don't forget where the story is based.So far so good, and running the perfect hotel (or B&B;) in Provence, has to be right up there with opening your own independent bookstore for the occasional sentient, free-spirit still encased in the corporate game. Then Mayle stirs in a major dollop of the French underworld, in the person of the Marseille gangster, Enrico, and the bank robber, Jojo. Of all the characters, I found Jojo the most sympathetic. To fulfill their plan to rob the bank, he and his buddies have to train, and get back into shape (the \\"win one for the gipper\\" theme). It would be a hard-hearted reader that wouldn't be rooting for Jojo; no doubt Mayle's intention.And the bank is based on a very real-life one, very near the old water wheel, in L'Isle sur la Sorgue. Mayle describes it authentically, and I have often thought of the day when he must have sat on the park bench, in the adjacent park on the Sorgue, and sketched out the essentials of the novel in his head.For an American who has to face that long night-time trans-Atlantic flight to get there, this book might be the ideal companion for its \\"je ne sais quoi\\" quality of a sympathetic look at another culture of which, despite whatever aspirations, will prove elusive to join. 4-stars."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"It is really fortunate to read Peter Mayle for the first time while you are visiting Provence for the first time. Such was my good fortune this summer. This book is charming, funny and a great joy to anyone with an interest in London and Provence. Mayle is simply superb."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"The joy of reading Peter Mayle's writing is in his ability to embody the atmosphere,food and what it is to be French. Who cares about character depth here? This is fun reading. I do take issue with some of his novels endings. Quite ironic I must say that after escaping advertising to Luberon he ends up being offered it again. Anyway life can be NOT SO SIMPLE and UNEXPECTED."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I don't know what book our esteemed reader from Los Angeles read, but I found this book fun, light and yet hard to put down. I could not wait to find out how the General's little plan worked and Simon was such a fun guy, searching for something better for his life. And Ernst, who could not like Ernst? I just wish I had one of him in my life. I haven't read all of the other books, but you can bet that I'm going to now!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Wonderful light novel about a midlife crisis come to fruition. So the subplots aren't all neatly &quot;finished&quot; at the end...don't other reviewers have any imagination? I enjoyed the fact that I could arrive at my own conclusions and create my own fantasy future for the characters. Now if I could just find my own hotel to renovate..."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"This was a great book from start to finish. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because there really wasn't an ending, it leaves the whole possiblity of follow up. What ever happened with the mafia gangster. Did the crooks really get away? This book was a wonderful read, very quick but not short on detail. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good book filled with laughs."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I enjoyed many parts of Hotel Pastis - mainly the beautiful descriptions of Provence, and the lovely idea of restoring an old building and creating a hotel. The characters are all fairly well defined and occasionally offer some funny dialogue, and it's a setting one would enjoy being in.Other than that, I felt the story was a bit weak. The subplot of the band of...cyclists, we'll call them, is built up throughout the book and then pretty weakly disposed of, with no resolution to something the author spent a great deal of effort setting up. The final act of the story centers too much on something that happens to a character we barely know and don't really care about, and pushes the characters we do know and are interested in into the background. It seemed an odd story telling choice to me.But otherwise, it's a good casual read and will make you want to lounge poolside in Provence."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Charming and delicious! The characters aren't exactly realistic but they are well done and fun to know. The plot isn't exactly realistic either, it's fiction after all! I've never been to the south of France but this book made me fall in love with it.I was a bit confused by the side plot of the bank robbery, but even that was enjoyable and funny, even funnier when it all came together towards the end.Definitely a book I'd recommend!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"This audio-book is one not to be missed! Peter Mayle captured the charm and seduction of a vacation in provence, but Tim Pigott-Smith's reading is the breath of life. Each character is instantly recognizable -- and there are many. Watch out: You are likely to find yourself plotting with the bad guys, cheering for the good, and all the while feeling as if you KNOW them personally... It was a wonderful vacation!"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"If you are just going on hollidays, go find this book somewhere and take it with you. The characters are realy enyojable and fun. Great summer reading."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I had the best time reading this book. If you want to take a nice trip to the south of France you will enjoy this one. Very fun read."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"Was loaned &#34;A Year In Provence&#34; and loved it. Have since read this and all of Mayle's other books and loved every one."},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","review":"I love Peter Mayle's non-fiction, this was his first fiction that I've read. I really like his descriptive style of writing and his funny characters. This was an easy read but I enjoyed it very much.
