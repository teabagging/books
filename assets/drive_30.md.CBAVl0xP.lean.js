The photographs are visually pleasing and very erotic. This is a unique collection that certainly merits review. Roffman's photographs captures the male form in various stages of passion, as well as in mundane moments; each definitely tells a story of the men and leaves the viewer to conjure up stories to fill in the narrative blanks (no pun intended).I highly recommend THREE.

Using Black and White photography to capture the playful, emotional, passionate nature to three romantically entwined individuals, Roffman offers the world a look into a very interesting relationship. A relationship which I am uncertain that I could emotionally withstand. Nonetheless, these three are going against the societal tides in an expression of love that is truly unique.The history behind the relationship was not throughout the book which might have made it even more interesting.

This book contains the diaries and letters of six women who traveled by wagon and horseback across the Great Plains and the mountains of the West to a new home in California, Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico in 1850. Amongst their descriptions of terror and hardship are also homely tales of life on the trail and often the generosity and nobility of many of their fellows.I was impressed most by the sheer numbers of the overlanders. Some 50,000 people took the Western trails in 1850, drawn mostly by the promise of gold in California. Accounts of the dust, the crowded conditions, and the inevitable cholera caught my attention. The journey across the plains and mountains was, as the editors note, the longest voluntary migration in history and one has to wonder why so many people left comfortable homes to journey west. The westward urge -- \\"Manifest Destiny\\" -- or whatever it might be called was a powerful force in 19th century United States. Indians and buffalo play surprisingly small roles in the accounts of the crossing.

Frink.Mrs. Frink, along with her husband, whose first name we never know, and a boy named Robert leave their nice home in Martinsburg, Indiana, for the riches of the California territories. It's not only the promise of gold that spurs this couple on, but of the riches available to those who make the arduous trip.Mrs. Frink keeps a detailed diary of the daily distances traveled (how did they m ark this?), the price of provisions along the way, the weather, the many people they run into, and an acute observation of the fashions on the trail. I found that quite interesting, those detailed descriptions of fashion, in clothing, transportation, and supplies, and the daily traveling distance. I also found myself amazed at the mileage the wagons were able to make each day and the price of provisions along the way. In 1851, one onion costs the Frink's one dollar, which is astronomically even in the 2002 market.Susan Baxter, an actress at the Creede Repertory Theatre in Colorado, gives life to Margaret. By the tone of voice she uses, I suspect that Margaret is a bit of a snob, but she handles the travails of the trail with remarkable good humor.It is particularly interesting that the diary does not end with their arrival in Sacramento, but gives a hurried account of life for their life as hotel owners and diary farmers. It is also interesting that the home they dismantled in Indiana and ship by boat, arrived in the new state at almost the same time they did.Thanks to the publication of this diary, I have a whole new appreciation of the Old West!"},{"Title":"Covered Wagon Women, Volume 2: Diaries and Letters from the Western Trails, 1850 (Coverd Wagon Women)","review":"I love this kind of reading, my daughter gave me vol.2 as a Christmas gift, I read it in just a few days, had I had the time I would have read it in 1 day.

Ant-Man was the unsung hero of the early Marvel Comics. He didn't sell as well as the other heroes, so a female partner, the Wasp, was added to his comic. That didn't help sales too much, so he was changed from Ant-Man to Giant-Man. He still didn't catch on, so he was replaced by the Sub-Mariner in Tales to Astonish #70. But these comics are still historically important, since Ant-Man and the Wasp were founding members of the Avengers. Quality wise, the comics aren't as good as, say, Spider-Man or the Fantastic Four, but they are still quite enjoyable. Fans of early Marvel Comics should dig it."},{"Title":"Marvel Masterworks: Ant-Man & Giant-Man Vol 1","review":"The Avengers was Marvel Comics' 60's version of DC's Justice Society of the 1940's. Both had memberships comprised of characters from each publisher's \\"anthology\\" comics. Marvel's superteam initially was composed of Ant-Man and the Wasp (from Tales to Astonish), Thor (from Journey Into Mystery) and Iron Man (who was featured in Tales of Suspense.) The quality of the earlier Ant Man stories was uneven (as it was for Thor and Iron Man) but the Jack Kirby and Don Heck artwork is (for lack of an adequate superlative) spectacular - two legendary illustrators at the peaks of their respective careers. The quality of the stories picks up when Stan Lee (Oscar Hammerstein to Kirby's Richard Rodgers as comicdom's greatest collaborative team) takes a more active hand in scripting the stories, and introduces a partner for Ant-Man - the Wonderful Wasp. The verbal interplay between the two insect adventurers recalls the sophistication and wit of William Powell and Myrna Loy in the \\"Thin Man\\" movie series. The series then really \\"hit it's stride\\" when Lee tweaked Ant-Man into Giant Man. Unfortunately (perhaps because the writing may have been a little TOO sophisticated for teenage boys) circulation for Giant Man's showcase, Tales to Astonish, always lagged a little behind the sales of the titles featuring his fellow Avengers, Iron Man and Thor, and Lee the editor made the decision to replace Giant-Man with Prince-Namor, the Sub Mariner, after a 36 issue run. (Frustrated Giant-Maniacs had to wait 11 months before the character resurfaced, once again in the pages of The Avengers.) Thor and Iron Man, as well as the Hulk, the Sub-Mariner and Captain America have all had their earliest adventures chronicled in Masterworks editions.

This worries me just a bit since it seems it should be still useful and thus profitable to print. One answer might be that Mr. Dacey's book has caused some of the exorbitant charges and abuses of probate to disappear (out of embarrassment?).One probate issue which has not disappeared, is the lengthy time(months or years)during which probate proceedings control the assets covered by a will -- assets which the book says it clearly enables you yourself to place in a simple trust so your beneficiaries (or heirs) will have instant and clear title to them at your death.It describes large reductions in transaction costs including tax savings, but it does not, in my opinion, show how to pass assets to your heirs tax-free."},{"Title":"How to avoid probate,","review":"The two major problems with probate are the lawyers fees which can be excessive and the delay which can be easily be over a year or more.The book can be read in less then an hour.

To avoid the probate system many wealthy people put their assets into trusts of one kind or another. What's good enough for people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett should be good enough for me.When we moved to Texas in 1981, I asked several people about setting up a living trust. I was assured that unlike some other states, the probate system in Texas was simple and straight forward, and that a living trust was unecessary. Recently the media has had articles on the corrupt probate system in Texas. However as the articles suggest, it is a fair system, anyone who has to deal with the probate system, rich or poor, is apt to to find all/most of the estate going to the lawyers."},{"Title":"Certified Macromedia Dreamweaver 4 Developer Study Guide","review":"Being an experienced Dreamweaver user, I found this book extremely easy to read.

Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"The strong points in this book are these:1) it is a thoroughly entertaining detailed account of the discovery of the causes for the mass extinction which occurred at the K-T boundary, and2) it provides an insightful anaylsis of the many pitfalls, lucky strikes, and false trails which are characterstic of any process of true scientific discovery. As such it reminds us of how careful and open-minded scientists need to be in dealing with new insights and discoveries.For those who are trained scientists, the book is mainly written for the layperson, especially the geological aspects, but that is fine, because as a geologist I am strongly of the view that we need more geological education and understanding in the general community. It is fine if science is written simplistically as long as it is accurate. Walter Alvalrez, for the most part, with perhaps a few exceptions, has managed to achieve this careful tension. The book is not an overview of the various theories and developments concerning mass extinction events, but rather a story of the search told by some who have been deeply involved. Therefore the fact that it doesn't provide an objective overview of the available theories, whilst true, is not really relevant here; Walter Alvarez is telling a story of mostly his own experiences, and those with whom he has worked. As long as this is understood, the book is educational, entertaining, and a thoroughly enjoyable read.I would like to add for those with some knowledge of geological science, that we have some very good exposures of the Permian-Triassic boundary in Australia, which Mr Alvarez notes is not so common in the northern hemisphere. This boundary is recognised as the biggest mass extinction of all, and some of these exposures have not been studied in much detail,let alone from the point of view of mass extinctions. Perhaps, being thus far somewhat geographically isolated from the scientific community of the northern hemisphere, Australia will provide some exciting new developments in our understanding of mass extinctions."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"If you're over 30, you've lived through the period during which extinction of the dinosaurs by catastrophic means was debated and explained. At first Luis Alvarez and his son, Walter, were ridiculed for their explanation of what happened at the Cretaceous/Tertiary or K/T boundary.Walter's book explains the chronology of events in a very readable fashion -- much less academic than the style of Stephen Gould and others. Its a story that tells how father and son found a way to work together, despite very different professions. It also shows how different disciplines worked together, across borders and countries.What's surprising is how quickly evidence began to accumulate to support the Alvarez' theory. And its interesting to see where they might have been sidetracked or made critical mistakes, were it not for good scientific practice"},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"This is the story of the discovery of why the dinosaurs -- and so many other creatures -- went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago. Walter Alvarez was a young geologist who discovered an \\"iridium anomaly\\" in a deposit at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary that strongly suggested that an extraterrestrial event of massive effect had happened then. He was joined by his father, Luis Alvarez, a physicist at Berkeley, in the pursuit of the significance of this finding. It seems hard to believe, but most geologists were reluctant to posit anything like a meteor strike as being a significant factor in Earth's history, preferring to explain everything by invoking gradual processes.Yet it became clear early on that something big had happened, and various candidates were mooted, such as a nearby supernova, or a companion star to the sun periodically throwing comet orbits out of whack. This book is the story of how geologists, chemists, physicists and others over more than a decade closed in on the solution -- a massive impact in the Yucatan Penninsula whose after-effects shrouded the Earth in darkness for many months -- starting with that original discovery back in 1977. This is a reasonably lightweight account, but with enough details to give the reader a good idea of the technical problems without descending into jargon.

By observing, measuring, and interpreting the information held fast through the eons of time, the earth's history can been seen and understood.There are two camps in these disciplins the camp of gradualism where everything takes times... sometimes an enormous length of time, then there are those of the camp catastrophism, something awful happen like a comet of meteor crashing into the earth. Well, this book falls mainly into the latter camp as the work on the K-T layer (Cretaecous-Tertiary) Iridium was found and the cause soon revealed that it came from an extraterrestrial source.To be realistic, one must use both camps to come up with the true answer.This book has seven chapters: Armageddon, ExLibro Lapidum Historia Mundi, Gradualist versus Catastrophist,Iridum, The Search for the Impact Site, The Crater of Doom, and The World after Chicxulub. Each of these chapters bring the read more information on how science, if applied correctly can render an answer to some nagging questions.This book tell about what happens when a meteor the size of Mt. Everest crashes into the earth and the consequenses that follow. As the author states, \\"The hugh cloud of vaporized rock generated at ground zero was driven outward by its own heat and pressure in a colossal fireball.\\" Mexican geologists found the Chicxulub crater back in the 1950's, but the general knowledge of Chicxulub didn't become common knowledge until 1991. As more and more evidence becames available, the extinction of the mosters of the Mesozoic is starting to favor the catastrophist theory... but we can only guess, but an intelligent guess is better than not knowing.This book was a fast read and the narrative flowed freely just like reading a detective story and all of the pieces of the mystery come together. This book has a little chemistry and physics in it so I believe that this show be read by age 16 and up. All in all, the is an excellent book and a fascinating story unfolds with some of the best firsthand paleontological science unraveling the mystries of that great extinction 65 millions years ago.Nevertheless, this is a chilling reminder of the fragility of the biosphere, which is under a constant threat from asteroids, meteorites, bolides and comets."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Easier reading level than the Powell book, and more suitable for children and teens interested in the topic of the K-T impact extinction.This title is more of a first person memoir of the development of the theory and not as detailed or as frank about the political aspects of the struggle as the Powell book. Dewey McLean, one of the proponents of a terrestrial, gradual, volcanic cause for the K-T extinction claimed that the elder Alvarez had threatened to ruin his career, and claimed a low level of debate and personal attacks. Even from the quotes here it appears that the late Luis Alvarez took a seemingly unscholarly approach toward those that didn't accept the impact scenario from the outset.Longstanding objections to the impact extinction -- such as the Deccan Traps, which have been conclusively shown to be of the wrong date and have had little impact on the dinosaur populations nearest to it -- are examined, but see &quot;Night Comes to the Cretaceous&quot; by James Lawrence Powell for a better and more adult oriented book on the same topic and a more detailed examination.See also &quot;Rain of Iron and Ice&quot; by John S. Lewis."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"It's interesting to see that this book is now being used as a text in high school and even junior high school science classes. I had a great laugh from the reaction of a young reader who wrote that it was &quot;boring&quot; and that &quot;Innocent eight graders shouldn't have to read this stuff&quot;!Ah, yes. Innocence. But 14-year-olds aside, this is a fascinating and delightful story of scientific discovery and triumph second to none. It can be compared to James D. Watson's The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, both in terms of the importance of the discovery and for bringing to the reader some of the excitement and adventure of the quest. It is not, however, as the title might imply, the reading equivalent of watching a Stephen Spielberg movie! And perhaps we can be thankful for that.T. Rex and the Crater of Doom is the story of one of the great scientific discoveries of the twentieth century. Prior to Alvarez's work, it was not known what had caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Volcanism, disease, climate change, etc., were put forward as possibilities. But in1970 Alvarez began to believe that a large meteor or a comet had struck the earth with enormous force causing the extinctions. But how to prove it? At first it wasn't even imagined how a meteor could bring about such a catastrophe; but gradually it was seen that the debris thrown into the atmosphere by the force of impact would encircle the earth and block out the rays of the sun for months or even years at a time, thereby killing off plants both on the land and in the sea, thereby collapsing the food chain and starving the dinosaurs and most other creatures.This was the breakthrough idea, and an exciting idea it was. Of course there was great resistance, as there always is in science when established opinions are threatened, and Alvarez and his team of scientists had to fight mightily against the orthodoxy of uniformitarianism which had held sway in geology and paleontology since the time of Charles Lyell. It wasn't until twelve years later in 1992 that Alvarez's theory finally found general acceptance in the scientific community.One of Alvarez's purposes in this book is to show a general readership how scientific discoveries are made and confirmed. His tone is generous and he goes out of his way (unlike Watson in The Double Helix) to give credit to everyone involved. He makes it clear that the work was a shared enterprise. One thing that stood out in my mind was the central contribution from Alverez's father, Luis, a physicist who unfortunately died before the theory could be confirmed.Alvarez does however allow himself an occasional sarcasm vis-a-vis the old order. Characterizing the &quot;conventional geologic opinion&quot; on the formation of craters like the Meteor Crater in Arizona as due to &quot;mysterious explosions that occurred at random times and places for no evident reason,&quot; he appends this observation: &quot;In retrospect this causeless mechanism...is indistinguishable from magic, but at the time many geologists considered it preferable to catastrophic impacts.&quot; (p 76)Science is especially subject to the braking effect of established opinion because it is extremely difficult for anybody to allow that the established beliefs of their entire professional career can suddenly be overturned. All your life you believed one thing and one day you wake up and some whippersnapper has overturned the entire edifice! That is hard to take, and so entrenched opinion wars against new discovery. But that is as it should be since extraordinary claims do indeed require extraordinary proof.Therefore, just as &quot;the course of true love never did run smooth&quot; (Shakespeare), so it is with science. Alvarez recounts an early misdirection in the quest when it was thought that they had found plutonium-244 in the KT boundary clay, possibly indicating a nearby supernova explosion 65 million years ago. He and Frank Asaro took their discovery to Earl Hyde, a nuclear chemist who listened patiently to the details and then said, &quot;Do it all over again.&quot; This was very good advice because when they did it all over again they found they had erred: there was no plutonium-244 in the clay samples! (p. 74)After reading this book we are left with an intriguing question: what was the role of volcanism, not only in the KT extinction but in the Permian-Triassic as well? Alvarez hints that there must be more than coincidence involved in the fact that during both extinctions there is indisputable evidence of vast lava flows. Does a truly monstrous impact somehow trigger volcanic eruptions? An &quot;intriguing mystery&quot; is what Alvarez calls it. (pp. 143-144)This book should be read in conjunction with David M. Raup's The Nemesis Affair: A Story of the Death of Dinosaurs and the Ways of Science which covers some of the same ground (especially the fight against established opinion) while claiming a 26-million year periodicity for impact extinctions caused by Oort Cloud perturbations from a hypothetical companion star, dubbed &quot;Nemesis.&quot;"},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Probably the most investigated mass extinction of the five major events known to have occurred has been the KT boundary event. This is probably because the dinosaur, especially T. Rex--as notice how much the dino named Sue fetched at auction--has captured the popular imagination more than any other animal. It was also the demise of these animals that openned up a world of opportunity for mammals, among which our own species is numbered. We therefore have a vested interest in, a sense of ownership of that catastrophic event as of no other. The notion of an astroid impact as the bringer of the end to the &quot;terrible lizards&quot; is also almost Biblical in proportion. It grabs the imagination. Certainly it has grabbed the media, as several TV programs and at least two movies about astroid impacts have been produced since the introduction of the theory advanced by the Alvarez, father and son. This book is a well written account by Walter Alvarez of the discovery of the clues to that event, of the gradual developement of the theory by many contributors, and of the defense of the theory before the scientific community. In fact the book is a good demonstration of the rigour with which new theories are challenged and defended and of the scientific process itself. It is also a landmark episode of the multidisciplinary approach to research and the growing dialogue between scientists from different fields. (For an opposing theory, also in itself compelling, see Evolution Catastrophies by Courtillot, or click on my name for my review of it. For a more thorough account of the prevailing theories of the KT and other extinctions see End of the Dinosaurs by Frankel or the review of it under my name)."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Alvarez mixes Scientific Method, paleontology, the difficulties in getting a new idea considered with an adventure story. Especially noteworthy is how Alvarez gives lots of credit to the people who contributed with advancing this theory. The reading level seems geared towards mid- to older teens. I hope to use this book in the Earth Science class I teach."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Although there are many questions that still remain about the extinction of the dinosaurs, this book does a very good job in detailing the work involved with finding the impact crater that hit 65 million years ago. This is one of the few science books that go into detail about the dead ends of the scientific quest not just the positive finds."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"T. Rex is two books masquerading as one. On the surface it is about Walter Alvarez' theory of meteor impact and how he believes that it is the cause of the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period that marked the end of dinosaurs. It is in this way that the book starts, and describes the theorized events in lucid detail. The remainder of the book is of another kind, and that is the hidden treasure here. This book is a story of personal inquiry and uncertainty, of conflict between father and son resolved through conjoint quest, of the gathering of knowlege by many people with unrelated agendas to formulate and reinforce this revolutionary theory. It is a story of how science really works, how ideas are formed, challenged, reformed, and grow to be accepted. Though not what the title promises, this second book is a delight for anyone with an interest in what living the life of science is really like. It makes this book better than a good science read, and much more personal. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"T.

Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"June 16, 1999 I would first like to thank Walter Alvarez, Jeff Riggenbach for taking the time to write this book and especially for creating an audio abridged version of it. I would really like to see more of these types of books adapted to audio format so that I may enjoy them. Orignally purchased for my 16 month old son as a bedtime story, I have been trying to find all the audio novels I can which share my passion for the maths, sciences, physics, geophysics and astronomy. When I orginally this audio tape I really didn't know what I was investing in but after letting my son listen to it once, I decided to see what I was letting the little guy listen too. What I discovered was a amazing story which took place over several decades which involved everything I wanted to expose my young son too. That is scientists talking about the work they love to do in the process of solving a mystery related to their field of research. Scientists working hard, solving difficult problems to explain a mystery. I could not have picked a better audio novel to expose my son to the adventures of the, sciences, physics, geophysics, palentology, astronomy, the dinosaurs and the rewards which come from a good education and working hard. I would really like to encourage more scientists to write about their discoveries and have them abrigded to audio like this story. This is the type of edutainment I love to support! In short I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"A well written book with good intentions, but there's still reason to doubt the &quot;impact theory&quot; as the reason for the demise of the dinosaurs. The extensive volcanism of the Deccan Traps in India may have also formed the iridium layer. Another idea, never discussed, is that impacts of lunar volcanic material--expelled volcanic domes--may have pelted the Earth in prehistoric times. This idea is especially intriguing to me since tektites--little glassy stones often thought to be splash from an impact--appear to some geologists to be more igneous than sedimentary in origin. The late Dean Chapman of NASA Ames Research Center had the most logical theory about impact craters and tektites: craters are connate with tektite strewn fields! Thus, a massive lunar dome-meteorite impact was followed by a trail of tektites as it entered the earth's atmosphere. Microtektites--lunar in origin-- found at the K-T layer may link volcanic outbursts on the Moon with these periodic extinction causing impacts. Also, check out NASA's John A. O'Keefe (author of the 1976 book TEKTITES &amp; THEIR ORIGIN et al) for an excellent review of this often ignored, but still very intriguing theory! Curiously, an Apollo 12 lunar sample resembled a &quot;terrestrial&quot; tektite so closely if it had been found on Earth, it would have passed for a javanite (tektite)!"},{"Title":"T.

However, it appears that the author was in a hurry and just needed to gloss over everything. I should have known from the title of the book that this was written just to make money and not out of a desire to tell an exciting story about people and science. Walter Alvarez ahould have read Lucy or Fossil fish (the story of the ceolocanth) to get an idea of how his story should have been told. When he tries to go into personal detail he highlights the encounters. For example the time in Mexico when he ran into former Pentex employees who knew the area and what the author was looking for. In stead of going into detail he basically says we got lucky. I wished that this book went into a lot more detail about the science while exploring the human drama on a much deeper level. If his goal was to make a quick buck he did it. If his goal was to open the minds of fifth graders he did it. If his goal was to tell an intriguing story with much human emotion and very interesting science he failed. I can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"T.

Other than that it's a book for 5-year-old non-scientists. I found it pathetic.Alvarez's discovery is a brilliant one, which the world has now accepted, but he could have done a little better. Whether the boundary really exists is another question. Iridium is produced a lot.

In the meantime, I thought it prudent to start reading The Behavior of the Earth by Claude Allegre (plate tectonics), and picked up Steven Stanley's book Extinction (global climate change).

In explaining the current thinking on the extinction of dinosaurs it touches on a number of different areas such as astronomy, geology, and palentology. However, it is more interesting than reading a textbook on the subject because it also discusses the personalities of the scientists involved and the controversies that existed (and still exist) between them. To me this book is to Geology/Paleontology what the \\"Double Helix\\" by James Watson was to molecular biology."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"This is the book that started it all: Dinosaur extinction by bolide from outer space. Catastrophic tsunamis. Intercontinental ejecta layer. Geologic evidence everywhere you look once you know where to look. And the laughingstock of serious geologists everywhere until the evidence started mounting up to where it couldn't be ignored.This is the story of Walter Alvarez and his colleagues and their careful science that yielded ideas, insights, and then, whammo! the Big Idea that there might be an external component to the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It is a forensic mystery worthy of \\"CSI\\" except this is the real deal, and the slog work of doing research took this band of scientists all over the world in search of enlightenment. Leveraging new developments in dating techniques and the best minds in the field and out of it (did I mention that Walter Alvarez is the son of Luis Alvarez, the Nobel Award winner for physics?), the adventure is somewhat stalled until the discovery of oil company drilling cores from the Chixulub region of Mexico that confirm evidence of an impact in that region. It is an eleventh-hour discovery just as interest is waning and funding is running out - a development worthy of the \\"Nova\\" episode that it eventually became.As much fun as it is to read mysteries, it is equally fun to read about the real-life trials and tribulations of a band of intrepid individuals who have a hypothesis and then are able to methodically test it, with startling results. One of the joys of this book is Alvarez's generosity toward those whose work supported him and propelled him forward, as well as his occasional head-scratching humility.

Mr. Alvarez paints an intense scene in the first side of a two cassette story as he describes in detail exactly what happened on the fateful day. Then he sets forward, in the remaining three sides, to giving all of the data which led to those conclusions. Obviously, this tends to become tedious and I found myself drifting into my own thoughts.

It is now well known that a large meteor hit the earth 65 million years ago creating a monstrous explosion and dust cloud, blocking the earth from the sun. The proof that was given to us by nature was the Chixculub Crater, created by the asteroid 65 million years before. He lost me a third of the way into the book, as he started to talk of the chemical bases of the iridium and how different machines used certain chemicals to trace other chemicals. It was not that I disliked the book. The pictures were stunning and I thought that for the most part the book was really intriguing from a scientific point of view. The reason for the three points taken off was that, perhaps, in order to make the chronical book length, he combined difficult information with more interesting and less difficult information. I think he was aiming at too wide an audience. Was he talking to high school students? College students? Overall I really enjoyed the book and I recommend this book to anyone over the age of sixteen.

Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Obviously punning on &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,&quot; Walter Alvarez in T. Rex and the Crater of Doom tells an equally entertaining (but true) story of the earth's past, and scientific derring-do. About 65 million years ago, all the dinosaurs died out. At the same time, a discontinuity appears in the geologic record worldwide, indicating a time when life very nearly disappeared from the world. In this very accessible book, Alvarez outlines basic geology, including the rise of plate tectonics and the &quot;rule&quot; of gradualism, and then shows how he and many other scientists came to conclude that a giant comet or asteroid slammed into the earth, wiped out the dinosaurs, and re-made life. Alvarez makes the scientific quest both exciting and fun -- it is not unlike the detective in a murder mystery who finds clues, pieces them together, eliminates false leads, and deduces the solution. &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson!&quot; This short (150 pages) book is an extremely satisfying read, and may be finished in a couple of evenings.

Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"The title of this book says everything you need to know about its literary style. It's a fun romp through one of the leading scientific controversies in modern geology and paleontology, told by one of the central figures. It is not a scientific treatise, but a book of scientific history, detailing the process by which geochemical &quot;detectives&quot; sorted through Nature's red herrings in the attempt to track down the object that murdered the dinosaurs. It's also a case study in the philosophical debate between catastrophe theories and gradualism in a science so marked by its long debate with certain groups of religious conservatives that it developed a reflexive antagonism to any suggestion that some events might not have taken place over &quot;geologic&quot; time scales. A world-altering meteor impact was not something the gradualists wanted to discover.Alvarez clearly believes that the discovery of a 65-million-year-old impact crater on Mexico's Gulf Coast has pretty much resolved the question of what killed the dinos, and he's written his book to an audience of like-minded folk. If you're on the fence, the book might convince you. If you're in the opposing camp, it won't-nor is that the book's purpose. Rather, Alvarez is out to tell a good story of the progress of science.

Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"An excellent book.Written generally for the non-scientist, there's enough critical evidence here to convince just about anyone that the Impact Theory is based firmly on fact. The author covers the ground from back to front in lively style, and with wonderful examples which explain the relevant geology, physics, and paleontology to the layman. The \\"plus\\" in all of it is that this book was written by THE major contributor/investigator. Who better to present the story?My overall rating includes this factor. My rating also includes the fact that the book has varied pictorial material which highlight the text. This is definitely a book that popularizes a scientific issue - and shows how real scientific investigations progress from ideas/guesswork to accepted theory. The description of the asteroid/comet impact is the best I've read.I recommend this book without reservation to those interested in the mystery of dinosaur extinction, and in the controversy over whether evolution is \\"punctuated\\", \\"gradual\\", or a mixture of both. It compliments and enhances all we've seen via TV presentations.I also recommend it for another reason - the underlying tug of war between the ideas of geology, and the hard evidence obtained via physics. There's an undercurrent here (behind the obvious story) of a real clash of ideas and beliefs between the two worlds. Author Walter Alvarez - son of Nobel Prize winner Luis Alvarez - seems to have smoothed over this clash. One wonders whether the story would have ever come out without the input from father Luis, and the integration of ideas, methods, and data he infused into the investigation.Again, an excellent book worth reading."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Good writing and easy to follow. Be aware that there are more recent updates to how the dinosaurs became extinct and that Alvarez' theory is just part of the mass extinction (other theories include climate change and volcanic activity). I read a chapter to my high school students and they liked it so I think it would appeal to teens as well as adults."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"This is a book for laymen and more power to Walter Alvarez for that. He tells a natural history detective story and is not compelled to gloss over those wrong turns that his own research pursued. The science is easy to swallow, too easy for some, but my own view is that any writing that draws people into science is good writing. Alvarez is also, refreshingly, respectful of those who disagree with his view that an impact event 65 million years ago killed off all the non-avian dinosaurs. I am among them -- largely thanks to him, no one reasonably can dispute an impact event that was disastrous for life at the KT boundary. But to argue, as Alvarez does, that up until that moment of impact, things were well and still thriving in dino world does not necesarily follow. This is a useful contribution to the debate about what happened to dinosaurs. But it was not the final word when it was published in 1997 and it is not today. One last tantalizing thought -- he touches on evidence that other great extinctions may have been impact extinctions and that there is at least some evidence of predictable periodicity to killing impacts. I'd like to know where that teaser evidence has led."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Short book (150 pages of text, dozens more of footnotes). Easy read. Great story of discovery including all the mistakes, errors and luck that make up science. Experts in the field may likely find it overly simplistic, but don't read it for the latest academic details on the state of the science. Read it for the travelogue of a voyage of discovery and in that vein I give it 5 stars.I appreciate that Walter Alverez notes that there was and is some hot debate about the science, and honors those involved by not trying to quote blow by blow who said what to whom, but rather that to argue over uncertainties is part of being human and part of being a scientist. That is a key take-away from the book, that science is not a neat linear flow from darkness to light. There are many misteps along the way.I notice that several of the one-star ratings are from school kids who were assigned the book in class and found the book boring. As they confess, it isn't actually that the book was boring but that any book about science was bound to be boring. Ouch, I am sure this book was carefully selected by the teacher as most likely candidate to entertain the students. It is too bad if even this book couldn't engage some of the kids, but hopefully others were turned on and will take their own voyage of discovery when their turn comes."},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","review":"Ever wonder what T-Rex's last day on earth was like? Author Walter Alvarez describes in stunning detail that last moment on that last day 65 million years ago when a huge rock that fell from outer space smashed into earth and began the catastrophic firestorm which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Geologist Alvarez, a major proponent of the impact theory of the Cretaceous extinction, then begins an amazing and highly readable account of the worldwide search for and discovery of the many pieces of evidence supporting this theory. This book flows like a scientific detective story, laying out the characters, clues, arguments and false leads until it finally arrives at the \\"AH-HA!\\" moment when the Crater of Doom is found. If you've ever wondered how scientific theories are developed and proved, you'll want to read this wonderful, well-written book."},{"Title":"T.

There is an index in back. 379 pages.Example: Meekness...What is meekness? Many people have a totally wrong idea of it, but they can learn the true meaning by listening to jockey's and horse-trainers after a horse race.

The self-willed horse, the factious horse, is frequently left at the post; when he does get started he may run faster than some of the others, but he does not finish with the leaders who were meek. In the Word of God, meekness is presented to us as a vertical virtue, not as a horizontal one. Meekness is the way a man stands before God...even as Moses was able to stand before Pharoah...he is bolder than any man. &quot;The meek shall inherit the earth.&quot;Dr. Barnhouse was the pastor at the Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, PA and was the founder of The Evangelical Foundation and for many years the radio voice of the Bible Study.

There seems to be different levels of experience, different styles, and different picture quality.First, half of the pictures are quite monotone, some attractive woman naked, posing, normally taken from the thighs up, most of them either with a mask or hiding their faces in apparent shame. A fair number of these shots seem to have been taken at a rather low resolution, and then passed by some low pass filter. We all know Photoshop is a great tool but it doesn't solve everything.The rest of the pictures are, on the other hand, diverse. Some of them are too gross for my taste, some other are quite shocking, but that's, of course, the final objective.Over all, I expected more from the book.With respect to the book itself, it's a high quality binding, the satin paper seem to be high quality too, but I suggest you wash your hands and after use hand sanitizer.

You can probably count them on the fingers of one hand, which in itself says something about the math teachers we've all had. The one vital thing that most teachers never discover is that the greatest thing we can &quot;teach&quot;is the excitement of learning, the thrill of discovery.A great acting teacher is not one who can most effectively direct actors where on teh stage to stand and with what expression to recite their lines. A great teacher helps, directs, creates the environment wherein the students can make discoveries. And any discovery is part of self-discovery.Jeff Bennet's book, SECONDARY STAGES is a roadmap to the process through which disovery becomes possible. It makes the journey dangerously safe, instructively fun. It methodically conducts us through the maze of adolescent psychology to the lovely place where spontaneity is possible.It is able to be inspirational and simultaneously grounded in practical reality. It is pedagogical (in the best sense) and simultaneously personal. The book is logically organized. Its structure is a function not only of ideas but of the experiential progression of the teacher-student relationship.It sets inspirational and practical goals, it offers pathways to get there, it identifies problem areas and offers incisive and practical ways of understanding them and solving them.It is a great guidebook for any student or teacher of the craft of acting...and of teaching."},{"Title":"Secondary Stages: Revitalizing High School Theatre","review":"I have had the pleasure of being a former student of Jeff Bennett's classes in high school.

Remember that word &quot;influence.&quot; It is a big part of what I want to say about this extraordinary man. Deng Xiaoping is impressive as an historical figure for several reasons. First of all, there is his basic longevity. He had a way of lasting.But the one thing that stands out most about Deng Xiaoping is his gut-level understanding of the balance between power and influence. We tend to think that power and influence go hand-in-hand. But in fact, there tends, most often, to be an inverse relationship between the two principles. Makes sense when you think about it. When you exert power, you naturally lose influence. The very heart of influence is the ability to &quot;win people over&quot; to your ideas. Power is about making people to what you want. Influence is about helping people to want what you know is best for them.Now, this book is specifically about Deng during the Cultural Revolution, and it is not intended as a political treatise at all. But most of us knew Deng as a political figure before we encountered him in this book as the father of a family. So for most readers, there is going to be a tendency to read the book in the light of what they already know about the man. Still, I must say that I think Deng Rong does an excellent job of portraying the very human side of her father. There are some places where she treads lightly, and leaves more questions than she answers. But that tends to be true with anything written about the Cultural Revolution. What I am getting at is the fact that the Cultural Revolution, and how bad it became opened up all kinds of questions about any possible weaknesses in the system that produced it. But many books on the Cultural Revolution want to talk about it in isolation, without thoroughly examining the causes.For example, at several different points in the book, she tells how her mother takes measures to be sure they are not being overheard, such as hiding under the covers, or running the water in the bathroom. But what kind of system produced the fear that every room could possibly be bugged? Deng Rong does not address that issue. And she says this about Mao:&quot;Mao Zedong was a great man, a powerful figure for all times. His thoughts and deeds cannot be discussed in the same manner as those of an ordinary person. Perhaps that is one of the reasons for the huge gap which constantly appeared between his ideals and their realization.&quot;I don't accept this. Certainly it is unfair to talk only about Mao's weaknesses without mentioning his strengths. But if the only way to address a leader's mistakes or abuses is to create a separate standard by which to measure them, then we are in real trouble.Having said all that, this is a very well written book. Part of this is due, of course, to the fact that it deals with a very extraordinary man. But Deng Rong must be given credit. She not only honors her father with this book; she shows herself to be a very perceptive historian, and a woman of character in portraying her father, and his measured, prudent responses to the extraordinary circumstances he was faced with.Power and influence. Deng Xiaoping did have power. But history will credit him with accomplishing the most for China when he had the least power. Deng Xiaoping resigned his last official position in 1989. But his economic reforms, which pulled 250 million people out of poverty, were begun in 1992, three years after he had relinquished all official posts!Patience. Perseverence. Prudence. Principle. These were the defining character qualities that, in uniquely balanced measure produced a uniquely great man. This is a book worth reading. Its historical value is obvious. But it is also very readable and fascinating as a human interest story. The story in this book is as important as the person it is about. In other words, the book would be well worth reading even if nobody had any idea who Deng Xiaoping was. Even if he had never distinguished himself in Chinese government and culture, he distinguished himself as a father, and as a man of principle in living a life that is worth examining, and in leaving a legacy that is felt every day by a quarter of the earth's people. Deng Xiaoping really is the father of modern China."},{"Title":"The Broken Lands (Empire of the East, Bk. 1)","review":"The Broken Lands is the first novel in the Empire of the East series, which follows the adventures of Rolf, a sixteen year old peasant boy born in the lands of the Satrap Ekuman.In this novel, Rolf is plowing the fields when the soldiers come to his farm. His first awareness that something is wrong is the sight of a winged reptile swooping down to the farm yard. Running home as fast as possible, Rolf finds the flimsy house kicked apart and bodies that look something like his parents sprawled amid all the other ruined things in the yard. Though he searches everywhere, he cannot find his sister Lisa, so he goes looking for her. After a while, he finds himself sitting beside the road, quivering with exhaustion. A man is standing near him. At first, he thinks that the man is a soldier and wonders if he might get out his knife and kill him, but he looks more closely and sees that the man is not a soldier. The man asks if anything is wrong, but it is too hard to understand the question. He just gives up and slips into unconsciousness.Rolf awakes as the man pours water into his mouth. When the man again asks him if anything is wrong, Rolf manages to force out words to tell his story. When Rolf is done, the man introduces himself as the peddler Mewick. The peddler return to the farm with Rolf and helps bury his parents. After the burial, Rolf accompanies Mewick south, carrying the pack when Mewick tires. However, the peddler takes the knife from Rolf and then throws it away, saying that it is against Castle law. As they are walking, three mounted Castle soldiers overtake them and insist on searching Mewick's pack. While one of the soldiers is searching the pack, he comes upon a love charm and casually asks why they never catch a young girl out there. The other soldiers ignore him, but Rolf goes berserk, reaching for a rock and throwing it at the trooper. Although he misses, Mewick doesn't, and they kill all three soldiers. However, their actions are seen and they immediately have to run from other soldiers.They flee into the swamp and the Castle soldiers soon give up the pursuit. Rolf and Mewick wade through the bogs for hours. Around midnight, a very large bird swoops down on them and converses with Mewick. Soon they find a camp on a strip of dry land and are able to sit down and eat warm food. When Rolf awakens, he recalls that his parents are dead and Lisa is missing. Next, he confirms that he still has the short sword taken from the dead trooper. Then, arising, he goes to meet the others in the camp, the woman Manka and her husband Loford. After he has washed, he finds the large bird, Strijeef, perched deep within a tree and asleep. He learns that the birds fly at night, acting as scouts and killing the winged reptiles used by the Castle soldiers. Rolf has found the Western Resistance and soon becomes a full member when the reptiles find their camp and attack Strijeef. The Resistance group flees further into the swamp to avoid the soldiers who follow the reptiles.While they flee, Loford raises a water elemental to overwhelm the Castle soldiers and cover their escape. Still, the reptiles follow them and attack once more. Mewick shoots arrows at them and Rolf swings his sword, but doesn't hit anything. Disgusted at his performance, Rolf asks Mewick to teach him how to use the sword and, after one wild swing almost skewers him, Mewick agrees out of sheer self-defense. Soon they come to a larger camp in the swamp and Rolf is introduced to Thomas, a local leader. He also learns of Ardneh, who rides the Elephant and is armed with thunderbolts. Then, as Strijeef is preparing to go out on his nightly patrol, another bird, Feathertip, returns with word of the Elephant. The Resistance group decides to investigate the find and Rolf goes with them.The Castle soldiers, however, have not given up their search for Rolf and his new friends. Moreover, they know something of the Elephant and Ardneh, so they are also searching for these relics of the old times.This series is one of the most enthralling tales of magical adventure that I have ever encountered. All of the Swords and the Gods books are based on this series, but, while quite enjoyable in themselves, the sequels have never really achieved the same level of fascination.Recommended for Saberhagen fans and anyone who enjoys well crafted tales of sword, sorcery, and high adventure.-Arthur W.

This book is an absolutely realistic recreation of the mind of a person who experiences schizophrenia. I have never come across a book that has done this so effectively. Through Robby's voice the author, Elizabeth Kytle, presents some of the prime features of life with schizophrenia; for example, 1. the extreme sense of social anxiety; 2 the social immaturity; 3. the confusion over sexual identity and fear of sexual contact; 4.the deep and profound, though constantly thwarted, need to belong; 5. the awareness that what you are doing and thinking is somehow extremely inappropriate combined with the need to spend intense energy disguising that inappropriateness; and finally, 6. the establishment of a barricade to protect yourself from other people, which eventually becomes a prison. One of the most effective techniques Elizabeth Kytle uses in this book is to have Robby narrate a portion of his life, and then have another friend, relative, teacher, colleague or employer then narrate a parallel section covering the same period of time, yet reflecting a different perspective on the same events. Research has shown that shizophrenia is caused by a complicated interaction between genetic and environmental influences--40% is probably genetic while the environment contributes the remaining 60%. This book does an excellent job of showing the interaction between these two elements to the point where Robby ended up in a psychiatric hospital with a full fledged case of schizophrenia. Overall, at the end of this book, I was wholly impressed with Robby's courage and ingenuity in facing an extremely destructive mental illness. We are also called to examine our own attitudes towards what those who have serious mental illness can and cannot do. It was clear that Robby, despite the severity of his illness, was a far more capable employee than others who weren't mentally ill. If only employers had been willing to work with his diability, he could have ended his life with some self-respect and dignity. In conclusion, I've read many books on mental illness, particularly in the area of memoir, and this is pretty well the best I've read thus far."},{"Title":"The VOICES OF ROBBY WILDE","review":"I am writing a paper on Paranoid Schizophrenia and found this to be an excellent story.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The VOICES OF ROBBY WILDE","review":"This is a thought provoking true story about Mental Illness.. Robby was handsome, charming, bright, friendly and hard working, yet angry,desolate, alone in a crowd. No one could save this wonderful man.

We need to accept it more."},{"Title":"Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War","review":"The author has done his homework by thoroughly researching primary and secondary sources on President Kennedy's Vietnam policy from 1961 through 1963. Kennedy had always maintained, going back to his election as senator in 1956, that the Vietnam conflict could only be won or lost by the Vietnamese themselves, and that the U.S. could not fight the war for them. He continued with this view as President, even though many political and military advisers urged him to send in significant U.S. troops. While he did increase the number of advisers, who sometimes assisted the South Vietnamese in battle, he never favored deploying significant ground forces. Also, Kennedy had a plan to eventually withdraw what U.S. troops were in country as the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) became more capable. Even in 1963 1,000 U.S. troops were withdrawn. The author's main position is that Kennedy would never have turned the war into an American war, with a huge deployment of U.S. forces, the way Lyndon Johnson did starting in 1965. Thus the death of a generation of young Americans (over 57,000), and many more times that number of Vietnamese, as well as the spiritual death of a generation of Americans who never again trusted their government and turned to self-destructive behavior in the drug culture, could have been avoided. This is an interesting thesis, but essentially unknowable. Hanoi significantly built up Viet Cong military capability in 1964 and 1965. The coup overthrowing Diem, which the Kennedy administration supported(though no Americans were involved in its execution) resulted in a series of ineffectual political leaders who were no better at political and economic reforms, or at leading the fight against the Viet Cong, than Diem was. Had Kennedy not been assassinated, had he been reelected in 1964, would he really have been able to totally withdraw from Vietnam and be tagged with another global loss to Communism, as the Democrats where in 1950 with the loss of China? The politics of 1965, both Republican and Democrat, strongly supported U.S. assistance to South Vietnam, even the deployment of significant U.S. ground troops. The author's basic position, then, that Kennedy would have avoided the death of a generation, is highly questionable.Nevertheless the book is well worth reading and is a must for anyone interested in Kennedy's Vietnam policy or the buildup to the Vietnam War. One interesting story relates how the intriguing Edward Lansdale told McNamara his statistical measures for judging progress in fighting the Viet Cong insurgency were all wet because he was measuring many factors which weren't getting to the heart of the issue. An intriguing what if of this period is: what if Lansdale had been more involved in forming U.S. policy on Vietnam? At the time he was assigned to Operation Mongoose, the program of covert action against Cuba.In the novel \\"Intruders in the Dust,\\" Faulkner describes how in Southerners' hearts it will always be July 3, 1863, at the moment before Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, the high tide of the Confederacy before the devastating loss that day set the South on the road to ultimate defeat. Similarly, in the American heart, even for those who aren't Kennedy fans, there will always be a wish that the bullets in Dallas would have missed, that a young president who inspired hope in so many citizens would have somehow been able to avoid one of our great national tragedies by avoiding the massive bloodshed and societal chaos resulting from the Vietnam War. Like the thesis of this book, we'll never know if that could have happened, but such a wish is a natural longing of the human heart."},{"Title":"Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War","review":"\\"Death of a Generation\\" reports on President John Kennedy's attempts to limit the United States' exposure in Vietnam. It is set in the early 1960's, prior to \\"South Vietnam\\" becoming the staple of nightly newscasts and before most of us could locate the place on a map. Burned by his experience at Cuba's Bay of Pigs, JFK was dubious of our Indochina involvement and leery of advice from his military and the CIA. He favored counter-insurgency/Special Forces action as opposed to main force combat. Central to the Vietnam problem was Premier Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu. The two, most especially Nhu, were authoritarian, remote and resistant to any democratic reforms. The Catholic brothers became increasingly estranged from the Buddhist majority. DG revolves around JFK's increasingly frustrating dilemma of dealing with the recalcitrant Premier. Diem's resistance to those reforms only served to further the cause of North Vietnam and the efforts of the ever-present, increasingly aggressive Viet Cong to undermine the Saigon regime. 1963 was the key year. JFK had to survive the 1964 Presidential election without being accused by the Republicans as \\"soft on Communism\\". He wished to avoid the fate of President Truman, who was accused of \\"losing China\\". Once safely re-elected, his plan was to call US forces home by late 1965, after South Vietnam could \\"stand on its' own\\". As 1963 progressed, rumors of a military coup in Saigon intensified. Slowly and reluctantly, JFK relented and allowed the South Vietnamese military to overthrow Diem and Nhu and force them into exile unharmed. But the brothers were assassinated-virtually murdered. The coup solved nothing and arguably made the crisis in Saigon worse as the generals squabbled among themselves. The rest is history as President Johnson immediately pursued a military buildup that led to the \\"death of a generation\\". There are some dark warnings in DG from top Kennedy lieutenants Chester Bowles and Michael Forrestal about our Indochinese quagmire in the making. And there is a chilling warning from Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the onetime top commander in Vietnam: \`Military measures could not provide permanent solutions to a massive problem that has political, economical, social, psychological AND military dimensions'. McGarr's warning to Army Chief of Staff Lyman Lemnitzer went unheeded. His position was correct in 1963 as it would be in 1975 as Saigon fell to the Communists. DG is exhaustively researched and documented, with 100 pages of notes. It certainly covers the topic! But DG far too long, self -indulgent and wordy. The same points are made over and over. DG cries out for a stern editor with a sharp blue pencil. 100 pages could easily have been truncated. Is such editing performed anywhere anymore? In all the heft, there are two issues that are not covered adequately: 1) What if only Nhu had been removed and Diem left in place? Such is pure speculation, but deserves mention. Vietnam, in 20/20hindsight could not have been worse off with Diem than it was with the squabbling generals. 2) Did JFK's staff serve him well? This reviewer feels they did not! Secretary of State Rusk seems virtually detached, and Maxwell Taylor, Joint Chiefs Chairman appears more loyal to the military establishment than to his Commander in Chief. And this reviewer has never understood what value Defense Secretary McNamara bought to the table. (Personal feelings do not belong in book reviews but RM was the man this observer's generation loved to hate). \\"Death of a Generation\\" is recommended to SERIOUS (!) history buffs, students of the Vietnam War and those who can wade through such a long rice paddy of writing. . Casual readers should look elsewhere; there are many other JFK and Vietnam works to choose from. 3 stars are a rather strict rating for such a serious and well researched work, but the sheer heft here begs for the reduction in rank."},{"Title":"Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War","review":"If there is a better work on the Kennedy administration and its involvement in the Vietnam war, I haven't read it.

The fact that Lodge was ordered by JFK to stop the coup by JFK and that Lodge refused to do so , the fact that Lodge held longstanding hostility towards JFK due to home politics is made light of . The whole matter of how Lodge engineered the disposal of the CIA Chief of Station is also not put in proper context nor how he used and exploited Lou Conien for his personal agenda . And finally Jones does not delve into Diem's last phone call to Lodge , where from other sources it is quite ecident that it was Lodge who in turn called the Coup Generals to tell them where Diem & Nhu were so they could be murdered . The book is sub-titled How the assassinations of Diem and JFK prolonged the Vietnam war. A btter line would have been how the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem lost the Vietnam war."},{"Title":"Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War","review":"This book has great chapter titles, and 80 pages of notes.There are a lot of questions in this book are about death. While President Kennedy was alive, it was not obvious that Vietnam was going to be part of the world in which so many Americans would die. The insignificance of the problem at the time Kennedy took office might be guessed from such assessments as, \\"Interrogations of captured Vietcong cadres showed them to be well trained and brought in, across the seventeenth parallel, or through Laos and Cambodia. The total Vietcong in central Vietnam had grown from a thousand at the end of 1959 to five times that number by mid-1961.\\" (p. 102). President Kennedy had authorized an increase in American troops that jumped from hundreds to thousands as the years went by, but with little sign that, merely seven years after JFK took office, more than a thousand troops per week on each side might be losing their lives in Nam early in 1968.As a professor in history with a year off from teaching, Howard Jones had the opportunity to examine documentary sources and the Oral History Interviews at presidential libraries, and he even talked to a few of the remaining participants. Daniel Ellsberg is not a major character in this book, though Jones talked to him on March 27, 2002, concerning a meeting in which President Kennedy asked Lansdale about getting rid of The Nhus, \\"But if that didn't work out--or I changed my mind and decided to get rid of Diem--would you be able to go along with that?\\" Lansdale ended up in a limousine with Robert McNamara after the meeting, where McNamara told him, \\"When he asks you to do something, you don't tell him you won't do it.\\" (p. 365). Actually, the source of this story is a book by A. J. Langguth, a New York Times correspondent in South Vietnam who claimed \\"Ellsberg's unpublished memoir, Langguth asserted, contained this account of Lansdale's clandestine meeting with the president.\\" (p. 365). \\"Ellsberg likewise considers the story valid. But in an interview of McNamara conducted by Langguth years afterward, the former secretary alleged that he did not recall the meeting.\\" (pp. 365-366). I checked the index of SECRETS by Daniel Ellsberg, finally published in October, 2002, and found no mention of President Kennedy on the pages of the only entry for \\"Lansdale, Edward G.: McNamara's meeting with,\\" though it included a page on which \\"high Vietnamese officials who met with General Lansdale regarded him warily but with awe because of his reputation as a kingmaker. They assumed he was there to pick the next Diem.\\" By the time Ellsberg was on the Lansdale team, LBJ was president, Diem and Nhu were dead, and the Vietnamese could only hope that another government like Diem's would be better than a bunch of generals.America clearly considered a coup against Diem at a time when it was trying to be as neutral as possible, because Diem could have asked American diplomats to leave Nam if he had any evidence that the Americans were actively engaging in plots against a government that it was supposed to be supporting. The index is good at sorting out who was involved, though it isn't until page 280 that Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., a brigadier general in the Army Reserves who spent 1962 writing policy papers on Vietnam, was given the opportunity to become the American ambassador to Saigon. In the photo section, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's trip to Saigon on May 12, 1961, established that Frederick Nolting was ambassador then. President Kennedy is shown talking with Henry Cabot Lodge on August 15, 1963, just a few weeks before JFK's CBS television broadcast with Walter Cronkite on September 2, 1963. As usual, \\"Lodge's appointment, the Kennedy administration insisted, ensured bipartisan support for its Vietnam policy. These statements were true, but they did not reflect reality. The White House believed that Nolting had become too close to Diem,\\" (p. 281). The note supporting this information adds, \\"Nolting learned of his removal over radio while on vacation.\\" (p. 501).While this is a history of policy that led to the Vietnam war, there is little sense that any possibility, other than a result which might be considered a victory for American policy, was ever considered. The only use that the Vietnamese had for the Americans was for creating the illusion that somehow America could win a war there. By September 18, 1963, Lodge was trying to get Nhu to leave the country, and reporting back to Washington, \\"one feels sorry for him. He is wound up as tight as a wire. He appears to be a lost soul, a haunted man who is caught in a vicious circle. The Furies are after him.\\" (p. 371).This is history on an emotional level. I have no doubt that Jack Ruby pulled the trigger of the pistol that shot Lee Harvey Oswald in the stomach, resulting in Oswald's death, and it might have been because of a cancer that would take the life of Jack Ruby before the end of the 1960s, when we had learned enough from Lenny Bruce to let just about anybody swear, if they felt like it. For President Kennedy to remain on good relations with the C.I.A., after news started coming in on how bad the situation in Nam really was, is like expecting Americans to believe that Ruby and Oswald were friends, or even knew each other. Oswald and Ruby do not appear in this book. For that side of the story, see OSWALD TALKED by La Fontaine. This book has no news on who took part in the JFK assassination, which is officially still more of a mystery than anything that happened in Nam."},{"Title":"Teaching American Indian Students","review":"The book arrived as stated in Amazon. Very helpful if you work with American Native children."},{"Title":"The Grapes of Wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where none exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book, to go out and buy a copy - any old copy, and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands","review":"As a prairie biologist, I refer to this seminal volume frequently. It is the very best compendium of prairie restoration and management information.Anyone who has been taken by the ecological romance of the tallgrass prairie, and hopes either to know in detail the ecology of these biomes, or to plant or manage one, needs to have this in the personal library. It's mostly technical, but wonderfully engaging for the &quot;prairieophile.&quot; One doesn't really know the prairie until having read this book."},{"Title":"The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands","review":"If you don't already have the original 1997 edition, then this is definitely a 5 star title. However, if you DO have the original, don't bother to buy this one. Despite the various developments mentioned in the preface to this 2005 edition -- advances in no-till planting techniques, restoration strategies for woodland wildflowers, methods for integrating native biodiversity into agriculture, and exploding Internet resources -- none are dealt with here. There is no updated information about weed problems and herbicides, despite the ongoing advance of invasives and development of new products. Lots has happened in the field in the decade since the prior edition was written, but you learn none of it here. This is just a reprint of the original -- and this is quite disappointing.That said, what is covered is truly excellent. It just could have been far better with a thorough rewrite."},{"Title":"The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands","review":"Let me just say that it is nice that someone wrote more than just what plants to use. It is fairly easy to find prairie journals and books that describe everything except how to implement your prairie project. Packard had the good sense to know that seeding rates and implementation techniques are necessary information."},{"Title":"The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands","review":"This is a top rate restoration hand book. Amazing amount of information from people who are out doing the work. It is a collection of essays/chapters written by the front-runners in the field. Everything you wanted to know from site selction to seed collection to fire management. Since it is written by actual prairie restorationists, not theorists it is practical and easy to understand. I will recomend it to everyone who is interested in the field."},{"Title":"The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands","review":"This book has a good range of information, easy enough language and concept presentation for those casually interested in restoration but also provides detailed, applicable info for the professional."},{"Title":"Security Complete","review":"Network Security is fast becoming a technical position that is hard to fill. With all of the things happening in the computer industry, internet and even in the world we need to be able to protect our networks and data from outside intruders, this book is a great start to making your network a more secure place.Having just taken the Security+ beta and beginning to study for Microsoft's new 70-214 Windows 2000 Security exam, this book has provided an unbelievable amount of information. Over 950 pages packed with tips, tricks, ideas and methods for securing the network, the operating system and even the network infrastructure.Tackling Windows 2000 and XP professional, Linux, Netware and Samba and then over 160 pages on firewalls including setup and configuration make this as complete a manual as I have come across so far.Like I said this book works for several security exams and there is even 240 pages for the Cisco CSS1 exam.

These often cannot be answered fully in a few hours, and often they need to pray and meditate on the adventure ahead of them. Pastors and other Christians are always there to answer and help but they really need more. I have found in this read a perfect help for young and old Christians alike. The Angels In Heaven Rejoice is a wonderful book. Inside you will find everything that is needed to explain to a new Christian what their life is now about. Their Salvation through the Blood of Jesus is explained, their benifits for being a child of God is explained, and they are filled with the excitement of what is ahead for them. Not only that but as I read it I myself felt a refreshing that I needed, even though I didn't think I did. Written in a comfortable, warm manner, this book will help to quench doubts and release a wonderful peace to the reader. Very well done."},{"Title":"FINDING STRENGTH: A Mother and Daughter's Story of Childhood Cancer","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I purchased it, and some others, on childhood cancer with a view to finding tools to help me deal with my daughter's recent diagnosis of cancer. Our own journey is still very new (3 months) but our experience has been quite different from that described by the authors. The book is quite critical of the medical profession as a whole. In the journey with cancer, one finds many many different people. It is difficult to believe that so many experiences can be as negative as described by this text. Maybe we are still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase, of looking to professionals to save our daughter's life, but in our journey we have come across so many compassionate, knowledgeable, kind and skilled people. There is no doubt that it is important to be a part of the &quot;professional&quot; team and to know everything one can know about your child's illness, but after reading this book I was left with a negative impression about the relationship between the authors and their health care team. I did enjoy the statistics on childhood cancer; other books are not so detailed, but I was left &quot;cold&quot; by the negative perspective advanced about the medical profession. Surely, Ontario is not so different from Alberta (where our child is being treated) such as to explain such a radically different perspective on pediatric oncology.I also wished that the authors had described more of the emotional impact on them of battling this journey rather than the academic nature of the text. There were times when I felt that this book was a text for a university or college class, rather than a story of the most difficult challenge a family can face.I will reread this book as we continue this journey to see if my perspective changes. I hope it does not."},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","review":"This was a fabulous book, and I hope that many others like it are written (soon!!). For a first book, especially, I am impressed with the way Connolly keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. We **need** more images of and stories centering around strong, independent women (no longer side-kicks or merely sex-objects). One that does this **and** question the authority of state and religion as well as \\"Rising\\" I have not yet read. This book should be put back into print as well as followed up by its already written sequel (just waiting for a publisher)...there is a campaign currently happening for this. BRAVO FLYNN!!!"},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","review":"Perhaps I'm biased. I have a passion for all things Irish, and I mean all things. That's most likely why I enjoyed this book so much, but it's more than that. It's the idea of ordinary people rising against a repressive government and demanding freedom for all people. I got chills toward the end of the book when the actions of the protagonist, Nuala Dennehy, touch off a global demand for justice and freedom for everyone. The potential exists in everyone to change the world for the better.The book ends with a question mark (so to speak). Is there more? There must be. Unfortunately, no information is available as to a sequel. When I contacted the author, I was told that a sequel was on the editor's desk, but this was some years ago. Whatever happened, I remain in anticipation of more from Flynn Connolly."},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","review":"A chilling depiction of what could happen in a theocracy. Many terrible things have been done in the name of organized religion such as the use of religion to pacify oppressed groups within a society and this book illustrates such. Similar to the practice of using religion to keep African American slaves in line, in this book women are the oppressed class. Just as African Americans were told, in pre-Civil War times that they must knuckle under, that God would provide a suitable reward, that a Christian would serve faithfully, women are told that a, &quot;well done thou good and faithful servant&quot; should be enough reward for marrying, popping out babies, keeping the home. Religion is used as a means to oppress in this depiction of Ireland under the control of the Catholic Church. With those issues as background, the author gives us a heroine who will risk all to help liberate her fellow women and nearly pays the ultimate price. If you enjoy reading fictional struggles of the few to help the many then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","review":"Author Flynn Connolly takes a stab at feminist SCI FI, in \\"The Rising of the Moon.\\" Unfortunately, what starts off as an interesting idea: what happens if the Ireland of the future forms a Taliban-like Theocracy? Soon becomes an anti-catholic rant describing the evils of Christianity and the horrors of a society dominated by the Church.Those who know my reading tastes, know I've enjoyed my fair share of feminist fiction and alternate realities but for some reason Rising of the Moon just didn't grip me. Perhaps I prefer books with more action, or perhaps it's just that the characters of R.O.T.M seemed to lecture a bit TOO much on the glories of feminism, that they didn't seem real. I mean, come on, and even little kids seem to be budding feminists.... And everywhere Nuala goes she seems to meet sympathetic activists in the making. What about those who are happy with the Theocracy and the status quo?I wanted to like this book, but I prefer novels where the readers aren't so completely BLUDGEONED with a message. I found it really unbelievable that someone as socially aware as Nuala would have no inkling that Ireland had changed \`so drastically' in fifteen years. She's a teacher for goodness sake! Still, I enjoyed parts of this book, which is why I'm giving it an average rating."},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","review":"This is an interesting read, but the basic premise (Ireland taken over by the Church with a capital C, women oppressed, the IRA to the rescue), doesn't ring true, and the rest suffers badly.

I saw him 18 months later and he looked at me and said YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. Coming from him it was a great complement. I had glowing skin, rosy cheeks, and looked FABULOUS. I lent the books out and never saw them again. 30 years later I have re-ordered the Cookbook and it will be wonderful to see the book again - so many wonderful recipes.

It contains the perspective of a clinical psychologist who elected to obtain fairly extensive cosmetic surgery (for its own sake, not in order to write this book!) and observed herself go through all the emotional turmoil that this produces, which was much greater than she anticipated. She researched the existing literature on the subject, interviewed many patients herself, and then wrote a guide for laypeople to the psychology of the process of obtaining cosmetic surgery--making the decision and dealing with the outcome, good or bad.Don't look to this book for technical information about procedures.

Lord Damien Montjoy, one of Richard's faithful knights who would help the king take Jerusalem, and lord of his own castle back in England, is rewarded by Richard for his valor with the adjoining lands of Lady Katherine (\\"Kat\\") de Montrain--and with the hand of the lady herself. Richard also wants Montjoy there as he needs to secure the north of England from the wiles of his brother John. Ah, but there are legends about the forest there...Robin Hood, LIttle John, Friar Tuck, Lady Greensleeves and the Silver Sword! Prince John would give Kat's hand to the evil de la Ville who will pay him richly as John is ever in need of funds. The Silver Sword, who once saved her father's life, arrives to save her from de la Ville and deliver her to Montjoy, but then the Sword takes her innocence (the way I read it, it's actually a rape, force after a strong \\"no!\\" though there is then some mutual passion involved). Kat is a strong and beautiful young woman...in fact, the Lady Greensleeves herself! She goes on to wed Montjoy, her nemesis from her youth, because he is King Richard's choice and she has few other options. She hates them all! Could she ever love such a man? (\\"Never!\\") Does she love the Silver Sword after their night of intimacy? (\\"No!\\") But all will come right and the legends will have their day.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Damsel in Distress","review":"\\"Damsel in Distress\\" is the re-release of a 1992 novel written by Shannon Drake, aka Heather Graham, now in digital. Graham must have a dozen personalities. She can write any genre, any style. She does romance, mystery, paranormal, you name it, she can write it. This e-book is a traditional romance with all of the cliches and passion that that entails. Kat is a countess who is being dealt to the highest bidder. The prince wants to give her to the evil de la Ville. King Richard gives her to Montjoy, a knight. Knight in shining armor if you will. Both Kat and Montjoy are related to Robin Hood, who plays a bit part in the book.It almost seems there is too much going on. We have 12 Century English politics, Robin Hood, the Crusades, and the love story which is kinda attached to all of the other stories. I thought it was ok. I'm a fan of Graham, but not really of Avon romances. It is well written and well researched. A little heavy on the cliche phrases and heaving bosoms and aching desires. But some people really like heaving bosoms."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Archaeology: Classical Times to the Twenty-First Century","review":"Fagan provides a quick walkthrough of the development of archaeology. He starts with a description of how the ancient Romans would embark on tours of Egypt, to peer at the tombs that were already far older than Rome. And how we are now left with Roman graffiti that is two thousand years old!But the bulk of his narrative concerns archaeology as it developed since the Industrial Revolution. How it had to shake off the albatross of religious Christian dogma. Fagan describes this field primarily through recaps of its most prominent practitioners.

Will buy more books this way."},{"Title":"Ready to Roll: A Celebration of the Classic American Travel Trailer","review":"An architect and a photographer co-authored this classic mix of pix and text that rolls us down the American back roads in high style. From the early almost-train cars manufactured for the wealthy, to the poor man's alternative --- &quot;Sleep in Your Car,&quot; one ad suggests --- we are drawn along by the fantasy of life fully lived away from home, a fantasy that could only have taken root in America, where roads and cars grew up together in serendipitous symbiosis.Before the metal bodies and custom interiors, there had been the Conestoga wagons and, before that, the wooden gypsy vardos of old Europe. Sheepherders had &quot;arks&quot; made for crawling across the lonesome prairie, precursors to &quot;tin can tourism&quot; that attracted freedom-loving Americans almost as soon as they discovered the practicality of the auto itself.From the 1930s onward, the question was not if they would buy it but what shape they would purchase, as independent companies vied for a market share, assembling campers shaped like teardrops, bread loaves and fantastical avian forms lifted from the burgeoning airplane industry.Today's RVers owe much to Wally Byam, a true fanatic whose conception of a trailer accessible to the average middle-class family resulted in the Airstream, arguably the finest development of the pull-along format. With wood paneled mod cons within and an aerodynamic metal bullet exterior, the Airstream divorced trailering from the Oakie image and spawned many imitators. While confections like the Curtiss Aerocar and Pierce Arrow's faux railcar sought the aristocratic end of the market, and utilitarian itsy-bitsy tent-trailer combos attracted the low budget traveler, Airstream sat doggedly in the middle, offering class, ease of hauling and fine workmanship at an affordable price. &quot;Today, more than four decades after his death in 1962, Byam's basic Airstream design continues to roll off the Jackson Center production lines, still widely regarded as the Rolls-Royce of trailers, and still inspiring imitations.&quot;For nearly fifty years in the heyday of over-the-road vacationing, there was a Very Large Array of metal boxes on wheels, with names like Comet, Gypsy Wagon, Spartanette and Airfloat, and some more durable brands like Shasta. Because these ephemeral blips on the trailering screen were often handcrafted and built, remarkably, to last, many are still rolling or at least set up on blocks in mint condition, alluringly photogenic.Gellner and Keister sought them out and tastefully snapped their innards and their outer skins, along with the cars that pull them. Where the snowbirds flock, these metal bubbles proliferate, often hauled by cars of equal interest to collectors. Now there's a new craze, and why are we not surprised --- that of building &quot;vintage&quot; campers, look-alikes to the old timey road runners of the early 20th century. Is this true &quot;camp&quot; or what?Peering inside these metal marvels, via the camera's eye, we get a feeling for what was considered essential to the traveler in times past: parquet flooring, lounge chairs, recessed doors and plastic laminate kitchen counters, the latest thing. Beginning as a simple imitation of home interior design, trailer construction soon became a playground for experimentation in the technology of the tiny, the art of making things work smoothly in cramped quarters without skinning knuckles or having to sleep in a ball.Like millions of Americans, I've followed the camper craze, the boondoggling and midnight interstate rest area getaways. I've moved with the carnival where homes on wheels have to be durable for the weekly hops. Maybe when I retire I'll look for a campsite at Slab City in California or Quartzite, Arizona.If you love this book, then you're the guy for me. You and I could hit the high spots --- starting at Braden's Castle in Reno (that's where we'll get married), then on to Shady Dell in Bisbee, Arizona, where overnight guests can stay in vintage trailers. We'll honeymoon there in the Spartan Royal Mansion.--- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott"},{"Title":"Ready to Roll: A Celebration of the Classic American Travel Trailer","review":"I have a weakness for books on architecture and interior decorating anyway. But this is the one I turn to again and again. For those of us with Champaign tastes and beer budgets, a vintage trailer is ulimately doable. Own your own piece of modernist archeture, albeit on wheels, even though you could never touch a Mies or Wright. When ever I try to figure out what to do with my 1957 Sportcraft (a classic silver-clad \\"canned ham\\"), I flip through these pages. I always find something inspiring."},{"Title":"Ready to Roll: A Celebration of the Classic American Travel Trailer","review":"This book is a great overview of the history and variety of travel trailers out on the road. Great quality pictures of all types of trailers, trailer parks and vintage ads. Finally, an un-biased history of the trailer, which tells the real story of how the Airstream came into being. The inventor of the aluminum aircraft-style trailer finally gets his due (hint: Wally Byam didn't invent it, he just perfected it and marketed it better). Also a great source of ideas for those lost souls who undertake a restoration of these beauties. Americana never looked so beautiful and interesting."},{"Title":"Ready to Roll: A Celebration of the Classic American Travel Trailer","review":"This is an incredible wealth of information for anyone interested in architecture, travel trailers, and Americana in general.

This book has incredible photography for starters, but more importantly they were choosy enough to get the best stuff into the book. You can feel the love for the old canned hams and other tin can glories from the way the book lovingly displays them in all their restored shininess. The fetish for RV's is mostly American, in that other countries buy them, but we have way more per person than any other country, there is something that connects us both to the outdoors as well as the heyday of travel on Route 66 when we see these trailers. The old trailers and their evolution is showcased very well here, with many of the vintage brand names we know - Shasta, Airstream, you name them. The book is also a great nostalgia coffee table book, as guest get a kick out of the photo spreads."},{"Title":"Ready to Roll: A Celebration of the Classic American Travel Trailer","review":"This book has a fine combination of beautiful photos and well written text about an American niche.

For the fate of Cray's father would only be discovered in the light of demon fire...&quot;I couldn't stop reading Sorcorer's Son, from it's intriguing beginning to it's thunderous close.&quot;-Roger Zelazny, Author of The Chronicles Of Amber---If you like demons, you'll love this. The book takes a turn in which Cray becomes a demonologists, and lives upon the demon plane... Decidedly interesting"},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"After the sorceress Delivev Ormoru rejects his marriage proposal, sorcerer Smada Rezhyk becomes worried that she's out to get him. In order to reduce her powers so that he'll have time to weave himself a protective gold shirt, Rezhyk sends his demon slave Gildrum to impregnate Delivev with Rezhyk's own seed. Gildrum takes on the form of a handsome young knight (Mellor) and shows up injured at Delivev's doorstep. As expected, Delivev falls in love with Mellor, but unexpectedly, Gildrum (who doesn't even have a heart) falls in love with her, too. However, Gildrum must return to serve Rezhyk. He doesn't tell Delivev that he's really a demon -- he lies and tells her that he'll come back after he delivers a message.Sure enough, Delivev becomes pregnant and gives birth to Cray. And, of course, Mellor never returns. When Cray becomes a teenager, he decides to find out what happened to the father whom his mother still loves. This leads to a series of adventures which create more questions than answers.Phyllis Eisenstein's Sorcerer's Son is a pleasant coming-of-age novel. The writing, for the most part, is lovely -- it flows well and is not overdone or pretentious. The dialogue, however, (and there is more of it than their needs to be) is sometimes stilted and unrealistic.The plot of Sorcerer's Son is original and interesting -- especially the parts in which Delivev or Rezhyk appear. Delivev has control over nature -- particularly snakes, spiders, and ivy. Rezhyk summons and enslaves various types of demons who live in a complex world and follow strict rules about summoning. These parts are very creative and entertaining and I found that I have developed a respect for Phyllis Eisenstein's imagination.Unfortunately, I just could not believe in Cray, the hero of the story. He was too nice, good at everything he tried, rarely complaining, and too mature, noble, and philosophical for a teenager. Except for the very rare occasions when he lost his temper, he was boring. I'm not into angsty teenage brooding, but Cray could have used a couple more personality dimensions.The ending of Sorcerer's Son was a little too sweet for me, but if you like that sort of story, then this is a good read."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"I found this to be a surprisingly good book (and I am not a big fantasy novel reader). It was just lovely! The romance between Delevev and Gildrum was the highlight for me though. Gildrum, he can pass out at my front door anytime!"},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"I first read this book years ago as a library copy--the title and the smarmy cover painting did not look promising. To my delighted surprise, the story is full of marvelously inventive yet logical plot turns, settings, and details as well as a variety of appealing characters and an appropriately vile villain. Instead of cloying sentiment , there is an underlying warmth that feels honest. There is also suspense, heartbreak and a story that always pulls you on and keeps you guessing. Since the plot extends over a generation, there is space to develop the characters, the story line, and the many unexpected ramifications of magic. There is also a uniquely humanistic depiction of demons (four kinds!) including a tour of their home domains. The ending is exciting and satisfying, but I kept checking to see how many pages I still had left to enjoy and was sorry when they ran out.Though my first copy was from the library, I've bought multiple copies since then for myself and friends. So far, they've all reacted to this book the same way I did. I recently read it for the fourth time and enjoyed it all over again."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"This was a fantastic read. From the cover and the description, it seemed very typical and straight forward. But don't be fooled, this novel is filled with characters with many facets, and lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Eisenstein is not a very prolific writer, but if you enjoy this one, pick up In the Red Lord's Reach, The Crystal Palace and Born to Exile. All are fine reads."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"As a jaded fantasy reader, I immediately recognized the character types I'd seen in a hundred other fantasy novels. What Eisenstein did is take characters that could easily have been cliches and made them live. These people seem real and human, and the story -- the wonderful, absorbing, unique story is so well told I couldn't put the book down. Some scenes were classic fantasy novel moments but they were so well done they seemed fresh, like I was reading the book the others had been imitating. The plot itself was original and satisfying; it kept me guessing/hoping/wondering without relying on illogical, artificial twists, and I can't remember the last time a fantasy novel achieved that."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"I love the world Eisenstein has created here, one where nature and magic interact, and where demons have their own worlds far from the call of man. It is one of the few books that I can start rereading as soon as I finish the last page, because it is always new and refreshing to me!"},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Son","review":"This is honestly the best book i have ever read.

Never before have I read a book with such cookie cutter characters. They are simple and unchanging, with no depths, thoughts, or emotions (the one exception is the knight's mother, she displays her everlasting sadness, but even then, that is her only emotion.)

Emphasis is placed upon the behind-the-scenes dealings of the western powers, with the Soviet Union, over the future of Poland. Strengths of this book include its detailed documentation, including from seldom-cited sources, and its fine description of Operation Burza (Tempest) east of the so-called Curzon Line.There was the usual Churchill-Stalin obsession with the need for Poland to have \\"ethnographic borders.\\" Never mind the fact that the sun never set on the British Empire, most of which consisted of nations in which ethnic Britons were a decided minority, and the fact that the Soviet Union was itself a multi-ethnic state in which, ironically, ethnic Russians were a minority in most of the Soviet Republics!Interestingly, Mikolajczyk had wanted British troops to be sent into Poland alongside the Red Army (p. 19). Mikolajczyk had been repeatedly pressured to give into Soviet demands to annex the eastern half of Poland. He steadfastly refused: \\"He feared that, if he accepted the Curzon Line or even smaller territorial changes in the east, the opposition abroad might brand him and his cabinet as traitors and stage a mutiny in the army.\\" (p. 36)Ciechanowski repeatedly faults Mikolajczyk for not accepting the Curzon Line. He suggests, without any evidence, that, had Mikolajczyk done so, the Soviets would have recognized the London Government (p. 68, 315, etc.)Oddly, Ciechanowski seems to try to exonerate the Soviets. He discusses the Soviet reverses near Warsaw around August 1, 1944, and treats Stalin's refusal to follow Rokossovsky's suggestion to renew the drive to take Warsaw, after August 25, as something ambiguous (p. 251).To be delayed up to three weeks is one thing; to be delayed by five and a half months is quite another. Does Ciechanowski seriously suppose that the Soviets, who had the Germans on the run over several hundred kilometers during the first half of 1944, now suddenly had become so weak that they needed until mid-January 1945 to re-establish their advance (in this case, merely across the Vistula)? And, considering such additional facts as the Soviets calling the Uprising a \\"criminal adventure\\", their disarming of AK units converging on Warsaw to assist the Uprising, and their refusal to allow western Allied planes to land on Soviet-held territory to refuel after their airdrops on Warsaw (except towards the very end, by which time the Uprising had been doomed)--how can there be any rational doubt that the Soviet failure to take Warsaw during the Uprising had been anything other than a cold, deliberate, perfidious act?"},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"Why have I never heard of Jill Marie Landis until now? I'm agonizing over the fact that I could've been enjoying her books all these years. Needless to say I plan to make up for all that lost time by making sure she's on my &quot;get anything written by her&quot; list.I usually prefer a character driven romance where it's heavy on the dialogue. The plot, settings, action and adventure are rarely important to me. Day Dreamer showed me that I just needed to read the right book to open my eyes to what a well rounded romance is all about. This book has it all. And this author can handle it so well that it's never overwhelming or chaotic. Which is what I expected (having been disappointed by other lesser authors) but was so pleased to find I was way off base. Her writing is so smooth and tight that nothing feels half-right or half-done.She made me slowly fall in love with Cord. The Hero. I thought he was pathetic at first. And credit must be given to the author when he can call the heroine a nag and can make it sound endearing. He is definitely not a one or a two dimensional character. Both Cord and Celine are complex characters. She gives back just as well as he can throw it at her. ( but it took me longer than it did Celine to forgive him for...well, I don't want to spoil it but suffice it to say she wasn't entirely blameless and he does such a nice job of making up for it)The back cover just does not do justice to describe this book. Heck, I'm having a hard time attempting to convey what a treasure this book is.And oh the steam they can generate. Yes, I've saved the best for last. For what is a romance without romance? I usually prefer the R to R-17 rated books. Day Dreamer is sensual but I'd rate it at PG-13 to R. But would I change a word? Never! Will I read this book again in the near future and need a fan to cool me when I read the love scenes again? Absolutely!"},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"What a fabulous story! Packed with emotion and deep characterization - in very few words. It could have been 100 pages longer and the story wouldn't have lagged. On the other hand, because the prose was sparse, the story really packed a hard punch. Celine and Cord were wonderful together: how she believed in him and how his heart began to melt and make room for love again. Plus a tearful, exciting climax - what more can I say? A perfect little book."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"It isn't an everyday occurrence. You know what I mean. When you pick up a book, not expecting anything out of the ordinary and then you find out that you couldn't have been more wrong. Day Dreamer is definitely one of those books. At the beginning it seemed, to me, like Cord was a really rude, arrogant man, but as the story wears on you see that Cord isn't that way at all. He just hides his pain and suffering beneath the mask of hostility. Trying to shield his new wife from what remains of his bruised and battered heart. My heart ached when I read about how much Cord has suffered in his short life time. I couldn't help, but feel like his heart would never heal, not even with Celine by his side. Both have suffered so much pain in their lives, but they find in each other, a reason to live again, laugh again, and love for the first time.Personally I don't feel like running from the law is the smart choice, but in Celine's case I couldn't help but cheer her on. Even if she would've waited for the police it wouldn't have mattered. They wouldn't have believed her side of the story. So, for her running was the only choice. But as you find out, you can't run from your past or hide from the future. The past eventually catches up with you. You'll hold your breath during the last sixty pages, but the ending will bring a smile to your face."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"This is my first JM Landis book, and I was well pleased. She told a snappy story which painted a colorful picture in my mind. I could relate to the characters well and found myself really cheering them on. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"I love the older books written by Jill Marie Landis. \\"Day Dreamer\\" has now become my favorite. The characters are rich and indepth. The heroine, Celine Winters, had a small but important role in \\"Just Once.\\" I am ever so glad her story was written. I found myself remembering parts of \\"Just Once\\" as I read overlapping scenes from \\"Day Dreamer\\". Both stories seem more complete now, because we have a greater understanding of both heroines and the individual paths they took after they met for a brief, but important, moment in time.Jill Marie Landis has a talent for making her characters complex with both lovable traits and human flaws as well. Celine is blessed, or sometimes cursed, with the ability to see a person's past memories by simply touching them. I especially enjoyed this spin on her personality. Just a touch of the supernatural. It was quite unexpected, but very believable. This makes her story unique and not just a typical romance novel heroine.\\"Day Dreamer\\" takes place in three main locations. First, in both the poor and rich areas of New Orleans, then aboard a passenger ship for an extended amount of time, and finally on a sugar plantation located on a tropical island in the West Indies. Plenty of geography covered here!The locations are detailed and give the story a very nice depth. The amount of time spent of the passenger ship is something I found very believable and much of the story develops here. Most authors mention travel on ships but don't really expand on the amount of time that would most definately be spent traveling between countries.The supportive characters are well written and you get a sense of the whole extended family that is created by the end of the story. They each have their own sence of humor and unique personalities. They are all enjoyable.All and all, this one is a keeper! It may be an older novel, but worth taking the time to find it at the library or buying it used on Amazon."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"When I started to read Jill Marie Landis books I didn't know what I was in for. Now I search every store I go into for her books. When I picked up Day Dreamer, I knew she had out done herself again. I was caught up in the book to the point I took it every where I went. I couldn't put it down. I felt as if I was there, living side by side with Celina. I loved this book and everyone that Jill Marie Landis ever wrote."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"I TOTALLY DISAGREE with the reader from Malaysia.Should she not have skipped all those pages perhaps she would have discovered an unforgettable story."},{"Title":"Day Dreamer","review":"EXCELLENT -- get all three books -- you won't be sorry.Cord Moreau was to have attended his cousin, Alex's wedding -- now he is dead.

Sad to say she has lost her touch this time. Celine is boring and Cord has a very shallow character. I cannot wait till the end and skipped so many pages just to finish the book. If I had borrowed it, it would be returned right after the 5th chapter. The first few chapters were interesting until Celine and Cord left for St. Stephen island. Thereafter, it's not worth the time I spent. It's certainly not worth the money I spent."},{"Title":"Sex Appeal: The Art and Science of Sexual Attraction","review":"Ok, so it's not a work of heavy scholarship (maybe see David Buss for that) or entirely a how-to-be-successful-at-love/sex/romance book -- Cabot's website is indeed pretty good for that, not that there are none of those helpful and practical pointers here. This is the kind of book you could give to your kid sister. And it glows with style (hint, hint...). I certainly think it's worth more than the measley two stars the other two reviewers gave.The authors have surveyed the entire field of research in this extensive area and put together almost all the interesting little tidbits and theories into an enjoyable and easy-to-read format. Even someone who thinks they're not a beginner will be sure to learn some cool things here which will make them sound like an expert at their next social gathering. I really liked the tone of the book and its often layed-back, bemused approach to a topic which can often lead to furrowed brows and a grim outlook on things. You got interested in sex research because you thought it would be fun, didn't you? This book delivers. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Sex Appeal: The Art and Science of Sexual Attraction","review":"I enjoyed this book because it's one of my favorite topics. The book has some interesting things to say, although it's more along the lines of a magazine's style than I had anticapted. Some of the more recent findings aren't in here, such as shoulder-to-waist ratio for men. Sex appeal is also aimed slightly more toward women than men. I would have preferred more research, and less filler, but I read it cover to cover."},{"Title":"Sex Appeal: The Art and Science of Sexual Attraction","review":"This book is good if you are looking for research on the topic of sexual attraction (there are some interresting facts to be learned) but it's lacking in practical advice. In addition, the first few chapters seem to be all about why people are attracted to \\"10's\\", models, actresses and other perfect people. There's even a page listing the costs of plastic surgery. I was hoping to find out how to better use the posative traits I was born with in order to create my own sex appeal. This book made me feel that I could only do that by attempting to look more like Pamela Anderson or Gretta Garbo. I think that if you are looking for practical advice in relationships that you might be better off trying \\"How to Make a man Fall in Love with You\\" or \\"Man Power--How to Win the Woman You Want\\" by Dr. Tracy Cabot. I found that 20 minutes on her website ... gave me more insite into sex appeal than the entire reading of this book. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is because it makes an interesting coffee table book and the pictures are beautiful."},{"Title":"Sex Appeal: The Art and Science of Sexual Attraction","review":"There was a lot of interesting information about appeal on many levels(scent, appearance, voice, charisma etc.), from different cultures, and across time. However, some information just wasn't accurate. The information they put in there about what females supposedly like in a man was very different on some facts from how I feel(in some parts of the book). As far as the accurateness of what was appealing in a female, I can't fully vouch for that, but it did make me wonder on some factors. I also felt that it was so focused on this one subject(this is one small aspect of life), that it was something a bit unhealthy to indulge in the book too much. Overall though, I thought this was a great book. Being a left-brained person, I loved the approach to the &quot;art&quot; of beauty from a scientific perspective."},{"Title":"Bible story book: A complete narration from Genesis to Revelation for young and old","review":"I have been looking for a bible-type book for my 10-year-old grandddaughter who just got a Kindle.

The entire Katz family is complex and their struggles thought-provoking and sympathetic. The supporting cast - nurses, gangsters, Nazi prison guards, models - are the fantastic foliage surrounding the main characters.Thane Rosenbaum keeps good company with other fine Jewish writers, some of whom interweave the Holocaust with other themes, some of whom stay in the shtetl, and some of whom just stay parked on the Lower East Side - go Tepper!"},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Since the end of WWII, many books, movies and plays have been written about the Holocaust, the people who died and survived and what these people made of their lives after the war. But little except for Helen Epstein's book, Children of the Holocaust, addressed the effect of their parents experiences during the war and in the camps and how they related to their children.As a Jewish woman who was brought up on the Lower East Side before it became the East Village, I clearly remember storekeepers, my paents friends, some neighbors and others who had tattooed numbers on their arms. I was told not to ask where they came from until one day my mother explained the Holocaust to me. I played with survivor's children, went to school with them and even dated a few as we got older. As I became older I began to hear from these children about their parents eccentricities which were clearly born from the Holocaust. One friends father slept with a packed suitcase under the bed in case they had to run in the middle of the night. One friends mother could never go into an elevator since she was so claustrophobic after living in theconcentration camps. Another friends mother could never drive near train tracks because she saw herself in a cramped car and observing one friends parents, a German Jewish couple who crossed the street every time a policeman appeared on the same side where they were walking. And finally there was my friend whose father seemed to come out of the Holocaust unscathed until Eichmann was tried in Israel and he suffered a nervous breakdown.Today there are groups all over the world which are populated by children of the Holocaust and relatives. They meet t discuss their experiences with family members and the similarities and differences in their lives.Thane Rosenbaum, the author of the book I recently finished, Second Hand Smoke, was a man whose parents survived the camps. He was raised in Miami Beach as was the main characters of his well written and poignant book.Duncan Katz is born to a most unusual mother. Early on, after she was living in Miami she befriended a delivery man who went on to become a member of organized crime and never forgot her or her family. Mila Katz was a card shark who hardly nurtured her son. Her very decision to name a Jwish son, Duncan, was unusual for the time. And as she lay dying she revelaed that before she left Poland after the war she left her first born son there who was raised as an orphan. Twelve years after his mother's death Duncan is told by one of his mother's Mafia friendes and his protector that he has a half brother who lived out the war as a baby and now lives in Poland. It doesn't tkae Duncan too much time before he decides to travel to Poland to meet this brother. Perhaps Duncan thinks that both he and his brother and can put to rest some of the demons left by their parents from their experiences during the Holocaust. Duncan has devoted his working life to finding thos guilty of war crimes still living as free men. But he is fired after one of his quests manages to evade the arm of the law. He is also seperated from his wife and each day is a challenge for him to get through. Clearly he is obsessed by hius mother and the Holocaust and wants to right all of the wrongs which is evident when he visits Auschwitz and Birkeneau. But his brother Isaac is the antithesis of Duncan. He is a yoga instructor and the caretaker of the Jewish cemetary where their great grandfather, an esteemed Rabbi is buried. As they travel through Poland and meet up with some very aggressive Nazis, they learn that they too are survivors and that life ultimately is good.I first bought this book when it was published on the advice of a friend but never read it then. For whatever the reason, I decided to pick it up now and I am so glad I did. I doubt that I will ever forget these characters who were so well fleshed out and the experiences both Duncan living with his mother and Isaace living without her have. And finally how they are able to put to rest their mother and the effect of the Holocaust on them. As the years have gone by there are fewer and fewer survivors left and in a few more years they may all be gone. It is important that we never forget these people many of whom incarcerated under the worst conditions managed to survive and go on to lead productive lives. This book will most likely be among my top ten books of 2012 if not number 1. I recommend that you read this book and others devoted to the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"The book starts out rather slowly, increases in interest as it goes along.It really hits it's stride about a third of the way through. It does capture your imagination and seemingly is autobiographical,the child of Holocaust survivors. Is it worth your time? Definitely, once you get into the story of a seemingly heartless mother, controlling a son to be more than he should be."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"This book left me drained. It is a magnificently written story of how holocaust survivors live their lives and pass their horrors to their children. It is a must read and an important book to remind the world of what was done. Rosenbaum's use of language is marvelous and he keeps you enthralled in the story. I could not put the book down and immediately bought his book Elijah Visible-another magnificent book. Rosenbaum is an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Second Hand Smoke takes the reader on the main character's astounding and moving voyage of self-discovery. It is a novel that unfolds and spirals outward, giving us successive levels of understanding and meaning as we read. Rosenbaum's writing is impressive throughout, but especially so when depicting the relationship between the protagonist and his mother. Even subplots are skillfully handled--as with fugitive Nazi whom our main character tracks down. I would recommend this book highly to anyone interested in serious fiction."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Second Hand Smoke by Thane Rosenbaum is a brilliant tour de force through a world so beyond the imagination of most of us that it appears impossible to recreate it through our known language, but Mr. Rosenbaum has managed to lead us from &quot;planet Auschwitz&quot; to &quot;planet post-Auschwitz&quot; as a matter of course.Second Hand Smoke once and for all puts to rest the (Christian?) notion that when people are put through hell on earth - are humiliated, denigrated, tortured, starved, forced to witness the murder of loved ones, deprived of all hope, compelled to give in to their darkest impulses in order to survive, a saint comes out at the other end. A saint who henceforth acts with compassion, empathy, understanding, self-effacing modesty and especially wisdom, a saint, who has conquered all earthly demons and from now on will lead a pure and virtuous life. Even though psychology shows the exact opposite, we seem to cling to this notion. Mr. Rosenbaum has no intentions of making us see survivors as almost-saints, purified through the proximity to gas chambers and the stench of thick smoke billowing from the chimneys of the crematoria. He courageously shows us the devastating and sad 'kaputness' of the world the protagonist of his novel grows up in. Yet, the survivors from \`planet auschwitz' he describes never sink to the level of caricatures, fully engage us in their tortured complexity and command our empathy. They are fully developed people who will not tempt us to say &quot;aha, this is what \`survivors' are REALLY like&quot;, instead, his book helps us to understand that \`survivors' come in all shades - just as non-survivors.Duncan parents' world is characterized by small-time crooks, gamblers, people who &quot;engaged in the most futile of get-rich-schemes and a rabbi &quot;whose only apparent calling was to piss God off whenever possible.&quot; Clearly, Auschwitz was not intended as, and did not become by perverse logic, an institution for character &quot;...they were damaged. Irreversibly ruined. The Katz family of Miami came assembled that way, without manuals or operating instructions or reassuring warranties. Everything was already broken. Nothing worked right. Nothing ever would. The damage is what defined them best.&quot;Duncan's life is dominated by his mother Mila who perceives friends &quot;as enemies in disguise. A survivor's world was generally divided into black, off-black, more black and still blacker perceptions - with no other color combinations left on the palette.&quot;author of TALES FROM A CHILD OF THE ENEMY"},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Paints a vivid picture of Miami Beach, the authors own mother, and the scars that have been left behind. I look forward to his next novel."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"I often find Holocaust material very painful and I feel like I know &quot;enough.&quot; Like most Jews, the Holocaust is too engraved in my psyche. Still, in &quot;Second Hand Smoke,&quot; - which I only bought and read because I saw Thane speak at a book talk and I was truly impressed - Rosenbaum defines the Holocaust's impact on the next generation - the children of survivors. Like Frazier's &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; which paints the Civil War without a single battle, &quot;Second Hand Smoke&quot; avoids the camps but captures the horror.This is a brilliant novel. It is structually perfect, it swims in metaphor, it dances through time, it's funny, and it hurts. I am grateful that Rosenbaum took me to a place that I didn't necessarily want to be. I feel wiser.&quot;Second Hand Smoke&quot; moves. No preaching. No indulging. Just raw, honest story telling. A great read!"},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"If you never read another book, you must read this novel. No, it's not about the tobacco industry; it's a post-Holocaust story, funny and gut-wrenching. It addresses the question: is it possible for survivors to have any kind of &quot;normal&quot; life?For Rosenbaum's characters, the answer is a resounding &quot;no.&quot; Told from the son's point of view, the story begins with Duncan Katz's bris in Miami Beach, where his parents--the survivors-- have settled. You will love Morty the Mohel who never misses an opportunity to rail against the god he doesn't believe in. Mother Mila, who becomes the mascot/mentor of the Jewish mafia,cajoles her son to move faster, as he grows up, through all the karate colors. Then it's taekwondo and kickboxing. To hon his skills, she drops him off in rough neighborhoods, a move which even her mob friends question.The Katz mindset &amp; lifestyle make perfect sense if you are a Holocaust survivor, but you wouldn't want to grow up in their home.You will want to read this book again."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"This is a fascinating story of Duncan Katz, the son of Holocaust survivors, and how his parents' horrific experiences in the concentration camps had such an invasive influence on his own well-being, in the same way that second-hand cigarette smoke can make non-smokers quite ill!Mr. Rosenbaum has a very interesting writing style. Poetic and at times surreal (and sometimes a bit complicated), the author creates a world where not all Jews are portrayed as \\"nice Jewish boys\\", where characters such as Mila (Duncan's mother - a card shark and a gangster), Duncan and Isaac are larger-than-life but fascinating. The conclusion was extremely satisfying.I feel that this story is very important, especially as the world loses many Holocaust survivors to old age. As those with the numbers tatooed on their arms pass on, we need someone to remind the world of the atrocities inflicted by Adolf Hitler on millions and it how it still effects current generations. Thane Rosenbaum has done that job in SECOND HAND SMOKE quite effectively!"},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Thane Rosenbaum was my professor at Fordham Law School. If you cannot spare three years and $80,000 for a legal education to get a full semester-long exposure to the unique viewpoint of this gifted iconoclast - this book may be the next best thing. His voice resonates with a deep understanding of the evil that men can do but a great hope for the power of redemption and love. The book reveals - in a story which blends humor, anguish and elloquent prose (in perfect proportions) the depths of human and emotional complexity - and the amazing perspective that Thane represents. Read this book."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"This is an extremely well-written novel about the child of Holocaust survivors. It is extremely suspenseful, and although parts of it are painful to read, it is difficult to put down. One of the main issues the book addresses is coping in a world that can be evil. It is also a book about families, reconciliation, and understanding."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"I was surprised by the book in its very sad long ago beginnings.

My favorite of the three superb books by the author. Excellent writing, suspenseful plot and a great moral story come together in this sleeper of a book."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"As the adult child of a survivor it is refreshing to read from another child a creative telling of both the survivors and child's stories. We are called upon to continue to tell the stories again and again so that they may never be repeated. As our world changes they way we must tell the story must change too. It is important that we honor the memories of those who died, those who survived, and those of us who now hold the stories with publications just like this. And for American Jews the kindness which the book shows through humor makes breaking the sometimes deafing silence easier."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"This may not be a proper sort of review, but it definitely is an endorsement. Take it from me, you should read this book! I finish about one of three novels I start. Life is too short to be wasted wading through the semiliterate, commercial hackwork cluttering bookstore shelves (it's a shame publishers cannot be required to turn such books back into trees). So when a work of such high intelligence, creativity, and literary skill as this by Thane Rosenbaum arrives, note must be taken. I won't try to describe this book, because other reviewers have done so as well as or better than I could. But don't linger over the reviews - run and get the book! You will be entertained and enlightened, and finally encouraged by the realization that there may still be writers among us."},{"Title":"Second Hand Smoke: A Novel","review":"Thane Rosenbaum has accomplished a rare feat with Second Hand Smoke. He has managed to weave a magical fable out of the ashes and bones of a real world tragedy in a way that entrances the reader without compromising the true horror of history. Make no mistake, this book is not a dry Holocaust memoir or a grim and sorrowful tale--it is a comic-tragic mystery and suspense story filled with rich hot-blooded life, spirit and humor. It unfolds in precise and elegant prose that never once becomes pedantic or scolding--Rosenbaum tells his story with a poets ear and a surgeons eye. His creation of character, time and place are intentionally writ large- and this is what makes reading Second Hand Smoke a literary joy as well as a revelatory insight into the strange, amazing and disturbing ways of human survival.

The Performance Factor is the heart of these principles and I have watched as organizations applied them. Synergy was created, i.e. 1+1= 3,4,5. These principles work, regardless of what culture you are in, for I have taught them in North America, UK, Asia, South East Asia and Thailand. It is simply the best investment you will ever make for the success of your organization."},{"Title":"The Performance Factor: Unlocking the Secrets of Teamwork","review":"MacMillan has demystified what it takes to turn a group of people into a high-performance team. In recent years, much has been written on the topic of teams, and much has been done to implement team structures in organizations of all kinds. But until now, nowhere have the factors underlying effective teams and teamwork been woven together so sensibly as they have been in The Performance Factor. MacMillan's team model is elegantly simple in concept, yet significantly robust in its logic. The Performance Factor not only lays out the 6 components needed to produce high performance teams, the pieces are linked together in such way that it is simple to see how each component relates to the others. In addition, MacMillan provides many examples from the real world to show clearly the realities and challenges facing groups who choose to emotionally invest in true teamwork. The book is incredibly rich with details and practical advice, and so readable that I found myself feeling as though I was having a private conversation with the author.MacMillan gives team leadership particular attention because leadership is such a critical part of any team's success. At the end of each chapter is a \\"Message to Team Leaders\\", words of wisdom dedicated to helping team leaders fully understand their roles and responsibilities. An aspect of the \\"Messages\\" that I found particularly noteworthy was the recurring emphasis on service to team members and team purpose, a critical behavior required of truly effective team leaders.I suspect that most who read \\"The Performance Factor\\" will ultimately read it more than once, and that those who are really serious about wanting to promote the \`exceptional' results, achievable only through truly high-performance teams, will keep the book close at hand for ready reference."},{"Title":"The Performance Factor: Unlocking the Secrets of Teamwork","review":"This book is one of the best I've read on teams and team leadership. MacMillan's comprehensive model breaks down the somewhat mysterious business of effective teamwork and gives an overarching framework that gets to the heart of high performance. Six components (Purpose, Roles, Leadership, Processes, Relationships, and Communication) form a wheel that turns throughout the book. Each section of the wheel is explained in detail, with plentiful anecdotes and visual aids. The author also includes sections on team principles, possible pitfalls, and the process of building a high-performance team, among others. At the end of each chapter the author addresses \`the bottom line' and includes a message to team leaders, making the principles of the book practical and doable. A helpful team assessment instrument is included in an appendix. Teams have become an integral component of successful organizations, and in this book MacMillan makes high performance teamwork accessible to anyone interested in learning. Packed with wisdom and insight, it's a must-read for anyone working with others to achieve extraordinary results."},{"Title":"The Performance Factor: Unlocking the Secrets of Teamwork","review":"Not the book I wanted.

The author retells the story of United Flight 232 throughout the book to make his points. It brings the principles to life in a very real life way. The \\"team wheel\\" and the chapters on the qualities of a high performance team are worth the price of the book alone.This book would be of real value to anyone leading a team. It would be an especially good resource for consultants as well. Lots of graphs and diagnostic tools make the book feel like a library of resources.On a personal note, there is a lot you can apply to any set of relationships where you are on a team. I learned a lot about being a husband and dad just reading it!"},{"Title":"The Performance Factor: Unlocking the Secrets of Teamwork","review":"MacMillan's text helps readers see the benefits of working in a team oriented environment. The Performace Factor is nothing to write home about and doesn't really shed new light on the academic discussion of administration.

With the right blend of principle and practice, this book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand what teamwork and leadership are all about in the real world."},{"Title":"The Performance Factor: Unlocking the Secrets of Teamwork","review":"Pat MacMillan is one of the top consultants in the USA to Fortune 500 businesses and non-profit organizations.

The hard part is getting a group of people to perform like a high performance team. The answer is found in Pat MacMillan's latest book The Performance Factor.MacMillan's book is a must read for anyone leading teams, or anyone aspiring to lead teams. It is simply the best resource for both conceptual framing and practical application of high performance teams. The book is centered on a high performance team model that MacMillan has been working with for years. The model is simple and intuitive, and therefore effective. The book is packed with examples and tools to improve your chance of reaching high performance results.

I was caught bookless and had to have something quickly a couple of days ago, so I picked this up on the title alone. I read widely, but my weakness has always been mysteries, preferably of the who-done-it variety with psychological insights. I've read historial and contemporary, procedurals and cozies..lots and lots of English and American writers. So I figured...The 50 Greatest Mysteries! Edited by a Big Name in mystery fiction. I expected well written and carefully chosen mysteries, including lesser known fascinating puzzles. Penzler is well known in mystery literature: owner of the Mysterious Bookshop, compiler, guest lecturer...a Name in the Business. The \\"Best\\" of anything is always an argument, so even if the stories were not \\"the best\\" they would certainly be contenders.The stories are arranged chronologically, and Penzler provides a very brief introductory paragraph. He does not suggest why the story is included (and in one instance, refers to a story that is not included as better than his example). He doesn't discuss or distinguish between a true mystery, a suspense story, a procedural or a cozy. Arguments abound as to what is a 'mystery' and Penzler doesn't attempt to add to or resolve the discussions. He adds no insights or points of view--nothing to justify his choices. Some of his dated pieces are charmless, so I have to assume they were included as exemplars of the period, but Mr. Penzler doesn't place the unfamiliar within a context. Instead, he seems to have included the oldest first, plodding through the genre to fill the pages before the next book, which will probably be called Another 50 of the Greatest Mysteries. The book seems complied haphazardly and named to sell.Perhaps I ask too much. There are some lovely stories,and some that are interesting. He includes a brief suspenseful piece by Edith Wharton. She's a lovely writer, but not an ounce of mystery is involved in the tale. The Red Headed League is an early Sherlock Holmes which is fun but not the best of Doyle. I can't argue with The Purloined Letter (Poe), and am happy to known that writers not known for mysteries actually wrote a few (Jack London, Aldus Huxley, Thomas Hardy[and its a good one], Thurber, AA Milne, Ogden Nash) but they are not the Greatest Mysteries. Fredrick Irvington Anderson's story is dated and tiresome--and Mr. Anderson is not a familiar name. Mr. Penzler doesn't crack stories from 1950 until page 327--two thirds of the way through the book. But it is probably cheaper to republish stories well past their copyright conflicts date.They ain't The Greatest Mysteries. They are sometimes interesting. Some are truly fine. If you want context, insight or thematic consistency, look elsewhere. These are complied tales, not an editor's choice. On the other hand, if you are caught bookless and need 567 page of choices, you will find some good stories, some seldom published historical oddies to leaf through, some to skip and certainly, along the way, something to like."},{"Title":"The 50 Greatest Mysteries of All Time","review":"I confess.

I've read hundreds, nay thousands of murder mysteries, all of Agatha Christie, Conan Doyle and all the \\"classic\\" purveyors of crime. Or so I thought. Out of the 50 selections that appear between these covers as selected by Otto Penzler, I'd read fewer than 8-well below the Mendoza line. So I've found the ideal poolside book for the Summer-short, well written, riveting. Follow the trail for yourself. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. In the unlikely event you've read them all before you can always pass it on -teachers and adolescents tend to love this sort of thing. Hmmm...Is there a connection here.

Ah, but there are other Christmas stories which put a unique twist on Christmas from an African-American perspective. Collected for the first time in one source are Christmas stories told by African-Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.The stories they share and their backgrounds are diverse. You have authors who were journalists, actors, educators, activists and radicals. Many of them were born into slavery and all of them suffered through the sickness of racism. Most of them were the leaders of their day such as Ida B. Wells and T. Thomas Fortune.How are these stories different from other Christmas tales? All of the stories were serialized in Black periodicals and newspapers.They address social and economic inequities (for all people) in their society . A persistent theme of the uplift of the race by those who have the resources is a continual thread throughout the book. You will also find some amusing tales that will give you a great belly laugh! Christmas is the background but our authors stress the need for social and economic uplift with compassion for the poor.The book gives us a brief biography of the writer, a synopsis of the story and reviews the historical context. I liked the brief introduction but felt some of the information took away from the stories themselves. Such a treasury is a must to have under the Christmas tree, a gift for Kwanzaa and as a present throughout the year.

As the President gives a speech in Boston, a body is found in an alley outside - a body that resembles the President in every way. Who was it? Who killed it, and why? Almost (but not quite) against his will, the President's press secretary is drawn into the mystery. Ultimately, the reader ends up being way ahead of the characters, but the ride, as one expects from Bova, is entertaining.The novel takes place in an unspecified time, but probably around the late 1990's. It is always interesting to compare how the future actually unfolded to the way an author hypothesized. Fortunately, urban America has not imploded as Bova theorized. Even more fortunately, videophones have not become the norm. Interestingly, in the background of The Multiple Man is an invasion of Kuwait - this time by the Shah of Iran instead of Iraq (and isn't it strange to think of a world in which the Ayatollah never took power?). Bova wisely kept societal and technological changes in the background, so the conflicts between his future society and our own are noticeable but not distracting."},{"Title":"THE MULTIPLE MAN [A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE]","review":"I'm a big fan of Bova...but I've read several of his earlier works recently and they've only been passable. I finished this book just last night. The story idea was an interesting one but Bova didn't flesh it out enough. The characters were a bit too cardboardy (&lt;--is that a word?). The novel is definitely dated...because it's a political-based novel written in 1976 I entirely expected this. There were some interesting references that I doubt many people got. For instance, one of the background characters whom you never meet but is mentioned is said to have moved to Sri Lanka...also, another briefly mentioned character had the last name of Bester. The first is surely an homage to Arthur C. Clarke who has lived Sri Lanka for many years (perhaps going as far back as 1976, I don't honestly know); and the briefly mentioned Bester character is surely an homage to Alfred Bester...his most famous work is The Demolished Man, I've never read it but hear it's quite good. Aside from Bova's homages to his fellow Scifi writers, Bova also predicted at one point in the book the development of closed-captions on TV...you have to remember that this book was written in the mid-70's...most people didn't even have cable back then. To sum up, The Multiple Man leaves something to be desired...but for hardcore Scifi and/or Bova fans it's certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This book was a great guide to the VB exams -- I passed both using this book plus the Transcenders. (For a sanity check I also used the Troytec guides.) Yes, overkill, but I passed both with high 900s. This book actually is good (if not better) as a desktop reference. For the &quot;bare essentials to pass&quot; crowd (including me), sometimes I felt the author spent a bit too much time on things that weren't directly on the exam. Yes, they were enlightening and good foundation material, but weren't always directly relevant.

I used only it, Transcender and Exam Cram when I first attempted the Distributed test last year, and barely failed. The Hawhee book by New Rider's fills in the holes that Foxall doesn't, or at least doesn't do well. Namely, the Creating User Services portion of the test, IIS Applications and DHTML applications.The Foxall book seems to make the mistaken assumption that if you are a VB programmer at all, and any good, of course you use menus, ListView, Treeview, Imagelist, etc. in your programs all the time. I mostly program ActiveX DLLs and none of my programs use external files (at least in such a way that I would need a Treeview/Listview combination, or even a Windows Common Dialog to go schplunking through directories.) Both that attitude (and the comparative lack of information on these topics) sent me looking for other supplementation, which again, I found in the huge Hawhee book.Now the Foxall book DOES give much better coverage of COM and ADO than anything else, and that counts for a lot on BOTH tests.It's not a bad book. Just an incomplete one.None of the books that I saw gave an adaquate look at the Package and Deployment wizard (at least as far as the Desktop exam goes.)(After using the Hawhee book and Transcenders, I passed with 885 for Distributed and 814 for Desktop.)"},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"... and this book is the reason.

O'Reilly's web site support for the book is excellent as well. The author has posted an excellent write-up that details how to approach the tests, with excellent recommendations for additional study aids.

I purchased this tome some time ago in order to prepare for the VB exams. My decision was based on the 4 Plus star ratings, but I must tell anyone interested that I have been very disappointed in the book. I find it misleading, ambiguous and in some cases plain wrong. For instance, I got the exercise on pages 205-211 to work fine, although a brief explanation of why the index of the first option button was set to 1 would have been very helpful to a beginner. And, if the hands on exercise on pages 212-215 works you couldn't prove it by me. I've reentered the thing twice, checked that the database exists and can be browsed in Access. But for the life of me the thing doesn't work. I suppose this is a reflection of how little I've learned to this point and could be due to some failing on my part. However, I am sure that I have entered what is in the book and applied as much insight as thirty years of programming might provide, but when I click on the data control arrows nothing happens.

This book covers all these little aspects that even the best of programmers might not know. Microsoft exams are more concentrated on the Microsoft technologies, tools and softwares then the programming part itself.This book covers every inch of what you need to know.

It's a great book.The beauty of it is that it doesn't assume you're starting from ground zero. You have to know the basics of building VB apps with forms, built-in controls, database access, etc. That's why it's only 600 pages! However it does start from the beginning on topics a lot of us experienced VB developers have not used much if at all such as building ActiveX controls, using MTS, using property pages, licensing, digital signatures, etc. -- all items you have to know for the first two core exams.If you're going to get your MCSD, GET THIS BOOK and through out everything but your Transcenders, your copy of MSDN, and your Bible.

Often these errors appeared in the review exercises at the ends of the chapters.Luckily, the publisher is on top of these and may correct them in later editions.

You will not find how to fill a listbox in this book. Or how to create a control array.Another thing about most of the MCSD books that bothers me, is that most of them cut and paste their tutorial sample code from Microsoft... no origninality and little real-world issues.This author covers real world issues that are truly important when designing a VB project. His style of writing is clear and straightforward. I appreciate this.Microsoft makes an effort to make the MCSD certification meaningful by including questions on the exams that you will only know the answer to if you have confronted the issue in your own experience or know the concepts so well, that you can think through the problem to a solution. This weeds out people who have no experience whatsoever and study a book in order to get the cert. I enjoyed the coverage of incorporating help and optimization; issues that can really make or break an application.This book is NOT a How to Program with VB beginner book... rather a discussion of the key concepts that experienced programmers need to know to be certified.Thank you Mr. Foxall!"},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I used MSPress VB 6 Study Kits as well as New Riders to prepare for my MCSD exams.

This is the best investment I have made in books. This book is not for the begginer. It is a treasure chest of practical information. It feels like I am speaking to a very experience professor whom is giving me all the tricks of the trade. This guy actually answers questions others assume you know the answer for.

(bear with me, I am such a happy camper right now that I felt I should share the source of my success for those who are looking for good study materials) I have to give a huge amount of credit to the O'Reilly book MCSD in a Nutshell. The book is geared for the 70-176 and 70-175 exams. What I liked is that the book started off with the assumption that you know the basics of VB and you now want to get into the more meaty topics. It is very well written and digs deeply into COM Components and ActiveX Controls. Each Chapter has a summary at the beginning that lists the topics and which of the two exams they apply to. It also has little &quot;side bars&quot; throught the chapters on things you should remember for the exams. The Key Facts, review questions and exercises at the end of each chapter are also very appropriate.I had also used the MCSD Training Kit from MS. That book was not nearly enough. MCSD in a Nutshell turned out to be a much better investment. Get it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"Great buy !

After reading the first chapter, I know that even if I did not proceed with the exams I was not wasting my time reading the book. The information is concise, informative and real world.This book is a survival guide as well as a study guide. I already used the book several times to resolve programming issues and design techniques. 80% of my development time is programming around the Visual Basic quirks and unknowns. The book touches on these quirks and defines the fine line differences.The kicker of it all, I e-mailed the author a question relating to a topic in the book.

I had read several others books but were thoroughly disappointed. They covered basic topics and only skimmed the surface neglecting most of the areas that you will be tested on. MCSD in a nutshell, on the other hand, thoroughly discusses each topic. If you are intending to pass the exams, this should definitely be in your arsenal. Combine this book with the transcender exams and you should have an excellent opportunity to pass the exams.This book is written for experienced advanced users of visual basic. It does not cover basic visual basic information such as loops, lists, combo boxes, etc. The author expects you to have learned these topics previously. It instead concentrates on the complex concepts that you will be tested on. If you are a beginner, you will need to buy other books to become familiar with the Visual Basic language.In addition, once you have passed the exams this book will not gather dust on your shelf.

However, if someone needed my recommendation for only one book, Foxall's &quot;MCSD in a Nutshell&quot; would be it. Unlike many other MCSD books, Foxall doesn't spend any time insulting professional VB programmers with beginner VB details (which, believe it or not, is what some MCSD books do in their first chapters). On page 9, he's already describing how to display a pop-up menu during program runtime. He assumes that if you need a beginner's tutorial, you shouldn't even be thinking about these exams.The book begins with a table dividing the skills &amp; technologies tested on these two exams, the way every certification book should begin. Foxall's treatment of COM and ActiveX is outstanding. In fact, I learned more in the 38-page COM chapter than I did in all of Wrox's VB COM book. The chapters on &quot;Packaging &amp; Deployment&quot; &amp; &quot;Visual SourceSafe&quot; are also noteworthy, primarily because other books skimp on these topics while Microsoft still heavily tests on them.A final note: people will be drawn to this book mainly for help passing the MCSD exams.

It has the best info on COM I've seen, and explains it clearly. Good luck finding any other guide with a good explanation of Apartment threading. It is well organized, and will have a permanent place on my desk at work for reference along with VB/VBA Nutshell. It is that good.

But if you're taking the Desktop exam, by all means, use this book. I wrote the exam today and scored 928/1000 (92% - 714/1000 is a passing score). The author, James Foxall, cuts through the basics with which most books bore us, and gets right to the important details. If you buy this book, make sure that you get the January 2001 reprint (the second edition). I have the original October 2000 edition, and it is riddled with errors, especially in the most important chapter: Packaging and Deploying. Some errors are not even listed on O'Reilly's errata list.

Only ~350 pages of actual reading, scary thing is I learned more than when I read most 1000+ pagers.Covers everything you need to know for the exams and covers it better than I've ever seen. I you used to wonder about ActiveX, classes, and objects in VB than wonder no more. You'll get it after reading this. I only wish all books were this good (and short)."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This book is a work of frank honesty. James Foxall is an author who finally respects my time! (And shares my opinion on HTML interfaces) I am an everyday VB6 guy and this book didn't insult me with \\"This is a variable\\" type kindergarden stuff. In the intro Foxall says that is the type of book it will be and it turns out it was not lip service. He delivered on his promise. I used this book exclusivly to pass both 70-175 & 70-176 on the same day. Today, btw. I would recomend this book alone for everyday VB folks and and this book with a companion book for entry level people. I learned a great deal from this book. Not only what I needed to pass the tests, but, day to day items that are now demystified. Usefull nuggets fell out of this book in nearly every chapter.I am a tech editor and I read development/concept books literally every day. So I say with authority, If you are not going to take the tests, Buy this book! If you are going to take the tests, Buy this book! You will benifit as well as your organization will benefit."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This book is simply the best preparation guide for MCSD certifications exams. I wonder why there aren't more books of the author out there. I read four other guides for 70-176 and 70-170 from Microsoft and Sybex. The training kit from Microsoft is good, but for beginning developers. The Sybex guides are awful. Believe me if you need to go to basics, get the Microsoft guide and then go to MCSD in a Nutshell to get all answers for the exams."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This book is a good exam prep book. It takes a no-fluff approach to passing the exams. The material in it is concise, and to the point. It tells you what you need to know to get the questions right on the exam. It also has good examples and would make a good programming reference for VB programmers.If you're trying to learn VB, this isn't the book for you. While experienced VB programmers will find very useful information in this book, it is not meant to teach VB from the ground up.The architecture section of the book, like most of the Architecture books, covers a lot about the Microsoft Solutions Framework. This makes sense considering the topic of the exam. However, the exam itself concentrates on case studies and being able to pick system requirements out of them. It also concentrates on good database design. There is very little on the actual MSF on the exam, and hence that section of the book is only partially useful."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This book was worth every cent! I have just recently passed both of the VB MCSD exams with 900+ scores and James Foxall has helped to keep me sane during the process.When studying for the exams you want to be sure that all topics are covered and at an appropriate level. MCSD in a nutshell does better at this than any other book I have seen. (I had access to 4 and only used/needed this &amp; 'Programming VB6' by Balena - the best VB book on the market, but unfortunately not exam focussed)I have good IT experience, however haven't been using VB for a great amount of time. This book made me aware of, &amp; educated me on, all the VB topics needed, with the exception of web classes which Balena covers well.Another bonus is it's size. Being smaller than the useless tomes that are out there, I could take it with me everywhere to ensure a steady stream of learning.If you find this book too much of a slog due to it being too high a level - you're not ready for the exams.Having the exams behind me, I'll be keeping this book on my shelf. (Right next to Balena of course) It's not intended to be a reference book but it will definately have some use as such.Finally, use Trancender!

However, I found it so well written and comprehensive, I decided to start preparing for the 70-176 exam.As far as it being a tool for preparing for that exam, I would would highly recommend it. It spares us from the arrogantly overused techno-jargon that you find in most books. It uses diagrams appropriately to supplement its explanation of concepts and it also includes end-of-chapter quizes and assignments to help you retain its lessons.(Do the assignments! Doing is learning in the IT field.)I have the October 2000 edition and I must say that I was less than impressed with the typographical errors, but at least they are not counter to the point of the lessons. I hear the later edition is better.

I immediately went online, ordered thebook and have been religiously reading it everyday.

The last Visual Basic version I used (seriously) was the fourth. After telling you that, you can imagine that I want to demonstrate to potential employers that I'm a good Visual Basic developer.Oh, what a surprise to find out that the exams wanted me to show expert use in technology I hardly talked about in those days, but I thought &quot;no problem, I just need to get a hold of it, I was good in this, so I can do it&quot;. Well now I can tell you that without this book I would have never acomplished this task, just today I passed the first exam with an 89% score, and I can tell you it was extremely hard. How did this book helped me:- Is the only book I've seen that has a very seriously aproach to the Package and Deployment Wizard (I got 15 questions out of 70 about this topic, that is more than 20% of the exam, and got 77% right).- A chapter for COM, another one for ActiveX code components, another one for ActiveX controls, and another one for ActiveX documents, at least 50% of the exam is about these topics.And if that's not enough, there's quite a lot of information about implementing Help, Internet applications, Testing and Debugging, code optimization, all of this topics are going to be on your exams.If you are seriously thinking of getting certified, don't waste your time and money on books that are going to explain you how to put code in a form or a command button (most &quot;certification trainning books&quot; have this approach), you should already know that, get down to business and tackle the really interesting stuff.If you are not interested in taking the exams, but want to become an expert in Visual Basic, this is the book for you.Good luck on getting that certification!!"},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I found this book very easy to read. The author explains the complex features very clearly. I would recommend re-reading the sections you're not familiar until things make sense to you.

(Many times, it is the author's style that makes or breaks a book). Whenever I need a book on VB in the future, I'll first check if this author has written something on it.

I have read other books and no other book comes close to this one. This is an invaluable reference if you want to pass the MCSD.Also, practice the TRANSCENDER exams. 30-40% of the exam contains questions from the TRANSCENDER exams.Thank you Mr. Foxall.

It covered all the areas covered on the exam and does an excellent job at it. I do have to say this, however, that his or anybody elses book alone will not guarantee a passing grade. You definitely need to supplement any book with Transcender. Transcender helped me uncover the areas I was weak in and Jim's book helped me brush up on those areas. The two together will go a long way towards success. I also have very little real world experience in VB. Most of it was through what I did on my own and what seems like a mountain of exercises. So any of you that have day to day experience in VB and haven't taken any of the exams, then this book + Transcender + your experience --- hey, you've got it made."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I like this book of several reasons: 1. Its size -not too heavy - can even be read in bed. 2. It does not contain a CD, so the author cannot refer to that, but has to make his writing understandable (I have bought a lot of used computer books on Amazon, and not a single one has the seal on the CD broken!) 3. It presents advanced topics in a very understandable way. 4. The code examples are concise and to the point.It is not a beginners book for sure, but perfect for the student that has the basic knowledge of VB and just unorganized ideas about the more advanced concepts."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"This is a very valuable book. It defintely helped me not just prepare, but learn those aspects of VB that you don't use every day, like ActiveX Docs, and the P&amp;D wizard. However, I couldn't bring myself to give it the full 5 stars for this reason. Even though the book was an excellent source of info for the test, I still had to buy another book - even though I have been using VB for several years. I still had to brush up on the basics, which Mr. Foxall does not cover. As a VB programmer, I don't keep everything in my head all the time. MSDN is always readily available to me, so I do not have to memorize certain things that are covered on the test. Regardless, the book did help, and for that I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in studying for the &quot;Designing and Implementing Desktop Solutions with Visual Basic 6.0&quot; (70-176) Exam. I passed on the first try with a 757. This book along with the MSDN Library and Transcender's Exam Simulation were my main sources in preparation. If I had one complaint it would be that some of the items designated as being on the Distributed Exam only are in fact also on Desktop. I found this particularly true in the &quot;Working with Data&quot; section for such issues as cursor locations, cursor types, and recorset locking. Overall this is a good concise presentation of what is on the exams."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I have been reading this book for a couple of hours.What I like about the book is that it covers subtle but very important points in understanding VB coding, like COM, and how it works. Unlike other books that give you bits and pieces of information and huge coding examples, the author painstakingly limits his discussion to get the point across without confusing the reader. The author clearly understands what makes Visual Basic tick. This book is going to be a big factor in passing the exam. Maybe the only computer book that I can't put down.With this said, this book is not for someone new to VB. You must know VB topics such as what event driven programming is and at least basic computer syntax."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"If you had finished the VB Programmer's Guide and understood generally what's going on in Ch.9 and 10, this is a very valuable book for you.

My copy of this book, on the other hand, has been folded back so many times it's grown wings.I passed the 70-176 (1000/1000) &amp; 70-175 (900/1000) using this book as my primary study guide. Having read many VB, Java, C++, etc. books, I have found found very few that combine good readability, in-depth content, and low price. This one does all that. To give you an idea of the depth of the content, my 2nd time through the book I took notes on the key points. I ended up with 250 pages of notes. That's quite a bit of key points packed into a &lt;600 page book.Another couple of nice things about this book (&amp; O'Reilly, in general) are the font and binding. O'Reilly is one of the few IT publishers that realizes that smaller fonts are actually more readable and allow more content on fewer pages. Also, the binding allows you to lay the book open on a page, and it actually stays open - nice when you're working through examples.It's worth noting that you will need to supplement the data access portion with the ADO help file and plenty of practice. That is the only area that I found seriously lacking. The other area that is doesn't cover is Microsoft's data services/business services/user services tiers, but questions related to this on the exams are fairly straightforward.If you're taking the exams, read this book, write plenty of code to cover the tests subjects, and supplement with MSDN &amp; ADO help."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"MCSD in a Nutshell is by far the best book you can get for Visual Basic certification exams. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the topic. The most basic areas are not covered, but it covers a lot of ground. If you are well versed with visual basic, then this book will give you the boost you need to brush up on your skills, prepare you for the obscure topics of the exams, and make you aware of how to use VB in general. Not just for the exams, it's an excellent quick reference tool.It's not riddled with code, but it uses code in adequate amounts to explain the section in question. Its &quot;Key Facts&quot; section summarizes the chapters very well - something that one can scan through before the exams. There are also a proportioned amounts of questions at the end of the chapters for self testing.Considering the low price as compared with other competing books, MCSD is a sureshot winner."},{"Title":"MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic Exams (VBS Exams 70-175 and 70-176)","review":"I just passed my second VB exam based on the strength of this book and my previous experience. I strongly recommend this book to any VB programmer studying for the two VB exams. It will ground you in all of the areas the exams test you on.That said, I would have given this book 5 stars, but the occasional typo was problematic in the sample tests. I have a first printing so hopefully O'Reilly will continue to correct all the mistakes found. Remember to check the O'Reilly website for the latest errata (I wish more book publishers would be this honest)."},{"Title":"Breach of Faith: Fall of Richard Nixon","review":"The facts behind Watergate, the only scandal ever to take down a sitting president, have become so conflated with Hollywood myth, political posturing of the right and left, and the trivia over Deep Throat as to obscure just what Richard Nixon did to deserve losing his office less than two years after his landslide reelection.Fortunately, Theodore H. White was on the scene to give his on-the-spot analysis. 1975's \\"Breach of Faith\\" begins strongly with the last days of the Nixon administration when a shell-shocked staff led by Alexander Haig sort out the best way of getting their boss to leave office for the good of the country while fending off former aides under indictment seeking pardons. People who talked about Watergate showing American democracy at its finest, White makes clear, missed the emotional carnage at the scandal's center.\\"The true crime of Richard Nixon was simple: he destroyed the myth that binds America together, and for this he was driven from power,\\" White writes.Yes, people working for Nixon's subordinates did bug the office of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Hotel, getting caught the second time. Nixon didn't approve that, but he did approve other surveillance activities, and tried to use the CIA to pull the FBI off their Watergate investigation when the water started to boil. He listened agreeably to talk of using IRS audits for political payback.There's one episode where Nixon pigeonholes an assistant attorney general, Henry Petersen, with a suggestion that they not give immunity to the man who would eventually use that immunity to blow Watergate wide open, John Dean. The tapes Nixon had recording everything capture Petersen bravely telling Nixon he will not let anyone, even the president, interfere with his agency's prerogative on who gets and doesn't get immunity in their investigation.Anyone who dismisses Watergate as a victory of partisan politics clearly needs to read the narrative of that conversation included here, really one of the unfairly forgotten events of this convoluted case. At the same time, getting back to White's point about the \\"true crime\\" of Watergate, Nixon was more culpable of setting a criminal tone for his office than of any concrete crimes. The hiring of subordinates like Bob Haldeman, his imperious chief of staff, was more responsible for and deserving of Nixon's fate than penny-ante stunts like bugging Daniel Ellsberg's shrink.White quotes an aide: \\"Nixon was by nature an excluder. Haldeman liked to exclude people. When Nixon's need met Haldeman's abilities, you had an almost perfect recipe for disaster.\\"White doesn't get everything right. Some of his Nixon psychoanalysis is simple and reductive, especially as White backtracks across Nixon's career and loses some of the journalistic narrative that anchors the book's strong beginning. He misses a big part of the story by skimming over Sam Ervin's Senate hearings, when many of the bombshells were made public. There's also White's grandiloquence: When he wants to tell us how House investigation chair Peter Rodino talks, he notes his use of \\"dental\\" rather than \\"fricative\\" speech patterns, instead of saying he says \\"dey\\" instead of \\"they.\\"But White proves himself, here as with each of the four \\"Making Of The President\\" books he published from 1960 to 1972, a fair and sympathetic chronicler to politicians of all stripes, including Nixon and his most vociferous supporters. As a final chapter in the political career of the one man to feature prominently in each of those four books, \\"Breach Of Faith\\" makes for a fitting, bracing conclusion to White's take on how politics in the latter half of the 20th century shaped the American dream, and a worthwhile place for Watergate newbies to start their education. Whatever its minor faults, \\"Breach Of Faith\\" really deserves another printing; the lessons of Watergate deserve to be remembered with the seriousness and care of White's singular pen."},{"Title":"Breach of Faith: Fall of Richard Nixon","review":"THis book offers a very solid perspective on one of the more remarkable politicos of our time and why he fell. While White tended to get a bit sentimental about America in his later years, this book is hard-nosed and very interesting and well written.Essentially, WHite argues that it was not what Nixon did that did him in as much as lying about it. I don't think that that quite covers it, but it puts a lot into perspective. He treats Nixon fairly.One of White's better books."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"The Turkeybird Speaks (My son's opinion, age 3): \\"Now this is the part where I tell you to pull up a chair and your favorite snack so you can settle into a great book. Does it really get any better than trucks, planes, and trains? I would say not! They move, they have wheels, they go fast and they do all sorts of fun things. I especially liked reading my plane book when we traveled cross country to our new home. It was neat to look out the window and see the same sky that I was looking at in my book. These books are a must have for every home. Go get them!\\"Mom's Two Cents: \\"I have to agree with The Turkeybird and the publishers summary. We initially purchased the Trucks book when he was very little and it instantly became a favorite. Now that he is quite a bit older (at least two years have passed) he still picks them out of our full bookshelf. As he mentioned, we traveled by plane this last summer to move from the DC area to California and the Planes book was a huge hit! There are images of people getting on and off planes in the book and because of the small airport we initially left from, we were able to get aboard the plane just as they did in the book, which he loved! And though you would think these books wouldn't appeal to girls, even The Littlebug picked the Plane book out yesterday as her book of choice.\\"Now, onto the technical side of the book. What I, as a parent, really like about these books are the simple text and straight forward images. It's not going to be the most beautiful book on your shelf, nor will the words be drawn out and elaborate, but it still holds an entertainment and educational value I can't deny. Each page has between 3 to 5 words with a simple illustration demonstrating the text. For smaller kids it can often times be overwhelming to have a book filled with words and dramatic images, but these books though not elegant are still captivating. I highly recommend these books for beginning readers and even for older children who may need a respite between larger, more complicated books.\\""},{"Title":"Trains","review":"A staple board book for a 2 yr old!

And he asked for it to be read to him several times together over the weekend. When we finished, each time he'd say \\"That's a good story.\\" Though \\"Trains\\" was his far and away favorite, he also liked the other two Byron Barton I bought with it, \\"Machines at Work\\" and \\"Trucks.\\" He'd \\"read\\" them to me. They are perfect books for the boy who loves things on wheels. I'm looking at his \\"Dinosaurs\\" book for Christmas."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"We've already bought this one twice. The first one the kids. The first copy the kids managed to destroy from so much reading and, um, 'playing'. The book is very simple (as befits a toddler board book.) The pictures are also fairly basic, with just enough detail to excite toddlers as they find a \\"doggie\\" or banana. As a parent, I don't mind reading it for the 200th time (even if it is not super exciting or witty.)"},{"Title":"Trains","review":"One of our son's favorite first books!! Also have Trucks, Planes, and Boats. Trucks and Trains most favorite with Boats least favorite."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My son loved this book from the time he was about 15 months old. The words and the illustrations are simple and catchy. I'm not sure if this one comes in paperback but I highly suggest getting all of the Barton books in the board book style. They are sure to be read over and over!!"},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My kids love this very cute little book.. They want me to read it to them over and over again. A great book for your little one. Must have!!"},{"Title":"Trains","review":"This our favotite train book. Love this book for a 1, 2, or even 3 yo. Both my boys love(d) it. We just bought it as a gift."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"This book is great - (...)when I read it aloud, it's kind of fun for adults to read, too. Out of all the books we have, I'd say this book is one of the top 2 my son wants to have read over and over. When we're not reading it, he flips through it on his own and looks at the clearly drawn, colorful, interesting pictures, which have just enough detail without being too complicated. The depictions of different kinds of trains are fairly accurate, too. And the book is a good length - not just a few pages, like some board books, but not so long he loses interest."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"This book is great for all children. The illustrations are simple enough for babies, yet there are enough details to interest older children. The story is about different trains, where they travel, and the people who work and ride on them. My one year old loves to look through this book on her own. When I read it to her, her favorite part of the story is, &quot;Here is the conductor calling... all aboard!&quot;. It gets a smile every time!"},{"Title":"Trains","review":"Byron Barton's Trains has become an unlikely favorite for our 2-year old. I say unlikely because it's so different from what most of his favorites (which are heavy on Sandra Boynton, Jez Alborogh, and the Spot series) are like. The art is extremely simple, using lots of bold colors, and the story doesn't rhyme or feature any noticeable repetition. It's not really even a story at all, but rather a descriptive sentence on each page highlighting the kind of train or activity shown.I don't know whether it's the bold colors or just the subject matter (my son is absolutely fascinated by all kinds of vehicles), but this little board book went straight into his bedtime \\"top 5\\" and shows no sign of leaving! I may not get it, but I'm confident enough after seeing my son's reaction to this book to recommend Trains to the parents of any toddler interested in trains."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"When I first read through this book, I thought it was a loser (we received it as a gift). The text was so bland that I did not think I could stand to read it again and again to my son (now 27 months). But, he loves it. He shrieks with joy at the train coming around the mountain, he loves to call \\"all aboard!\\", he loves the intersection with the street. And now I love it, too, because it gives him so much joy and has taught him so much about trains. I have just placed an order for several other Byron Barton books and I can't wait for them to come."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My son got this book when he was 18 months old and he LOVES it! It is simple enough to keep his attention and not bore him with too many words. The pictures are perfect. I would ask questions about what he saw in the picture and he would point things out. We counted how many houses, how many trees, how many train cars. We noticed that all the people at the train station were wearing hats, and on the train they were not. I know this book by heart now and I'm not sick of it. My son is now 2 and 1/2 and he still wants to read this book."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"I gave this book to my 3 year old son shortly before he and my husband were taking a train trip. I thought he would enjoy it since he loves trains so much, but I didn't realize that he would become completely attached to it! He hasn't let this book out of his sight and wants us to read it to him all the time. Since he has memorized the words, he even reads it to himself. Great book for a pre-schooler who is fascinated with trains or for a child who will be taking a trip on a train!"},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My toddler isn't as into this train book as his is some of his others, but I don't know why. It introduces bunches of different kinds of trains. The pictures are bright and clear and the text is simple. I think it is a great toddler book."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My son has been obsessed with trains since he could talk; this book is perfect for him. It's very simple, so it's best for very young readers; it gets boring very quickly for adults. Highly recommended for kids 2 or 3 years old, particularly if they love trains."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"This is one of the most requested books at our house by our 2-year old. His brother, who is almost 4, still enjoys reading it. Simple, yet full of interest, with plenty of places to be creative in exploring the story beyond the words. For example, there is a town the train passes through with a dog in the scene. Two points to the houses and says house. Four asks, which house does the dog live in? Just about every page is like that."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"Our two year old grandson loves trains, and since I want him to love books, this selection pleases both of us when he comes to visit. He asks for this book and tells me a story about the trains. The colorful and simple drawings leave room for imagination."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"My son is a train fanatic. We bought this book for him when he was a year old. He wanted it read to him constantly and before too long, we all knew it by heart! The book has fallen apart after 4 years of constant reading, carrying and as a bedtime companion. We would recommend Trains to anyone who has a child interested in these huge machines! We are going to get another copy of the book for our youngest son."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"Trains, though just a children's board book, captures the excitement and magic of traveling by train. It goes through a typical day on a train, each beautifully illustrated in a bold style that young children will enjoy."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"I obviously did not pay attention to the dimensions because the book is 5 inches. Next time I need to read the fine print."},{"Title":"Trains","review":"This story was kind of boring, not as melodic as some of the other books (Cars is our favorite) but kind of cute. Graphics are somewhat boring too (compared to the others)"},{"Title":"Agee on film","review":"The lion's share of 'Agee on Film, vol. I', is devoted to James Agee's work as a columnist for 'The Nation', where he wrote about film from 1942 to 1948. It isn't exactly clear if this volume contains every column he wrote for that magazine - nowhere is it mentioned one way or the other, and there are gaps in the dates attributed to the entries. That may be only because he didn't contribute to every issue, but it would be nice to know if this is all the material from this source - an author who rates theLibrary of America treatmentrates a complete collection. Other sections of this volume include a few of Agee's weekly film reviews for 'Time Magazine' from 1941 to 1948, some miscellaneous articles for 'Partisan Review' and 'Sight and Sound', and two 'Life Magazine' features - 'Comedy's Greatest Era' and 'Undirectable Director'. The first of these features deals with the comedians of silent film - Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, and Lloyd; the second concerns John Huston.Those are the nuts and bolts of the collection, so to speak, which doesn't address what value there might be in a book of mid-century film criticism, especially one concerning pictures which are either forgotten, or only appreciated anymore by niche viewers. In the world of DVD though, many of these films are probably more accessible now than when Agee was writing his column. From that perspective, there is undoubtedly some intrinsic value to these reviews for those interested in this era's film - not only is there the novelty of reading a contemporary opinion, but there may be films that Agee discusses that modern critics and reviewers gloss over due to the overwhelming amount of material to cover.But the book wasn't created to function as a film guide, even if it could be used that way. It is film criticism, though today it seems to be a peculiar brand of it. I am too used to criticism that is concerned with explaining what it is I should be getting out of the film - Agee, instead, is like a well-informed friend who has accompanied you to the theater and commiserates with you over the failure of the picture to meet its potential. That he can by turns commiserate with droll wit or short, acidic remarks makes him immensely entertaining as he does, though it's probably best read in small doses lest the pungency wears off.A few examples:On 'Carnegie Hall': 'the sickest and sourest mess of musical mulligatawny I have yet had to sit down to, a sort of aural compromise between the Johnstown flood and the Black Hole of Calcutta.'On 'Tycoon': 'Several tons of dynamite are set off during this movie; none of it under the right people.'On 'The Egg and I': 'Marjorie Main, in an occasional fit of fine, wild comedy, picks the show up and brandishes it as if she were wringing its neck. I wish to God she had.'At this point, the unfortunate impression I've probably left you with is that Mr. Agee was in the business simply to toss out snarky remarks and sniff at everything put before him - that impression would seriously shortchange his contributions. He did have high standards, yes - but he also loved the entertainment value in film too. There are far more examples where he admonishes a film in one breath but lifts it up in the next. In fact, from these articles, one of Mr. Agee's most apparent attributes is his even-handedness when evaluating a film.But digging somewhat deeper, past the book's purported subject, it's obvious that Mr. Agee looked at the world with an honest eye too. Since the medium of film is a reflection of the society around it, Mr. Agee often wasn't only critiquing the film, but the audience that it was directed at as well. Considering the time that these columns appeared, it should be plain that he was writing during a period of extreme emotion and action - then, as now, various forces were dedicated toward advancing certain viewpoints, viewpoints that may have seemed emotionally justified, yet morally compromised. Mr. Agee stood up to these popular cheerleading efforts, basically remarking that there is still some swill we should not swallow.In two fantastic examples he comments on the manipulation efforts of certain films to whip up a frenzy of emotion - in these particular cases they concern the defeated nations of WWII, but I could not help thinking of our last decade as in some ways they seem startlingly similar. In one, a Russian film titled 'The Rainbow', which chronicled atrocities in the Ukraine and subsequent calls for vengeance, Agee voices his concern not about the desire for revenge, but the advisability of putting it on film. 'I wonder,' he says, 'whether certain dreadful events, of the sort this picture is full of, are not so incalculably rich in the possibilities of moral and aesthetic blackmail that they can never be represented maturely or even undeceitfully, and so had better not be represented at all...Indeed, few films ever made have so vigorously seized the spectator by the throat and so implacably insisted, with one unprincipled bang over the head after another, that he turn himself into the wildest animal possible, and mistrust and hate with all his might any lingering question which troubles him about his obligations to do so.'The other instance does not involve a particular film, but instead the footage coming out of liberated Europe in the final stages of the war, when the true extent of the horror was appearing before the American public for the first time. The footage as presented, he believed, was another call for vengeance, and Mr. Agee's response is a brilliant piece that few will ever read, or reading, appreciate.'The passion for vengeance is a terrifyingly strong one, very easily and probably inevitably wrought up by such evidence (of atrocity), even at our distance. But however well aware I am of its strength, and that in its full immediate force and expression it is in some respects irrelevant to moral inquiry, I doubt that it is ever to be honored, or regarded as other than evil and in every direction fatally degrading and destructive; even when it is obeyed in hot blood or in a crisis of prevention; far worse when it is obeyed in cold blood and in the illusion of carrying out justice.'At the risk of making a too long review even longer, I'll simply add that it isn't necessary that one agree with his sentiments in all cases, it's the fact that I so rarely get an opportunity to read discourse like his that when I do find it I want to bang people over the head with it, with one unprincipled bang after another. Do I recommend it? Yes, very much so, provided one remember that this is still primarily a book about an entertainment medium, and despite several electric passages like the ones I've quoted, the overwhelming majority of the entries in the book reflect a lighter disposition, one more suited to musicals and westerns and comedy films.According to its front matter, theModern Libraryedition of 'Agee on Film' reprints the same material found in this older version, with the exception of introductions by Martin Scorsese and David Denby. While Denby's comments are worthwhile, were I in need of this volume, I would probably look tothis Library of America version, which also includes Agee's script for 'Night of the Hunter', uncollected film writing, and journalism pieces."},{"Title":"Country Roads of Kentucky","review":"My wife and I got this cookbook as a gift about ten years ago, and it has become a holiday staple. The book automatically falls open to certain pages, such as the Hungarian gulasch, the Viennese tenderloin, and a new favorite that we made yesterday, the Raspberry torte. The recipes in the book have simple names, but they do not taste like run-of-the-mill food. We get compliments every time we serve them."},{"Title":"Country Roads of Kentucky","review":"My husband and I stayed at the Inn in 1993.

This book is OK, but I don't use it often, since the majority of the recipes are for sides, soups, or desserts--none of which I generally prepare from a recipe. Also, lots of the recipes are more time-consuming than I can manage on a regular basis. And, though this book does tell you what to do with your armload of kale, it doesn't even mention most of the AMAZING plethora of \\"ethnic\\" ingredients that you can get around here, many of them also locally grown or caught, nor does it have many recipes beyond the European/yuppie wholesome farmers' market palette.What I do like about the book is that it is divided into seasons, and then organized by key ingredient. For each ingredient, there are tips for selecting and storing. Nice photos throughout. I would just like more actual recipes, especially for main dishes.Bottom line: you might find a few gems in here, but you have to make a point of using this book and making the time for it if you want to get much mileage from it. As for taking advantage of local produce, I've found that the America's Test Kitchen books and magazines, plus a few great cookbooks (Louise Pickford's \\"Fast & Fresh,\\" a healthy Indian cookbook, etc.) get me into the farmer's market or produce aisle a lot more often than this one does."},{"Title":"The San Francisco Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market Cookbook: A Comprehensive Guide to Impeccable Produce Plus 130 Seasonal Recipes","review":"This is a great reference for storing and preparing and the treasures that can be purchased from the farmers Markets."},{"Title":"The San Francisco Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market Cookbook: A Comprehensive Guide to Impeccable Produce Plus 130 Seasonal Recipes","review":"I love going to the Farmers Market in SF on Saturdays.

However, Vitale's &quot;instant writing method,&quot; described in Turbocharge Your Writing, isn't really insightful or new. This book tells you what to do to get started on your writing project. If you already know that you need to organize your thoughts pre-writing, and that you need to write and re-write, and that you need to step away from, and then return to your work with a fresh view, then you don't need this.

The adventures of Sancho and Don Quixote were very well written, funny, and has captured the hearts of millions throughout the centuries. Don Quixote is a madman who believes himself to be a knight-errant destined to return the world to the prior \\"order\\". Immediately he gets dressed up in a very silly fashion and starts by attacking \\"giants\\", only they are windmills. The first part involves Don and his squire Sancho Panza in a series of silly conflicts that they get into, at the same time doing many great things. The first part was much better than the second part in my opinion as Quixote lost some of his humour and became somewhat more \\"normal\\" Sancho was a great clown and the book truly deserves to be named 'Don Quixote and Sancho Panza\\" Also, Quixote's folly was a little bit irritating for me at times. Especially when he kept mentioning stupid such as his \\"Lady Dulcinea el Toboso,\\" who is truly a whore, and talking about enchantments which were simply the consequences of the stupid things that Don Quixote and his squire did upon themselves.Of course, this book was more than simply a satire attacking the ancient tradition of knight-errants. Quixote said many things which made sense at the time, through what he said, we can see a glimpse of the life in the early 1600's and a little bit of Cervante's own experiences as a soldier. Many times did Don Quixote mention his badge, in which Cervantes truly valued for fighting the English armanda.In conclusion, if you want to read about two clowns perform that were being put down on the pages of a 528 page book that is funny and very well-written, this would be a great book for you."},{"Title":"Don Quixote (Signet Classics)","review":"We were home schooling our middle schooler and used this as one of the reading books for writing and reviewing assignments.

This book provided a rich and textured view of computing history, with lots of details. Having lived through much of it (I used a slide rule in college & I worked at Xerox during those STAR days, later Tandem), reading it from a historical point of view was wonderful and fun; source for much memory dredging and discussions with my husband (an engineer too).

No, it doesn't fully cover software and doesn't cover every computer made everywhere in the world, so it shouldn't be the only computer book you read. This book is simply the best, single volume history of the development of the electronic computer (hardware), from the 1940s to modern times. The biggest gap, as a previous reviewer pointed out, is the omission of Shockley.Many obscure systems which were redundant or evolutionary dead-ends aren't covered as fully as they could have been, but he details most of the ones that had a major impact on the world. I would recommend a history of software, as well as a history of computer precursers (such as Babbage's machine) to accompany this history. Those reviewers who didn't like the book had unrealistic expectations--it has a very specific focus.The book is mildly technical, but you certainly don't have to be a computer expert to understand it. (For those who want to know more about the software industry the book \\"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry\\" by Martin Campbell-Kelly is one of many good books on the subject. \\"Early British Computers\\" by Simon Lavington covers British developments in computer hardware.)"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"I think that the book would have earned a lot if it had illustrations.

In a way it documents the success of a bygone era: Computation has been commoditized for content consumption - the next generation will not have the concept exposure for DIY garage-style engineering.All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"I'm a Brazilian and my english is not perfect, sorry. Anyway the book is like the description sad \\"Like new\\". I was from a Library so it have some techinical stikers outsite but this don't mess with the reading. It is much better than i expected."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Here in America we say that books are Eurocentric. We have no name for a phenomenon that is useful to our cultural life, and &quot;American-centric&quot; is therefore my term of art for books that narrate culture and technology as if no interesting developments happen beyond our shores. The consequences of this ignorance, as we have seen, can be deadly, for one of the reasons for non-Western extremism is our instinct to treat non-Western participation in our culture and technology with disdain.Thus, as Ceruzzi fails to narrate, Algol is really the only common ancestor of usable programming languages, yet Ceruzzi dismisses Algol because it was not a commercial success. Algol was not a commercial success because IBM failed to support it in the decade from 1954 to 1964, and then attempted to usurp it with vaporware PL/I, for which IBM's programmers failed to develop an adequate compiler until the mid-1970s. Nonetheless, the block structure of Algol was found to be the only rational way of thinking about program structure as opposed to Fortran.But Ceruzzi not only naturalizes American technical praxis along the dimensions of geography, he also naturalizes it along a temporal axis in which the mainframe era was a failed try at modern praxis.Thus the &quot;colorful&quot; Herb Grosch does get his picture in Ceruzzi's book...and with his goatee poor Herb looks slightly fraudulent.Grosch's law was so obviously self-serving from the standpoint of Herb's employer IBM; it was that the larger the computer, the power delivered increases exponentially. Herb left IBM in the late 1960s, and the history of how men like Herb were compromised (by the occlusion of their feelings and thoughts with corporate goals) is unwritten.Herb's law was falsified by the discovery in the late 1960s that large computers (such as MIT's Multics) required such complex software that their promise could not be delivered, and today's law is Moore's law, which declares that microchip power will instead exponentially increase as the micros get smaller.Common to both &quot;laws&quot; is the naturalizing error of neoclassical economics, which acts as if history does not exist. While it does appear today that Moore's law is still true as chip designs deliver what is miscalled computer &quot;power&quot; (the &quot;power&quot; to deliver wrong answers at high speed should be deconstructed) and is actually mere clock speed at an exponentially increasing rate, an historical perspective should remind us that this too, shall pass.Making smaller chips is a labor process which has damaged the water-table of places like Silicon Valley and which represents the personal choices of venture capitalists to fund, entrepreneurs to entrep, and employees to choose to work in moon suits that are damned itchy at the end of the day.Moore's law, like so many &quot;laws&quot; of neoclassical economics, declares that in 1971 we stumbled upon a fact of nature, like Parson Malthus observing the lads cavorting with milkmaids. It is secretly normative (like so many laws of the dismal science) in that it commands us to conform to this fact of nature as a ticket to adulthood.Perhaps &quot;computers are takin' over.&quot; But a critical history of technology, which to me is the only study worthy of the name of history, would read against the grain. It would narrate world praxis in hardware and in software as did a 1999 IEEE Transactions (in the History of Computers) which showed how the Swedes got by in the 1960s without IBM mainframes. It would narrate victim history, including the very interesting history of computer programmers who, it seems, have been an invisible class because they represent, all the way down, a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative of an autonomous technology to which we have to conform (for example, the biography of computer pioneer Ted Nelson is more interesting than that of John von Neumann.)A very useful result of such a history would be applied, retro computing, for while mainstream historians like Ceruzzi are laying the past to rest, libraries, universities and other institutions are losing data through losing the software that formats and reads older data files. The XML (eXtended Markup Language) notation tries to address this problem as did Ted Nelson's Xanadu system but technical innovations, useful as they are, by definition do not address existing Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets (or the moldering Algol compiler I discovered at Princeton.)I look to a book and software system on CD-ROM that would preserve, not the physical realization of outdated systems like the IBM 7090 or TRS-80, but their important features, which was the &quot;architecture&quot; they presented to their actual programmers. While building a retro computer encyclopaedia would be a formidable task, it would be made easier by describing the architectural interface of the computer in a form that a modern system can &quot;compile&quot; to a program that simulates the old computer, thereby presenting the user of the encyclopaedia with actual running examples of old software.To modern-day crowds, trooping through the Smithsonian, computers are physical objects. But actual programmers know that computers are ideas in the mind, and a retro encyclopaedia would be a fascinating narrative of how Turing's idea created the postmodern era. It would also make clear that the old fraud, Marx, was right, for the value computers has created for society consists in a deep labor of understanding architectures enough to craft problem instructions, including the most despised yet most valuable instruction: &quot;computer, here is a language in which I shall speak, and here is how you shall translate that language.&quot;This is a grand yet critical narrative, for it shows that Leibniz was wrong. Let us not calculate (sir) let us communicate. I probably expect too much of poor Mr Ceruzzi, who appears to be of the tribe of people with which I made acquaintance at Princeton; the humanists who honestly apply their narrative skills to technology. But it appears that in America, no-one has answered Derrida's 1978 call for a critical reading of technology."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Very informative and exciting.Ceruzzi made it simple for all to understand how computers came about from 1940s untill today."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Any history of modern computing that starts with ENIAC is flawed. The first working, fully programmable general purpose computer was Konrad Zuse's Z3 (Germany, 1941). ENIAC (inspired by Atanasoff's earlier, less general designs) was fully programmable too, but came much later (in 1946). Z3's switches were based on relays instead of tubes like in ENIAC. This is no fundamental difference. There are many ways of implementing a switch. Today we use transistors, of course."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"I looked up the people I knew and knew of. None of them were in.

I wonder if they even read the book, considering it mentions the Z3 as well as many other early computers and calculating devices.This book is a fast-paced can't-put-it-down read -- assuming of course that you're interested in the history of computing from about the 40's through the early 90's.Very well organized. Very well written. Very well researched. Doesn't get too caught up in who made millions and when, nor does it get caught up in the various academic and business computer debates that have come and gone over the years. A perfect balance of noting the history without taking sides.Overall an excellent read. I'd give it six stars out of five if I could."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"This book is a history of computing technology since 1945. Ceruzzi focuses mostly on hardware, giving very detailed descriptions of how the great mainframes were built and by whom. He also discusses how transistors and microchips were developed and came into use in computers, although his descriptions of the development of computer languages, operating systems, or other software are much briefer than those he provides for hardware. The book has a number of illustrations of people and the machines they made famous. The author seems very careful to give an accurate account of events and the book is very well footnoted. It also includes an excellent index and bibliography. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the technical aspects of the history of computers."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"This book makes a nice thorough reference of the history of computing post 1945, and is great for use on a course. However it is a little dry and unanalytical. Buy Howard Rheingold's &quot;Tools for thought&quot; if you want a generally more human, enjoyable read which provides almost as good a technical account."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Paul E. Ceruzzi, curator of the National Air and Space Museum, describes the development of computing, starting with its earliest history. He examines the beginnings of commercial computing from 1945 to 1956 and traces the history of computer hardware and software, dividing these developments into five- to 10-year time periods. His book emphasizes technical development, rather than personalities or business dynamics, a focus that contributes to its fairly dry, academic style. With this caveat, we [...] recommend the book primarily to those with a technological bent, such as professionals in operations and computer sciences, and academics in the field. However, if you are interested in the subject, you'll love this. Ceruzzi provides an informative and comprehensive saga including extensive footnotes and a bibliography that runs about 80 pages."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Ceruzzi defines the modern computing era as post World War 2. His narrative shows a twist perhaps unappreciated by current readers. Nowadays, all computers use semiconductor chips. Mostly made of silicon. But the use of such chips did not become widespread till the 1960s. For the first 20 years, computers used tubes. (Yuk.)He explains why tubes were eventually abandoned, as being too bulky and slow compared to silicon based integrated circuits. There are several crucial landmarks scattered throughout the text. Like the invention of the integrated circuit by Kilby and Noyce, and that of the microprocessor by Hoff and Faggin. Curiously, the invention of the transistor in 1947-8 goes unremarked. With no mention at all of one of its inventors, Shockley. A grievous oversight, since he started a group, with members like Noyce and Moore, that would later prove crucial in developing the industry."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Though (as in everything) there are lacunae, Ceruzzi has put together a singularly good book which should be a must for anyone interested in the history of computing. While the author does not seem to be interested in software nor in operating systems, his recounting of the machine developments is excellent."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"I can't believe a book titled \\"A History of Modern Computing\\" does not mention the impact home computers such as the Sinclair, the various Ataris, the VIC-20, the C64 and others had in making computing accessible for the masses, or the impact that cheap home computers had in shaping a whole generation of programmers and engineers. The book totally ignores the revolutionary Amiga, LOGO language, and videogames which have been instrumental in driving technical improvements and driving computer market penetration. In short, this \\"history of modern computing\\" ignores some of the most important aspects of the computer revolution of the 80's and 90's which could have been well covered in a chapter or two."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"Very well researched (the bibliography alone is worth the price of the book) history of computing from ENIAC to the day Netscape's stock went public. Focuses less on personalities and more on technological development and the social forces at work driving it. Ceruzzi also dispels a number of tired myths and cliches. He also rightfully places Ken Olsen of DEC as the true father and hero of modern networked personal computing."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)","review":"This review is of the 1st edition, published in 1998.Ceruzzi's A History of Modern Computing is an academic book, not a popularization of the history of computers. It is not a chatty book. There are no personalities in it. There is no journalistic reporting of conversations, nor of the progression of various difficulties and triumphs during the design and development of the computer systems discussed.This is not a comprehensive history of computers. ENIAC is mentioned, but this book begins its history, post-WWII, with UNIVAC. The focus is upon US developments. It was not written to inform computer scientists and engineers of detailed design elements of past computer systems, although design elements of both hardware and software are discussed. It is the story of the rise and fall of the mainframe and the rise of the personal desktop computer; but it does not provide a history of Apple or Microsoft or of the development of the Internet.It is more satisfying as a history than the the 1st edition of the bookComputer: A History Of The Information Machineby Martin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray (which I read after reading this book), because there is more detail. It complements their book very well and would be a good choice to read if you read that and wish for more. But this is still within the realm of what I consider first looks.Contents -Introduction: Defining \\"Computer\\"1. The Advent of Commercial Computing, 1945-19562. Computing Comes of Age, 1956-19643.

As near as I can tell, there is no original research (e.g., interviews with actual participants in the events). This has led to a book that's off the mark in some ways:* Ceruzzi accepts uncritically the statements of other authors.* He also arrives at some odd conclusions - for example, his notion that the success of the Windows operating system is somehow due to the use of hungarian notation.* He fails to give credit to the right people. He claims for example that DEC's TOPS-10 operating system was the result of work done by MIT. In fact, some of the key features of that OS were developed by students at Stevens Tech in New Jersey. Those students then went on to join the engineering staff at DEC.So, for anyone with real background in computers - and especially for anyone who lived through the period Ceruzzi is describing - this book is a little bit like reading something written by an anthropologist from another planet. It's just \\"off\\".On the positive side, the bibliography and reference notes in this book will give you an excellent starting point for your own research."},{"Title":"The Chronology of the West river Rail Road","review":"There are two books on the West River Railroad. The other has a better narration of the story, but this is more exhaustive (it's a very fat book), and perhaps gives a better flavor of being there as it is sourced from contemporary accounts. The pictures are good and well reproduced. Some have been published before, but not all."},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"One of the first romances I ever read was a Debbie Macomber book so I credit her with my current love for the genre. With RETURN TO PROMISE I am reminded just why I enjoy her books so much. She's able to weave a story so seamlessly and make it so heartwarming.Jane, a physician, and Cal, a rancher, have been married several years and have two young children when Jane's father breaks his hip and Jane returns to her California hometown for a few weeks, children in tow. When she is in California, she realizes it is no longer her home and yearns for her new hometown of Promise, Texas.Meanwhile, Cal is lost without Jane. Although he was a bachelor for many years, he has come to rely on Jane so much and finds himself feeling lonely. When complications require Jane remain in California, he finds himself a bit resentful.Nicole Nelson has just returned to Promise with one thing on her mind - to seduce Cal. She doesn't care that he's married - it just makes the game more challenging. When she hears Jane is out of town, she figures she has more of a chance to succeed in her malicious endeavor. Nicole's actions seem rather innocent at first - but it soon becomes evident that she has an ulterior motive in mind. Will Cal and Jane's marriage survive this invasion?We also meet many of the people of Promise, but readers who haven't read the other Promise books won't feel left out. What a skill it is to write a sequel like this and make it stand alone!RETURN TO PROMISE reminds me of Jan Karon's \\"Mitford\\" series - a heartwarming story, set in a small town, with many endearing secondary characters.After reading RETURN TO PROMISE, readers will be anxious to read the stories featuring the other residents -- Lonesome Cowboy, Texas Two-Step, Caroline's Child, Dr. Texas, Nell's Cowboy, and Lone Star Baby.There is rarely a better reading experience than a Debbie Macomber book!"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"A fan of the Heart of Texas series, I had to read this book. And needless to say I wasn't disappointed. Once again the characters are real and their situations are real. Debbie Macomber did an excellent job of conveying the emotions of both Jane and Cal. She wrote of both their feelings--Jane's wanting to be reassured and Cal's &quot;she already knows, I don't need to tell her&quot; attitude. Even Nicole in her quest for Cal seemed real. I loved the confrontation between her and Jane at the book store. Go Jane!!!! I love these people in Promise, Texas and Debbie Macomber for creating such wonderful people to read about. This is real life with a happy ending!!!!P.S. When's the next Promise, Texas book???????? I'm ready for it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"I've read the other Promise stories and, granted, this one isn't typical. But I found it very real. The difficulties in Cal and Jane's marriage are definitely believable; they stem from small frustrations and careless moments, as marital problems so often do in life, and are exacerbated by the death of Jane's father. Jane's grief, too, is very believable. And Nicole, the woman who tries to break up Cal's marriage, might be a bit cliched but let's face it--cliches have a grounding in truth. Overall I liked the story a lot and I found the emotions genuine. I thought the resolution worked because you can believe in these characters and in the love they have for each other, despite the fact that daily life has gotten in the way of their expressing that love. Macomber's fictional Texas town is less idealized in this story but in the end returning to Promise is a satisfying experience."},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"and this book has me eager to read other Debbie Macomber books. When I started reading the book, I was expecting a typical ending to the book, and was surprised when it didn't happen at all. Cal and Jane are very &quot;real&quot; characters that you can picture in your mind as you read this book, and that is something I always like.Well done Debbie Macomber. You've got a new reader in me!!"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"Cal Patterson knew his wife would be furious when she learned that he entered the bull riding event without telling her. Eight seconds of thrilling accomplishment doesn't keep trouble at bay when Jane threatens to leave the arena with their three-year-old son and eighteen-month-old daughter. Such incidents leave Jane feeling that her husband has been less than honest with her. An attractive young woman reintroduces herself to Cal following his ride. Little does he suspect the threat she poses to his marriage or the damage she will purposefully cause to his reputation around town.As trouble begins to escalate between Cal and Jane, she finds herself called away to California to offer support to her mother while her father's hospitalized. Miscommunication and wounded feelings leave both Cal and Jane feeling bereft and frustrated. As frustrations continue to increase, their marriage's strength continues to be undermined.New York Times best-selling author Debbie Macomber returns readers to Promise, Texas. I haven't read the previous books in Debbie Macomber's Promise series, and found that RETURN TO PROMISE reads well as a stand-alone. With heart-warming characters and realistic challenges to this five-year marriage, RETURN TO PROMISE approaches romance with a mature outlook and a practical understanding. Recommended."},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"I have read all the &quot;Promise&quot; books and was quite anxious to read &quot;Return To Promise&quot;. I was disappointed! It was only about Jane and Cal's marital problems. There are so many delightful characters living in Promise Tx - I would have loved to read about some of the other inhabitants! I hope Ms. MacOmber will 'return' to Promise with more books about the other folks!"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"The schism in their marriage started when Cal Peterson hid from his wife Jane that he signed up to participate in the Promise, Texas Labor Day Rodeo bull-riding event. The next incident begins when Jane's mother calls to inform them that her father is ill. Jane, accompanied by her three-year-old son and eighteen-month-old daughter, travels to her California home while Cal stays behind.Meanwhile, Nicole Nelson, best friend to the woman who jilted Cal years ago, has returned to town. Nicole makes a bold bid to catch Cal's interests, having romanticized her image of him over the years. However, her machinations lead to a separation between Cal and Jane as each misinterprets the situation to fit their thoughts. Jane thinks Cal is having an affair while Cal believes his constant running into Nicole is a coincidence. With Jane in California and Cal in Texas, it seems that this relationship is over unless the duo comes to their senses.The RETURN TO PROMISE will satisfy die-hard fans of the warm uplifting series and newcomers who will gain a taste of that mighty Macomber magic. Cal and Jane have appeared as secondary charcaters in previous books, so that their starring role feels like coming home. However, the plot is occasionally detoured by flashbacks that Ms. Macomber told in previous novels. Still, the latest book in the Promise series works because of the lead couple, who substantiates that men and women occupy different galaxies.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","review":"I've read all the Promise books and looked forward to this sequel, but I was disapointed in what has happened to the \\"Dr. Jane\\" character. She doesn't act very intelligently (IMO) for an educated and previously spirited lady, in fact, she seems rather like a 1950's type of woman. And Cal, unfortunately, acts like an demanding jerk. (I realize their conflict is the point of the story, but it didn't seem very realistic as the characters seemed more mature in the previous books.) Of course there was a happy outcome, although it felt rather contrived. I read the whole thing to see what happened to the characters of Promise, who I rather liked (enough to buy the books), but I wouldn't really recommend buying this one unless you are a big-time \\"Promise\\" fan and want to add it to your collection.

An absolute miracle for her. Woke up the next day brighter and happier than I can remember. Have been using for nearly a week now and the change in her sleeping habits is fantastic. I have also been using it for my 7 year old son as he also wanted to have his CD player on at night, he does not have sleep problems but is a very active and excitable child and it seems to have calmed him down a bit.

She hates it! She doesn't like to listen to the narrator. SHe would rather just listen to soothing music for meditating. My 7yo, on the other hand, enjoys it very much and asks to listen to one of the meditations often. it really depends on the child whether or not they'll like it. My older daughter is a hyper chatter-box, and my 4yo is very quiet and introspective. one complaint i have is that the CD is very short and i feel we didn't get a fair value."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I listened to the cd first and thought it would help my youngest (7) son with some of his anxiety, and anger stuff.

She loved the first one, so I was really excited to get this one for her. First off, it isn't a woman speaking on the cd, it's a man. The first one was a woman. That threw my daughter off big time. She didn't like listening to the man.

Recently I started to feel like the CD wasn't helping him anymore -- it seemed like he just didn't even notice it anymore. So I purchased Indigo Ocean Dreams. It has been wonderful! He was so excited to listen to the new stories and went to bed without incident the very first night.As others have stated, these stories do use the same techniques as the original Indigo Dreams CD. My 6 year old did point that out to me (\\"The Angry Octopus is the same as the Caterpillar story\\") but he didn't seem bothered by it. In fact, the second night when I went in to check on him, he was actually tensing and relaxing his muscles along with the story. He never used to actually use the techniques in the stories before. I definitely see the benefit of having both CDs -- we can switch them up when he gets bored.My three-year-old daughter is now using the Indigo Dreams CD. I just can't say enough good things about these CDs. They are simply wonderful!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I love this cd! I purchased both the Indigo Dreams as well as the Indigo Ocean Dreams together and we absolutely love both of them! My children (3 boys in the same room) ask for the cd every night. We even will listen to them together just before bedtime on the couch for some down time. They love to lay still with their blankets and I watch their tummies go up and down as they automatically follow the breathing pattern within the stories. The music and voice of the reader are very soothing and within 2 stories my kids are asleep! I love the messages that are being told within the stories - they teach how to relax, have confidence and help relieve the stress of the day. I am so, so happy I have found these cd's!

It is beautifully done, with a direct approach to the child who is having trouble unwinding at night. So many materials in this area become sweet, almost sickly sweet, but \\"Indigo Dreams\\" is warm, charming, and really loving, while presenting the techniques in an intriguing and creative way. There are four selections on this CD, in addition to the complete sound track. The first is also called \\"Indigo Dreams\\" and is a series of affirmations, accompanied by gentle music. It is especially appropriate for younger children. \\"Boy and a Bear\\" deals with easy breathing, \\"Boy and a Turtle\\" uses colors, and \\"The Goodnight Caterpillar\\" considers Stress and Release, and Progressive Relaxation. Here, the child is used as a teacher, which can be a very positive experience for some children. This CD gets my highest recommendation.Lise Liepmann, MA, MEd, School Psychologist and Play Therapist"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"This is a fabulous tool for any clinician or mom.

Great buy!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"Indigo Ocean Dreams is important in light of current research regarding the brain and the detrimental effects of stress. As early humans struggled to endure, their brains became \\"hard wired\\" for survival. Today, though, only on rare occasions do we fight or run for our lives.Modern human brains when stressed, nevertheless, elicit the same fight or flight response our ancestors experienced. The problem lies in our inability to consciously recognize our brains still react to modern stress in a primal manner. Our brains still trigger hormones meant to optimize survival. Bodies become battle ready. Yet, unlike our ancestors, we experience few events that tell our brains, \\"Stop stressing. The danger has passed. Let's relax, feel safe and appreciate the fact we live for another day.\\"Conversely, our ancestral brains learned how to reduce the deleterious effects of stress through relaxation and rest. With fire as a major safety tool and language a close second, humans developed the habit of nightly evaluating events. These reviews, especially the most meaningful, became part of a storytelling tradition. Children grew up hearing life-lesson stories. The flickering fire, the protection and warmth of shelter, and the hypnotic tone of the speaker's voice lulled listeners into a relaxed, trance-like state. Herein lies the antidote for contemporary stress, what stress-reduction scientists call the \\"relaxation response.\\" Indigo Ocean Dreams helps children relax in a healthy, natural way. The stories speak to life as manageable and safe. Guided imagery and soothing suggestions induce the relaxation response and provide problem-solving lessons. Unlike the case with many relaxation recordings, the speaker's voice and delivery are pleasant. As a mental health therapist, I find this CD immensely useful. I suggest families purchase a copy and use one of the four stories nightly for at least a month. I have seen phenomenal success in some very tough cases.Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"This cd is a miracle.

She is profoundly gifted (which we did not know at the time) and has all the baggage that comes with that. She is very intense and feels all of her emotions in a much more intense manner that I do. People always recommended \\"Raising Your Spirited Child\\" to me when they met her, even as a toddler. I was searching for some kind of tool for HER to learn how to deal with her emotions and to be able to relax more. 6 years later - I am amazed at what this CD has done for her. She listened to it at night to fall asleep when she was a toddler. If she got very upset about something, we would give her some \\"down\\" time to go to her room and listen to her CD. Her favorite track is the Angry Octopus one (since she always seemed drawn to the CD when she was angry). When she gave up naps, she would listen to this CD in the middle of the day as her \\"down\\" time. These coping techniques have helped her to learn how to deal with stress from a very young age. She's 9 now, and she chooses when to go put her CD on. When she knows she has a big test coming up at school or a presentation that makes her worry - she listens to her CD. When she has a bad day or a fight with her sisters - she listens to her CD. I had NO idea when I bought this CD that it was going to be a lifelong coping strategy for her. Seriously, I stumbled upon this CD when there was NOTHING else out there for stress-relief geared at children. This CD gives me hope to imagine a world where kids don't grow up learning to be stressed out, but they grow up learning how to deal with stress from a young age, preventing illness and all the awful anxiety disorders that so many people have. I can't imagine how much calmer everyone would be if we were given these tools as children. In short, I am highly impressed that it has had such a long term effect and has created a life-changing coping strategy for my intense child."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I do not recommend this CD. I wish I could have listened to a sample of the CD before I purchased it. It was a waste of money. The electronic \\"music\\" or noise on this CD is annoying. I like the concept of teaching relaxation techniques to children. But my grandchildren did not like the narrator's voice or the music and asked that it be turned off. I was looking for something to help them fall asleep when they come to visit. This was not the right CD. A better choice for young children (infant to six) is Rainforest by Fisher Price. The music is soothing and can be played at very low volumn. Another favorite is the Garden of Serenity by David and Steve Gordon. While I think this CD is intended for adults, it is appropriate for any age. The grandchildren love the chime and water sounds. With either of these CD's they fall asleep within minutes."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I wanted to listen to the stories before the kids and it was so calmingI went to sleep.

The Indigo Ocean Dreams CD has been a lovely addition to our bedtime routine. I feel good about the fact that my child is learning skills in such a sweet, enjoyable way and that will continue to be of use to him as he grows up (visualization, breathing, affirmations etc).

This was the first of Lori Lite's books and cds--I now own and use almost all of Lori Lite's books and cd's.They have been wonderful for my child. I began playing the cd's for my child when she was 2 1/2--she is now 4. I began using them when she started preschool, which was a period of great change and upheaval for her. I would play the cd's (or read the book) right before bedtime and they would help her settle down at the end of her day. The stories would gently lull her (and me) to sleep. The CD teaches calmness, serenity, breathing, release of emotions, etc--important things for every child and adult. (I found myself releasing my own fustrations of the day, as I listened.) There is another very important tool that the cd provides that has not been stressed enough--in an age of limited language skills and expression--this cd provided my child with the language tools, to be able to better express to me her feelings, issues and fustrations, so that in turn I could be more responsive to her. This tool or gift, whereby the stories gave her the ability to verbalize her own fustrations has truly been remarkable."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I bought this CD for my eight-year old daughter on a impulse.

Both CD's are beautiful; filled with positive, uplifting, and empowering stories presented in soothing, steady tones. The pace of the speaking and spacing of the stories is slow and deliberate, achieving the goal of peaceful relaxation. The CD's are passively interactive...breathing, stretching, relaxing and absorbing the message. These CD's facilitate learning very important techniques for self-regulation and control and I highly recommend them to all families.Despite some initial fidgeting on the part of my 11 year old, the first time we listened together the kids quickly settled down and became engrossed and involved. A couple of times, we lay all together on my bed with the lights dimmed while listening; other times the kids listen after being tucked in to bed in their own room. Although we have only had the CD's for a few days now, they have already become a part of the winding-down pre-bedtime routine."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"my four year old chooses between the 'blue' and the 'purple' cd to listen to as he falls asleep, these have even outdone the Polar Express he had been listening to!calming and soothing- i'm not sure who loves them more- he or I!!!!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I listen to this CD with my two children, who are two and three, at nap time.

On the cd there's onecalled \\"Bubble Ride\\" and you can feel the bubblescascading all the way down to your fingertips and itREALLY makes me relax!\\"He won't go to sleep without them now. Heassociates it with relaxation and sleep so all I haveto do is turn on the cd player and he immediatelycloses his eyes and gets down to the business ofrelaxing towards sleep. Before the cds, he would beup and down in his room for up to an hour beforehe would settle down and stay in bed.My neighbors 10 yr old daughter is also very anxiousdue to a break-in in their new home recently andsome other issues she has. I suggested this cdawhile ago but her mother didn't buy it. Finally afterthey had yet another sleepless night due to somebad night terrors and were exhausted, I walkeddown and physically handed one of our cds to themso they would try it. She said her daughter lovesthem and zonks right out. I never did hear if theyhave \\"cured\\" her of the night terrors and anxietybut I do know they bought their own copies thenext day!It's a good thing too because my son was literallycrying to get his Indigo Ocean Dreams copy backone night (he had the other one - Indigo Dreamsthough!) and I had to walk down to their house inthe dark and trade them for our Indigo Dreamscopy!The woman's voice is so soothing. It'swonderful. I love to listen to it too. The pace isperfect also. Thank you so much for these cds.Children have so much to deal with in their littlelives and it's wonderful to see someone payingattention to this and teaching them thesetechniques they can learn easily and use for the restof their lives! Thank you Thank you!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I am kind of bummed because I went by one of these reviews that called this a \\"sequel\\" to the other one. It is NOT a sequel but is the exact same thing -- only the characters and setting have changed. Even my 8-year old noticed right away - \\"Oh this is the caterpillar story\\" and \\"this is the boy and the bear.\\" We really liked the first CD, Indigo Dreams, and since this was described as for age 8-12, we thought it would be that \\"next step.\\"Yet I feel we completely wasted money since we already had the first. But if you don't have the first, then this is a great item. I don't know too many 12 year olds who would listen to it, but it's great for kids 6-10ish who need to learn relaxation techniques. Right away my son incorporated some of the techniques and is beginning to make some process with his anxieties."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"Indigo Ocean Dreams I would highly recommend this CD for mental health workers who have children on their caseload. Finding resources for children are very difficult so I was very happy to locate this product. I have been working with several children experiencing anger management and anxiety problems and they really enjoy this CD. Also, their parents benefit from the techniques and the time spent with their children practicing the techniques."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"Overall, the \\"Indigo Dreams\\" series of CDs is excellent, and my rating reflects my general perception across all three of them. The concepts and tone are soothing and the tools it teaches are effective. My very bright, creative 10 year old son suffers from pretty intense anxiety and stress issues; he also has some anger issues and trouble falling asleep, both of which are off-shoots of the stress and anxiety. While these CDs are (unfortunately!) not a total panacea, they are helpful for him on many a tough evening.We own all three CDs in the \\"Indigo Dreams\\" series, and he listens to one or another of them just about every night. When he places one of those discs into the CD player, turns it on, and turns out the light, his body and brain seems to viscerally respond ... most of the time, anyhow. At his age and developmental level, he is just at the cusp of the kids' CDs being a little too young and the teen CD being a little too old, but he seems to benefit from them anyway. At this point, he still leans toward the kids' versions most of the time - the simple stories \\"zone him out\\" in a good way, though I can't honestly say that he \\"hears\\" them as much more than white noise after so many listenings. There are mornings when he tells me that he can't remember anything past the first or second story on the CD, which means he fell asleep relatively quickly. (YAY!) Sometimes we just skip the CD player to the \\"music only\\" tracks at the end of each CD and that relaxes him as well.The only barrier that prevented me from rating the series with five stars rather than four is a minor \\"gender issue\\". My son prefers the voice of the female narrator; unfortunately, she is only present on the Indigo Dreams CD with the purple cover. And, also unfortunately, it's impossible just from surfing on Amazon to ascertain which narrator is included on a CD until one purchases it - the gender of the narrator is not included in the description or even on CD label/gem case. My son has \\"made his peace\\" with the male narrator (it wasn't a huge issue), but the female voice still seems to be most effective for him in terms of relaxing. (I suspect that the \\"Teen Dreams\\" CD may have garnered a more positive reception with a female narrator, but who knows?) This may not be an issue for most kids, but - if it is - be aware that the \\"Ocean\\" and \\"Teen\\" CDs include a male voice for the stories/exercises.As an aside, my husband and I find ourselves successfully using some of the techniques that these CDs teach; I guess after listening to them (even peripherally) so many times we've just absorbed them! We await further additions to this terrific series!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I bought all 3 of the Indigo Dreams CDs for children/teens. I have 2 daughters who deal with anxiety. My youngest's anxiety was so severe that she ended up in ER with a panic attack, which increased her anxiety even more - it was a horrible cycle. In searching for techniques to help her, I found this CD series. It has been a godsend. She quickly downloaded both of the \\"non teen\\" CDs to her iPod, allowing her to take the relaxation \\"on the road\\" and to choose her favorites from both CDs. She's been using these for almost a month and now her bedtime is so peaceful and easy - no longer does she stew and fret and end up being awake for hours. She is always asleep within minutes. My eldest daughter likes her teen CD as well, though she declared it was \\"stupid\\" before she listened to it. Now she has it on every night. These are great great products!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"My kids have been waiting \\"impatiently\\" for this CD to arrive in the mail and said it was worth the wait. Lori Lite hit another home run with her second CD Indigo Ocean Dreams. My 11 year old had experienced an increase in anger towards the end of his school year. My 9 year old is dealing with fear and anxiety due to a recent challanging family event.The first night of listening was a great experience for my daughter. She learned new self-calming techniques and was walking around the house the next day practicing her sea otter breathing(belly breathing).(she did this with the first CD \\"Indigo Dreams\\" where she did her Boy and a Bear breathing.)My son learned how to release his anger and loved the Angry Octopus story. I listened to the CD after both kids were asleep and I was amazed at how relaxed I as an adult felt.I felt calm, peaceful and happy. I actually can not remember when I fell asleep. I just know that I had the best sleep I've had in months.My life is so challenging now with all these recent changes that I will do anything to keep my kids healthy. The techniques of breathing, affirmations, muscle relaxation and visualizations presented in these stories are working for my kids.These two CDs \\"Indigo Dreams\\" and \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" have been such a blessings in my recent life that I had to share this with the world.Thank you Lori!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"My third-grade class begs me to listen to Indigo Dreams.

I am in my 40s and I wish the Lori Lite CDs were around when I was young. I imagine it would have been a big help to me, given that I was a nervous, worried child. I love the stories and the narration is soft and pleasant. I use other CDs for relaxation and meditation that are geared for adults, but I find this type to be a nice change from those. I find it makes for a good balance to switch off between both types. We've all heard the phrase 'inner child' - this makes my inner child acknowledged and happy. The adult Lori Lite CD is another winner as well."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"This CD is great! The stories are so cute and it teaches children at a young age how to deal with stess, anger and how to relax and feel better about themselves.

So whenever I introduce a new concept to him (home charter school), he immediately thinks he can't do it, he gets extremely frustrated, and gives up before even trying. Awful. I was desperate to find something to help, and I knew something like Indigo Dreams had to exist. Lucky for us, I found it.I downloaded it in MP3 format right away. My husband was very skeptical, but he knew we had to give it a try.I prepared a small alcove off of our living room to create a \\"relaxation station\\". I painted it chocolate brown, brought in a couple of live leafy plants, set a dark green cushion on the floor, along with a few coordinating pillows. I set up his CD player with headphones, and explained to my son that during school, I will set aside time whenever needed for relaxation station. He was excited to try it out.So on the first day of school, he got overwhelmed with his phonics lesson. He got through the lesson though, knowing that he would get down time. So shortly after, off he went to relaxation station. He was sitting up on the cushion, against the pillows. Literally, ten minutes later, he was nestled in, and sound asleep.He LOVES \\"The Angry Octopus\\". That is his favorite. He says that he uses his imagination to see the story. When the octopus is angry, he feels angry too. And when the octopus breathes to calm himself, he does it too. He sees colors and the characters and the environment. He loves the sounds of the ocean. He says that it relaxes him and makes him feel good.Since using relaxation station on an as needed basis, my son no longer has the outbursts as I described earlier. He still gets frustrated from time to time, but now he is becoming an eager learner! He is progressing in school like never before! There are still challenges, but this CD helped remove one of the barriers, which was anger/frustration. Awesome!I have recommended this to elementary teachers, special education teachers, and physical and occupational therapists. I have recommended it to moms of kids who are perfectionists or have anxiety or anger issues or are highly sensitive.I am so glad I found this product. Even my skeptical husband admitted to its success. :)My 6 year old daughter also enjoys this CD. She especially likes the breathing exercises. Although she does not share the same challenges as her brother, she still does benefit from the stories.I would highly recommend this to parents, teachers, therapists, and specialists who work with children."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"This entire CD has been a wonderful boon for my children, especially my 8 year old daughter who has suffered from nightmares and had trouble going to sleep.

Nice stories, but the Cd is too long for a child to hear in one night and fall asleep at a decent time. My suggestion to the creator would be..Please alternate stories with music. The child could listen to one story and fall asleep to the music. The next night they could listen to another story and music, etc. My daughter told me \\" I had to stay awake to hear the end!\\" The stories are great!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"My son absolutely loves Ms Lite's Indigo Dreams CD.

Anytime she does not relax before falling asleep she wakes up hyper and her anxiety is high. I starting using this cd with her and she wakes up a different person. She is relaxed and happy. It is amazing. Also I go into her room to check on her after about 15 minutes and she is sound asleep. I can lift her arm and it falls back down limp.

In fact one day he was having some anger issues,my 3 yr old brought him the cd and suggested he go lady down and listen to the \\"angry octopus\\",so he did over and over several times then when he emerged his attitude was greatly improved for the next several days.

They listen to it nightly as they are going to bed. I would say that they stories are for kids aged 4 - 10. I think over 10 and the stories seem too babyish but might be ok.The stories really seem to help my boys relax as they go to sleep and feel comforted.The narration comes from a man who has a very soothing and calming voice. In the background are very soothing sounds of the sea.Their two favorite stories are:The first story is angry octopus. It is about an octopus who loses his temper and feels out of control. He is taught not only that he can control his temper but how to control it. The relaxation exercises that follow are very useful and work wonderfully.The story affirmation weaver is also wonderful. It teaches kids about self esteem and telling themselves good things about themselves.The other two stories are Sea Otter Cove and Bubble Riding. These are also very calming and relaxing stories.

Our kids have lots of energy and at one point my son was Diagnosised with O.D.D. That diagnosis I am happy to say have been lifted. Our kids just don't want to go to bed. So when my husband is gone (he's a trucker so 98% of the time he's gone) they love to push it everything more. I needed something to help them relax and calm down from their day of activity. I was searching on the internet for some relaxation music for them. This one night just happen to be one our more stressful nights. So I was searching that night for kids relaxation music and what did I come upon on you tube. Part of story called Bubble Riding. So I checked it out. Wow it worked my kids settled down and even went to sleep. I'm even using it now as I type this because after school is not the best time. Every one is tired and letting it all out at home. As we listened to Bubble Riding on youtube, natually our son was disappointed because there was only so much of the story on there and he wanted to know what happened. I said he needed to wait until we had a bit of extra money. With my husband starting a new job it was tight, but we managed to order Indigo Ocean Dreams. After I had called and asked if the stories come on CD. When I was told that they come on the CD with music I was so happy since we didn't have the extra money for the package I wanted. This even helped me relax as well which is a good thing for parents to be. Our son was happy that I got the CD but sad because the pictures from the stories weren't on their. My husband and I usually talk about everything before we just go and buy something. I told him I'd rather spend a little bit more money on something that I already know WORKS; than to spend money on the exact same type of product that only half works or doesn't work at all. I've thanked Lori many times for taking the time to create the music and stories. And even if your child doesn't have austism and all the others it works all kids. I would reccommend this not only to parents, but other professionals as well such as the dentist since some kids have a hard time with that, teachers and others. I even told the one Dr we saw for our son about the CD and he is pleased with all the progress we've made and was happy to lift all diagnosis and concerns for our son. I've already told a couple of teachers about it. Even though one was joking she did asked if there was for adults and I said yes there is. I am just so impressed with the time and work Lori put into this...and there's even a CD for teenagers and most of us know how stressful the teen years are. This is definately a 5 star product and worth every bit of money.

This book is so wonderful and the music is so relaxing that they are doing the breathing exercise. The 5 year old has just entered kindergarten, bringing in more changes to his life. It is wonderful for him to know a relaxing technique. Thank you for the awesome books & cds."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I love the Indigo Ocean Dreams CD and the books that correlate to it. I am a Behavioral Resource Teacher and work with students with emotional and behavioral disabilities. I have used the stories during social skills lessons as well as in independent listening centers. All of my students (in grades Kdg. through 6th) have enjoyed the stories. My students have learned valuable strategies for decreasing stress, dealing with feelings of anger, and believing in themselves. I would recommend this product to any classroom teacher."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I was ske-ptical at first but then it won me over as something worthwhile. Despite some initial fidgeting on the part of me , the first time I listened to it, I soon after settled down and became engrossed and involved. A couple of times, I almost fell asleep. Although I have only had the CD's for a few months now, they have already become a part of the pre-monday morning rush routine. I recently received this as a gift to use with my 11 and 12 year old sons. This cd is really beautiful; filled with positive, uplifting, and empowering stories presented in soothing, steady tones. The pace of the speaking and spacing of the stories is slow and deliberate, achieving the goal of peaceful relaxation. The CD's are passively interactive...breathing, stretching, relaxing and absorbing the message. These CD's facilitate learning very important techniques for self-regulation and control and I highly recommend them to all families."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"My daughter was having a lot of anxiety and anger managment issues. I ordered the CD on Amazon hoping it would help. She LOVES it! She is almost 9 and still loves \\"lullaby\\" cds. She goes to bed about 20mins early now and listens to one of the relaxation stories on the cd and then puts the cd on the instramental track and hits repeat so it plays all night while she sleeps. I often use the cd during the day to calm her as well. If I see anxiety/anger coming then I will ask her to go to her room, lie on her bed, and listen to a paticular track. Great buy!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"I love the message the stories share.

I put the CD Player in the hallway before bed so both my 6 and 3 year old can listen to one story before bed. My daughter needs this the most to learn to control her anger and this helps her learn how to breath and calm herself down. This also is nice and relaxing which helps with our bedtime routine."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"These relaxation audios for children are presented in a style that is appealing to children as the strong story element engages their imagination and gently teaches them skills to focus on breathing and to quiet the mind. The professional quality of the recording is evident and I like the background noises that help to create the scene and support the child to focus on breathing. The second track re affirmations introduces a number of creatures that might not be familiar to children living away from the sea and therefore I'd recommend to also buy the beautifully illustrated story bookAffirmation Weaver: A Believe in Yourself Story, Designed to Help Children Boost Self-esteem While Decreasing Stress and Anxietyas a visual support. (Fabulous books to support the other visualisatons are also available).I particularly enjoyed the \`Angry Octopus' and think that many children (and adults!) would benefit from this. These relaxation activities can have a calming effect and strengthen the child's ability to cope with stressful conditions, which is likely to leading to better emotional balance, improved thinking, attention and immune system. Like buying fresh fruit, this audio is something that's enjoyable and healthful for our children!"},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"This relaxation CD integrates guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, affirmation practice, and deep breathing in a relaxing & fun audiobook.I am a school therapist & have been using it w/ my kiddos.

She is having a problem adjusting to her two families--she has a mom and dad and a stepmother and stepfather. After selecting two other items on the Amazon site, I just happened to pull up information on these CDs. As I read it, it seemed to be what I was looking for. The reviews helped in my decision to purchase, even though a reference was given regarding the male narration. Once I received them, I listened to all of them first, and the review I read about the male narrative was correct. It wasn't very dynamic--he read the stories but there seemed to be something missing. I don't know whether it was his tone or the male voice in general. Despite that, I am hopeful that my granddaughter will benefit from these, especially as she drifts off to sleep."},{"Title":"Indigo Ocean Dreams: 4 Children's Stories Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness","review":"Short gentle relaxing stories for children, when they go to bed.

I was not disappointed.In this book, Sonja gives more details about how to communicate with animals and a lot of practical cat care advice. She fills in the gaps left in her life story by the previous book. There are, of course, stories about the cats Sonja has worked with. My favorite is the story of Rosie, a hungry, frightened, pregnant kitty rescued by Sonja's husband, Fitz, who is evidently as much of an animal over as she is. This book would be most appreciated by cat lovers who are open to the possibilities of interspecies communication."},{"Title":"Cat Talk: The Secrets of Communicating With Your Cat","review":"This is another great book from Sonya! It has helped me understand the animal world much better. Thanks to her book I am now able to better understand my cats and the animals around me. I help my family and friends with their animal problems now. I am very thankful to Sonya for helping me to better understand the world from an animal's point-of-view. I have no doubt that people can communicate with animals telepathically. If you are truly open to the idea, want to communicate with your pets, and have a true love for animals, then you can develop your ability to communicate with animals. Sonya tells in her book about the many animals she has encountered over the years; by telling people of these stories she has opened up the reader to what animals are like and how they perceive us. This book is truly a must for pet owners in order to better understand their animal companions. She tells ways to effectively get through problems that a person might be having with his/her pet and then gives helpful tips to help remedy the situation. The stories she tells apply to every pet owner. In the book, she has covered almost every animal you could possibly have. I recommend this book to anyone who has pets or works with animals. I give it five stars! Sonya truly is a gift from God!"},{"Title":"Cat Talk: The Secrets of Communicating With Your Cat","review":"This really opened my eyes about what cats go through in life!

The 2 practice exams in the book gave me almost an exact replica of the actual CHP exam! I was completely confident with all of my skills. This book helped me with the reading comprehension, writing, spelling, vocabulary, fill-in-the-blank, and essay. It even tells you as the reader what exactly to do to get hired.

Mariagrazia Ardengo, the mother, will not give up her pretensions though financially ruined and without hope for the future. She has two children, both in their twenties. Carla, who is bored with her present life, wants to change it drastically and overnight. Michele, who shows the indifference of the book's title, cannot get aroused by anything or anybody. Lisa, the mother's friend, has sunk to the level of a fat, penniless tramp, searches desperately for somebody to love her - or to at least pretend it. And then there is Leo. Leo used to be the lover of Lisa, until Mariagrazia took him away from her. Leo is the source of their financial ruin. Leo has money. Leo wants something fresher, younger, unspoiled. Leo goes after Carla. And he succeeds. After Mariagrazia and Lisa spend their time fighting over Leo, they are now left out in the cold. Michele cannot be touched by any of this but hopes that, one of these days, he can get a real life.Moravia started on this book when he was eighteen and it was published in 1929 when he was twenty-one. He did not have the life experience he so stunningly shows in his later work. I get the impression that he studied too much of the French literature of those times and tried to follow it. That makes this novel less than perfect and somewhat outdated."},{"Title":"The Time of Indifference (Translated By Angus Davidson)","review":"As my review title indicates, I think of this novel as a an existential soap opera. It has tawdry romances, dramas, intrigues, centering mostly around shallow characters with predictable emotions. But through the main character, Michele, Moravia explores contemporary trends in modern Western culture, society, and thought.So this book is both a pleasantly engaging page-turner and a pleasantly engaging intellectual treat. It's still not as good as Moravia's later works, particularly Boredom and The Conformist, in sexiness, intelligence, or originality. But I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Time of Indifference (Translated By Angus Davidson)","review":"Product said it was used but I swear it was brand new and got to me super fast! Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Time of Indifference (Translated By Angus Davidson)","review":"I am a big fan of Moravia, but I consider this to be one of his worst novels. There are only 5 characters and the novel is 300+ pages long, which makes reading it sort of a bore. Not a complete failure, worthy of one star, but seems to be far inferior to everything else written by the author."},{"Title":"Virgil's Aeneid (Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Short book of about 150 pages, with essays by various authors on diverse topics connected with \\"The Aeneid\\". Made for interesting reading and reinforced my recall of events in the poem, although all the excerpts cited were from modern translations that I found abysmal. The language was too prosaic. Ordinary. Nor suitable to the epic at all. In retropect, I loved John Conington's verse, the rhyme scheme carried you along, and yet let in all the pathos, poignancy, and Vergil's obvious abhorence of war. Which none of the essayists here addressed, an oversight I cannot understand, since this seems to be a major theme of the epic. Dryden's translation was also wonderful, and perhaps a bit clearer, although that may be attributed to the fact that I had already read this book and Conington's translation."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect compendium of almost everything having to do with the movie and artwork. The only thing lacking is of course, is the gorgeous soundtrack from the movie. (For that I recommend purchasing the Ost [IMPORT] Howl's Moving Castle Audio CD and listening to it while you peruse this beautiful book.)Anyone who is a fan of the movie, Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli, the artwork, and the screenplay will LOVE this book.Here is why this book is really worth every penny:CONTENTS:Intro- Production SynopsisPart 1- Contains Miyazaki's storyboards. His original concept sketches of the characters, backgrounds, and settings. You get to see the original artwork from the creator's mind. A chance to marvel at Miyazaki's inventiveness, and appreciate the Studio Ghibli animators' talents in bringing it to life on screen.Part 2- Neary 200 pages of beautifully printed scenes from the movie (all in color of course, glossy, crisp), following the entire storyline from start to finish, in a very clean layout. Each scene from the movie has concept art, sketches, and final prints. Nice printing, the rich colors and gorgeous artwork of the movie are beautifully intact. Large images, including a few two-page spreads (one of Howl in resting in bed after his \\"traumatic\\" hair experience.) *If you are keen to revisit the scenes from the movie, you will definetely not find this book to be lacking, it is chock full of images.- All scenes have text captions and many include insights from the Studio Ghibli's artists and animators on how they worked to achieve Miyazaki's desired artistic effect. Also a very interesting section of the studio's use of CGI (using CG \\"(not to create reality but to) ...add realism to the animiation\\")- Also full page prints of Japanese promotional posters at the end.Part 3- Contains the entire english screenplay of the movie (in case you wanted to see whether you missed anything). Again, nice layout.(There IS in fact both a hardcover and softcover version of this book, however the softcover I have only seen in the all-Japanese version so far, maybe the english version will be published in softcover in the *future.- *This tidbit written in Aug. 2005)"},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"As a huge fan of the film Howl's Moving Castle, I was delighted to see this book being sold so cheap here on Amazon. The book is hardback, and overall, well presented.My only complaint with the book is that the majority of it only contains stills from the film. They look great, of course, but I was hoping there would be more concept work, as well as pages dedicated to just backgrounds, as they were some of the most beautiful ones I had ever seen in an animated film.In a nutshell: A good book with some beautiful art, which is cheap, though it contains mainly stills from the film, not a lot of concept work."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Following in the tradition of The Art of Spirited Away, this book captures some of the best work in progress art for the film. The paper is glossy, the size is perfect for a coffee table book, and the colors span a wide, wide range, though perhaps not as much as those in Spirited Away.If you like The Art of Spirited Away, get this. There is something odd about it though. It's listed as being in paperback. The version I picked up at Barnes and Noble was most certainly not a paperback, and was in the exact same covering as The Art of Spirited Away, which is listed as a hardcover. Why is this?"},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Being a great Miyazaki fan I really love this book. Even though majority of the books is filled with movie stills, I love it. I revisit those pictures in the books and get myself lost in the beauty of colors. Also being a student of animation, I really get to learn a lot of things. Character concepts and other drawings are really helpful. I highly recommend this book for anybody who likes stories, animation and colors."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"And a heavy one. A hardcover book, with over 250 pages, and full of tons of data from the movie. Page after page of artwork dealing with scenes and character designs. It also has the English language screenplay. It also has information on the computer digital work and articles from many of the people who worked on the anime. A great art book that, if you are a fan of Hovel's Moving Castle, is a must."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"If you loved the movie, you will love this book, The Art of Howl's Moving Castle it's hard cover, with original sketches, storyboards and the final screenplay!The book explains every step of the complex story, from the original book adaptation to the final movie.

My student loves this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book in one word is...stunning! The high quailty pictures on thick quailty paper make this the best art book that i own. If ur thinking about buying a studio ghibli art book do not hesitate to buy this one!!!"},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I just got this as a gift and I love it! It is a wonderful collectible book. I am always looking for hardback because I think they are more collectible than paperbacks. The art of the whole book is wonderful but the character sketches are my favorite probably because I loved the characters of the movie so much. I thought they were beautifully done. In all the art I loved seeing the creative flow, the process of artists is fascinating to me. It's like looking inside the mind of a creative genius. I am so happy with this gift. It's a beautiful book and I will cherish it forever."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle is great for anyone that loved the movie and wants to know more about how it was created.This book gives you a look at the concept drawings that started it all. There r some stills from the movie as well. They give you a play by play from the first image to the last. It's great because you get a little blurb explaining the drawing and character development by the person that was actually drawing that particular character or scene. There are a lot of interesting factoids about why a character is drawn a certain way or way the color scheme may change based on a charcters mood. My favorite part was the evolution of the Elder Sophie and how her apperance changed. You also get a copy of the final screenplay at the end of the book. So enjoy as you flip through how Howl's world came to be."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Is the second time I order a book from amazon and I'm satisficed with the service, I live in other country and i never had a problem."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Howl's moving castle is a wonderful story of fantasy. After the first time I watched it I actually had tears coming out from my eyes. I can feel myself how Sofie would feel when she suddenly turned in to a 90 year old woman. I was actually surprised how Howl was willing to sacrifice himself to protect Sophie, a person that he didn't know of much. I'm glad to say that that this is one of the best movie I've ever seen. I'd like to thank the person who created this wonderful and amazing story!"},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I love this book!

The concept sketches go in order of appearance from the movie, so the concept sketches for Sophie come at the beginning, for example, while the concept sketches for Human Turnip show up near the end. There are thousands of gorgeous location scenes as well plus short bios on some of the creators of the movie and a few articles that discuss the creaters' experiences working on the film. Also, at the very end is the complete final screenplay to read through. The screenplay has a few minor changes in it from where the English actors improvised a little (especially Billy Crystal), but otherwise, is exactly from the movie.Being a student of film and the arts, I found this book extremely helpful and interesting, because it showed the creative process of a huge movie. I would definitely recommend it to any film or arts students to browse through if they wan to get an idea of what kind of work it takes to create such a monumental film!The only qualm I have with this book is that there were hundreds of screenshots. Not that that's bad, especially if you want to buy this book to revisit the movie, but I would like to have seen a few more sketches and whatnot, or at least a few more articles on how the particular scenes with the screenshots were made.That aside, I fell in love with this book and was enchanted from front cover to back cover."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"This book opens a world of anime art like none other.

Over the years I have periodically watched it again and each time I see it my appreciation for movie's storytelling power and visual beauty grows stronger.This is a fun, beautiful film that takes place in a wonderous alternate universe that's Japanese anime meets steampunk Austro-Hungarian fairytale.The Art of Howl's Moving Castle is a book compilation of various drawings made by the animation team from concept sketches to final cells. All of the drawings are stunning to look at, but what may be of more interest to the movie's aficionados are the corresponding commentary about the moviemaking process by team members such as art director Yoji Takeshige, background artist Kazuo Oga, and so on.The bulk of the book also functions as a basic storyboard, but the last third or so is the actual final screenplay.Studio Ghibli Library has published quite a few companion books to their movies, but The Art of Howl's Moving Castle remains one of the strongest in the set due to the aforementioned commentary.Definitely a worthwhile book for any artist, animator or Miyazaki fan."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I bought this for a gift for a friend that loves Howl's Moving Castle.

The book is in Japanese, but it doesn't matter much as only the first 5 pages are in Japanese and the rest of the book is just pictures. It's over 400 pages and nothing but layout designs (as the title suggests) from all the Miyazaki films. Gorgeous."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Nice. Really nice. As you open the pages, you'll see full traditional watercolor paintings of the castle, the backgrounds, and everything. The first part are character designs and sketches, then more to the finer ones, then movie stills. The latter part includes some digital enhancements on the movie. Plus of course, the movie script. This artbook is really a good find, I tell you. Although I must say, Spirited Away's Artbook is much better; but this is still as good as it can get. Of course, it's Studio Ghibli! :)"},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"Beautiful book. Beyond the expectations of our son the artist. One of his favorite Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"The Art of Howl's Moving Castle","review":"When I first saw Howl's Moving Castle I was immediately taken by it. But I had a lot of questions about some of the film's symbols, which prompted to me buy this book. Though the answers to my specific questions were not to be found in these pages, there were a number of other answers to questions I never thought to ask that took their place. In fact, even after just a cursory walk through the book I found myself appreciating the film even more. Now that I've had a chance to read all of the interviews with Miyazaki's team I consider \\"Howl\\" to be a definite masterpiece. Everything from considerations about color, mood and the subtle arc of the characters is discussed here. I was most impressed with the observation that the With of the Waste is not an \\"evil\\" character nor does she consider herself to be evil. This certainly comes through in the movie when you find yourself being endeared to the poor old woman who, despite her age, maintains her naughtiness. I wish books like this were done for so many other animes that I enjoy, but at least Miyazaki continues to offer them up for most of his films."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"As a student who scored a 1600 on my first try, I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I commend Fischgrund for sending a desperately overdue message to parents: TAKE IT EASY ON YOUR KIDS! Micromanaging your kids' lives will not make them get a perfect score. There is no need to send your kids off to private schools, test prep centers, and private tutors. (I went to a public school and took one practice test two nights before the exam. I attribute the results more to luck than anything else...luck and that enormous painting of John Lennon right in front of my seat at the test center.) And while you're at it, don't read books like this looking for some secret formula; read it because the topic interests you. High school students are already so sleep-deprived and stressed out; it's better to let them spend Saturday morning sleeping in than at Kaplan. The SAT is not a be-all and end-all. An extra 10 points is not worth the burnout.On the other hand, I feel Fischgrund makes some grave mistakes by inferring causation from correlation. For instance, perfect score students are more passionate about learning, a theme he repeats several times using slightly different phrases. Well duh! It's easy to be passionate about learning if, from a young age, the teacher has always rewarded you with good grades, and concepts have come easily to you.The SAT does tap into a certain type of ability that some people have more than others. I am NOT talking about intelligence--I don't feel that intelligence is a singular word; everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I'm simply saying that, for the narrow fields the SAT tests, there are individual differences that are either present at birth or created by the end of elementary school. When a young child excels in academics--possibly from factors as random as a teacher's style or personal biases--there is a greater chance that he or she will become intellectually curious and passionate. If, instead, the child becomes cynical about school--often for totally understandable reasons--that attitude is extremely difficult to reverse later on because it self-perpetuates.So yes, it's true that perfect score students are intellectually curious and passionate. But can that really qualify as a &quot;secret of acing the SAT?&quot; If so, you could write another book: &quot;The 7 Secrets of Becoming the World's Greatest Violinist.&quot; Secret One: Love to play the violin. If you interviewed the world's greatest violinists, I'm sure they'll all say they love to play the violin. But as someone who could never play in tune, I can assure you that nothing could have made me love the violin. I was bad at it; the teachers told me, and the judges told me even more.Another factor Fischgrund mentions is the prevelance of two-parent households among perfect score students. Again, correlation does not equal causation. There could be a third factor involved, such as the absence of major family crises (e.g., death or major illness in the family) that reduces the divorce rate and also gives the student more mental capacity to focus on academics. In addition, having two parents around does NOT necessarily mean a supportive family network. More than one perfect score child I know has parents who are still married just for the sake of saving face to other members of their religion or culture.But the one &quot;secret&quot; I have the most problems with is the first one: Perfect score students are self-confident. Keep in mind that these students were interviewed AFTER they found out their scores. If you had scored a 1600 and were just reminded about it by the interviewer, wouldn't you be self-confident too? In fact, a lot more self-confident than you probably would be a few years down the road when no one cares about your SAT scores, and certainly a lot more self-confident than you were the morning of the test.Finally, I take major issue with the irony of this book. Here is a book telling you that perfect score students don't place that much emphasis on the SAT and are instead interested in learning not for a test but for wisdom. But at the same time, the book is marketed as a book of &quot;secrets&quot; filled with directives for parents to follow so that their kids can achieve that elusive score. Hypocrisy, anyone? (or maybe just a clash between idealism and capitalism...)Conclusion: Love your kids and give them positive feedback when you see improvements. But don't do it for the SAT; don't do *anything* for the SAT. Contrary to what this book may imply, parents can do way more to make their children kind, compassionate, and responsible than they can to make their children score higher on the SAT. Trust me--a perfect score is not All That."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"My mom had recently bought me this book, since it was on sale. As I skimmed through it, I wondered how a book published as recently as 2004 was in the Barnes and Noble Bargain section. Little did I know how right Barnes and Noble was to get rid of this book as quickly as possible. This book did a study on what perfect score students did to get perfect scores and then came up with 7 \\"secrets\\" based on the resultsThe book stresses that the SAT is not very important, and that life should not be focused on the SAT. Why then, does the cover yell \\"7 secrets to raise your score\\" if it's not a big deal? As a reviewer on amazon.com said,\\"Here is a book telling you that perfect score students don't place that much emphasis on the SAT and are instead interested in learning not for a test but for wisdom. But at the same time, the book is marketed as a book of \\"secrets\\" filled with directives for parents to follow so that their kids can achieve that elusive score. Hypocrisy, anyone?\\"Let's see what the 7 \\"secrets\\" are.Secret 1: They're Self ConfidentWell duh! Of course they're self-confident. These students were interviewed after they found out they got perfect scores. Suppose you got a 1600 on the SAT. Wouldn't you be confident some guy came up to you and interviewed you, reminding you of how well you did? You would certainly be much more confident now than before you took the SAT.Secret 2: They are intellectually curiousI didn't need a book to figure that out.Secret 3: They read quickly and voraciouslyAgain, I didn't need a book to figure that outSecret 4: They develop a core group of passionsI don't see how this helps me get a better SAT score.Secret 5: They're proactiveThat pretty much is a given for a student who got a perfect score on the SAT.Secret 6: They develop a social networkI can see how this may help, but I definitely would not classify this as a \\"secret\\" that will help me improve my score. I was expecting something more useful in this book.Secret 7: Their real goal isn't to ace the SATI don't understand. The cover says \\"7 secrets to raise your score\\", but one of the secrets is not setting a goal to ace the SAT. So, this book is saying, in essence, that the secret to ace the SAT is to not have a goal to ace the SAT. Does this ring any bells?Overall, this book is highly misleading. All 7 secrets are not really secrets. They are just social habits. The cover of this book should really say: \\"SAT Perfect Score: 7 Social Habits Perfect Score students have\\". This book may be interesting to read but has no real academic benefit. I doubt I would do any better on the SAT now than before I read this book. Also, this book doesn't seem to be very professionally made. It doesn't have an index! I find an index very helpful for searching up things you need to know. And since the author thinks that these are \\"secrets\\" that everyone needs to know, he should put an index in there, so we can find information on the \\"secrets\\".Out of a 1-5 scale, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best, I'd rate this book a 2, rounded up from a 1.5. It was an interesting read, but I was expecting something that would help me academically. If this book was entitled \\"SAT Perfect Score: 7 Social Habits Perfect Score Students Have\\", I would have given it a higher review, because the book is interesting, and I would know that is wouldn't help me in terms of academics. This book is definitely not worth the 13.95 list price."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"If your student can use this advice, more power to him/her. _Very_ few people will find it worthwhile.For example, one piece of advice is to have an insatiable intellectual curiousity. Hey, that's good advice . . . for someone who already has it. How exactly do you go about instilling such an attitude in a teenager who is not naturally/already that way? It is obviously possible to _raise_ a child in that sort of environment, from a very early age, but how do you change their approach to learning midstream?More advice from the book: have a strong sense of self-worth and derive your motivation from within. See my comments above for what I think about this bit.It's a bit like telling a 98 lbs. kid to simply \\"be bigger\\" in order to do well in sports. Yes, it _is_ possible to work out and get bigger and put on mass or wait to grow larger . . . but that does not help the kid much right now when he or she has to play the game in just a couple of months (or less).Some things in the book, like an appeal for students to read voraciously, are good advice. But it's a bit hard to work your freshman into a frenzy of self-directed learning-for-the-joy-of-it if they have not been raised that way.The book does a wonderful job of telling what you would look for if you wanted to _predict_ which students would do well on the SAT. As for nuts and bolts how to actually achieve a higher score, this book is practically worthless.Go to a bookstore and check it out before buying. If you still want it, come back here and go to town. I think you'll find out that there are other resources out there that will provide more immediate advice.-------------------------One last note: the questions on the back cover are great examples of how to misuse statistics. For example, one question asks \\"What percentage of 1600 scorers went to public school?\\" The answer is (if I remember correctly) about 80%. Impressive, right? Not when you realize that, in 2000, 95% of all high school students attended public schools .... This actually indicates that private schools are outperforming their expected numbers. Other questionable statistics abound in the questions.While you're at it, pick up a copy of \\"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists\\" by Joel Best to help you spot these numbers abuses."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"Fischgrund's book is interesting. And it's a nice change from books that give the same long list of \\"take practice tests. Here's the vocabulary that's likely to show up. Here are the sort of math problems that they give. Here, time yourself and do this. Now do this. Now do it again. Now let's talk about the perils of blind guessing. Have a good night's sleep and a healthy breakfast!\\" And, perhaps naturally, I'm interested in the idea of what makes up a perfect SAT scorer.I got a 1600 SAT, first try, in 1997. (Technically, second try, since I'd taken it five years before.) There were some things I had in common with Fischgrund's subjects -- I had a supportive, two-parent household, I'd been an insatiable reader since before kindergarten, I was given the freedom at my public school to independently study what I felt like studying, and I took advantage of it.I also had a well-developed sense of self-loathing, far from \\"confidence\\", and, had I been born five years later, probably would have been on Prozac or one of its cousins all through high school. My social circle largely evaporated outside of school and scheduled activities -- I didn't have a supportive clique or friends as such. I was acquainted with failing to excel: my math teacher that winter tried to get me to drop her class for something easier, and plenty of things I put my hands to fell apart. I didn't much believe in luck, either creating my own or letting it come to me. I never took a practice test or opened a test prep book.And furthermore, when I went into the testing room in spring of my Junior year, I'd had a pretty severe case of mononucleosis for over six weeks. I still felt awful and couldn't make it through a full school day without going to the nurse's office to sleep for an hour. I had no hopes for my score. In fact, I fell asleep at several times during the test.And you know what? That probably contributed to my doing as well as I did. I walked into the test room with the attitude of \\"Whatever. This doesn't matter much. I can always retake it.\\"If you're reading this, you might be a teenager -- but you're more likely to be a parent. So I just want to tell you -- be realistic. Think about your kid. Fischgrund touches on this, but it gets subsumed by the way that the book is geared toward Getting The Best Test Score Possible, and it needs to be restated strongly and often. If your kid is prone to test anxiety, you'll know it by the time she/he is in high school. Don't go nuts about how important this test is and how it'll determine the rest of your teenager's life -- schedule it for junior fall rather than spring, and then let your kid go into it without pressure from you. If your son or daughter doesn't fit the characteristics outlined in this book, don't try to force them -- and don't fall into the trap of thinking that these \\"secrets\\" are either necessary or sufficient.There are tons of ways to knock the socks off of an admissions committee. SAT scores are only one piece of it. And going to an elite college is no guarantee that you will be happy, or even employed. There is NO one true way to success -- don't be persuaded otherwise."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"As the parent of two teenage children I am always looking for ways to encourage my children to do the best they can in school. I have just finished a new book, 1600 PERFECT SCORE, The 7 Secrets of Acing the SATs, which I strongly recommend as a new insight to achieve this goal. I like the fact that Dr. Fischgrund did not speak in generalities. Rather, he gave specific advice to parents and kids on how to achieve better SAT scores and grades.His interviews with these high achievers gave me a new perspective on kids who get a perfect score on the SAT. The stereotype of the \\"academic nerd\\" is just that, a stereotype. These high achievers are dynamic and well-rounded. There is no one \\"type\\". Read the interviews and see how they view themselves. I now realize that they could be any one of my children's friends.I think we parents and our teenage children need to have evidence against the argument that kids who do well in school will be social outcasts and will be doomed to spending their lives in labs. This book gives us proof that success is attainable and comes in many forms and these kids are demonstrating only one of theirs by acing the SAT.Bernard Mlaver, M.D."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"This book reveals what the real test takers who aced the SAT did to succeed, which no other book has ever done. What a bright idea! The book even created charts comparing what all the other SAT prep books recommend and what the 1600 kids say. There are differences that surprised me. The book takes it a step further than that, it shows how these high academic achievers have succeeded as students, and how parents can help their kids be successful in life. The book also has another use that is not that apparent because of the focus on the SAT. The commonalities found in the 1600 students serve as a guideline to prepare college applications and the essays. Their personal attributes are exactly what college admissions officers are using to select students from the pile, once you get past the scores and GPAs."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"I picked this book up in a Book Store.

To be clear, this book doesn't give tricks but it did give me something else instead.This book basically is about a research down by the author and how he surveyed perfect score and average students and compared these two groups based on their interests, likes, and daily life. What I really enjoyed about this book is because it showed me the daily life of a perfect score student and it allowed me to compare with what I am currently doing. It gives you detailed statistics and numbers about the hours both perfect score students and average students spend doing their activities every day and week. I found this book to be a really interesting read and I think it helped me in ways different than SAT books by test prep companies would help.To be specific, here is what I got out of this book.Note that I am only including things that I did not before, that I do know now.1. I have to read more, this book gives you statistics on how many hours students read and how it correlates with SAT scores.2.

We both read this book and thought it was interesting, although the basic message was that most students who do well don't stress too much over grades but get perfect grades and are balanced students. This isn't very helpful since it basically says students who do well are so smart that they don't have to study, but my older son got a 2370 on the sat only after studying and taking the test over. So obviously studying is important to success. One interesting piece of information this book has that may be helpful to other parents and students is one passage where the student talks about how he was able to know what questions to expect and was even able to guess the experimental section and left it blank. I believe this is the secret to success--if you practice enough, then taking the test will become second nature to you.

From the get go I had a hard time getting very far into this book after reading the description of the author's data gathering regarding the perfect score students and the control group. It was IMHO not rigorous enough to lead to statements such as \\"myth shattering\\" and \\"results [...] turn the idea of SAT preparation on its head\\" (granted, SAT preparation is yet another story, but I digress).The author also goes on to imply/state how much influence parents have on the ultimate success of their child. Yes, parents do have an impact on their children, but when it comes to the drive to succeed, a parent's impact may not be as great as we like to think. I highly suggest anyone reading this check out Levitt's \\"Freakonomics\\". While the whole book is not devoted to the subject of parents' impact on their children, there is some insightful information regarding children and their success in school/life in chapters 5 and 6 (the \\"Perfect Parent\\").Now as far as the \\"secrets\\" go; well they are good general pursuits that everyone would benefit from.

It assumes that the best students are the ones who receive 1600: those with 1590s are automatically discredited from participating in this book's study, even if 1590s are just as intellectually capabkle as 1600s, probably only slightly more likely to make minor mistakes."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"As I was reading this book with 1 student in college and 2 teenagers at home, I found many answers to questions that I have had about preparing my kids and helping them to improve their scores. At our house the SAT becomes a huge focus for at least 2 months before the test. Tutors are hired, computer programs are installed, Mom and Dad are screaming to study more and get off the phone.However we realize that by 12th grade we can not really help them very much. If we have done our jobs as parents correctly then they should be \\"ready\\" based on accumulated knowledge and life experiences.This book made me feel better about the support and resources that I have provided as a parent such as the impact of a nuturing home environment. It reinforced some things that I knew already(importance of reading and intellectual curiousity)but it also gave me a greater appreciation of the role of peers, friends, and schools on my kid's development and interests.I also realized just how \\"normal\\" most of these high performers really are. This book has many interesting profiles that really give you a sense of what drives these kids to succeed. These kids are not all nerds or naturally gifted...they are many times \\"all-arounds\\" who excel at many things and do not just have their head in a book. These are the type of people, the role mdels, that I want my kids to see and read about.So read this book for you...to better understand what the priorities should be in your home with your kids, and ask your kids to read the book so they can better understand what is really important in life ( beyond good grades and just scoring 1600)."},{"Title":"1600 Perfect Score : The 7 Secrets of Acing the SAT","review":"A refreshing approach to what is often a dry subject. This is so much more than a test preparation book, this is a book about life and creativity and values and how important those things are in becoming a happy, fulfilled person. Every parent should read this book -- and every student as well. It's about balance and focus and big picture goals. As it happens, practicing the seven simple principals will likely bring you close or closer to a perfect score. The beauty is that the score is not an end in itself, but a means to more opportunities for a rich and satisfying life.The author stresses that self-motivation, creativity and curiosity are critical -- all things that can and should be encouraged from very early ages. This far-reaching study truly confirms what many of us would like to think. Using the characteristics of the perfect score students, Fischgrund illustrates that success is not driven by money or privilege but by developing passions and focusing on the big picture.

The formula then offered is simple but effective: if you want to achieve this objective, practice these traits as best you can and you too may get there--or at least a lot closer than you ever thought you would. By understanding the deceptively simple &quot;secrets&quot; offered by books like &quot;Perfect Score&quot;, the willing but uncertain reader can acquire probably the most important traits of all required for success: confidence and motivation.What &quot;Habits&quot; did for achieving self-actualization and &quot;Millionaire&quot; for building wealth, the well-written and carefully thought-through &quot;Perfect Score&quot; can do the same for maximizing your child's educational potential.

To be honest with you, I've never taken the SAT in my life yet I hold three degrees. Why? Because the SAT means nothing. Do you want a simple royal road to success? Just go to a community college for two years, graduate with a degree, transfer to a 4 year university, and graduate with another degree in two years. Most will save tons of thousands of dollars by this way. For each degree I've earned, I graduated in the top 1%, overall and major. Taking the SAT has nothing to do with it. It's just a stupid test that is virtually meaningless. Moreover, you actually can transfer to any school in the country providing that you have successfully graduated from a community college with high enough GPA. Hmmm, after reading the book, I am actually interested in taking the SATs and see how I measure up. If I fail to get 1600 (or today, 2400 or whatever the perfect score is), what does that mean? Like I said, it's just a stupid test that is virtually meaningless. If one bombed the SAT absolutely and got one of the lowest scores possible yet he has earned millions of dollars in his lifetime afterwards, what does that mean?

Drucker, born in 1918, is probably the 20st Century's greatest management thinker. He was Professor at New York University and currently teaches at the Graduate Management School of Claremont University, California. Drucker is the authors of numerous books and award-winning articles. This article was published in the January-February 1988 issue of the Harvard Business Review.Drucker discusses the changes in the concept and structure of organizations from command-and-control organization to information-based organizations. The article discusses the transformation process - the availability of capital investment information changes the traditional budget exercise into an analysis of policy, the information-based organization requires more specialists overall than the command-and-control organization, and the information-based organization will have a flatter structure where the knowledge will be primarily at the bottom. Drucker also discusses the transformation of organizations, which is hard to decipher, but the author uses the hospital, the symphony orchestra, and the British administration in India to describe the various possibilities. Information-based organizations will also have different requirements: clear, simple, common objectives that translate into particular actions, and information responsibility to others and oneself. Finally, Drucker discusses the management problems facing information-based organizations: development of rewards, recognition, and career opportunities, creation of a unified vision, management structure for an organization of task forces, and the supply, preparation, and testing of top management people. According to Dr&uuml;cker, the job of building the information-based organization is the managerial challenge of the future.Drucker has a reputation for predicting future trends and in this article he shows that skill again (do not forget that this article was written in 1988!). In simple terms he explains the challenges facing organizations turning from command-and-control into knowledge-based. For people that like the articles from Peter Drucker I recommend his (great value-for-money) book 'On the Profession of Management' (1998), which is a collection of 14 Harvard Business Review articles. The author uses simple US-English."},{"Title":"Mostly Shaker from the New Yankee Workshop","review":"Perhaps I'm biased, I think Norm is to woodworking what Carl Sagan was to science.

I rarely follow woodworking plans and basically use them just as a rough guideline, and these plans are easy to use that way as well.My only problem with the book is that in my humble opinion dovetails should be cut by hand. Norm uses a jig which I have no problem with. But I think he should have at least mentioned that the dovetails in the book can be cut by hand and tradtionally would have been. That minor gripe aside this is a good book for those who admire Shaker furniture."},{"Title":"Mostly Shaker from the New Yankee Workshop","review":"I'm not much for writing book reviews but had to for this one.

The photos and maps are first-rate, and the time estimates are a nice feature in any guidebook. Many of the routes given I've never heard of before (even on mountains which I've visited), so this book opens up a great set of new possibilities for my future climbs. Highly recommended for those Colorado mountain fans who are ready to move beyond the busy 14er routes to something more challenging."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"I purchased Colorado Scrambles in summer of 2005. Having moved from Colorado the previous summer, I came out on vacation in September 2005 for mountain climbing and used the book extensively. It is a good mix of route descriptions with pictures. I climbed Lookout Peak, Arrow, Engineer, Vermilion, SW ridge of Sneffels and the Citadel with the excellent info provided by Colorado Scrambles. The book is very good for someone wanting a challenge but not looking for multi-pitch technical climbs. I really enjoyed reading about the obscure summits especially in the Gore Range where there is not much written about the magnificent range."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"Mars-man needs to get out of Colorado more. \\"Scrambling\\" in the world at large does indeed have a specific meaning that includes 4th and lower 5th class climbing (probably more than it does just Class 3 climbing). I've climbed more than a dozen of the routes in the book including at least one that is not documented elsewhere and one using only this book as a guide and find the book to be a great guide to \\"interesting\\" routes throughout the state.It has a nice balance of well-known classics and hidden gems and provides important information (like GPS coordinates for critical junctures) not available elsewhere. As far as the pictures go, well they are worth a thousand words especially when it comes to routefinding.I kind of like the 1, 2, 3 general ratings for length and difficulty too (you know, \\"easy\\", \\"medium\\", \\"hard\\"?). It captures more than the technical difficulty of a route's hardest move. The traditional NCCS I-VI commitment grades could also have been used more widely, but I think 1,2,3 is more intuitive for the average person.There is no expressed or implied correlation between the 1,2,3 length/difficulty ratings and the traditional Yosemite grade. E.g. nothing in the write-up of Kelso Ridge implies that it is any harder than Class 3 (which I find to be accurate).To be sure, the climbs in this book are not for the beginner or inexperienced climber, but for the intermediate seeking to stretch their limits or the experienced climber looking to ply their craft, this is an outstanding compilation of climbs."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"This book is a great addition to any Colorado mountaineer's guidebook collection. Contains many little-known but interesting ridge routes, as well as some of the classics. Cooper's descriptions are easy to follow and the guidebook is well-formatted.Many other guidebooks concentrate only on the highest peaks or the most difficult technical routes. This guidebook focuses on \\"scrambles\\", i.e., off-trail routes of at least moderate difficulty, and ranging into some climbs that require ropework. Best of all, the featured routes have been selected for high quality and aesthetics."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"When my Colorado friends first showed me this book, I sat down and went through every page just admiring the color photography. If this wasn't a guidebook, it could make a great coffee table book! Not only are the photos exceptional, but they also help you visualize the difficulty level of many of the crux portions of each route.After my first pass through, I was also drooling about trying many of the routes described. There are some classic routes such as Sawtooth Ridge (between Mt. Evans and Mt. Bierstadt) and the Little Bear/Blanca traverse. Even these well-known routes came to life for me much better in this guidebook than any other I've seen.Many of the 50 climbs in this book are ones I'm not familiar with. (note: although I live in New Mexico, I do a fair amount of climbing in Colorado as well) I've climbed 2 of the routes in the book so far, and found the maps and descriptions to be right on the money. My climbing partners have climbed about a dozen of the climbs, and agree that this is an excellent guide to all of them. They especially liked the inclusion of GPS waypoints for some of the routes where route finding is a particular problem.If you have solid experience with moderate climbing and are ready for some wonderful new challenges, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"It is refreshing to read a quality guide book that goes beyond the typical 14,000 ft. peak list. While they are useful many of us want new ideas on lesser known peaks and routes. It was interesting to read the exchange about the definition of a scramble. I started climbing in 1974 and I understand and agree with David's assessment. More importantly the book is well organized and the ratings are consistent.

My kudos to Dave on this book."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"This is a good book, particularly for those people who are experienced climbers and interested in many of Colorado's lesser known peaks. For these people, they will love this book and look beyond the book's faults. When I first inspected this book, I didn't hesitate to buy it.Now, you will note many reviews on May 11 and May 12, 2006, some of whom criticize Martian Bachelor's review. These reviewers, as it turns out, were encouraged by one of the author's friends to submit reviews. Take their reviews in the vain of \\"a friend of the author.\\"As for Martian Bachelor's review, some of his points are not without merit. His point about the title and the treatment of the classification of the routes is reasonable. Gerry Roach has set the standard for rating climbs within Colorado through his very popular guide books. In Roach's first 14er book, Roach states, \\"Class 3 is the easiest climbing category, and people usually call it scrambling,\\" and \\"Class 4 and Class 5 are in the realm of technical climbing.\\" As such, a more appropriate title for the book would have been, \\"Colorado Scrambles and Climbs: A Guide to 50 Select Routes in Colorado's Mountains.\\" Not much doubt about what this book entails with that title in view of Roach's well-read books.Given \\"most\\" people who climb own at least one copy of a Roach book, it would have been nice, if not appropriate, if the author would have recognized the classification standards adopted by Roach, if for no other reason people have become familiar with these \\"YDS\\" standards. Class 3, 4, and 5 mean something to people in Colorado.To be fair to the author, though, rating peaks is tough, and it is often difficult to distinguish between a class 3 and class 4 route. Perhaps this is why the author rated climbing routes as 1, 2, and 3, and did not faithfully rate routes to the degree Roach rates his routes. On occasion the author rates routes as class 3 or 4, but many route descriptions lack a class 3 or 4 rating altogether.However, this book will be greatly appreciated by the experienced climber who perhaps doesn't need or even desire the breath-by-breath route rating that a Roach guidebook provides.This a good work and it fills a niche in Colorado mountaineering. Nonetheless, you can notice a difference between this work and a Roach work. Those interested in climbing, however, will easily look beyond the book's faults and be excited by the routes reviewed."},{"Title":"Colorado Scrambles: A Guide to 50 Select Climbs in Colorado's Mountains (Colorado Mountain Club Classics)","review":"I've been climbing in CO for 30+ yrs and had done part or all of 7-8 of these routes before getting the book, so I think I'm in a good position to review it. In short, I'd like my $$'s back.My biggest problem is with the title. The term \\"scrambling\\" has a fairly well-defined meaning in climbing jargon. Namely, it refers to Third Class climbing where no rope is needed, except perhaps as a backup for emergency use or if one is climbing solo and wants an extra margin of safety. But only seven of the routes in this book are rated Third Class. The other 43 are Fourth and Fifth Class routes. Yes, some are capable of doing such climbs without a rope, but that doesn't make them nonchalant scrambles. While a book filled with the many excellent Third Class climbs available in CO would be a welcome addition, this certainly isn't it. If you don't have rope, harness, protection, helmet, ice ax, and possibly crampons, you probably don't want this book.Related to this is the author's invention of yet another difficulty rating system. Don't ask me why. This is a number which runs for one to three. Even though not stated explicitly, you take the author's number and add two to it to get back to the standard class rating. Standards exist for a reason and people should use them. Actually the author does use the standard in the text, making it a puzzle why one would want to confuse things with a second difficulty rating.I also had a gripe and a warning about one particular rating. This concerns the Kelso Ridge on Torreys, a very well-travelled mountain. The author gives it a 2, which means a Fourth Class rating. I would hate for anyone who does this relatively easy Third Class route with only one short slightly difficult section (near the top) to think that they could then go and do, say, Ice Mtn or Pilot Knob because they're in the same class. When you read the text you realize that the author's rating is a result of having done it in late March when new snow added to the difficulty.I might also mention the choice of peaks in the book seemed to be based on no rationale other than that the author liked the climb. There are some very popular climbs (like The Maroon Bells and The Crestones) sprinkled in with some very out-of-the-way obscure (at least to me) peaks.Next issue: picture captions. While photos can be a great addition to a book like this, they need to have good captions in order to justify the amount of text which has to be left out to make room for them! Otherwise one doesn't really know where the picture was taken or exactly what one is looking at. While in most cases this rule is followed, too often the captions were something ambiguous/obvious like \\"entering the gully\\". (Like how many gullies are there an any given mountain typically?) In other words, I found myself going back and forth from the photos to the text trying to figure things out -- which is the author's job. In one case I swear the order of the photos was scrambled. I'd rather have more text than pointless photos.Last issue: the book is littered with errors. The last page contains an Errata, but even casual study will turn up many more errors. (Why not *fix* the errors before printing, rather than putting them in an Errata? The mountains will still be there next week or month...) There are places where the text refers you, puzzlingly, to a page that has to do with an entirely different climb.A final note regarding the GPS data: I haven't checked the numbers to see if they're accurate, but I did look at enough routes to puzzle over why certain waypoints were chosen and not others. Frankly, the choices often seemed haphazard. In addition, many of the routes are only sparsely covered, with but 3 or 4 waypoints (while others have a dozen). So while the GPS data is an addition, it's a slight one and not enough to overcome the many other downsides.To summarize, I found this book a big disappointment. Maybe a later edition will correct many of its faults, but consider buying it then only if you can afford the price to get a little bit of helpful info on a couple of routes of interest."},{"Title":"Interior Divine: Walking You Through the Transformation of Your Home","review":"As a frequent reader of home design books and magazines, the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me. A quick review of the table of contents revealed that I had to have this book. Pelosi begins with the basics, moves into specifics, and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor.

Her Interior Divine is not just inspiring and filled with good ideas, it arms you with what you need to know to actually take the next steps to a better home. And with Jayne's guidance, the concept of home is not just a pretty picture ripped from a magazine, but a place that supports you and energizes you. My favorite parts of the book deal with Feng Shui, a philosophy many of us have heard about but don't know how to implement in our own spaces.

Then I came here and saw a couple of negative reviews and thought I really wanted to put my two cents in.Mary Rose Occhino presents, in this book, convincing evidence of the reality of psychic phenomena. There are a couple of reviews here that dismiss her gift as hallucinations or coincidence. Those comments miss the mark entirely. They could be made only by folks who are so hostile to the concept of psychic phenomena that they resist all evidence.If these reviewers have proof that Ms. Occhino is a hoaxer, then, by all means, let them present their proof.Absent proof, they are just blowing smoke.Again, a couple of reviews dismissed the book as being poorly written.Well, one reader's pleasure is another reader's bore.I enjoyed this book. Ms. Occhino writes as what she is: a New York area, ethnic woman from a working class, immigrant background. Her voice is authentic, and an authentic part of the American pageant. This isn't James Joyce, but then many of us don't want to read James Joyce everyday.I felt very comfortable reading Ms. Occhino's prose. Her style can be compared to the style of a letter from a good, old girlfriend. There are family tragedies and triumphs, bouts with serious illness, trips to Catholic Church, and the occasional celestial gift.I was thinking of buying a copy of this book for a young friend who is just now discovering her own psychic powers and struggling with dealing with them.

All these other Amazon readers have given this a 5-star rating, I was not that thrilled with this book, to be honest, I found her stories utterly dull and her writing style not captivating at all. If you love reading books on psychics and have read several, this book will not impress you, it seems so centered on 'gut feelings' which we all have, and drawn out (frankly boring) stories about her mother, grandmother and children. I felt my mind wandering as I reaad this book and several times I had to stifle a yawn. Like one reader, I read this in almost one sitting, but just because I wanted to finish it and begin reading a more interesting book. The reason I gave this 2 stars as opposed to one is that Ms Occhino does come acorss as a very sincere, warm person even though her writing sytle and her stories leave a lot to be desired. Ms Occhino also states that people have to inherit their psychic powers and these can never be developed, only intuitive powers can be, sorry, but I beg to differ.

Again the Word series has given the Christian community the best Christian book on the market. Grant centers in on three primary forms of family violence: spousal, child, and elder abuse. Though the standard description of the problem is outlined in every chapter, Grant delineates many helpful hints in counseling that other books fail to cover in much depth. He is very complete about the various options available in resolving family disputes and violence.Like all the books that I have read in the Word series, Grant seems to favor the cognitive-behavioral approach to treatment. And since he believes that everyone is a victim and that low self-esteem is the primary culprit, Grant also includes a chapter about treating men who batter, something few other books do. His chapter on the evaluation and treatment of the sexually abused child offers some very helpful hints, but like any book that attempts to survey so much, many will find his comments sometimes not in enough depth. This is especially true on his short chapter on elder abuse.-- Journal of Psychology and Theology, 1988, Summer, 16 (2), 196."},{"Title":"Tourism, Ethnicity, and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies","review":"After \\"The Tourist\\", by Dean MacCannell and Valene Smith's edited book titled \\"Hosts and Guests\\", in the mid-1970s, the field of the Anthropology of Tourism was flung wide open. A large number of writers focussed their attention on this topic which rapidly increased in importance. In this \`new wave' of anthropological writing, Picard and Wood's edited volume on tourism, ethnicity and the state in various societies in Asia and the Pacific stands out for its quality. Wood's introduction is followed by seven well-written, informative chapters, each written by different authors. There are a number of maps, charts, and even black and white photographs, all of which enhance the text. The areas covered by the book include Guizhou in southwestern China, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Bali and Sulawesi Selatan in Indonesia, and Hawai'i /Western Samoa. The authors chose their own directions and followed their own interests, but unlike many other such compilations that I have read, this one really hangs together in excellent fashion.In China, Singapore and Indonesia, \\"ethnic tourism\\" both reflects state policy towards national ethnic groups and is used by the state to further policy. Tourist development does not operate outside state controls, so we read about showcase visions of ethnic diversity in which ethnicity itself is commodified according to government guidelines. In Bali, tourism has become so much part of the culture that it can no longer be considered an outside force. The author can write of the \\"culturalization\\" of Balinese society in which the arts emphasized by cultural tourism have become crucial to Balinese identity. In Thailand, neglect of national minorities and their culture reflects the state policy of trying to \`iron out' differences between small ethnic groups and the large Thai majority (to the detriment of the former). The Malaysian case reflects not so much on ethnic policy in the country as on using tourism and tourist \`precincts' to foster a particular view of national history and culture. The study of Hawai'i and Samoa may be the most diffuse of the seven, plus, the capitalist environment of the \\"50th State\\" precludes the state interference found in China and parts of Southeast Asia. Thus this final chapter does not mesh so neatly with the others, yet the author also introduces useful points to show how tourism is intimately linked with ethnicity and how the state used a certain image to foster both tourism and domestic harmony (despite the patent untruth of that image). In short, this is a most useful book for those interested in the anthropology of tourism, in politics (state interference in tourism, state manipulation of ethnic images, ethnic rivalries over tourism receipts), and in the constant revision of what \\"culture\\" and \\"history\\" really mean in any one society. If I were teaching a course that touched on any of these issues, I would definitely use this book. If I were writing a paper on some aspect of tourism, I would have no qualms about turning to this book for its excellent case studies."},{"Title":"A Vittorini Omnibus: In Sicily, the Twilight of the Elephant, La Garibaldina: In Sicily and Other Novels (New Directions Books)","review":"ELIO VITTORINI IS A NOVELIST WHO WRITES LIKE A GOOD POET.

But there are better books out there with more descriptions on the subject than this.. I only bought this because it was required reading for a class."},{"Title":"Ghost","review":"For a book written in 1984, it sure was a captivating read. I found the story excellent. It took me a bit of time to figure out the heaven and hell characters, but their roles in the story played out well. I may read it again sometime soon just to get a better hold on their battle, which probably had a much deeper meaning.This book had just the right mix of spiritual, racial, gender, love, trust, parenthood, youth, old age, heaven and hell, and of course a Ghost.I'm sure that someone involved in the movie Ghost, which came out around 1990, must've read this book to get their initial idea.What I found interesting were the relationships of the characters. There's much conflict and change going on in the families of the White Ghost and the little Black boy who befriends the ghost. It takes the love between family members to bring about the success of the story.To have a ghost narrate to you about what it feels like to be dead does get a bit spooky. The ghost, being a writer in his earth life, has the skill to describe his after death existence in a way the reader finds believable and captivating. Constantly while reading this book I found myself putting my being in the ghost's position. What if I'd died and had to watch my ex-wife and family move on with their lives without me. Cut off from any form of contact with them. Anger may drive you to haunt the living as you become an introverted unhappy entity without a home and no future to think of. What would you do?The child's role in this book was perfect. A child with a gift. Reminds me of a biblical quote which says \\"In order to enter the kingdom of heaven we must become as children.\\" Yes, it took a child to see what adults were unable or too busy to see. And it took a wise old man to help prepare that child for the day when he'd need to use his special gift.Not a lot of excitement, or at least the type of haunting and ghostly excitement you'd expect in a book about a ghost. It's not just your typical ghost story. It's just as much a philosophical/metaphysical journey down a mysterious path as it is a horror/ghost story. A thinking person's ghost story maybe. The author does an excellent job in giving us one possibility of what comes after life.I almost forgot to mention the humor written effortlessly into this story. The author has the ghost talk intimately with the reader about his dilemma and if the reader's mind can respond to the nifty flow of dialogue, then the story becomes alive. I really couldn't put this book down. It was a quick 283 pages that I couldn't guess what would happen and didn't want it to end. It would take Hollywood to screw up this story and make it something of a tear jerker. Fortunately for the movie Ghost, it had a love story, comedy, good special effects and a great soundtrack. Where as this book had a real ghost, a gifted child and a struggle between good and evil. A very good read indeed."},{"Title":"I'm Telling You for the Last Time","review":"this is the funniest thing i have ever heard. seinfeld is hilarious. he speaks the truth, and he still makes everything sound so funny. if the cd, of the same name, is anything like this then it should sell real well. this is great. and only $9.58. you should definitly check this one out."},{"Title":"I'm Telling You for the Last Time","review":"I am not a huge fan of the Seinfeld shows, but I have seen quite a few.

The films are known for being breezy and comedic rather than for the actual plot, which typically involves a murder mystery. The original novel The Thin Man is certainly of this mold, which for some might be perfect but for others (like me) a bit disappointing.In The Thin Man we have our handsome couple tinkling champagne glasses in 1930s Manhatten. Our reluctant detective is asked to sort out some shenanigans of a former client, and his very dysfunctional family. We are entertained by cameo appearances of thugs, crooks, and Asta (the family dog). It is all very cutsie without being too silly. However fans of other private detective novels of that genre, especially the Philip Marlowe stories by Raymond Chandler, will find The Thin Man to be too ... thin. No sparkling dialogue, no real nasty characters, ... no \\"oomph\\".Bottom line: painless reading. But see the film, forget the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"For Nick Charles life has become a comfortable routine of running his wife, Nora's, inherited businesses, social gatherings, and stock market investments. Waiting for Nora to return from a Christmas shopping trip he enjoys a drink in a local bar where he is reacquainted with Dorothy, daughter of an old client, Clyde Miller Wynant, who she claims has disappeared and is under suspicion of murdering his assistant. So Nick Charles is reluctantly drawn back into his earlier profession as a private investigator.All is not as it seems, and Nick Charles discovers that Clyde Miller Wynant has been murdered by his attorney, who, in consort with Wynant's ex-wife, is out to lay claim to the Wynant fortune.Dashiell Hammett's writing skills are terribly stretched in what should really been a short story in order to avoid the relentless vapidity of the first 120 pages, after which the story springs to life when the Nick Charles character breaks away from the tiresome and trivial spats between various members of the Wynant household. The book's ending was also pretty dismal, with a kind of tacked on piece to help explain how conclusions were arrived at.As Nora says in the last line \`...it's all pretty unsatisfactory.'The Thin Man is regarded by many commentators as Dashiell Hammett's worst book. And it is. A shame, since the story is intriguing, but too poorly executed to extend its appeal beyond the hardcore fen."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"One of the things about coming to the crime fiction scene so late in my life is that I know the clich&eacute;s before I actually get to their origin point. The same is true for films, too. When I finally saw \\"Casablanca\\" in my 24th year of life, I was amazed at how many phrases/scenes were originally from that movie. It was fun but it lost a little because I had seen cartoon characters utter certain lines for laughs, not human characters saying those lines like they meant it.When I first decided to read Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man, I knew enough of the book to know that the stars of the show were Nick and Nora Charles. I am a child of the 1980s. As such, certain things are ingrained in my head and I bring them to every new adventure I go on. With The Thin Man, \\"Moonlighting\\" and \\"Hart to Hart\\" were the things that moved past Star Wars miscellanea and rare music trivia to set up shop at the forefront of my brain. There they sat, ready to divulge some little chunk of knowledge that might prove useful with my new book.Honestly, I was disappointed. With those two TV shows in my head--and the relationship between the respective couples active in my memory--I read The Thin Man waiting for the book to be like those shows I remembered. It didn't happen. Granted, the book was published in 1934, but I expected a little more involvement from Nora. There are large chunks of the book where she's relegated to their hotel room while Nick, the former PI, goes off and solves the case. True, Nick and his cop pal, Guild, go to places a socialite like Nora wouldn't want to go to, but still, I'd have thought she'd be in more scenes. And take a look at that cover. Glamor and intrigue ooze from the cover painting. Didn't find much in the prose.The story itself is light but not in a bad way. Much of the action is relayed to Nick or Nora by other characters telling a story. As a modern writer whose mantra is \`show don't tell,' some of the scenes were annoying. The dialogue between Nick and Nora was fun and the reader, William Dufris, does a remarkable job of speaking in multiple female voices.Another preconceived notion I had going in was a direct result of an earlier Hammett novel, Red Harvest. In that novel, much blood is shed. I kind of expected some more blood but I guess The Thin Man was something of a cozy in hard-boiled clothing."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Having come off of reading Maltese Falcon and watching the Thin Man movie, I had high expectations for the book. Unfortunately I found it extremely dull, and the characters Nick and Nora, who are so vibrant and alive on screen, are two dimensional alcoholic drips on paper. It took a lot of time to get through this book, and in the end, I didn't care what happened. Although the movie doesn't have much of a plot, it is far more entertaining than the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the first novel I have ever read where I cared nothing at all about any of the characters(excepting Asta, the dog). I actually wished, while slogging through, that all of the characters would die so that I could stop reading.None of the characters feel real and the prose itself is choppy. I realize that I'm looking at this novel through modern eyes, which is unfair, but it seemed that all the women do is cry, lie, and answer the phone, which grates on my nerves.If it weren't required for school, I would have been done with this book two pages in. Save your money."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is the last novel from the creator of the crime novel, Dashiell Hammett. This is my first Hammet book, and I have to admit that the mystery--the assistant to an eccentric and missing inventor is murdered--wasn't what kept me turning the pages of this book. (Or rather, hitting the forward button on my Kindle.) As I read, what I liked most was Hammett's crisp portrayal of the times in the ways his characters spoke and acted. For example, in a time of prohibition, the characters, especially the main characters, Nick Charles and his wife, seemed to be drinking all the time. And there's also a light, but easy misogyny, representative of the times, but probably something that will seem a little off for most modern readers.Nick is the main character, a former detective who tries just as hard to avoid getting involved in the case as others try to bring him in. But he's living the high-life, not working, living off his investments during a depression, and he doesn't seem to want to ruin that. His obstinacy and sharp tongue provide for many funny moments, and also serve as highlights in the book.In fact, I almost found this more of a comic novel, with an edge satirical of the times, rather than a crime novel. I haven't read any of his other novels, so can't compare to determine if this one book was an exception, but I think most modern readers looking for a crime novel, with their tastes shaped by our modern penchant for more intense suspense and plenty of violence, will find this book too tame to satisfy. But if you want a short and funny look at a chaotic and vastly different time in our history, this might do it for you."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Maltese Falcon is like film noir fine wine; The Thin Man is the hangover. This was Dashiell Hammet's last novel and it's apparent he was tired. But that's not a knock.The story starts off noir-ish enough: a woman approaches a detective about a murder case. But then you realize the main character Nick wants nothing to do with the case and is seemingly dragged in. He needs alcohol to even function around everyone. He's tired, knows the game and just wants to rest.There's a four page story about cannibalism that stops the plot; incest is randomly mentioned. This is unlike anything any other author has attempted in noir. Facetious? Yes. Boring? Nope. The random subjects touched upon suggest a deeper, darker meaning. And I've yet to mention the scumbag character Mimi and her pesky games. It's obvious Hammet cynically cackled writing portions of this book.Sadly, many people find fault trying to read this as straight noir. For that, check out Hammet's other novels. Ideally, a reader will ponder what they think are flaws in this story (maybe Nora's underdeveloped character?) and ponder if Hammet had hidden meaning in it (statement about marriage?). I still don't know what Hammet's exact meaning is with this book. Though, the deeper I go, the better it gets."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I know I'm in the minority in this, but I liked this book much better than The Maltese Falcon! I really enjoyed it.Nick Charles is a newly married former private detective who gets pulled into a murder/missing person case unwillingly. He has no choice because the people connected with the case will not leave him alone.His wife Nora doesn't seem to mind - she is fascinated by the case and helps as much as possible. Nora was impressive; a great female lead. Nothing seems to rattle her.(I gotta say, the family under investigation in this book is completely CRAZY. Rarely have I met a weirder bunch of people. Kooky and entertaining.)"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the book the first movie is based on. Also some of the scenes were used in later movies. The book is a lot more serious, hinting at relationships that would never be allowed on the big screen's version of the story. While some things are funny it isn't really a comedy like the movies were. The characters are crisp, realistic, and sometimes people you would never wish to run into in a dark alley.On the other hand it did seem to drag just a tad. I think it is because there were scenes in the book that were never in the movie, giving it a feel that suggested it was being padded, which it was not. The movie was edited heavily when compared to the book, so if you enjoyed the movie you may feel the book is slow.I would suggest reading the book first and then, if you wish, watching the films.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was my second Hammett read after the Maltese Falcon, and the contrast was impressive. While the former book was dark and mysterious, the Thin Man had a lighter feel, an aloofness which attests to the author's changed life circumstances. Yet while some fans of the earlier style may find this disappointing, it's important to judge each work on its own merits and in the contextual frame of the time and world in which it was written. And with this view, The Thin Man clearly deserves five stars.As a pure mystery, it was solid: the reader has a chance to guess \\"whodunnit\\" based clues. But the real value goes well beyond the plot. The Thin Man provides a window into its time, the Great Depression following the social liberation of the preceding decade.It's a little bit sad that this was Hammett's final novel, as he is clearly one of the great writers of his time. Indeed he even appeared to have difficulty getting this one out: more time had passed since the publication of The Glass Key than it had taken him to write all of his preceding four novels. But maybe it's better his work was so reserved: compare with many modern mystery riders who turn the crank one or two times per year, year after year, producing story after story with the same characters and style. That Hammett was able to produce works of such contrast within the genre of detective fiction is a testimony to his talent, and to the importance of each. I'll certainly read them all."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The last of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, THE THIN MAN seems lighter, more superfluous, than the other two I have read, THE MALTESE FALCON and THE DAIN CURSE. Perhaps. But Hammett's name is almost synonymous with crime noir. Even his lighter work reveals something much darker than might be apparent at first glance.Nick and Nora Charles, the detectives introduced here, are markedly different than Hammett's other creations. Elegant in a way that the Continental Op could never be, superfluous in a way that would make Sam Spade sneer, they are an insufferably smug couple that are at times rather difficult to like. They spend whatever free time they have drinking and socializing and seeming oh so important.In New York on vacation, the couple is pressed into service by an old friend to look for a missing man. They enter, or perhaps merely describe, a world of moral vacuity for which Hammett was, and still is, so well known. The lies, evasions and apathy of almost everyone in the book are universal. Underneath the light banter and eternal cocktail hour, Hammett presents a view of the upper crust as having a beautiful veneer as thin as cigarette paper which, when torn away, reveals the dark underbelly of contempt towards anyone outside of their own little circle.Although I liked THE THIN MAN, I am also glad that Hammett did not use Nick and Nora for any of his other novels (I have read many of Hammett's stories and do not recall seeing them in any; if they are, they are not major figures in Hammett's canon). Like a strange label of beer that I can enjoy for a bottle, but which becomes distasteful after two, the Charles are an interesting pair to be sparingly sampled."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Back in the days when a cigarette wasn't the cinematic equivalent of a black hat and when real men had scotch for breakfast, Nick and Nora Charles enthralled Depression-era America with their witty repartee, beautiful clothes, and glamorous parties. And with their idleness - they didn't work! All this wealth but no work! All they did was drink, sleep, throw parties and solve the occasional crime.The book is clipped and breezy. Nick is economical in his words, not least because talking slows down his drinking. (Reporter: Say listen, is he working on a case? Nora Charles: Yes, he is. Reporter: What case? Nora Charles: A case of scotch. Pitch in and help him. ) There are frequent asides, the hard-boiled detective equivalent of \`yadda, yadda, yadda,' to skim over the pleasantries and glad handing that consume so much dialog in books and movies.\\"The Thin Man,\\" like the movies that followed it, is heavy on style and that makes it a pleasant read. As a book its aims are modest, its execution is excellent, and you just enjoy the journey from mysterious murder to having everything neatly wrapped up, courtesy of your tour guide to both the under and over worlds of New York, Nick Charles.Watch also \\"After The Thin Man,\\" which is the tenth best mystery/detective film set in San Francisco and the second best of the Thin Man series of movies (based on my analysis as a reader/watcher of San-Francisco based noir/detective books and movies)."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"There are three things that stand out about this novel in the 21st century:1. Liquor is the glue that seems to hold all the relationships together; it's always easy to be charming when everyone is \\"tight\\" with alcohol.2. The word \\"tight\\" has certainly evolved away from its meaning in this book, and it took me a couple of times seeing the context to realize what it meant.3. Hammett does not pretty over anything. All the foibles and faces of the various characters are there to see, making them far more realistic... and tragic than so many characters in the novels and mysteries of today.I highly recommend this short novel to anyone who's heard of the old 1930's mystery noir but not read Hammett or Chandler."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This fast-paced mystery by Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) plays out with humor and suspense. Nick Charles is a hard-drinking and hard-bitten ex-detective now living the high life of 1930's New York sophisticate with his wealthy wife Nora - whom he also teaches about the detective business. Despite their heavy drinking and cynicism, both remain decent persons. They are soon enlisted in the search for Clyde Wynant, a successful inventor who has disappeared. Did he vanish on his own or was he the victim of kidnapping or worse? A mysterious letter arrives and helps set the ball rolling. The mystery proceeds with a rapid mix of mystery, suspense and humor though the final pages.I liked THE MALTESE FALCON even more, but mystery fans won't go wrong with either of Hammett's most famous efforts."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Dashiell Hammett is perhaps better known for creating the classic modern prototypical detective, one Sam Spade the detective-hero (or anti-hero, if you prefer) of the literary noir Maltese Falcon. With the Thin Man he took a different tack in providing a model detective- the urbane Nick Charles, his side-kick society wife Nora and their ever present faithful dog companion, Asta. The story line here centers on a missing eccentric inventor/businessman who it is suspected has been a victim of foul play. Enter Nick, Nora and Asta at the request of his wondering society family (wondering, that is, about the fate of the dough necessary to keep them in their luxuries) and after a series of misadventures and false leads Nick grabs the villain. That is what old Nick has in common with the illustrious Mr. Spade-the dogged (not pun, intended) and tenacious search for the truth and the killer, come what may. If you like your detectives with a light touch this is for you. If you like your detective novels to be minor workS of literary art this is also for you. Hammett (along with Raymond Chandler) practically reinvented the previously rather shabby art of the early detective story into literature. Kudos."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"As the year 1932 draws to a close, Nick and Nora Charles of San Francisco are vacationing in Manhattan. Fabulously wealthy and as sophisticated as you can get, Nick and Nora are having a great time ordering up room service, receiving old friends, slumming in speakeasies and generally enjoying what New York has to offer.Before marrying Nora, Nick had been a private detective in New York and a fairly highly regarded one at that. One of his former clients, an eccentric inventor named Clyde Wynant, has been missing since early October and Nick is called upon to assist the police in finding him. The case starts to get complicated when Wynant's secretary is murdered.Helping round out the cast of characters are Wynant's boisterous ex-wife Mimi, his daughter Dorothy who happens to have a crush on Nick, and his son Gil, a very weird young man to be sure.Of the five full length novels completed by Dashiell Hammett, The Thin Man is far and away the one with the most humor running through it. And that is mainly a result of the sophisticated repartee that takes place between the urbane Mr. Charles and his equally witty spouse.As is the case with all of Hammett's fiction, The Thin Man is writtten using very strong sentence structure that makes for smooth reading. Moreover, the plot is solidly constructed and Nick and Nora are both delightfully entertaining characters. The Thin Man very much deserves its place among the classics of American fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"When I see a film based on a novel, I like to read the novel to compare plots and execution. Most of the time the novel or story is fuller than the movie due to the short media time and the target audience. In this case, the novel does have a better-developed plot and is more cohesive. The characters are more true to form and there is a real Rosewood/Rosebrien. However, the book characters are more sinister and Dorothy is sleazy. I planed to make this the last story I would read by Dashiel Hammett. However, others tell me I just picked the wrong one to start with.The film on the other hand, was modified to give a lighter approach. It is the film that I will think of as the real \\"Thin Man\\" and Maureen O'Sullivan as the real Dorothy that was concerned about her father. Speaking about that, what is the Sullivan act?The Thin Man Starring: William Powell, Myrna Loy"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"If you ever saw the movie The Thin Man starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, then you already know the basic story. It's the worst part of the Depression and Nick and Nora are a fabulously wealthy couple living in San Francisco. For business reasons, they are spending Christmas in New York City where Nick was once a first-class detective. Clyde Wynant, a man that Nick once helped, is missing and his daughter Dorothy (played by Maureen O'Sullivan in the movie) asks Nick to help find him. Nick isn't anxious to get back in the detective game (although Nora wants to see him in action) but when Clyde Wynant's secretary (who is also his lover) is killed and Wynant is suspected, Nick is dragged into the investigation.All the players are here, Mimi Jorgenson, Wynat's ex-wife who is desperately in need of money; Chris Jorgenson, Mimi's current husband; Dorothy and Gilbert Wynant, Wynant's two grown-up children; John Guild, the police detective stuck with this baffling case; Herbert MacCaulay, Wynant's lawyer; Nick Morelli the gangster and speakeasy owner; and Arthur Nunheim, the police stool pigeon and blackmailer. The problem is that none of these characters are in the least bit likable which makes it hard to care about them or even care if Wynant is found. Unlike the movie, Dorothy is a floozy who drinks too much, Mimi beats her children, and Gilbert is beyond eccentric and is simply unbelievable. And the book drags on with side steps into discussions of cannibalism, for example, that really have no point nor do they move the story along.But the main failure of the book is in failing to do what the movie does best... make a couple of Nick and Nora. There is no Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson feel in the book. Nora mostly hangs around comforting Dorothy and keeping Mimi from smacking poor Dorothy around. When the killer is revealed and the case solved, Nora isn't even around... she's back at the hotel. Rarely is a movie better than the book it is based on (Jaws come to mind) but this is one book that is poor compared to the movie. I should add that the book has a gratuitous use of the n-word and stereotypes lesbians as man-haters which made me like the book even less. Yes, I know the book was written in the 30's but still it grates on the modern reader and probably quite a few readers even back in the 30's."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Good book, bad recording.Ever hear Firesign Theatre's \\"Nick Danger\\" episodes, where male actors do the Femme Fatale's voice in falsetto? This recording is exactly the same. Unfortunately, here we are supposed to take the characters seriously. The unintentional humor lasts about five minutes, after which I turned it off and listened to Firesign.The contrast between the realistic male narrator's voice and the absurd falsetto of the females creates a jarring disconnect. Although I did finally listen to all six disks, I never really lost myself in the narrative.Next time, how about just reading the story?"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"What do I love about this book? Let's see: the dialog, the story, the pacing, the characters, the rivers of booze, the gangsters, the weirdos, the Big Apple, the double meaning of the title, the breezy way it all goes down... A timeless classic. I just wish Hammett had been a little more prolific."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"For those of you who allow amature reviewers to guide your reading decisions, know this: Those reviews that talk about the book as being about a \\"destructive relationship\\" and the characters of Nick and Nora Charles as the user and the willing usee have made the mistake of not reading the actual text on the page, but instead have tried to apply some late-twentieth century literaty criticism, which they don't fully know how to apply, paired with the social-moral attitides toward blatant alcoholism and frivolity, to a book that is simply what it purports to be: a detective novel with imperfect characters and a perfectly logical final twist. If they find Nick Charles to be a violent womanizer, one can only imagine what they have made of Chandler's Marlowe . . . although I wouldn't be surprised to find similarly misinformed opinions of those books by the same reviewers if I could be bothered to look for them."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"If you've never read a detective novel, this is a terrific place to start. If you happen to be a seasoned veteran of the genre, you'll find yourself remembering why you started loving detective novels in the first place. The precise, well-crafted plot, lively pace, and vibrant characters help make this underappreciated work a classic."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I imagine for people way into the detectival genre, this is not the book for them. However, the characters in this book are a hoot!! Nobody's telling anyone the whole truth, no one is sure who they can trust. The mystery, as with everything else in this novel, is a bit bizarre, but I think the important part of this book is the characterization. The Wynants/Jorgensons are all nuts. Many of the men are womanizers and boozers. And then there's Nick and Nora. They are one of the most fun couples I've read about. You get the impression that Nora doesn't know much about Nick's past (and really doesn't care). Nick is a good deal older than her, but she has money, so that's all that matters. They are probably the best part of this book. Overall, it is just a fun book to spend an evening with."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"... and intelligent detective work to boot. Nick Charles is teaching his lovely bride Nora about the detective business while on a Christmas vacation in the Big Apple as he gets involved with some old friends. It seems the Thin Man, an eccentric inventer named Clyde Wynant is acting in suspicious ways after his secretary (or is it lover?) is murdered. Equally goofy are his ex-wife and children. This book will entertain and reads very quickly. I can't wait to see the movie and compare it."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book really disappointed. I was looking forward to some clever hard-boiled detective, like Hammett's Sam Spade or Continental Operative. What I got instead was ex-detective Nick Charles, who is medium-boiled, at best.Nick Charles quit the detective game when he married the wealthy Nora, instead managing their (her) fortune and spending most days sleeping late, attending and hosting cocktail parties with the rich, going to all-night clubs, and coming home drunk in the wee hours. While on a trip to New York City he happens to meet up with the 20-year-old daughter of a former client, who of course needs his help. She just wants to find her father, whom she has not seen in many years.Then her father's secretary is found dead, and the father cannot be located (although he keeps sending notes to people). It turns out that nobody has seen the father for several months, except, possibly, the secretary. Several suspects emerge, most notably the missing man and members of his dysfunctional family.The Thin Man contains echoes of Hammett's razor-sharp dialogue, but it seems unnatural for a character who spends most days drinking and socializing with the wealthy. The suspects may be neurotic and slightly immoral, but they are not the street-smart toughs of Hammett's other books. Even the body count pales in comparison, and Nick is in danger only once, almost by accident. And the most disheartening element of all: I anticipated the ending about half-way through.This was Hammett's last novel, even though he lived almost 25 more years. And it was first published, not as a \\"pulp mystery,\\" but as a serial in Redbook, of all places (essentially a woman's magazine). This was in 1933 during the Depression, so maybe he really needed the money. No one knows, even those closest to him, why he never wrote another mystery.The one aspect of this novel that stands out for me is the alcohol use. Nick and Nora have a drink or two, \\"to cut the phlegm,\\" before breakfast. Every time anyone shows up, including the police, they all have drinks. They have drinks with lunch; they have cocktails in the afternoon, they have drinks with late suppers; they go out to late-night clubs and have many, many drinks. I have read that Hammett was an alcoholic. If he drank only half as much as the fictional Nick Charles, it is no surprise that he had a problem.If you want to sample the origin of the hard-boiled detective story, read Red Harvest or The Maltese Falcon, not this one."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Forget those movies. They took a grimly funny novel about a group of predatory monsters and turned it into a series of light comedies. As splendid as William Powell and Myrna Loy are, they cannot hold a candle to the Nick and Nora portrayed in this novel.Hammett did not write a novel about a sophisticated couple who genteelly solve a murder while pouring cocktails and trading quips. He wrote a dark novel about an ex-detective who has married a wildly wealthy woman, and wants to spend the rest of his life managing her money. He is only faintly connected to the murders, having known the victim and his family briefly several years before, and wants nothing to do with the whole business. He is continually dragged in, however, and very nearly becomes a victim himself. Even a cursory reading of the novel should demonstrate that Hammett was up to much more than a series of one-liners with detective interruptions. Why else would Hammett, one of the most economical of authors, bring the novel to a halt to include a case history of Alfred Packer, the only American convicted of the crime of cannibalism?There is much more here than Hollywood, or anyone else that I know of, has yet realized."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I believe it was F. Scott Fitzgerald who once said, &quot;Hammett is one of those good writers ruined by Hollywood.&quot; This book shows Fitzgerald's quote in action.Don't misunderstand me, 'The Thin Man' is an excellent story. It's amuzing, tense, and contains possibly Hammett's most memorable characters, but it's also a complete departure from his previous novels. In a way, 'The Thin Man' is a farewell. Here we have a once hard-boiled detective, Nick Charles, who has settled down with his wise-cracking wife, Nora, and doesn't want anything to do with his previous work. Instead, Nick drinks, and drinks, and drinks, and goes to parties, and hosts parties, and the like. Whenever anyone questions Nick over the case that he's rumored to be working, Nick simply claims that he doesn't want anything to do with being a detective and leaves it at that.This being Hammett's final novel, I believe that it an all too valid assumption that Hammett was using the character of Nick to symbolize himself and his own mentality. To connect this with Fitzgerald's comment, following the publication of 'The Thin Man', some movie studio handed Hammett a check for something like $40,000 for use of the characters, cementing his literary decrepitude, and he never worked again.But it is a good read, very good, and while I would have liked to have given it the full five stars, i've chosen to remain with four, as 'The Thin Man' just doesn't compare with many of Hammett's other classics."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is one of the best crime novels ever written because it transcends the genre so beautifully, you won't even care about the mystery plot. The characters make it biting, strong and unforgettable, freaks and weirdos alike... Nick and Nora Charles are 2 of the most perfect literary creations in all of fiction. Hollywood cleaned them up a little and made them classy social lushes, but in their original written form, they're cynical, world weary wise acres. Their heavy drinking only adds to the book's appeal. Dashielle dedicated it to his long time love Lillian Hellman, as she, in turn, dedicated a few of her plays to him. The Maltese Falcon is the most famous of Hammett's works, The Daine Curse, his most complicated, Red Harvest, his most violent, The Glass Key, his most bitter. But the Thin Man is the most entertaining. You'll feel like reading it with a bottle of booze at your side."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Boy, these reviews are all over the place, aren't they! Well, they at least give you the plot so I don't have to. Here are some quick comments:There is so much going on in this book that most people miss much of it the first time (as these reviews show), especially if they don't know Hammett's life. As noted, Hammett modeled Nick and Nora on himself and his paramour, budding playwright Lillian Hellman, so it's interesting to see how he dealt in fiction with their relationship and his ultimate failure to cope with success.Yet, \\"The Thin Man\\" works - and works well - as a straight, hard-boiled detective novel, too (which is why none of the characters are particularly likeable). Also, Nora, one of the few, strong female detectives of the pulp magazine era, has inspired countless woman (including Myrna Loy) through the decades.Hammett's sparse style of writing, which many critics (including myself) think Hemingway merely popularized, revolutionized American literature. Each of Hammett's words had to do its part. Similarly, unlike those of earlier detective novels, Hammett's characters committed murder and other mayhem for actual reasons! The notion greatly affected Chandler, Macdonald, and all the others who toiled in the garden Hammett created. His books are all classics of American literature.Some of these reviewers have made too much of the \\"alcoholism\\" in the book. Fact is, a certain, large segment of society in the \`30s - products of Prohibition - did (or wanted to) drink the way the book's characters do and thought nothing of it. Basically, everybody drank in those days. Even the President of the United States had a bootlegger.To my mind, an alcoholic is a person who drinks because he or she _has_ to; these characters drink because they _want_ to. Those revisionist Puritan reviewers just don't understand the context of the drinking in \\"The Thin Man\\".Speaking of Puritans, the city of Boston banned \\"The Thin Man\\" upon release (thereby greatly increasing its sales) because Nora asks Nick if he got an erection while wrestling with one of the female characters. The word - heard without reaction on TV and in the movies these days - was simply too much for the city fathers. (\\"Just a little one\\" Nick answered, if memory serves.) The movie producers could not chance a similar ban on the movie so they cut a lot of the dark humor out of it but introduced Hammett to a lot of people over the world. The problems come when the viewers don't realize the book and the movies are two very different animals.I would love to see \\"The Thin Man\\" made into a movie now - when the producers would respect the work while employing fantastic production values. I'm sure they would remember that Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" did not succeed as a movie until the third try when new producer John Huston wisely utilized most of Hammett's cutting but sparkling dialogue.Hammett wrote five novels and, while they share similar traits, each one is different from the others and each one is an American classic. \\"The Thin Man\\" sees an older, wiser, possibly drunker, Hammett playfully poking fun at himself, Hellman, and the genre he mostly created while staying within the confines of that genre - a difficult trick. \\"The Thin Man\\", the most commercially successful of the five, can stand proudly next to its brothers. You'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"My first Dashiell Hammett book and after reading it I decided I'm hooked on his writing. The plot is tight no doubt, but the ending especially left me thoroughly impressed at the skillful crafting of the story. That aside, the playful banter between Nick and Nora Charles amused, and surely the dry wit of Nick will elicit a chuckle. Add to the whole mix a bunch of crazy characters like the Wynant family who can't seem to talk straight, and you get an absorbing whodunnit with a generous dose of humour."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder. Nick Charles, a retired detective, and his wife Nora find clues while helping a young girl named Dorothy through problems with her abusive mother and crazy suspect of a dad. As the story unfolds the situation turns out to be more complex than a single murder. There are many twists involving many characters that make the murder hard to solve.The characters are well-developed with depth and realistic personalities. Detective Charles sarcastic wit makes him a fun character through which to sift through all the information to solve the murder.Nevertheless the detail of information sifted through in the book can also make parts of the book a slow read. The author goes on large tangents that seem to detract from the story. For example at a party at the beginning of the book Nick is asked about cannibalism in America by a suspects child, Nick hands him a book which is then quoted at great length. Perhaps the author includes this to keep the reader guessing as to its relevance or as a device to show what people may do under extreme circumstances. Either way these side stories make the book drag at parts.Despite being slow in certain sections the character development and the way the author highlights the relevant pieces of information to solve the mystery is satisfying. If the mystery is like walking through a forest to identify which trees are needed to guide the reader through to the far side of the forest, the author describes in detail too many of the trees. Yet, at the end, it is fun when the detective highlights and connects the facts that are part of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a wonderful novel. Written in the classic Hammett style, the story is full of twists and turns of the interaction of well defined, recognizable characters.The central characters are Nick and Nora Charles. Nick has been a history as a successful private detective. Nora is a wealthy socialite. Together they are an intriguing and fun couple, who are forced into investigating the circumstance surrounding the mysterious death of a secretary and the unexplained disappearance of an eccentric,wealthy scientist.The story is so well crafted that everyone becomes a serious suspect and you are left chasing after each individual motive, trying to &quot;figure it out&quot; before the Charles' do.This novel is a classic from start to finish.If you have never watched the classic Black and White movie from the 1930's, THE THIN MAN, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, you have missed out on a treasure, although the book was better and more in-depth.The movie mirrors the book the closest of any I have seen. The reason, Dashiell Hammett was there to keep it true to the novel. Many of the delightful lines are directly out of the book!This is a grand and classic detective tale."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The last of Dashiell Hammett's novels was &quot;The Thin Man,&quot; and what a last novel it is. A hard-edged whodunnit, Hammett's writing had become very polished and his characters even more intricate by the time he wrote this, and while it's not the best he had written, it's a solid example of his work.Nick Charles was a rough'n'tough detective... until he married wealthy socialite Nora. Now he's retired early, drinks a lot, and has no apparent wish to come into contact with his messy past life. Enter Dorothy Wynant, daughter of weird (and possibly insane) inventor Clyde Wynant. As it happens, Wynant's secretary/mistress has just been murdered, and was found dying by his ex-wife Mimi.Nick keeps insisting that he doesn't want to detect, but somehow he gets sucked into it anyway when a gangster (ex-boyfriend of the murdered woman) invades his home and nearly kills him. Dorothy keeps popping up and pleading for help and protection; Charles' old flame Mimi is acting oddly; and her husband has some secrets of his own. Despite Nick's aversion to detective work, he and Nora set out to unravel the mystery surrounding the Thin Man. (Wynant, for your information)Hammett's cynical attitude was a huge part of his writing, but there's a new dimension to it in &quot;Thin Man.&quot; Charles spends a lot of time trying to distance himself from his detective past, and in a way it feels like Hammett was distancing himself from his detective novels. Was Nick's dissatisfaction a sign of Hammett's? Quite possibly.But many of the things about &quot;Thin Man&quot; are vintage Hammett: lying waifs, men in disguise, lots of lying and booze. Almost everyone is sociopathic, and Nick and Nora aren't exactly what one would call &quot;heroes.&quot; However, the dialogue is sharp and witty and the action is slickly exciting. Best of all, Hammett's writing had evolved a bit from his minimalist style; here he describes things like Mimi snarling in a bit more detail.Nick is the quintessential Hammett anti-hero (cynical, tough, and more than a little obnoxious), except here he's a bit weathered and tired out. Sam Spade and the Continental Op were on top of their games, but he's past his. Nora comes across as a little perkier but as tough in her own way. The crazy Wynant family, like manipulative mom Mimi and freaky son Gilbert, serves as a nice source of conflict.&quot;The Thin Man&quot; wasn't the best thing Hammett ever wrote, but it's still a solid mystery read. Pass the martinis."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I love Hammett's fat detective from Red Harvest, etc. but I think this is a wonderful story. The characterizations are razor sharp, the pacing incredible, and there are no false notes, for me at least, through many readings. In a fairly short novel with dozens of characters and settings this is remarkable. The Maltese Falcon is at the top of the genre, but I would put this one just behind. Great fun!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This may be a \\"detective novel,\\" but that's the least of it. The Thin Man is a statement of the good life, and included are plenty of style and sexiness. Nick and Nora Charles are the greatest, most reasonably decadent couple and the final, best commentary on the American high life that was thrown into such relief by the foil of Prohibition. Sure, there's a murder mystery, but there's also raw roast beef and onions, plenty of onions, from an all-night deli, washed down with perpetual scotch and soda. ... Dashiell Hammett wrote Nick Charles in order to be Dashiell Hammett: drunk, yes, but so what? Once great, always great, as long as you leave a legacy that people admire."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"It always saddens me to think that Hammett, who created hard-boiled literature with THE MALETESE FALCON and RED HARVEST, should close out his writing career with this polite fluff about a married couple solving a socialite murder. Chandler would years later praise Hammett as the man &quot;who gave murder back to people who had reason to committ it&quot;, but THIN MAN shows an unfortunate regression back to the old school that Hammett helped to eclipse. This is lightware fare, and nothing else."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I simply adore the movies... and while this novel had some of that panache, it is a much darker, harsher world.Is that disappointing? Well, yes."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Thin Man series of movies, so when I saw the book being offered I snapped it up. I found that the movie only slightly follows the book. The characters are there and some of the Nick and Nora relationship dynamics as well along with the basic plot but other than that there wasn't a lot of similarity. The humor that was such a wonderful part of the movies only occasionally shows up in the book. The witty dialog between Nick and Nora is pretty much absent as well. In short I was pretty disappointed. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Nick and Nora movies I would have enjoyed the book. If you like old detective stories you will probably enjoy it. My next stop is the Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett. I may not enjoy it as much as the movie, as in the case of the Thin Man, but who can resist reading the books that started such classic and enduring movies?"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I feel bad for writing this but: I didn't love The Thin Man. I wanted to, and Raymond Chandler did, and I love Raymond Chandler but...oh, I just couldn't.I thought the book was kind of repetitive. Oh, look, yet another morning when Nick wakes up and wants to down a bottle of hard liquor. What, another shady visitor thinks Nora's just a doll? Is that weepy girl really coming round again?I figured out who the villain was pretty quickly, and I never really attached to the characters. So yes, it's a fascinating period piece, and a good character study, but I don't think I'll be picking up another Dashiell Hammet anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"If you are looking for vintage, hard-boiled crime fiction this isn't it. While Hammett's talent is still evident, it is only wasted on this type of writintg. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book. It's just that the man who gave us The Continental Op and Sam Spade wrote this well after his writing had peaked. It is a very quick read because there isn't much to miss. Nick and Nora could best be described as one of the hardy boys marrying Nacy Drew, and then they become high society drunks who solve a mystery involving very one dimensional characters."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"\`The Thin Man' was Hammett's last novel. Unlike \`The Maltese Falcon' which had a mean and lean quality to it with characters you can't forget, his last novel seemed padded and most of his characters uninteresting. He wastes four and a half pages in telling the story of cannibalism in the old west. This would be a good technique if the story related to the current story. For example, if the story mentioned some treasure that disappeared and now people are getting killed because of the treasure. This is one of those rare times that I liked the movie rather than the novel.I gave \`The Thin Man' two stars. Even though I was disappointed with this novel, Hammett is still better than the people who try to imitate him. I guess that his time working as an operative for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency put a little edge in his writing. As a wanabe writer, I know you can do research and try to make things realistic, but if you have lived what you are writing about - you can put in all those little details that will let your readers know that you have \`street cred'"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Although this was the last novel completed by Hammett, he did live for over twenty-six more years until 1961. The story introduced the dashing couple Nick and Nora Charles who in some respects resembled Hammett and his long-time companion Lillian Hellman.If you entertain romantic notions about New York City in the 1930's, this will help you enjoy the book. However, you will have to cope with unceasing dialogue which is difficult to follow."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"There's always a problem with reading a book when you've already seen the movie version of it. You may be imagining characters that are different from the way they were described in the book - imagining dialog and nuances that just aren't in the book - and remembering scenes that you liked better the way they were in the movie.Those are all problems that I dealt with when I was reading this book. Not only have I previously seen The Thin Man (starring the ever-so-classy William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles) - I grew up watching it. I have probably seen it a hundred times.While I did my best to just say that this is a totally different experience and I should try to forget the movie while I read it - I spent a lot of time involuntarily judging the book against the movie. I couldn't help it.Well, if you're a fan of the movie, let me just say this: the book is a lot more raw than the film.The plot is essentially the same. Some minor details are changed. Some scenes take place in different places than in the film, and some characters are slightly different, or important for different reasons.But in the book, there is \\"language\\" (in the sense that censors use the term), implications of sexuality and more violence. The character of Dorothy Wynatt (who is essentially a heroine in the film) is definitely not so heroic in this. Nick is still smart and suave, but he's a little less classy than in the film.There is also a long, inexplicable section in the center of the book where Nick tells Gilbert (the eponymous Thin Man's son) the tale of Alfred Packer, North America's first cannibal. (You can see this tale colorfully illustrated in Matt Stone and Trey Parker's film \\"Cannibal: The Musical!\\" if you have any interest in it). This story relates in no way to the plot of the book, so I really don't know why it's there, if other than to assist the author in making a minimum page count.Looking at this book as a thing totally disassociated from the film, I can tell you this: yes, it was entertaining. Yes, it held my attention. It was a good way to while-away a couple rainy afternoons, but I can't tell you that I'd call it a great work of literature. And the thing that I liked the most about the movie (which, honestly, is mainly the characters of Nick and Nora) was a bit lacking in the book. It dwelt mostly on the Wynatt family, which was more twisted than in the film.It was good for what it was - a mystery novel. But I won't tell you that if you love the movie (as I do) that you'll love the book."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Being almost completely unfamiliar with the old Nick and Nora Charles movies, I came to The Thin Man with no preconceived notions about its two main characters and how they might fit into the rest of Hammett's body of work. At first, the book did not strike me as being particularly dark or hardboiled, two qualities I have come to expect from Hammett's writing, but by the time I finished it I had changed my mind. As Hammett developed his storyline and fleshed out his characters it became apparent that the more sophisticated Nick and Nora were dealing with characters from the criminal underworld and the NYPD who would have fit comfortably into any Hammett novel.Ex-detective Nick Charles and his wealthy young wife have come from San Francisco to spend Christmas 1932 in New York City, a city with which Nick is very familiar and in which he still has many friends and contacts because of the years he worked it as a private detective. Nick, retired from the business and hoping to earn his keep these days by managing the enormous wealth that his new wife has inherited, wants nothing more from the holiday than a chance to visit old haunts, see a few friends, drink some good booze on a regular basis and sleep until noon each day.A chance encounter with the daughter of a former client of his who wants him to help her find her father makes sure that most of Nick's original holiday goals will be impossible to achieve because, try as he might to avoid any involvement, he is slowly sucked into a mess beyond his imagination. Before he knows what hit him, Nick is working with a NYPD detective on a murder investigation, becomes the target of one of the murder suspects, finds that the wife of another suspect is trying to frame him for the murder, realizes that he and Nora have become surrogate parents to the young lady who first got him involved, and is still trying to squeeze in as much booze as possible into his daily routine.The Thin Man was Dashiell Hammett's last novel and I had hoped to enjoy it much more than I did. Strangely enough, what will stay with me the longest is the alcoholism that the novel's main character, Nick Charles, so obviously suffers, suffers to such a degree that he is constantly joking about his need for a drink and offering drinks to others so that he will have an excuse to mix one for himself. In fact, his young wife Nora, if she stays with Nick too many years, is almost certainly going to end up in the same boat. Hammett, an alcoholic himself, portrays these drinking habits as humorous and sophisticated, very much a positive thing in the lives of Nick and Nora Charles. I found that attitude, along with some casual use of the \\"N-word\\" to be distracting enough to keep me from fully buying into the novel's plot. I realize that the book was written at least 75 years ago but I struggled to get past this kind of thing, especially Hammett's attempt to make alcoholism seem so appealing a lifestyle.I listened to the audio version of the book and I was impressed with the way that William Dufris read the novel. The Thin Man is largely a first person narrative by Nick Charles with the remainder of the book being told in conversational format. Dufris does a superb job providing accents, inflections and different voices for the various characters, male and female, and made listening to Hammett's story a pleasure but, overall, I was disappointed in the book. Based on its reputation, I think that I expected too much."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder.

While the movies are about a gay, carefree couple who solve crimes and do a lot of social drinking, the book is more about a couple in a destructive relationship. Nick only married Nora for her money, and they both know it. He's also a womanizer and an alcoholic (as is Nora). Nora is a younger woman who seems enchanted by Nick's sinful ways, and allows him to use her as he feels free to. The whodunit mystery, although discussed very much in the book, is not the most interesting part of the novel, nor did Hammett intend it to be. Read it for the satirical potrayal of bad relationships. Not just Nick and Nora's, but the dysfunctional (although dysfunctional may be an understatement) family they help to solve the murder.The Thin Man is also notable for the use of a certain word to describe male arousal. Hammett was attempting to pave the way for other authors to discuss sexuality more openly. Unfortunately, it didn't quite catch on."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book actually is worth reading a couple of times. Read it the first time for fun, but then reread it to see what you missed seeing the first time around.You probably know the basic plot. A former private eye has given up on the detective work after his wife has inherited her father's businesses, and is running her financial affairs for her. On vacation, they run into his former acquaintances and, of course, a mystery develops which he reluctantly is persuaded to investigate.There are a lot of undertones here. The obvious fact is that both husband & wife are slipping into alcoholism, although he's ahead of her. He has lost interest in what was once his very life. He apparantly slips out on her on occasion, and she seems to tolerate it...they obviously love each other. But he's not the man he once was. He's going to avoid violent confrontations and he takes the easy way out. His drinking habit, his unwillingness to exert himself in solving a crime, the fact that the only noticeable cheating on Nora is at a party where the other woman apparantly drags him off...all this indicates a once vital person such as Sam Spade or, to compare with another author's detective, Phillip Marlowe who is losing interest in life.I wonder if this book didn't inspire Raymond Chandler's idea for POODLE SPRINGS which opens with Phillip Marlowe's having married a wealthy woman. Chandler only wrote four chapters before his death and Robert Parker finished it, showing Marlowe as too rough hewn a character to settle into the wealthy life style.But Nick Charles gave in to it, and maybe was worse off for doing so.This isn't the strongest of Hammett's books, but it sure is worth reading and wondering a bit about."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Contrary to what someone else wrote in these posts, the novel is very much like the movie, except it gets away with things the Code wouldn't allow Powell and Loy to get away with. It's uncanny how the screenwriter nailed the tone of the book and the voices of the Charleses -- as you read it, Powell's and Loy's voices come right through. It's fast-paced, witty, and, as someone else in here said, the mystery's not the thing. The banter is. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The characters are great. The plot twists are clever. The setting in a time that is long gone.I thoroughly enjoyed this old favorite once again."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"if you like the thin man movies this is a must read 4 you. this is where it all started."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man was Dashiel Hammet's final novel. It sticks with the familiar hard boiled themes and motifs common in his previous works like the Continental Op series or The Maltese Falcon. There are scenes showcasing the gritty underbella of prohibition era America and the thugs and speakeasies of the time. Where the Thin Man takes a different tack is that our main hero is a \\"retired\\" detective Nick Charles. Nick got married 4 years ago to Nora, a rich socialite from the West Coast. When Nora's father died, Nick left detective work behind and has taken on some responsibility for overseeing the businesses. Granted, his level of \\"oversight\\" seems to involve hobnobbing, spending money and doing a lot of drinking.The novel is set during Christmastime in New York City. Nick and Nora are enjoying a luxurious vacation when Nick runs into Dorothy, the daughter of a family he did detective work for years ago. Her father, Wynant is missing and she wants Nick to help find him. Nick says he's retired and gives her some ideas of who she might call. A bit later it is revealed that Wynant's secretary has been found murdered.Wynant's family members and associates keep turning up asking Nick to help find Wynant. The police also try to rope him into helping them solve the murder. More and more details are revealed and more suspects keep turning up. One of the suspects ends up shooting Nick and Nick decides he can't stay out of the investigation any more and starts gumshoeing. He still tries to defer to the police where he can and keep the press at bay as they try to get him to admit to working the case.Nora is enthralled with seeing her husband work and she keeps trying to push herself into the action alongside him. I love the banter between Nick and Nora. They are both so witty and sarcastic. It's a lot of fun to see them tease each other and especially fun when they're teasing in front of other characters or teasing other people. A lot of the other characters don't seem to know what to make of the Charleses. It's pretty funny.While this is still a gritty murder mystery full of all sorts of suspects both from high and low society, it is definitely less grizzly than the Continental Op. There were action sequences but they weren't as intense or drawn out as in Hammet's other works. The tone and action was closer to Maltese Falcon than the Op books.I really enjoyed the mystery of this book. There are a ton of little nuances and extra layers that add to the complexity. While some of the characters felt a little flat and stereotypical there were also a lot of very distinctive and interesting characters. Wynant's family members are each very outrageously distinct and quirky. Wyant's lawyer and business associates are a little more predictable but still interesting and add flavor.As with a lot of these early mystery novels, the final revelatory narrative is a bit drawn out with Nick going into a lengthy monologue explaining just what happened and how and by whom. I did like the humor that Hammet brought into this scene through short comments between Nick and Nora as she questions just how it is that he knows these things. In some cases his response is that \\"it's the only way that makes sense\\"...in other cases he comments that he's \\"not sure\\" but he suggests that by making deductive theories in one direction, it's sure to put pressure on the real guilty party and expose something they don't want exposed.All in all I really enjoyed this story. It was a funny, exciting and intriguing mystery tale. While the overall mystery elements were all actually pretty complex in their unraveling, the actualy resolution was quite simple and seemed to make a lot of sense once fully explained. In the end this made for a rather satisfying conclusion.After reading the book, I sat down with my wife and we watched the movie based on the book. I loved that Dashiel Hammet received top billing. The movie was pretty faithful to the overall plot of the book although it did start out providing significant back story prior to the introduction of the Charleses. This served as a good introduction to Wynant and his family and associates. I felt like this change was a good way of putting a face to a character (Wynant) who otherwise is almost always \\"off screen\\" but constantly talked about. They did make a significant change to the \\"Dorothy\\" character. In the book she's flighty, erratic and just possibly a little crazy. In the movie she seemed pretty grounded and she's engaged to be married (which introduced a new character but also got rid of her \\"flirting\\" with Nick). Most of the other characters and situations remained the same until the very end of the story. Rather than having the final revelation meeting happen in the room of Wynant's wife and family, Nick sets up a dinner party and invites all of the suspects to attend. During the dinner he announces that he's brought the killer in and expects to reveal him or her there. The dinner party scene certainly made for better theater by adding more tension and suspicion as well as providing more opportunity for situational humor.Overall I really enjoyed this book. I've had a lot of fun reading Hammet's works and I look forward to reading more. If you're in the mood for a \\"Noir\\" mystery without as much grittiness but with just as much intrigue and fun, The Thin Man is definitely a good place to start.*****4.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was a really fun read for me! I had never read any of Hammett's works but had always wanted to-we choose this book for a book club and it was great because it was a quick, fun read and it had all of us guessing who-done-it to the very end!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"One of the greatest, if not the greatest, husband and wife team ever. Sure, the mystery is good, but this book is really about Nick and Nora Charles, their wonderful, sassy relationship and the incredibly witty, charming banter between the two of them. A great example of the tension and attraction that happens simultaneously with men and women. Also, a nice example of trust, where spouses allow each other to openly flirt with others without having their fragile egos threatened."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Saw a marathon of the Thin Man Movies on Turner Classic Movies. A friend of mine said she had read the book. I ordered it from Amazon. Wow! What a great book. Thrilling, exciting, funny, crafty, witty and charming -- phew -- a lot of descriptive words that all are appropriate. I wish the movie could have included more of that kid, Gilbert, who is the brother of the girl, Dorothy. He seems like a hoot from his story line in the book where he is more utilized. I suppose hollywood had to make adjustments for time and the flow of the story's sake. I gave it to a friend at work and he said the book is a definite classic -- he exact words \\"great story and great story telling.\\""},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Hammett's novel is different enough from the movie to make its reading worthwhile. Lacks a good deal of the wit and personality supplied by William Powell and Myrna Loy, but packs in additional details missing from the script. (Oh, and there's one big difference: Asta is a girl!) The film is a bit sleeker, sometimes to much better effect (e.g., it omits the three-page report of cannibalism in the Old West that struck me as wildly out of place). Those who have seen the movie will have a terrible time trying to imagine the characters as anyone other than the actors who portrayed them in the film."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The writing is OK, but Hammett tries to describe a life style that, in my opinion, never was. Two words."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Having now listened to two of Dashiell Hammett's works -- The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man -- I am scratching my head at how they have managed to be such enduring classics. Unless it is just that they were such different, ground-breaking books at the time they were published that they made an indelible mark in the world of literature.For me, I am not a Dashiell Hammett fan. His books are all about snappy dialogue and action, peopled with interesting but shallow characters who never show any true emotions. There is lots of melodrama but very little real feeling. I didn't find Nick and Nora Charles all that admirable -- for one thing, Nick Charles drank from morning to night and was almost never sober. But I will have to say that Dashiell Hammett's books do give an interesting, and I must assume accurate, picture of 1930s New York (or, in the case of The Maltese Falcon, San Francisco). As for the mystery aspect, it is so-so. Hammett likes to tangle and intertwine the relationships of his characters like a plate of spaghetti, so that you end up feeling everyone is at least a little bit guilty, including the person who was murdered.William Dufris is an excellent narrator who somehow manages to give each of the large cast of characters their own distinctive voice."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This was a gift to my granddaughter. She had read it, but wanted to keep it because she loves the story. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I could not believe how well this book is written. A great detective story written with style, wit and intelligence."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"First of all, anybody who's read any of my reviews, knows I love the old hardboiled detectives from the thirties and fourties. These guys had to use thier brains, not some hidden camera, DNA, whatever the latest CSI science gimic is.Since none of this existed when Dash was arround, he never even thought of it. It has brilliant character developement thru out. You can even see \\"the Thin man\\" even though he never makes an appearence. My habit is the listen to it initially to hear the story, plot, etc. Then immediately listen to it a couple more times to see if there are any gafts, errors, etc. There are none. The only thing I'm not sure of is why a sudden narative on a wild west cannibal even though Dash does fit it in for no apparent reason. It has nothing to do with the story.The narrative is excellent, the story is classic. And if you think, you'll justwatch the movie instead, you'll miss a lot. The movie is different, even though it is good also."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The Thin Man is a mystery solving the case of Julia Wolf's murder. Nick Charles, a retired detective, and his wife Nora find clues while helping a young girl named Dorothy through problems with her abusive mother and crazy suspect of a dad. As the story unfolds the situation turns out to be more complex than a single murder. There are many twists involving many characters that make the murder hard to solve.The characters are well-developed with depth and realistic personalities. Detective Charles sarcastic wit makes him a fun character through which to sift through all the information to solve the murder.Nevertheless the detail of information sifted through in the book can also make parts of the book a slow read. The author goes on large tangents that seem to detract from the story. For example at a party at the beginning of the book Nick is asked about cannibalism in America by a suspects child, Nick hands him a book which is then quoted at great length. Perhaps the author includes this to keep the reader guessing as to its relevance or as a device to show what people may do under extreme circumstances. Either way these side stories make the book drag at parts.Despite being slow in certain sections the character development and the way the author highlights the relevant pieces of information to solve the mystery is satisfying. If the mystery is like walking through a forest to identify which trees are needed to guide the reader through to the far side of the forest, the author describes in detail too many of the trees. Yet, at the end, it is fun when the detective highlights and connects the facts that are part of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The year is 1932. Nick and Nora Charles have decided to spend Christmas in New York, away from their California home and family business. Nick was a hard-drinking hard-nosed private detective before he married Nora. But Nora's family money paid for his early retirement, and now he wants nothing to do with the investigation business. One afternoon when Charles is out drinking, he runs into Dorothy Wynant, the daughter of an old client of his. She's looking for her father, an eccentric old inventor named Clyde Wynant. When the headlines splashed across the next day's newspaper say that the inventor's secretary and mistress, Julia Wolf, has been found shot to death in her apartment, a lot of people begin to wonder about Clyde Wynant's whereabouts. Mr. Wynant's lawyer, Herbert Macaulay, plies Nick for information. Clyde Wynant's ex-wife Mimi also questions Nick about her former husband. Dorothy Wynant flees her mother and step-father's apartment, and Nora invites her to stay at hers. Nick finds himself in the middle of a mystery he never wanted to know about. But when a thug forces his way into the Charles' apartment at gunpoint and the police shake Nick down for answers, he is left with no choice but to investigate the case. Nick's investigation takes him to New York's speakeasies and into its underworld, through the sordid affairs of the Wynant family, and leads to two more murders before Nick is confident he has cracked the case.Fans of the 1934 film \\"The Thin Man\\", which starred William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, will likely be a bit shocked when they read Dashiell Hammett's novel on which the film was based. Although the film is excellent in its own right, the characters were altered beyond recognition to make them more palatable to a wide audience. Dashiell Hammett's novel is hard-boiled and cynical beyond words. Nick Charles is a violent drunk who married young Nora for her money so that he could spend the rest of his days sleeping and drinking and would never have to work again. Nick and Nora don't like each other very much and don't treat each other very well. The only interest they share is found in the bottom of a whisky glass. All of the characters in \\"The Thin Man\\", regardless of social status, are hardened and, in one way or another, quite depraved. There are no likable characters in this novel. It would not be an exaggeration to say that every one of them is a pathological liar and a sociopath. But \\"The Thin Man\\" is a good read. The characters, although distasteful, are well-drawn, and Hammett renders every scene vividly. The dialogue crackles with sardonic wit and is the novel's great strength. Dashiell Hammett's novels and stories were extremely popular in the 1920's and 1930's. Readers had a real taste for the blunt talk and bold-faced corruption that reflected urban culture at the time. \\"The Thin Man \\" would have fewer fans if were written today. Even if people could get past its cynicism and lack of sympathetic characters, many modern readers will be put off by the novel's abusive attitude toward women and the fact that everyone is so alcoholic that his/her ability to function and speak with any coherence at all really stretches credibility. But I recommend \\"The Thin Man\\" precisely because it isn't like modern crime novels. Dashiell Hammett's style is admirable. It won't put you in a good mood, and you may not even be sure that the mystery was solved in the end. But you'll be entertained."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This book makes for very good reading. The plot and characters are very well thought out and developed. Well written all around! I recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"What a difference three years can make. Between 1930 (when Hammett finished \\"The Glass Key,\\" perhaps his bleakest work) and 1933 (when he published \\"The Thin Man,\\" his last novel), Hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life: a steady income from book sales and from Hollywood filmwriting and, perhaps more important, Lillian Hellman.There's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love: Hammett's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of \\"The Thin Man\\" he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book, which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels.While his first four novels, as well as the early draft, featured an anti-Establishment loner (the Continental Op, Sam Spade, Ned Beaumont), \\"The Thin Man\\" introduces Nick and Nora Charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in New York (which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue) to solve a murder. Readers with only a passing knowledge of Hammett's biography will recognize both Hammett and Hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife.What also separates \\"The Thin Man\\" from Hammett's other full-length works is its giddy humor, which revolves around seedy nightlife, early-morning alcohol consumption, and Nick and Nora's freethinking rapport, while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself. The morning after being grazed by a bullet, Nora asks Nick: \\"How do you feel?\\" \\"Terrible, I must've gone to bed sober.\\" This playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures.Many Hammett fans have long regarded \\"The Thin Man\\" as his weakest novel, and I tend to agree--up to a point. This book lacks the quality for which the others are famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word). Although it's a sophisticated Manhattan comedy, Hammett's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits, and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often doesn't ring true. Even so, it's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"The story begins when Dorothy Wynant asks Nick Charles to help locate her father Clyde Wynant who has gone away. Wynant's lawyer Macaulay visits Nick to confer with him. The next day Nick reads that Julia Wolfe, Clyde's \\"confidential secretary\\" was found shot to death (Chapter 3). Chapter 5 shows Hammett's skill at conversational dialogue. A visitor brings excitement to their rooms (Chapter 8). Dorothy has problems at home (Chapter 9). Lieutenant John Guild visits Nick and tells him about the case (Chapter 11). Clyde Wynant sent a letter to his lawyer from Philadelphia (Chapter 12). Is the story about Alfred G. Packer padding or a clue (Chapter 13)? Nick learns more about Mimi's current husband's past (Chapter 19).Chapter 22 tells what it was like in a speakeasy for Nick Charles when he meets people. We learn more about some people's past. Mimi, the former wife of Clyde, has something new to say (Chapter 23). Wynant called his lawyer Macaulay for a meeting (Chapter 26). There is a new development when Wynant's son Gilbert gets a letter (Chapter 28). Then Mimi tells about what happened (Chapter 29). Lieutenant Guild shows up with more news, and there is a solution (Chapter 30). The loose ends are tied up in Chapter 31. Nick explains how a theory of murder is created from what makes sense from the known facts. They can't wait for \\"every little detail\\".This 1972 paperback book cover has a picture of Dashiell Hammett, a thin man in real life. This fast-paced and very readable book was one of Hammett's best novels (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\" was the other). It was also his last novel. His later years were spent in Hollywood working on film scripts. The film of this novel was also excellent, although changed for a visual media and simplified. Its success led to a series of films, as happens with other popular films. This 75-year old novel also tells something about life in those days."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Let me begin by noting that I am reviewing the audio cassette version of The Thin Man that stars Daniel J. Travanti as Nick Charles and Lynne Lipton as his young and wealthy wife, Nora.If you are like me, you met The Thin Man first in the movie series. Those movies have Nick Charles straddling the gap between the &quot;haves&quot; and the tough guy world with insouciance as he waltzes with the wealthy socialites and unravels fatal plots. The book itself is much darker, directly suggesting alcoholism, incest, adultery, and all the minor crimes . . . and deadly sins. The view is that humans are thoroughly flawed, but some can rise above that to serve others anyway. That is the nobility of the Nick Charles character . . . as he staggers out of bed in the afternoon with yet another hangover. Helping out old clients is his source of redemption against the temptations he cannot resist.The world view is probably somewhat autobiographical as Hammett spent more of his time in Hollywood late in his career, rather than working as a fiction writer. The echoes of F. Scott Fitzgerald are very strong, especially to Tender Is The Night.For those who love the classic &quot;tough guy&quot; stories by Hammett, this one can never have the same appeal. Nick is still tough, but he mostly shows it by taking abuse with style. That's a feminine kind of toughness that comes from maturity. He passes off the chances to trade punches when they arise.The characterizations of Nick and Nora Charles are the strength of the novel. But the book transcends that by also creating a picture of a flawed marriage between two people with hearts of gold who love each other, but are also killing each other. The development of the relationship is brilliant.I would like to especially note that the acting by Daniel J. Travanti as Nick brings a great sensitivity to the role. When I read the book, I put a snarl into a lot of the Nick lines when he is beset by yet another visitor or telephone call. Mr. Travanti wisely chooses to share an equivocal openness instead. I think his reading is correct, and added much to my appreciation of the story. Whoever cast him for this role deserves commendation as well.The mystery itself isn't very mysterious. It just has lots of red herrings. If you judge mysteries by the quality of the plot unfolding of that mystery, you will probably rate this book at 3 or 4 stars. I rated this audio cassette version for 5 stars based on the story line about the nature of modern people and relationships, and the superb acting by Mr. Travanti.After enjoying this dramatization of the story, I suggest that you think about what temptations are difficult for you to resist. How will those temptations undermine your life and your relationships? How can you occupy yourself in ways so that there will either be less temptation or you will be more able to resist it?To your good health and that of all your relationships!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I'm a Hammett fan - the snappy dialogue, the whole noir-schtick. Facing a long layover (and longer flight), and having never read any of Hammett's \\"Nick and Nora\\" mysteries, I gave _The Thin Man_ a read. While the elements of Hammett that I always enjoy remained the same, the characters just didn't click with me the way Spade does.The _Thin Man_ is set in New York City - a far cry from the San Francisco, the city I most readily associate with Hammett (it was both his hometown as well as that of Spade), the protagonists here urbane, wealthy, and dashing: they could not be more different than the hard bitten, cynical Spade. Nick and Nora Charles are to Same Spade what the White Sox fans are to regular attendees to the Chicago philharmonic (no knock on either, and to those who attend both, more power to you.) I assume Hammett was either spreading his literary wings, or was wanting to avoid his characters getting stale. They could not be more different.The plot revolves around a series of murders involving a socialite's dysfunctional family, the pater familias a person of interest in the crimes. The MacGuffin is that the comings and goings of the father are as etheral and elusive as the murderer him (or her-)self. As the story moves along and the list of suspects shifts, is modified and changes again as suspect after suspect is corssed off the list of possible candidates for the crime as they, too, end up in the morgue, the father a shadow - making him both the perfect suspect and a possible target for the next killing.The mystery eventually became so tangled and convoluted that I eventually gave up trying to figure out \\"who dunnit\\" and simply resigned myself to letting Hammett take me where he would, trusting that he'd eventually solve the crime and connect the dots for me. Thankfully he did, although I remain a bit fuzzy on exactly how the murderer led me (and Nick and Nora) on such a merry chase. In terms of difficulty, _The Thin Man_ is a double-black diamond.The real attraction of Hammett to me has always been his writing rather than his sluething. And while there is witty banter, wise-cracks and some snap to the exchanges between the characters, I remain much more a fan of Sam Spade. _The Thin Man_ is a good mystery, but the characterization just wasn't as compelling."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"I grew up watching Myrna Loy and William Powell play Nick and Nora Charles on the silver screen. I chose The Thin Man, by Dashiell Hammett for my book club in February. And even though I have seen the movie several times- and even studied it in college- I was still guessing and intrigued until the very end. This is a wonderful step into the \\"hard-boiled school of detective fiction\\". Murder, mayhem, the mob- all are present but with a love story that seems both imaginable and desirable. Nick and Nora Charles have an intelligent and loving marriage and are embroiled in a deadly mystery during 1930s prohibition New York- with just the right amount of screwball comedy."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"An old story. It is amazing what changes there have been in culture since the 20's or 30's. In this book, they drink and smoke from morning till night. The humor is great and so is the story.

I will not give out the plot twist, read it."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Dashiell Hammett along with James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler is one of the trinity of hard boiled fiction's trinity of great authors! Hammett was the longtime lover of playwright Lillian Hellmann, a former Pinkerton agent in Baltimore and a member of the United States Army. His many short stories and novels have earned him a rightful place in American letters.The Plot of The Thin Man-Nick Charles is a private detective who has become rich. He is wealthy because he is married to Nora Charles whose family is wealthy. Nick and Nora love to make smart cracks, drink booze and attend plays and parties. Their little dog Asta is an adorable creature! In this early 1930's novel the story is narrated in the first person by Nick. A very eccentric inventor named Wygant is missing. His secretary Julia Wolff is found murdered. Nick and Nora are friends with Wynant's family especially young Dorothy the daughter of the inventor. The Charles become involved in finding the murderer and locating the inventor.This is a short but entertaining novel that hardboiled fans will love! The Thin Man was filmed William Powell as Nick and Nora being played by Myrna Loy. Dashiell Hammett is a national treasure! Enjoy this outstanding classic!"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Just falls short of being called a classic, but nevertheless an excellent read and gathers pace as one reaches the end. I found it very contemporary, almost everything \\"modern\\" is discussed or inferred to, be it drug use, incest, toy boys or sexual ambiguity. No wonder it still retains its freshness. I think this is a must read.Loved when the wife says that they can \\"fly\\" back to San Francisco - remember the story takes place in 1932!! Lovely"},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Do the really good detectives ever retire? I doubt it. They're always pulled back into a crime case by circumstances or fans of their past work. That's what happened with Nick Charles, who had managed to marry a gorgeous woman with tons of money. He didn't need detective work to pay the bills. He had a few accounts to manage, some stocks to buy, and some martinis to drink. So he didn't want to get involved with the murder of the secretary of a man for whom he once worked. But I doubt he could turn off his curiosity or sense of justice any more than he could stop observing the world like a detective. Even when a small fight broke out while he was sharing a cheap champagne at a speakeasy with a man he had sent up the river several years prior, he couldn't help noticing that the more-or-less-former thug still led with his right. It was that mistake which the two men had agree allowed Nick to bag the thug back when they were on opposite sides of the law.\\"The Thin Man\\" is a great crime novel. It's very funny in parts, and if you have seen the movie series based on Nick and Nora Charles, both movie and book characters are alike in the sexy wit that has appealed to many readers and viewers for decades.Some readers have found it dark, but I do not. Nick has a sharp, funny way of looking at the people in his life which lightens any darkness from the corrupt people he deals with, and his interaction with Nora is priceless. Certainly it is a hard-boiled detective novel because the plot doesn't go off on unrelated tangents, but I think the story is great fun."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"A 2007 Summer reading list mini review.I just finished listening to Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man read by William Dufris. If I had actually read it, I would certainly call it a page turner. Hammett turns a phrase with the best of them, and Dufris does an excellent job embodying the narrator: sleuth sophisticate Nick Charles and the rest of the assundry characters that populate Hammet's world.I think listening rather than reading helped me to catch the atmosphere of this detective novel. And what atmosphere there is! There's lies and there's sex on this audiotape. There is so much drinking in this book, that I will probably wake up with a hangover, and I never touch the stuff. But besides the whiskey, there is also the wry sensibility of Nick Charles. Hammett never lets Nick lose control of the caper and that makes for an enjoyable read or listen for the audience."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"This is the third work by Dashiell Hammett that I picked up, the others bein Red Harvest and The Dain Curse. While I enjoy Hammett's sharp and colorful prose, these stories left me wanting a little more. In the case of Red Harvest, the crooks and the gunfights had an over-the-top B-Movie essence; The Dain Curse has more of the same, with an extemely offensive racist portrayal of a character thrown in.The Thin Man marks the first time I have thoroughly enjoyed a Dashiell Hammett novel. The tale is told in the first person by Nick, who is a retired private eye who quit the business after marrying the independently wealthy Nora. Nick and Nora essentiality live life at parties or lazing at home, almost always with cocktails in hand. What makes this duo so charming is their easygoing marriage in which they display affection for one another more via wisecracks than kisses. On top of that, playful Nora is the one person who has Nick's number: he can say no to anything and anybody excepting his wife, for whom he is head over heels.While Nick & Nora Charles are the characters who steal the spotlight, Hammett paints a fantastic array of characters involved in the disappearance of an eccentric inventor named Clyde Wynant, as well as the murder of his secretary. Most entertaining is the trio of Clyde's family: his ex-wife Mimi (a shallow woman who tries to lie her way out of trouble, with little success), son Gilbert (fragile inquisitive young man intrigued with detective work, human nature, and the effects that illegal drugs have on the mind and emotions), and Dorothy (manic young woman who recognizes her family's erratic behavior, but has trouble tempering her own identity).The majority of other characters are the colorful and pulpy gangsters, thugs, and cops. You will not find the coarse, gritty realism of a Raymond Chandler story. The Thin Man is more of a \\"Who Dunnit?\\" romp that deals with the collection of dysfunctional folks who have ties with the disappearance and the murder.When all is said and done, Dashiell Hammett leaves \\"The Thin Man\\" as a solid packaging consisting of both his excellent descriptive writing and a well plotted story. This story, and nearly any Raymond Chandler novel, are good places to start if you are new to the detective fiction genre."},{"Title":"The Thin Man","review":"Unlike the famous film version starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, the characters of Dashiell Hammett's THE THIN MAN range in tone from vapid to vicious, with only Nick and Nora Charles emerging as somewhat similar to their cinematic counterparts. The plot is also considerably less lean, and Hammett packs it with a number of unnecessary excursions that tend to sidetrack the flow of action. The result is less of an action-packed detective story than it is a portrait of New York in the early 1930s, where cops are brutal and stupid, society rubs shoulders with criminals in lowlife speakeasies, and every one is out for what they can get.And what they want are sex and money and more sex, preferrably laced with bootleg liquior. Fans of the film will easily recognize the basic plot: retired detective Nick Charles is unwilling dragged into the search for a former client, inventor Clyde Wynant, who is wanted for questioning in connection with the brutal murder of his secretary-mistress. But not only the police want him: ex-wife Mimi is low on funds and would like to lay hands on his dough, his estranged children Dorothy and Gilbert have vested interests of their own, and Mimi's current husband is playing his own hand as well. The characters are considerably darker here, particularly in reference to Dorothy and Gilbert, with Dorothy a manipulative and hard-drinking little tramp and Gilbert an ineffectual weakling; mother Mimi is viciously neurotic and abusive; and the missing Clyde Wynant is so eccentric that whether or not he had a hand in the murder he clearly needs to be locked up. To further complicate matters, both Dorothy and Mimi are on the make for Nick Charles. As for Nick and wife Nora, they possess considerable sparkle--but they too are of this world, Nick clearly en route to an alcoholic hell and pulling Nora along with him.Hammett writes with his usual strength, but as a novel THE THIN MAN lacks the focus of his more famous THE MALTESE FALCON, and his digressions and excursions hinder the book as a whole. Even so, his dark and frequently witty look at the underbelly of depression-era New York packs enough punch to bring it in at a solid four stars. Recommended for fans of the classic \\"hard boiled\\" style, but probably of more interest to hard-core completists than casual readers."},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"I have owned this book since I was a yong child and has always been one of my favorites. It has all of the trimmings, a wickid step mother and all!"},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"This was my favorite illustrated book when I was a child. I had actually been searching for this exact version for over 10 years (as it is an adaption of a Hans Christian Andersen story there are several versions and I couldn't remember that the illustrations were by Juan Diaz-Toledo). The book contains absolutely beautiful illustrations and although the story is slightly weird (like most Andersen tales)- it is still a lovely book.The book was also in pristine condition. So I was very pleased."},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"You can't go wrong with anything illustrated by the amazing and talented Susan Jeffers. It's so much fun that I have a 2-1/2 year old great niece, and another child on the way, to share with them the fairy tales I loved as a child. I envision many happy years of fabulous childrens' books with my little Genevieve and her expected baby brother or sister."},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"I bought this book for my daughter while at Capezio getting her new dance outfits. I did not know anything about the book, but loved the artwork inside. The first time I read it, I was amazed at what a beautiful and creative story it was. And it did keep my 4 year old's attention. We would look at the art work after reading each page and talked about it. It is my favorite story, a bit long, but whenever she picks it out for me to read at night I can never say no... no matter how late it is. I highly recommend the reading at any age, the artwork alone can ignite the imagination!"},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"I checked this book out from the library time and time again as a child.

He has many common themes however to the stories that had been passed down for generations. This story is of a young girl sent away by her evil stepmother. She then must rescue her eleven brothers from the spell that has been placed upon them. In a dream, a fairy came to her and gave her the answer. So after, a king falls in love with her at first sight. This tale is a bit lengthy and has a few passages of irrelevant information, but because the reader feels an emotional attachment to the girl so quickly, attention never waivers. The watercolor illustrations help to support the text, but at times do not have very much contrast, giving them a murky feel. Second graders would be able to read the text; however it may take until fourth grade for children to be able to do it in one sitting.Why 4 stars?:Some passages in the story can get a bit lengthy. Although the text is written on a second grade level, it may take a while before students can read this in one sitting. However, they will definitely listen to it, as the characters are very captivating. The illustrations are a little muddy though."},{"Title":"The wild swans","review":"I love the book - it is in great condition; better than expected.

It did get a little slow at times but it was just because of all the details. It did have a little too much detail as to what was done to the children and the effects that occurred but it helps us understand and realize what the parents and medical staff had to see these helpless children go through. I do recommend this book to all who like to read true crime. Enjoy! :o)"},{"Title":"Deadly Medicine","review":"I have to quibble with the previous reviewer. The book -- the result of years of research and absolutely factual (as it says in the Preface) -- was the BASIS for the well-received although fictionalized TV-Movie-of-the-Week. The book is, also, not your average True-Crime; this one is, like Capote's classic IN COLD BLOOD, a NOVEL as well. You won't be disappointed.

Since I've suffered from PMS at different levels of severity since adolescence, and since the price was right, I bought it.There is definitely a good deal of useful information therein. Lark has some tips on herbs, yoga, and other things that might prove useful, and I intend to use the book as one of several reference guides and to experiment with a few of her suggestions.What bugs me, though, is the unrelenting emphasis that you MUST radically change your diet if you want to get rid of your PMS. How does Lark want you to change your diet? Why, she wants you to get rid of beef, pork, caffeine, booze, cheese, white pasta and bread, salty snacks, and sweet desserts (especially chocolate) -- in other words, all the fun stuff.This, to be frank, is hooey, at least for me. I've found that if I minimize my intake of these things from a week before onset of menses until four or five days into my period, and also up my intake of Vitamin B, things get much better.As David Shaw writes in _The Pleasure Police_ -- a book I highly recommend, by the way -- one of the best things you can do for your health is to enjoy yourself. Despite all the scolding nanny types out there who want to convince us that everything we consume should be oh so wholesome, we all know that fettucine alfredo, Southern barbecue, Godiva chocolates, steaming lattes, and good stiff drinks are some of what make life worthwhile. (Sex is, too. Given this, it's rather odd that Lark doesn't mention how orgasm can diminish PMS and cramps. However, I digress.)Judging from Lark's other books, in which she hawks a macrobiotic diet, homeopathy (what a crock *that* is), and other &quot;natcheral&quot; cures, it seems like she's really into this lifestyle and devoutly believes everyone else should be, too. Hey, if it's your cup of herbal tea with honey in it, go ahead. But it's not mine. If it's not yours, either, you should be aware that it's not your only option.One last note: Antidepressants can also help immensely with PMS. But if another edition of this book ever comes out, expect Lark to condemn them as the product of &quot;overly goal-focused Western medicine obsessed with magic pills.&quot; Thing is, sometimes pills *do* work like magic."},{"Title":"PMS Self Help Book","review":"This book has everything, meal guides, yoga and accupressure and other ways to get rid of your PMS symptoms, and they really work!!"},{"Title":"The Waiting Sands","review":"As usual Howatch slips in some good writing in between the predictable Gothic formula.

I could tell who the killer was pretty much from the beginning and how it was all going to turn out.

However, I think a writer can remain in a genre and still come up with a unique, surprise ending as well as an entertaining book.All in all, this was a fast read and an interesting book."},{"Title":"The Waiting Sands","review":"I think and hope that this is one of Ms. Howatch's earliest books.

The ergonomics are great -- the choice of text and line styles make roads and cities easy to locate, there are generous overlaps between adjacent map pages, and every 2-page spread has a scale of miles and a tiny California outline showing this page's coverage. Very clear lat &amp; long grids aid in GPS navigation.The most distinctive feature, though, is the topography. Color is keyed to altitude, and shading is also used to give a clear picture of the land's contours. Combined, they give a very detailed image of how the land will be shaped when you get where you're going.For those interested in adventuring on California's back roads, the obvious comparison is with DeLorme's Southern California Atlas &amp; Gazetteer, and its Northern California companion. I've used the DeLorme books for years, and have the following comments comparing the Benchmark atlas with them:Pro: better ergonomics. The text fonts, road lines etc. are clearer in the Benchmark atlas. The &quot;look and feel&quot; makes it more of a pleasure to work with.Pro: more discernable land contours (the new edition of the DeLorme books add some shading to help in the interpretation of the oft-confusing contour lines, which helps a lot, but it's still not as sharp as the Benchmark book. Note that I've seen this new contour shading in the Southern CA book, and haven't seen a new Northern CA book yet)Pro: Seems to be more up-to-date (e.g. the Recreation Pages show a lot of the recent changes to the desert parks. The Benchmark book shows a new bypass through Barstow that isn't in the new DeLorme edition (confused the heck out of my group once))Pro: All of California in one book!Con: Not as detailed. There's a reason they can fit it all in one book: it's at twice the scale of the DeLorme's (1:300,000 instead of 1:150,000). Some small features, such as mine sites, aren't in the Benchmark book. I examined various regions I've visited, and most of the same dirt roads are in Benchmark book, but not as many of them are labeled. (In fairness, there's a corresponding &quot;Pro&quot;, in that twice as much area is covered on a page, so there's less flipping around)Con: Many park &amp; base boundaries are not shown on the detailed maps. While the borders of some national parks are shown on the detailed maps, many of them only have a label in the middle, and you must turn to the less-detailed Recreation Maps section to get a sense of their borders. This can be frustrating when you're planning a drive in the region of an off-limits area like China Lake Naval Weapons Center. This shortcoming is the main reason I don't give it five stars -- I hope they correct it in future editions.Con: No indication of land surface. The Benchmark book uses color exclusively for elevation; the forested Sierras look just like the mountains around Death Valley. DeLorme uses color to show levels of vegetation, etc. So, you can look at Desolation Wilderness near Lake Tahoe, and get a sense of which parts are forested and which are open granite.So, which is better? I'd say it depends on what you want to do. If you mostly stick to the paved roads, and/or tend to supplement your atlas with more detailed maps (park service, forest service, USGS topos, etc.), and want something that gives a better sense of &quot;the big picture&quot; of what the land is doing, you might be happier with the Benchmark book. For a driving tour at highway speed, the detail of the DeLorme book is probably excessive -- you'll be flipping a lot of pages.On the other hand, if you really want to get out on the dirt trails and find your own site in the backcountry, you'll appreciate the DeLorme's greater detail.Personally, I like having as many different maps available as possible, so I'd say &quot;Get Both&quot;. In particular, if you have an older edition of the DeLorme book, and are thinking about upgrading to the newer edition with contour shading, you might want to consider keeping your old one, and getting the Benchmark book instead."},{"Title":"Benchmark California Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"No one map [or atlas] can serve all purposes. The Benchmark California Road And Recreation Atlas seems to fill a middle ground between the pure road atlas [the Thomas Guide California atlas is my number one pick in this category] and a topographic/backroads atlas [the DeLorme atlases are my favorites in this category]. The Benchmark atlases are good road atlases with color-coded and shaded relief added to indicate topography. Each map covers more territory than the maps in the DeLorme atlases. This means less detail than the DeLorme maps and I wouldn't want to do much backroad driving with only the Benchmark atlas available for reference. I generally bring my copy of the Benchmark atlas with me on road trips because I find it good for doing a visual and mental overview of the area I'm exploring. I think all travel enthusiasts should have a copy of this atlas in their map library and especially those who want information on topography, but are contour line phobic."},{"Title":"Benchmark California Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"This atlas is highly recommended.

If you are interested in qualitative research methods, get a copy of this book. Mason's book:1. covers methodological as well as theory issues2. prepares the reader to conduct qualitative research in the social, behavioral, cognitive, and related sciences3. discusses presentation issues and coping with a \\"culture\\" bias towards quantitative research4. makes a compelling argument for qualitative research to make even the most jaded and ardent quantitative methodologist to have second thoughtsOne central approach Mason uses is to propose questions that force the researcher to think about the research, analysis, and presentation, and form the basis for a good review strategy for qualitative work.One of my top five books for researchers - I study human-computer interaction, and am (at heart) a computer scientist - this book has helped me see beyond artifact to the true meaning of contribution and value.

The text was clearly used for the class to be a comparison to other texts, because Mason's emphasis is different than many qualitative research texts. Mason emphasizes the importance of the researcher's own perspectives as something that will affect the research process. She also seems to think that research is a fluid process which allows you to change your research questions in the middle of your project, or adapt your whole study based on some of your earlier findings. I have not come across any other texts that would support this approach as a sound one.If you are a linear, rational thinker, you may find this book to be too \\"out there.\\" For instance the whole first chapter discusses \\"5 important questions\\" that should guide your research projects. It repeatedly refers to how important these 5 questions are, but then it actually lists and describes SIX questions in that chapter. For a $45 *used* book, I expect the author and/or publishing staff to be able to count to six... This is what I mean when I describe the text as \\"out there.\\" I did not find the it to be meaningfully-structured or really helpful for designing high-quality research.

In my experience, A heated mattress pad is superior to a heated blanket, because the heated mattress pad heat the space between your bottom sheet and your top sheet. It makes you feel cozy all over. I especially like Soft Heat because other brands of heated mattress pads I've tried have not been satisfactory. On the other brands I've tried, the part of the mattress pad that tucks over your mattress (and holds the pad to the mattress) is fragile, almost as if it was made to tear when you're trying to put it over your mattress.My only wish about our other-wise perfect Soft Heat heated mattress pad, is that it would not periodically come off the top corners of our mattress. But, I think that happens because our bed has electronic adjustments for lifting the head and feet. Anyway, every heated mattress pad we've tried tends to come off the corners of the mattress. The benefits of the heated mattress far outweigh the occasional inconvenience of have to pull the corner of the heated mattress pad back over the corner of the mattress.All I can say, is buy one. My wife and I are fussy old people, and we know what we like :-) We wouldn't buy anything but Soft Heat."},{"Title":"Sacred Mountains of the World","review":"i love this one.

Once again, the Benreys allow us to share the adventures of Nigel Owens and Flick Adams, the director and the curator of the Royal Tunbridge Wells Tea Museum in Tunbridge Wells, England.While tending to some rather sick Assam bushes in the museum's garden, a body is uncovered. It turns out to be the remains of Britain's noted \\"Tea Sage,\\" Etienne Makepeace, missing for forty years. When news gets out that the famous tea expert has been found, the media descend like locusts upon the hapless museum staff. As Nigel and Flick try valiantly to handle the situation, the bank that funds the museum threatens to withdraw their support, appalled by the unwelcome notoriety. Nigel and Flick, who are falling in love, must discover just how Makepeace found his way into their garden. It is clear that solving the mystery might be their only chance to save the museum. But the secrets that may have led to the tea expert's early demise are not the love struck pair's only problem. They each house their own deeply held secrets. The real mystery lies not only in the truth about Etienne Makepeace but in the ability of the wily sleuths to handle the truth about each other.Written in a style reminiscent of Agatha Christie, this cozy is a mystery lover's delight. Nigel's British sensibilities create the perfect foil for his American partner's lovable spontaneity. \\"The Final Crumpet\\" is a novel that requires a cozy fire, a comfy chair, and a delicious cuppa. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Final Crumpet (The Royal Tunbridge Wells Mystery Series #2)","review":"I loved the Benrey's first tea mystery, Dead as a Scone, so I had high expectations of The Final Crumpet.

Both were very entertaining mysteries with satisfying endings that make sense. It is neat to see Flick muddle her way through the different culture and how English is spoken in England rather than here. ( a torch is flashlight, etc). The passages on tea are very educational and the book reads fast.The only strange thing is that in the middle of \\"The Final Crumpet\\" both characters and a supporting one (Polly) start talking about their religious beliefs (Jesus is something like a dustbin--I know that's not the actual quote but something akin to it). I really like some analogies and thoughts about their faith but it seemed the authors threw those paragraphs in there to add some Christian basis to the novels. There was no preliminary buildup--it happened in the middle of muddling in the mystery. The first book had a reason why the Bible was quoted that was vital to the mystery but this book, though very good, had spots of Christianity thrown it as if an afterthought and it was somewhat distracting. If the authors can manage to weave in the character's faith throughout the book, it would be fantastic and add a whole new dimension and depth to the entire mystery."},{"Title":"The Final Crumpet (The Royal Tunbridge Wells Mystery Series #2)","review":"I recently read Dead as a Scone, the first book in this series, and I wasn't overly impressed. However, this book was much better written and I found that it didn't have the same flaws as the first book. It kept my interest throughout and the historical parts of the book were implemented into the story instead of being a break from the rest of the book. The mystery was captivating and it was thoroughly enjoyed.The one problem I had with the book was the fact that there was a short \\"Christian\\" section in the middle and vague references throughout but it didn't really tie into the story. I don't appreciate authors throwing Christian content into books just to market it to a specific audience and that is what this felt like. It didn't turn me off of the book or story I just felt that it could have been written differently. If it had tied into the story better I would have no problem with it. As it was, the content felt as if it was added into the story and didn't feel natural to the book or the characters.Otherwise, this was a great cozy and I liked it very much.

Mr. McMurtry does not. Writing about Crazy Horse is no easy assignment. He spent little time with whites and with his fellow tribesmen as well. It was almost as if this mystic intended to thwart anyone who tried to pin him like some specimen.He may or may not have led the Sioux who obliterated Custer's 7th Cavalry. It is not even absolutely certain that Crazy Horse was at the battle of the Little Bighorn. Perhaps the most documented event is the death of Crazy Horse, which was witnessed by many whites and Indians, and yet there are wildly conflicting versions. To add to it all, even his burial site is unknown.McMurtry well descibes the problems in telling of the subject's life and death. It is easy to see why some readers would be disappointed, because Crazy Horse never quite emerges in this small biography. He remains more myth than man, as perhaps he preferred. That much is clear.Today a version of this ghostly figure emerges slowly from the mountain near Custer, South Dakota. There are fatter books about the man, but nothing that will compare to the statue, to be the largest in the world. And we don't even have a single photograph of him."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Small book packed full of great history. Highly recommended. I wish that McMurtry wrote more non-fiction."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Given the shortage of facts concerning Crazy Horse's life, McMurtry (who is truly a great living writer) was an inspired choice to write this little biography. He's just the sort of writer that was needed to tie together the skeleton of a life that's remembered. And, true to form, McMurtry in this little meditation seems really to capture something of the essence of Crazy Horse's fascinating, tragic life. It's well worth a read."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This is a very interesting biography of Crazy Horse, a Native American who had great love for his people and defending their honor during the American-Indian War. He was also loved by his people the Sioux for fighting the Americanss with great courage. He was involved in the Battle of Little Bighorn where Custer and his army was slaughtered by thousands of Native Americans. Wherever the major fights would be, Crazy Horse would be there. The author, Larry McMurtry, explained the life of Crazy Horse in great detail. He would use words like Picassoesque to desribe the scenery out West. He used facts in his book and some hearsay, but reckognized it for being hearsay and not facts. It was very hard for him to put the book together because Crazy Horse was a very solitary man and the few that knew him well died in battle. But there was a few that survived and died of natural causes in the thirties. It was hard for their documented words to be translated. He described Crazy Horse's life from many points of view, though. Crazy Horse, toward the end of the wars was killed by his own people which is quite ironic because so many whites were out for his blood. The indians that killed him were jealous of him because he was looked up to by some whites for his courage in war."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Very little history is known about this mythic man Crazy Horse, but many historians are willing embelish when there is not enough to write about.

McMurtry is a wonderful writer, and those not too concerned with the precision of historic detail will find this book a great read. It is entertaining and informative at the same time, and does much to remind us of a part of history we're not particularly proud of. As one who has written Native American history as seen through contemporary eyes, I know how difficult it is to find an accurate record. But McMurtry demonstrates that the detail that may be lacking isn't necessary to provide a full and no doubt highly accurate account of the larger context into which heroes--Native American or otherwise--must be viewed. This is authentic, and if it attracts a wide following it will have performed a valuable service: We all need to know this story better."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Larry McMurtry (Telegraph Days, Lonesome Dove) brings his clean and concise writing style to this brief but illuminating life of Crazy Horse.This compact little biography is one of the Penguin Lives series that features what Penguin Books web site describes as an \\"innovative series of biographies pairing celebrated writers with famous individuals who have shaped our thinking.\\" The series is worth looking into for its other biographies of Churchill by John Keegan, Buddha by Karen Armstrong, and Saint Augustine by Garry Wills among others.In the case of Crazy Horse not a heck of lot is really known about the man. As McMurtry points out, most of what we know about Crazy Horse and most Indians derives from their contact with whites and Crazy Horse generally avoided whites to the fullest extent possible. He was a brave warrior, a leader of his people at times, but not truly a chief, a loner, an iconoclast within a tribe of iconoclasts.Crazy Horse is an iconic figure who captures the imagination. His life of some 35 or so years spanned the rapid transformation of the West from the free days of the nomadic Plains tribes and limitless buffalo herds to the confinement of those peoples on poor reservations and the destruction of the herds. Crazy Horse never really yielded to the whites unlike nearly all other Indian leaders, not that it mattered much in the grand scheme of things because no strategy was going to change the ultimate outcome. Crazy Horse declined to go to Washington, resisted any restraints, refused to attend the parleys with the whites.He did ultimately sacrifice his own freedom when he brought his 900 or so followers after the brutal winter of 1876-1877 - just months after the twin victories over Crook at Rosebud and Custer at Little Bighorn. Crazy Horse was killed, probably by the bayonet of a white soldier as he resisted his final arrest. His death was a blessing as the whites planned to ship him to Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, a tiny prison atoll in Florida.Unlike other popular authors, notably Stephen Ambrose, McMurtry resists the temptation to let his imagination roam too freely and sticks mostly to the known facts and reasonable deductions to be drawn from them. Those facts however immutably established Crazy Horse as perhaps the single most romantic and heroic figure of the great American Western epic. He lived free, defeated Custer, the great white romantic figure, and then died young \\"in the last moments when the Sioux could think of themselves as free. By an accident of fate, the man and the way of life died together...he came to be the symbol of Sioux freedom, Sioux courage, and Sioux dignity.\\" (Page 17, hardcover edition)Highly recommended for any reader with an interest in the American West."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"McMurtry's writing is smooth and compelling, and he does a fine job reconstructing a biography of Crazy Horse. My problem with the book, however, is that it doesn't really contribute much of anything new to the published scholarship on Crazy Horse. Furthermore, his use of 1990s slang and odd metaphors does not serve the respectful tone with which he gives his subject -- nor will these turns of phrase survive the changing tastes of vernacular literary expression. As a result, McMurtry's slang in the book will look &quot;nerdish, square, unhip, and not-with-it&quot; in, oh, about 3 years. But if you haven't read anything about Crazy Horse, McMurty's book is one good starting place."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I have not previously read a Penguin Lives book so I don't have a point of reference on how much to expect from one of these biographies. I have noted that none of the volumes seem to be any thicker than McMurtry's &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. I will assume that the purpose of this series is that the reader gets a brief overview of the highlights in the lives of an important historical person. That sounds like a nice idea but the question I have regarding &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; is this; Does it half to be THIS brief?I was inclined to accept McMurtry's observation that little factual information exists on Crazy Horse. In fact, I think he's soured me somewhat on reading Mari Sandoz's much lengthier biography. However, this book goes in some strange directions dealing with this paucity of information. For example, in trying to describe the great gathering of Indians at the Ft. Laramie Council of 1851, McMurtry inexplicably quotes Wilfred Thesiger's account of an Ethiopian gathering of African tribesmen. Shortly thereafter, he describes the tribal warfare of the Sioux by quoting Peter Matthiessen's description of tribal warfare in New Guinea in the early 1960's. Well, the primary resources on Native Americans may be limited but not so much that we must wander to other continents for our facts. (On second thought, maybe I WILL read Sandoz's book). McMurtry suggests at one point that it would be &quot;hubris&quot; to think that we can read Crazy Horse's mind. He momentarily passes on speculation of Crazy Horse's thoughts and motives and then spends much of the remainder of the book doing just that. So much of these 141 pages are devoted to events that happened during the time of Crazy Horse that little space is left to the man himself. As a biography of facts this work seems more along the lines of Charlie Browns Christmas vacation book report.However, Larry McMurtry's talent is spinning a tale rather than reporting the facts. This is the saving grace of &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. It reads like a well-written short novel and will leave the reader exasperated but sensing nonetheless that he has just read a good story."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I did not have high expectations about this book given the rather small size of it, but it was on sale so I gave it a try. The first thing the reader comes away with is the impression that the author has a very high regard for Crazy Horse and American Indians as a whole. Because of this esteem the reader is brought along the story believing that Crazy Horse was to the American Indian what Abe Lincoln, George Washington and FDR are to the average American. The story is a little light on overall factual stories, but I think that comes more from the lack of written records by the American Indians and the type of life Crazy Horse lived. From the traditional political leader as we know it today, there are reams of information on the everyday life and the job they held plus an ever increasing schedule and \\"to do\\" list that does not end. In contrast, the American Indians lead a much simpler (not to say less civilized) existence that handled problems with far less bureaucracy. Given that this was the case, this fact explains the volume of know facts about Crazy Horse. Overall this is a very good book that lets you know as much about the man as it also provides the basis for a learned respect for him. If you are interested in this topic I would suggest that this book is a very good first step."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Several series of short biographies have been published in recent years, including the American Presidents series and the Great Generals series, to give busy readers the opportunity to learn about famous individuals in brief compass. In 1999, Penguin Press initiated its \\"Penguin Lives\\" series with this short biography of Crazy Horse by the American novelist, Larry McMurtry. It was an intruiging and appropriate choice. Crazy Horse's life is the stuff of legend. Just a glance at titles here at Amazon shows how much has been written about Crazy Horse on the basis of what remains a thin historical record. Crazy Horse continues to fascinate many people as shown, among other ways, in the many reviews of McMurtry's title here at Amazon and of other books about the great Oglalla Sioux warrior.McMurtry uses his gifts as a novelist and his formidable historical knowledge of the American West to give the reader insight into an elusive person. McMurtry's book constitutes an exploration of the literature and legends surrounding Crazy Horse as much as it constitutes a biography of the man. This is unavoidable given the state of the historical record. With McMurtry's attempt to sift through the legends, Crazy Horse still emerges in his account as an extraordinary figure. McMurtry gives a convincing portrayal of an important and difficult man in a book of 140 pages. McMurtry makes as much as he can of a person with a rare way of life whom we do not know. To his own people, Crazy Horse was known as \\"Our Strange Man\\".In McMurtry's account, Crazy Horse (1840 -- 1877) emerges as a loner and a mystic. From his youngest days, Crazy Horse went his own way. He was a visionary, in common with many of the Sioux, but frequently sought his vision in ways outside tribal tradition. McMurtry imaginatively captures a great deal of Crazy Horse in this description of the dreams, wanderings, and spiritual quests which were a feature of his adolescence and adult life:\\"It is easy on the plains to imagine things not seen, worlds not known. Crazy Horse, in his wanderings over the summer plains, would have seen many mirages, which perhaps encouraged him in his belief that this world, with its buffalo and horses, is only the shadow of the real world. He was in a way a prairie Platonist, seeing an ideal of which the day's events were only a shadow.\\" (pp. 49-50)Crazy Horse was a hunter of buffalo and a leader of his people in skirmishes and fights with other Indians. As a young man, he became one of four tribal members honored with the title of \\"Shirt-Wearer\\" with the responsibility of looking after the well-being of the people, including the poor. When Crazy Horse ran off briefly with Black Buffalo Woman, the wife of another man, he was almost killed by her jealous husband, No Water, and the Tribe was split apart. The rift was healed by intra-tribal diplomacy, but Crazy Horse lost his title of Shirt-Wearer over the incident.Crazy Horse is best-known for his role in three battles with the onrushing white settlers, Fetterman's Massacre of 1868, the Battle of Rosebud in 1876, and most famously the Battle of Little Bighorn against Custer on June 25, 1876. These battles established Crazy Horse's fame as a great military leader of his people although his role in each of them, especially Little Big Horn, remains uncertain.After Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and a group of 900 Indians, exhausted by cold and pursuit, were forced to turn themselves in at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. Four months later, under circumstances that remain difficult to determine, Crazy Horse was tricked into returning to the Fort under a promise of a meeting with the commanding general. Instead, Crazy Horse was to have been exiled to a prison in Florida. A victim of military treachery and of jealousies among his own people, Crazy Horse was assassinated on September 5, 1877.Crazy Horse, for McMurtry, was a man who was not an administrator or a negotiator. He did not surrender or try to adjust to the inevitability of a new way of life, as did some of his compatriots. He remained faithful to the life of a warrior on the lonely plains, to the hunt, and to the mystic vision to the end. As in many cases, Crazy Horse became a figure of legend because this is what his life merited. Even when we are cognizant of what we do not know, as McMurtry is, a remarkable and enigmatic figure emerges. From the Indian wars and tragedies of the American west, McMurtry offers an account of a person whose life and goals were inextricably tied to a particular people and whose story yet remains universal and timeless.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This is my first run at Crazy Horse, so I have nothing to compare it to.

It definitely spurred an interest in the Penguin Lives Series. I've already purchased the book on Mozart."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"As you should expect from a 140-page book, this is by no means a comprehensive biography. It is, however, interesting and entertaining. I went into this book knowing next to nothing about Crazy Horse, and I feel like I came out with a passable idea of where he fits into American history.The author states up front that he isn't going to speculate into areas of Crazy Horse's life where there are no substantial facts. Consequently, much of the book is more of a history of the conflict between the Sioux and the U.S. military than a biography of Crazy Horse. But I do think the author does a good job of giving one a feel for Crazy Horse's place in said conflict."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"McMurtry has created a lean novella from the minimal amount of factual knowledge known about this Strange Man of the Oglalas. He cuts efficiently through the lengthy &amp; speculative romanticism that weighed down previous biographies. We see Crazy Horse before the legend muddied the waters. We see more of the man. But McMurtry seems to completely disregard the Lakota oral tradition and removes his subject from that perspective...a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. If you're looking for an intimate portrait of the man...wade through Mari Sandoz' excellent biography...tempered with McMurtry's clarity. But if you're looking for &quot;just the facts, ma'am&quot;, then I suggest a quick three hour session with Larry McMurtry."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"You are asking for it when you condemn those who have gone before you for doing what you proceed to do yourself. With a historical figure about whom so little is known, speculation is inevitable. All one can really ask is that the speculator be careful and honest about it, as Caleb Carr is in his speculative biography about the source of my pseudonym:The Devil Soldier: The American Soldier of Fortune Who Became a God in China. For the most part IMHO Larry McMurtry IS careful and honest about it, but after reading him taking so many of his predecessors to task for THEIR speculations, I like many reviewers have a lot less tolerance for his own and like many also wonder just what the Hell he was thinking for including descriptions of tribal gatherings in Africa and native warfare in New Guinea in a book about Crazy Horse!I also have to fault him for his noticeable pro-Indian bias. In particular one has to fault his condemnation of whites for their \\"foolish assumption\\" that some sort of leader could be found and negotiated with, without condemning the equally foolish assumption made by the Indians that what was almost from the beginning the strongest tribe imaginable would simply learn to put up with the traditional Indian practice of near anarchy that could burst into violence or open warfare through the uncontrollable actions of a single warrior.Then exactly 100 pages later he is bemoaning, \\"They had a hard time understanding that the Indians they had subdued would really stay subdued.\\" Gee! I wonder why that might be? Could it perhaps be the fact that on more than one occasion \\"the Indians they had subdued\\" DIDN'T \\"stay subdued\\", due to this very lack of anything resembling a leader who could give them orders that would be obeyed? One needn't approve of ANY of the sorry, sordid dealings with the Plains Indians to see that even a more honorable (or at least less dishonorable) course of action would eventually have lead to much the same result, just perhaps with less guilt attached.Still, for a short work on exactly what little is known or credibly surmised about Crazy Horse, this will be hard to beat."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I think this was a really good book.

Again, he spends much of his time trying to sully the reputations of the Military leaders of the period.When one looks at his references it is evident that he spent little time searching for a balanced view of the period."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I did not like this book much at all. I think McMurtry needed to do much more research regarding Lakotas, Crazy Horse, and the Plains Indian Wars of the mid 1900s. I wonder if he spoke or consulted with any Lakota people regarding this work. It would seem he did not. This book doesn't do justice for the topic."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"If &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; is indicative of the quality of the Penguin Lives series, perhaps readers would be better off staying away. The book is dominated as much by McMurtry's towering ego (endless use of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; in a book about someone else) as by the title character. McMurtry even uses descriptions from Africa to describe events in America, as if there weren't first-person accounts from the American West.Had the editor taken the time to do some serious cutting this would have been a decent book. That didn't happen, though, and the result is more than disappointing. If I could get my money back, I would.I expected more from McMurtry and from Penguin's Lives."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"As he states in this volume, it's less a biography than a testament to the impact Crazy Horse had on his own people during and after his life and what he means to Americans today. Illusive yes, but Crazy Horse is a symbol of all that could've been for natives of the plains. He was an Indian who never capitulated, who never gave up on his way of life or on his dreams and those dreams, both figurative and actual, guided him through life and into the walk with the spirits. What does this man mean to us all? He's more than a simple representation. He's an embodiment to self-determination. He's an example of charity and caring of a leader who placed his own people ahead of all else.Unlike Geronimo, who spent time in prison and then ended up selling autographed photos of himself for a dollar apiece to the very white people he'd sworn to kill, Crazy Horse avoided contact with Whites until his last days and never accepted their systems or their ideas of justice. He only came to the reservation because his people were starving. He only talked to the Fort's doctor because his wife had tuberculosis. He never allowed his photograph to be taken and wasn't known for talking much.He took his responsibilities very seriously as a shirt wearer and did everything he could to provide for the poor of his tribe despite preferring to be alone and preferring the open prairie to population centers.I can't help but draw parallels between another mythical figure after reading this tightly told tale. Jesus was said to express great concern for the poor and Crazy Horse was told in a vision that this was his mission in life. Jesus was a symbol for his people of a spiritual life outside the realm of Rome. Crazy Horse was a symbol of a way of life on the plains, free to pursue the Sioux ceremonies and religious observation. Jesus was killed through the betrayal of a friend and stabbed in the side by a Roman spear while hanging from a cross. Crazy Horse was restrained by his friend, the tribal policeman Little Big Man, when he was bayoneted by a soldier. In death, both Christ and Crazy Horse are rallying points for more than just their own people, but for people everywhere.CV Rick"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This book was absolutely pathetic.

It takes his life and tries to disspell rumors and exaggerations and find the truth. It's very sad how the life of Crazy Horse ended and you can't help feel for the plight of the Indians.

It should have a big disclaimer printed on the front of the book: &quot;This book is a work of fiction!&quot;McMurtry has the audacity to malign other writers and researchers for their conclusions and then he proceeds to do the same poor job of second guessing. Throughout the book he continually guesses at where Crazy Horse might have been or what he might have been doing. For the love of writing . . . if you don't know then say so. Don't just write to sell something!The book was the WORST I've bought in years! I've demanded my money back, and I think McMurtry owes us all a big apology for wasting our time!"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I am a fan of the Pengin Lives books. I'll say that up front. But Mr. McMurtry's book on Crazy Horse falls short of the standard the series sets with other works like the book on Rosa Parks. The author has clearly done a great deal of reading and researching to prepare for his task, however, through that he seems to have become bitter about the amount of speculation there has been to fill in the unknown holes of Crazy Horse's story. So he sets out to write a book with just the facts. Nothin' but the facts. And he clings to his effort by breezing past events of the day that were influencing Crazy Horse's life both directly and indirectly. He drops names and dates and places as if we had all done the research with him. In the end the writing and tone of McMurtry's work culminates in a dud of a biography that is lacking in richness. I won't go so far as to say that there is nothing to be learned from reading this book (as some other reviewers have said); I learned a thing or two. I am just left with the feeling that Mr. McMurtry has squandered a great opportunity by pinning himself to flimsy rules out of seeming contempt for other authors on the subject. For shame."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"What was wrong with Mr. McMurtry here? This book has no blood in its veins. He circles Lakota culture without entering into it. He seems more curious than anything else. If you want to know about Crazy Horse, read Ambrose. If you want to know about the Lakota world view, read Neither Wolf nor Dog by Nerburn. McMurtry should stick to cowboys, which he does better than almost anyone else. Crazy Horse didn't want to be photographed. Maybe he didn't want to be written about either."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"As I read this book, I couldn't help feeling that Mr. Mc Murtry would have been better off not writing this book. So eloquent about cowboys and the West in his other books, he comes across as stilted, disgruntled, and disconnected in this brief biography. Ultimately, Mr. Mc Murtry sems overwhelmed by having little, undisputed written evidence to work with.Crazy Horse has become a symbol to many, either as a brave warrior, a determined resister facing overwhelming odds, or as an authentic Native American hero. Mr. Mc Murtry deplores the myth-making in what has been written about Crazy Horse by other biographers. On the other hand, Mr. Mc Murtry does not approach the familiar historian's problem of overcoming bias with any particular rigor or insight. In fact, it seemed to me like he may not be familiar enough with the works of historians who have addressed this problem. So, the book often laments and displays the problems of writing history with few documented facts, but doesn't describe or handle the problem very smoothly.In addition, by wanting to separate himself from the myth of Crazy Horse, Mr. Mc Murtry potentially leaves the reader who is new to the subject wondering why anyone cares about Crazy Horse. Mr. Mc Murtry writes this book as though every reader has already read every other major reference about Crazy Horse. While I have had the benefit of reading many of those sources, I must say that such an approach is highly unusual and less than helpful.What jolted me the most about the book was the use of complex language to describe a man who lived a simple life. If anyone needed Hemingway as a biographer, it was Crazy Horse. Often, those who use complex language do so out of a sense of discomfort with their subject matter. Could that have been the case with Mr. Mc Murtry.Unless you have a compelling need to shrink Crazy Horse's legend down to size in your mind, I suggest you skip this book. But don't skip Mr. Mc Murtry. He is one of our very finest writers about the cowboys and the settling of the West.If you do read this book, think about what you would like to have known about Crazy Horse that is not portrayed here, but could have been discussed. For example, from a psychological point of view what does it mean for a son not to follow his father's religious beliefs? What kind of childhood events often cause this to occur in Native American cultures? What might have happened to Crazy Horse, based on clues in other aspects of his behavior?Listen for the dogs that don't bark, as well as those that do in writing history!"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Crazy Horse died at Ft Robinson on September 6, 1877, that much is certain.

If you are interested in him, this is a short and information-packed read."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This is the third Penguin Lives volume I've read and I find the series is holding up to positive first impressions. The Lives books are short, averaging around 200 pages each, but are saved from being mere outlines by creative matchmaking of subject with author. In CRAZY HORSE, Larry McMurtry, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Lonesome Dove, takes on one of the legendary Indians of the 19th century American west. Like the as yet unfinished monument of him that is being carved out of the Black Hills of the Dakotas, Crazy Horse looms large in oral tradition and is the subject of some weighty tomes, including a biography by controversial historian Stephen Ambrose. Despite the heft of the Crazy Horse canon, McMurtry says that the actual facts of his life are wispy and he chooses to devote his book to sorting the man from the fiction. In doing so, he offers up a lucid picture of the changing state of Indian culture as Manifest Destiny chewed its way across the plains. What facts do come to light reveal Crazy Horse as better suited to his culture's past, a reluctant though dutiful leader who preferred wandering alone in the hills. At one point, McMurtry makes a quiet observation of dust kicked up on a latterday trail ride, an image that becomes a central metaphor expressing the problem of retrieving a truth that has been filtered through so many biases. Some readers may be at a slight disadvantage because McMurtry assumes the reader possesses a certain amount of familiarity with the facts of Little Big Horn and the legends. Some may be disappointed that this book offers less about the man then about politics, both Indian and white, and the process of historical investigation and perspective. I think it is a fine meditation on all subjects. McMurtry is unafraid to express a controversial opinion."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"The Sioux ChristCrazy Horse was perhaps the most enigmatic - and celebrated - Indian leader. He was neither a chief nor a frequent combatant in the wars that emptied the West for white settlement. He was a loner and even a bit of an oddball. In the end, his own people despised him - and took part in his murder. Yet among Indians today, Crazy Horse is considered the greatest of warriors, a man who defiantly resisted white intrusion, who was so charitable he earned the nickname &quot;Sioux Christ.&quot; Larry McMurtry embraces the unenviable task of distilling this man in &quot;Crazy Horse,&quot; part of the Penguin Lives series. It's a rather interesting project, in which famed authors study the great figures of our past. (Jane Smiley, for example, will soon publish a biography of Charles Dickens.) McMurtry (&quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;) isn't a historian. That's what makes this book compelling. Instead of the trudging prose of academia, we're treated to a more literary take on Crazy Horse - part storytelling, part analysis. This wasn't an easy job. Crazy Horse spent much of his life shunning whites. He also shunned most of his tribe, preferring to be alone. Hence, there's little documentation on his life. And most of what's been written since is wracked by speculation. Where McMurtry excels in dissecting the many myths. Unlike many Indian biographers, he doesn't fall for the idyllic &quot;noble savage&quot; viewpoint. He condenses Crazy Horse down to a good man, perhaps a great man, confused by an era of rapid change. McMurtry doesn't have a historian's zeal. He spends much of the book dissecting the work of others instead of producing his own. At 140 pages, this is something of a Cliff Notes biography - not commensurate with the $19.95 retail price."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"A lean and powerful book very well written. Lean because the author wrote only what is actually know about Crazy Horse but places this information in the context of the places and events surrounding him. For the reader who wants to read more about those events and the speculations about Crazy Horse's participation in them as well as his character, a bibliography is included. I am a great fan of McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; trilogy and am certainly able to discriminate between fiction and the unadorned truth of &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"McMurtry writes a good, enjoyable, concise biography of Crazy Horse - he complains from time to time about other historians writing such extended works on a subject we know so little about, yet ocassionally I felt McMurtry himself skipped over some points without discussing things very much. Interestingly enough, it makes reading this book feel like writing history yourself - the facts are there, but always fragmentary, scattered, and contradictory. If nothing else, it's true to the feel of the source material - there are few hypothetical suggestions here, and when you do find one, it's clearly labelled as such.Nevertheless, there are two distinct advantages this book has. First, the author, having travelled in the territories where these events took place, provides some wonderful and fairly insightful thoughts on several events, such as the role that dust would have played during the battle of Little Bighorn (the author rode horses over the field himself). Second, he actually provides a pretty good summary of some major written works concerning Crazy Horse prior to the time this was published (1999). Though a few important things have of course appeared since then, this is a great place to start if you're new to the subject. If you're not, then you should already know that the Penguin Lives series is not where to look for serious, in-depth research.Overall - an enjoyable and concise read, which makes a good stepping stone to other works on Crazy Horse. Not an in-depth history, but a good meat-and-bones biography in the classic, old-school style. Definitely worth a spot on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Crazy Horse has been one of my American heroes ever since I read about him in \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West\\" by Dee Brown back in the 1970's. When I discovered that Larry McMurtry, a favorite author of mine, had written a biography of Crazy Horse, the book immediately made the top of my TBR list! And glad I am that I did immerse myself in this brief but rich biography. As usual, McMurtry does not disappoint - nor does his subject.Despite extensive writings about the great Sioux warrior Crazy Horse, there is actually a dearth of hard facts about his life. The man was born around 1840, at a time when the nomadic way of life of the Plains Indians was dying....or to be more accurate, at a time when the traditional way of life was stomped out though the US government's broken promises, lies, ineptitude, and the sheer number of US soldiers with rifles and their seemingly never-ending supply of ammunition. Manifest Destiny was very much a reality and it could not be fulfilled while nomadic tribes roamed the Great Plains hunting buffalo, \\"impeding progress,\\" the westward march of settlers, the building of the railroads.What kind of written historical record would there be of a man who lived the life of a Sioux warrior, \\"raiding and hunting on the central plains?\\" He rarely had contact with whites until the end of his life. And what translations exist are appalling.Worm, his father was an Oglala healer; his mother was thought to be the sister of Spotted Tail, the Brule leader. From the first, Crazy Horse, called Curly as a boy, marched to the beat of his own drum. He was a loner and although he lived in the traditional way, he was not interested in the usual rituals of purification, like the sundance rite. \\"He took his manhood as a given and proved it in battle at an early age.\\"He went on a journey as a young man, to seek a vision. Never orthodox in his beliefs or behavior, Curly did not purify himself in the ancient ways nor did he speak with a holy man, such as his own father, before making the trip. The vision or dream he achieved on this quest, and the interpretation, were to prove very significant throughout his life. There are enough consistent reports about this episode to prove its authenticity.The author takes the known facts about the period, as well as material garnered from documented interviews with Native Americans and whites who knew Crazy Horse, and recreates here a vivid portrait of the warrior, the human being who cared first and foremost for his people - for the very young, the sick and elderly - the man of such moral authority that he sparked deadly jealousy amongst some of his own men. \\"Among a broken people an unbroken man can only rarely be tolerated.\\" Crazy Horse \\"became a too-painful reminder of what the people as a whole had once been.\\"McMurtry, also paints a clear and accurate picture of the place, the times, the large Native American councils, of the Ghost Dance, the battles, the parlays, the betrayals. He recounts a much reported conversation Crazy Horse, near the end of his life, had with his old friend He Dog. General George Cook wanted all the Sioux at Red Creek \\"to move across the creek, nearer to White Butte, so he would have them handy for a big council. He Dog thought it might be best to do as he was told.\\" Crazy Horse did not want to make the move for his own reasons. He Dog, concerned about what the move might mean for their friendship asked Crazy Horse if \\"such a move on his part would mean they were enemies now. Crazy Horse laughed, perhaps for the last time; then he reminded He Dog that he was not speaking to a white man. Whites were the only ones, he said, who made rules for other people. Camp where you please.\\"Larry Mc Murtry invites the reader to camp where we please amid the recountings and recollections of the life of the legend who was Crazy Horse. This is a brief but beautifully written story of a life...and of a death. It is also a tribute to a great man.Apparently Penguin has published a series of brief biographies called \\"Penguin Lives.\\" James Atlas, the editor, plans for six volumes a year from \\"celebrated writers on famous individuals who have shaped our thinking.\\" The list includes the Buddha, St. Augustine, Joan of Arc, Dante, Mozart, Jane Austen, Dickens and Chekhov. Unfortunately I only see two women on his list. I sincerely hope this grave omission is corrected.JANA"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I read this slender volume on a whim after spotting it at a friend's beach house on a rainy day. Who hasn't heard of Crazy Horse? But who knows the first thing about him?Like some other reviewers, I am struck by the paucity of facts at McMurtry's disposal, yet I found that McMurtry readily acknolwleged this shortcoming while creating a deeply moving narrative that brought home to me the \\"greek\\" tragedy in a larger story - the annihilation of Native American cultures - that is normally either glossed over or deeply fetishized by observers who describe people like the Lakota in hyper-idealistic terms.The military and technological superiority of the Americans probably doomed the Lakota from the start. The reaction of Crazy Horse, while in many ways admirable, was futile in the face of it. The tragedy and the crime in the story was that appeasement did not prevent an old culture from having everything it knew and believed and practiced swept away before most of the participants had any appreciation for what was happening."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Why write hundreds of pages about a man who died young and shunned the public? Should one spend time to digest one author's guesswork, maybe comparing it to another author's? McMurty did us all a favor by cutting out everything not known as fact. So little is known about Crazy Horse that it can easily contained in this small volume. We are given a concise portrait of the man, his life and his aspirations. We are also given an almost poetic feel of his surroundings and the struggle to hold on to it. If you want to learn about Crazy Horse, this book will not lead you astray. If you want bells and whistles, look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This was the first of the exceptional Penguin Lives series of short form biographies. What differentiates this book from the others in the series is that very little information about its subject exists outside of legend. As such, this is one of the Penguin short biography books that a lengthier story is not likely necessary. Karen Armstrong&#65533;s book on Buddha had a similar limitation, but she used the opportunity to lecture on the development and meaning of the Buddhist religion.Several years ago, I read and enjoyed Mari Sandoz&#65533;s biography on C.H., but the book left me to wonder how much of the story was truth versus fiction. The novelist, Larry McMurtry, authored this Penguin Lives version and convincingly separated the C.H. facts from fiction. Far from diminishing the character, the author gives a more appealing portrait of the man who will always be an enigmatic historical figure.I, for one, appreciate the author&#65533;s honesty and the &#65533;grayness&#65533; of the character&#65533;s story. I think it is more a sign of weakness for a biographer to invent facts to enhance the story. It is certainly disingenuous and non-academic. McMurtry gives more than one example of this form of literary excess especially when mentioning Stephen Ambrose&#65533;s biography on C.H. Interestingly, the latter&#65533;s excesses seem to now have caught up with him as shown in the plagiarism charges that have followed his more recent works.The quality of this book, though, is in the warmth and dignity that the author gives to his subject. Crazy Horse was a solitary and misunderstood figure to even his own people. His is also a story of how greed and jealousy by his people led to his early death. McMurtry does not try to make the man more than what he was or would have been. The book gives the reader the opportunity to appreciate the simplicity of Crazy Horse. By not engaging in pseudo psychoanalysis, and literary commercialism, the author gives his subject what C.H. seemed to have always wanted when alive, his privacy."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Crazy Horse has been puzzled over by genertions of historians.

A loner in a non-literate community, even the stories of Crazy Horse's sparse interactions with whites were often based on speculation and conjecture.I did find this book to provide an interesting narrative of the life and warfare of the Plains Indians in the period after the Civil war.In this book we see the Indians as very individualistic. The Indian Chiefs, of which Crazy Horse was not one, while exercising considerable influence, could not, in many cases, control the actions of individual braves. While we often tend to think of the Indians as a monolithic nation opposing white expansion, they consisted, in fact, of independent, autonomous bands which would fight limited struggles against whites over specific territories or grievances. The struggle by the Indians under Red Cloud over the forts on the Bozeman trail was one instance in which the Indians were successful in turning back the tide of white expansion for several years.Individual battles, such as the Fetterman massacre, are described in interesting detail.As for Crazy Horse himself, such details of his life as are known are related. The details of his names, his dream experience, his romantic entanglements and finally his death from stabbing by a soldier while being held by an Indian, are described in detail. The obscurity of Crazy Horse's life may be one of his most alluring qualities, for by permitting each of us to impute to this Indian hero the attributes which seem most attractive to us, he grows from a man to a legend. As he rides out of the mists of history, Crazy Horse can be seen as the heroic warrior who never compromised or surrendered. That is the Crazy Horse portrayed by Larry McMurtry and the legend who, when his statue is completed, will ride forever over his Black Hills home."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Larry McMurtry lays out exactly how little is known for certain about Crazy Horse. There are many contradictory reports for just about every major event in his life, and McMurtry points this out, tells you what they were, and then tells you what he thinks, whereas most biographers pick what they believe and then tell the story as if that were the way it was. But I think he gets to some important truths about the man and about the way life was for the Sioux around this time. I was very moved by this small but powerful book about someone I had heard about and read about my entire life."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"This little book is not intended as an exhaustive study or complete biography of the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse, yet McMurtry succeeds in providing enough detail, wading through historical speculation, and imparting his own views to get a clear picture of Crazy Horse without propagating further falsehoods or myths. McMurtry's concise descriptions of Indian life, government politics, soldiers, and various battles come together to demonstrate how a biography can be effective without unnecessary and often fabricated decoration of facts.Obviously well-researched and presented objectively, Crazy Horse the man, and the events of his life, are presented without conjecture and without fanfare in a honest, straight forward manner, whetting the reader's appetite for further study of not only Crazy Horse but white man's relationship to the American Indian. Especially refreshing is McMurtry's acknowledgment of the lack of historical scholarship over the details of Crazy Horse's life. As the facts are presented, McMurtry also presents the various accounts, leaving the conclusions to the reader. As opposed to the dogmatic assertions often found in history books, this book freely admits not to know everything, but also keeps the energy alive with factual stories.McMurtry's humor can't help but shine forth occasionally with various statements such as \\"...sealing Custer's doom while, incidentally, making an excellent movie role for Errol Flynn and a number of other leading men.\\" His writing style is smooth, informative, descriptive, engaging, and consistent.

I was exceptionally pleased with it. I guess just about anyone who has read anything of the West covering the period from the 1830's to the end of the century;knows something about Crazy Horse. There are so many references and they vary so much,one has difficulty in trying to separate fact from legend.Mc Murtry puts on his historian hat for this one and tries ,and I might add very suscessfully,to sort it all out. To attempt such a thing,could result in a very long book with reams of details and references;but McMurtry has managed to avoid that;and comes up with a concise,easy to follow book that covers the whole Western Indian experience centered around one of the most prominent Indian leaders at the time.On top of that he builds into it references of other books where the \\"story\\" may differ;and where there is differences or actual unknown details;he addresses them. He also refrains from \\"making up\\" details and introducing them;which would do nothing but add to the confusion.When you finish this book ,you will be left with the impression that you now know the story about as well as one can possibly know it,particularly at this stage of the game."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"There is too much political correctness in this book to really get a good view of Crazy Horse other than some mythic figure of the Great Plains.

That's what first popped into my head when I finished the last page of McMurty's Crazy Horse. In his zeal to dispense with speculation, theory and assumption -- to demystify the life of Crazy Horse -- McMurtry essentially gutted it and leaves us only with the bare bones of cold, dead facts. He writes of the Lakota people's hero almost as dispassionately as one might write for a seed catalog.I agree with Stephan Oates, a well known biographer of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr., that a biographer's task is to &quot;conjure life from leavings&quot; and &quot;to elicit from cold fact the warmth of a life as it was lived&quot;. In that regard a biographer is an &quot;artist on oath&quot; and here McMurtry fails miserably as he is not able to flesh out a comprehensive &quot;canvas&quot; of the emotional, spiritual and intellectual make-up of Crazy Horse, nor does he reveal him to us within the full context of the history, ethos and social complex of Lakota culture. McMurtry's book is incomplete as biography and is much more a critique or commentary on existing historical writings concerning the life of Crazy Horse.At the start of his book McMurtry attempts to dupe us into believing that he is going to take the &quot;high road&quot; by being objective, sticking to the facts, avoiding any speculation or imbuing of unsubstantiated words, thoughts and feelings into his portrayal of Crazy Horses's life. As McMurtry himself professes, neither he nor anyone else has &quot;an accurate grip on the deeds, much less the soul, of the Sioux warrior we call Crazy Horse&quot;. Unfortunately, he doesn't deliver very well on this front either as McMurtry has scattered throughout the narrative his own speculations and insights into how Crazy Horse may have felt in certain situations or what motivated him to react the way he did to circumstances we know he encountered in his life. It's interesting to note that ofttimes where McMurtry chooses to insert insights into the character of this man beyond the cold facts, it usually does not place him in a very heroic light. For example, McMurtry doesn't hesitate to speculate on Crazy Horse's state of mind during the weeks following his surrender when he suggests that he was &quot;confused, stressed, off-balance, and finally, a desparate man&quot;. McMurtry further offers that &quot;from his (Crazy Horse) personal point of view probably the best thing that came out of this move (surrender) was that Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy offered to treat Black Shawl, his wife, for her tuberculosis...&quot;; suggesting here that Crazy Horse was preoccupied only with his own personal interests and not those of his community during this time of crisis.Another fanciful tale I found rather disturbing, even though McMurtry tried cover himself by adroitly declaring it speculation once the &quot;canvas was fully painted&quot;, was his suggestion that Crazy Horse opted for death rather than a life of imprisonment because he was not as &quot;tough a nut as Sitting Bull or Geronimo&quot;, both of whom endured the white man's confinement. What I found disturbing is why he bothered to speculate at all on this notion unless he was trying subtly to implant in the reader's mind that Crazy Horse's resistance up to the end was merely a form of suicide or cowardly escape from the troubles that lay ahead.Where he does attempt to trek along the &quot;high road&quot; of empiricism, McMurtry falls into a far more pernicious trap, which is to deny the character or soul of Crazy Horse its due in an extremist's effort to stick to the hard facts. One such example in the book is McMurtry's treatment of the circumstances surrounding Crazy Horse's death. Almost all accounts of Crazy Horse's death reflect that after he was bayoneted by a sentry at Fort Robinson while struggling to resist being placed in the guardhouse, he was carried off to the Adjutant General's office. Upon arrival, Crazy Horse refused a cot and was placed on the floor to die. Instead of concluding that the refusal of the cot was evidence that Crazy Horse was his own man to the end, McMurtry displays his extremism of objectivity, while at the same time his complete lack of empathy for his subject, by suggesting that such a conclusion is just the speculations of others who have written about the account. Come On! What are the alternative interpretations.....that Crazy Horse was merely a stubborn, uncooperative SOB to the bitter end for no other reason than the mere sake of it, or that he simply preferred the comfort of the hard floor to the cot...???To conclude from what we know about his death at Fort Robinson that Crazy Horse was his own man to the end is a conclusion about his character that is consistent with the other facts of his life. The fact that he refused to allow his picture to be taken by white men, the fact that he refused to embrace the white man's culture during the course of his life, the fact that he refused to go to Washington with other chiefs to commiserate with the &quot;great white father&quot;, the fact that he refused to engage in negotiations or compromises with Indian agents or generals when it came to Lakota land or the Lakota way of life cannot be ignored or dismissed. When the facts surrounding his refusal to accept the cot are viewed in this context, it enables us to resurrect from the dead certain apsects of his character and soul.There really isn't anything new I can find of substance in McMurtry's biography of Crazy Horse, and in my opinion, it serves best as cliff notes with personal commentary (by a cynical, old curmudgeon I might add) on other works that have come before. The one caution I have for prospective readers is my sense of an underlying bias behind his treatment of Crazy Horse as an ex post facto symbol of Sioux freedom, Sioux courage and Sioux dignity and not as a man who lived a heroic life. I suspect that it is McMurtry's belief that this symbol was created as the stuff of legends to ease the pain of both the survivors of a broken people and those who broke them. When it comes right down to it, for McMurtry, there is no real hero behind the legend at all.If you are interested in a biography of Crazy Horse that will bring his character to life in the full context of the Sioux culture, I recommend Mari Sandoz's Crazy Horse, The Strange Man of the Oglalas."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"Unless you're interested in the inner musings of McMurtry, don't bother with this hefty-priced, hard-bound 'pamphlet.'

I'd like to read several of the other volumes in this series, but I feel so ripped off by this one that I won't buy another."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"What are McMurtry's qualifications to write about Crazy Horse, one wonders? Does he know the Lakota people? Has he lived among them? Has he heard their oral tradititions? Does he have the vaguest idea of what Crazy Horse means to Crazy Horse's people? In general, James Atlas, editor of the Penuin series of short biographies, is on the right track in not seeking academic scholars and similar authorities to write these books, but SOME expertise, one would think, would not be amiss, especially in dealing with a figure so lost in myth as this compelling Oglala.

McMurtry also writes novels and needs to stick to the form."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse (Penguin Lives)","review":"I am a great McMurtry fan (Lonesome Dove, etc.).

First, the authors unfairly characterizes the defendants, overemphasizing the pseudo-occult nature of Damien Echols' behavior that led to the prosecution's \\"Satanic Panic\\" theory -- one which was supported at trial by testimony from an \\"expert\\" who received his degree from a mail-order diploma-mill. This genius testified that one sign of occult behavior was the wearing of dark clothes, \\"black dungarees ... sometimes they will tattoo themselves.\\" Under this standard, half of Philadelphia could be argued to be Satanic. Yet, despite this incredible theory and even more incredible testimony, the authors really have nothing to say about it.Moreover, the authors gloss over the patent weaknesses in the prosecution's case, including a total lack of physical evidence linking the defendants to the murder. Unless, that is, you count black T-shirts, many of which were seized from Damien Echols' house, as somehow being dispositive of guilt under the \\"Satanic Panic\\" theory.Most disturbingly, the book almost completely fails to mention that the West Memphis PD's investigation of the murders was botched to perfection -- including the coerced confession of Jesse Misskelley, who was borderline retarded, and the failure of the police to investigate John Mark Byers, father of one of the murdered boys, despite somewhat strong evidence which arguably linked him to the murders.All of this likely led to three innocent boys being placed on Arkansas' Death Row while the real killer roams free.For a much more balanced and thorough portrayal of the case and the investigation -- or, more appropriately, misinvestigation -- read _Devil's Knot_ by Marla Leverett, who covered the story for the _Arkansas Times_"},{"Title":"The Blood of Innocents: The True Story of Multiple Murder in West Memphis, Arkansas","review":"Although this book seemingly attempts to present Damien, Jesse and Jason as guilty; the authors piece together a poor attempt at presenting hard evidence that the three had anything to do with the Robin Hood Hills Murders.While there are a lot of facts left out of this outdated book, and while new evidence has surfaced, as well as some of the testimony being recanted or proven false, I found it a good companion to Devil's Knot by Mara Leveritt.I also encourage any reader of this book that is not familiar with the case to do some extra research...there are a TON of people online that have been very willing to help and answer questions if you are confused.As long as you don't rely on everything this book has within it as fact, and it is used as a companion with new and current information, I suppose it is worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Blood of Innocents: The True Story of Multiple Murder in West Memphis, Arkansas","review":"This book is long on supposition and short on objective fact.

This case has turned out to be a very controversial one with seriously troubling questions about the manner in which the defendants were identified, incriminated, and prosecuted. But these authors, two of whom covered the trial as newspaper reporters, pretty much miss the story concerning those issues and instead choose to report on every lurid bit of unsubstantiated rumor and gossip concerning Satanic rituals and orgies and sacrifices that they can find; no tale is too absurd, no accusation too outrageous, to be harped on. A goth magazine found in the trash of one of the defendant's girlfriends gets twice as much ink (two pages worth) as the trial testimony of a defense expert witness on false confessions, an issue that is perhaps the central point of contention in this case. Two more pages go to a juvenile in confinement who is obviously improvising a false story about local Satanic street gangs affiliated with Bloods and Crips, while another defense expert who testifies about the lack of factual evidence or scientific basis to support the then-trendy theory of a national occult crime wave gets less than one page.Like national reporters who have recently been embarrassed by simply believing and uncritically reporting stories from government officials about things such as the Jessica Lynch ordeal, stories which it is now obvious were largely invented by those officials, these reporters basically accepted the word of the authorities - prosecution and police - hook, line, and sinker without doing any critical investigatory work. To take one example that represents the blind trust that these reporters had in the accuracy of what they were being told by officials, the authors repeatedly express how amazing of a coincidence it is that the case number happened to be 0666; it seems so improbable that a case in which the police claim teenage Satanists were involved would happen to get, just by chance, the number of the beast. But they quote the lead detective as their authority that this is purely a coincidence, and they accept his word. Had they only paid a bit more attention to the case files, though, they would have discovered what the author of the other book on this case discovered, which is that the earliest reports from this case were originally numbered 0555; apparently, this was not some \\"coincidence\\" after all, but a deliberate act.The book's Postscript, written years after the rest of the text, does acknowledge, though, that the authors may have erred when they wrote the disputable claim that, at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the defendant Damien Echols, \\"all doubts that police had the wrong man began to evaporate.\\" Apparently with the benefit of some hindsight, they have revised their stance and now claim that \\"given the void of evidence in this case - and developments since the trials - Echols' contentions [of innocence] may merit another look.\\"And another book. \\"Devil's Knot\\" is a superior account in almost every way. However, all of this is not to say that \\"The Blood of Innocents\\" is not worth reading at all. It can be seen as a supplement to the other book; it does contain some useful background and interesting descriptions of the towns involved, and it describes early leads and police interrogations of other initial suspects that went nowhere. But for a detailed, accurate, insightful account of how this case unfolded, you have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Blood of Innocents: The True Story of Multiple Murder in West Memphis, Arkansas","review":"After seeing HBO's movies \\"Paradise Lost\\" and \\"Revelation\\" I had to know more.This is actually a very difficult book to find so get it now if you want to read it it may not be available tomorrow.This book goes more in depth into the actual case that HBO's documentaries do. The book is also reported without any of the favor that the documentaries showed the kids.But, by and large this book did exactly what I though it would do. It solidified my opinion and belief that the kids convicted in this case are without question innocent.The West Memphis, Arkansas PD should be investigated and prosecuted for their inept investigation and the so obvious disdain held for the convicted kids that the whole process from investigation to prosecution was a formality because this conviction was going to happen no matter what evidence was brought to light..."},{"Title":"The Blood of Innocents: The True Story of Multiple Murder in West Memphis, Arkansas","review":"I bought this book and The Devils Knot for a report for school.

To any Bill Knott fans, this is a must have. And to anyone unfamiliar with his poetry, you should immediately check it out; it is a very unique combination of formalism, surrealism and futurism. These isms don't quite cover it, however. He seems to be looking at the entire English lexicon, from ultra-modern slang to archaicisms, when he composes his poems, choosing fresh and surprising combinations of words to fill every line.Some of the best works in the book are his sonnets. (In the future I would love to see a collection of just his sonnets.) I didn't count them, but there are more than twenty sonnets in the collection and each is excellent. Knott uses the form of (usually) the Petrachan sonnet to make entirely fresh and moving poems again and again. One of the most impressive and entertaining of his sonnets is, \\"The Sonnet in ix\\" (which was first published, I believe, in an earlier, truly excellent, Bill Knott BOA edition book entitled, \\"The Quicken Tree\\"). The poem is a translation/parody of the Mallerme sonnet. Knott shows off his linguistic prowess by rhyming every line with \\"ix\\" without in anyway compromising the poem.

Determined to rise above the drudgery and poverty of her upbringing, Margie finds a job at a small business nearby and attempts to escape her overbearing mother and her overworked,disillusioned father. Before long, she meets Frankie Malone, a poor Brooklynite like herself, and the two fall headlong into courtship and marriage. Despite differences between her and Frankie, and some difficulties in her relationship with her parents, Margie still hopes that &quot;tomorrow will be better.&quot;Perhaps more than many of her other books, &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Better&quot; showcases Betty Smith's boundless abilities. Although the synopsis of this book may sound unassuming and dull, with Smith's writing the story becomes rich and eye-opening. Never have I found another author who can take an ordinary life and an ordinary situation (such as Margie's) and fill it with such truth and wisdom so that it becomes powerful. Smith has a rare gift for truly putting herself &quot;in her characters' shoes&quot; and seamlessly weaving their differing stories together to form a believable novel. While &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Better&quot; is ultimately a sad story, its sadness is fitting, realistic, and handled extremely will. This story of optimism, dreams, and disillusionment may not be quite the show-stopping masterpiece that &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is, yet it deserves to be read for its excellent characterization and deep truth."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"This book is often compared to Smith's opus \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" and thus many readers miss what is truly great about this book. Whereas \\"Brooklyn\\" chronicles Francie's growth within her family from child to woman while weaving in the perspective of her mother, father, aunts, etc., \\"Tomorrow\\" is purely about Margie.\\"Tomorrow\\" begins with 16-year-old Margie getting her first job in Brooklyn. It chronicles her courtship and marriage to Frankie, a neighborhood boy with his own family issues i.e. overbearing mother, loud father, myriad sisters. Margie's own parents are none too attentive to their daughter and what she might need, but feel pangs of loss when she decides to get married.Margie tries to please her mother, mother-in-law, and husband, make ends meet, gets pregnant, and gradually all of these adult conventions that she is supposed to want threaten to destroy her unless she stands up to all of them. Only then will she truly be an adult.This is an excellent account of a girl becoming a woman and proving it is an internal, not external, journey. The tale is as true today as it was in the 1940s. Female readers will identify with many of the sentiments expressed in this book and find themselves comparing their own lives to it."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"There is something about the way Betty Smith writes that just pulls me deep into her life.

I am there with her characters, inside their lives as they are living them.Like in \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" the Irish/American impoverished desperation and the raw immediacy of young life are stark and vivid in \\"Tomorrow will be Better.\\" Parents who never had a chance to develop emotional and physical resources themselves, are brutal toward their children. The children have not lost hope for a better life, but they see people who have given up all around them. As a prejudiced on-looker, I am driven to hope that they get the opportunity to be loved and loving and rise above their parents' frightening existence.This is just as riveting as the rest of her books. I only wish that there were more!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"The author of the classic, bestselling coming of age story, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", will delight her fans with this book, which is evocative of lower middle class life in Brooklyn. While this book may not have the poignancy of her classic bestseller, it will, nonetheless, hold the interest of her fans. It is a story of dashed hopes and dreams, as well as that of bitter disillusionment from which the well-spring of hope arises, like a phoenix out of the ashes.Margy Shannon grew up in the early part of the twentieth century, living a hand-to-mouth, hardscrabble existence in Brooklyn with her mother and father. Her parents, living embittered and estranged lives under the same roof, made Margy want to grow up and live happily ever after with the man of her dreams and with children of her own whom she would treat better than the way her own unhappy mother treated her.When Margy was seventeen, she left school to work as a mail reader for a mail order firm, as she was expected to contribute financially to her parents' household. Margy enjoyed her job and very much liked her boss, Mr. Prentiss, with whom she felt a connection. She also developed camaraderie and friendships with the other girls with whom she worked. Life was finally getting good for Margy, and then she met Frankie Malone.Frankie Malone was a guy from the neighborhood, an ambitious young man from a rough-and-tumble Irish family, upon whom Margy had a crush. Through happenstance, they began dating. When he asked her to marry him, Margy thought she had died and gone to heaven. Little did she know that she was on the path to a living hell.Margy had seen marriage as a beginning to a new and wonderful life. Unfortunately, there were a number of issues that were unexpected and would serve to throw a bit of a monkey wrench into her plans. Margy's and Frankie's respective families loathed each other, adding tension to their relationship. What loomed larger in their marriage, however, was Frankie's avoidance of physical contact. In fact, his sexual orientation seemed ambiguous and his desires, ambivalent, causing Margy no end of consternation.Moreover, Frankie was also reluctant to have children. Still, Margy was determined to make her marriage, such as it was, work. When she finally got pregnant, Frankie's reaction to her having his baby began the sounding of the death knell of their marriage. When tragedy struck, the bonds of that marriage began fully unraveling, making Margy realize that the life she had envisioned was simply a fairytale and that she had to make some tough decisions, if she was to have a better tomorrow."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"Although not in the same league with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, this novel is definitely vintage Smith, and worth the read.

Like many other Irish-Americans in early 20th century Brooklyn, her parents have just enough money to squeak by, and the stress of it all causes endless fights. Margy's mother Flo is a domineering personality, and having constant financial worries doesn't make life in the Shannon household any more pleasant.Having just graduated high school, Margy sets out to find a job, where she can help with the family finances...and most importantly, bide her time until she meets a man to marry and finally leave her unhappy home.Margy quickly becomes accustomed to life in the Thomson-Jonson Mail Order Company, where she works as a mail reader with dozens of other girls her age. She greatly enjoys being part of a group, being held responsible for doing a good job, and best of all, her confidences and good times with Reenie, her new best friend.Meanwhile, Margy begins seeing Frankie Malone, a boy from her own neighborhood. Although Irish-American and of a similar socioeconomic background just like the Shannons, the two families instantly take a great dislike to one another...which grows even hotter as Margy and Frankie decide to marry.However, Margy's joy at leaving her home and beginning a new life of her own quickly sours. She learns that life with a young man she doesn't truly love -- or who loves her -- isn't all that wonderful, no matter how hard she tries to make it work.Like real life, Smith does not promise happy endings for any of her characters. Yet when the book concludes, readers will still feel hope for Margy in the future..."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"I love the book, it was in great condition.

Amazing, and worth buying"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"Of Betty Smith's four novels, \\"Tomorrow Will Be Better\\" is second-best only to \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" (\\"Joy in the Morning\\" and \\"Maggie-Now\\" ranking third and fourth).It took Smith two decades and four books to finally give one of her main female characters a decent, normal husband, in \\"Joy in the Morning.\\" In her first three novels, husbands are either losers or freaks. In \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" Francie's father (her mother's first husband) is a drunk loser. In \\"Maggie-Now,\\" Maggie's father is an insufferable jerk and her husband is a weirdo slacker who charms with his looks and charisma but tortures Maggie with his asinine \\"free spirit\\" lifestyle. But wait till you get a load of Margy's husband in \\"Tomorrow Will Be Better.\\" This guy is a real piece of work. Confused as to his sexual orientation, unable to make any emotional commitment, he gives most of his attention to his job and his mother while his wife lies in a dreary slum clinic having a miscarriage.Since so much of Smith's fiction is drawn from her own experience, the suffering most of her women characters go through at the hands of their egregious husbands makes one wonder what her first marriage was like.Except for a couple of digressions into the life stories of peripheral characters, \\"Tomorrow Will Be Better\\" is strongly written and, like \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" vividly evokes the lives of the Irish lower class in early-twentieth-century New York.If you've read the other three books, expect many of the same elements here: an adorable female protagonist; bitter, poor, semi-educated Irish one or two generations above the shanty; baby birthing; and of course (with the exception of Carl in \\"Joy in the Morning\\") a husband you'd like to beat with a baseball bat and rescue the heroine from.Toward the end, the story sinks into despair and even its final tiny offer of hope--the remote possibility of Margy's escape from her dead marriage to a new relationship with a rather dull adult mama's boy--would be pitiful except that in comparison to the moribund union she's stuck in it would be a step upward."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"In all honesty, I do not remember the book specifically. At the age of 13, I was searching for books that would lift my spirits and tell me of a time past that I didn't know much about.

If you like Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I would suggest trying Tomorrow Will Be Better. The impression it leaves is worth reading about another's pain, as well as her joy -- and, after all, you always know that the truth is in the title."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"This story was depressing. It makes you feel sorry for the character and her abusive mother. I would definetely NOT read this book again. Who would want to read it?

Forget this book! It doesn't even seem like Betty Smith writing. Awful."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","review":"This book is by far the most insightful and truthful of Betty Smith's books. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a good read but just a soap opera. The analogy between a tree growing &amp; Francie in the previous book was not apt. Maggie Now was a ridiculous concept and Joy in the Morning her last was phoney. Carl and Annie in that book only made it as people helped the left and right.But Tomorrow shows the world how it was, how it is, and how it shall always be. Honest hardworking people getting by life on hope and hope alone. And how only a few of us actually DO anything to change the situation. It is a brilliant statement. For a good relaxing read try Betty Smith's other books."},{"Title":"Founding Mothers: Women of America in the Revolutionary Era","review":"I usually have to push myself to read anything other than fiction or memoir, so I was surprised to find myself so happily immersed in this book. The author's style is entertaining and easy to read. She covers a lot of ground here--from women's everyday chores and family life, to women who participated in the revolutionary conflict by supporting either the American revolutionaries or the British. She provides many interesting facts and details from different women's lives, including rich and poor women; black, white, and Native American women.

Her book makes some excellent points, particularly in citing the frequently ignored strides that Nixon took in domestic policy. Overall, however, her odd writing style and seeming preoccupation with revisionism make the flow of the book pretty choppy, as well as all out boring in places...In my opinion, any book on Nixon is worth it if you are trying to figure out what he was all about.

Let there be no doubt that Nixon was NOT a doctrinaire conservative, if he was even one to begin with. Nixon's early cabinet and advisers included some liberal minds. It is now known that many economic policies that were implemented during this time were very injurious to the US economy (wage and price controls come to mind) and contributed to the awful economic times of the late 70's and early 80's.Nevertheless, this book is a good start if you want to learn a little bit about what went on besides Vietnam and Watergate."},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"Decent book, very informative.

Naturally, a reader may find anything he seeks in an interpretation of the words of the author yet there is no obvious bias or partisanship on the part of Joan Hoff in this work. The amount of revisionism, however, is quite substantial. Hoff seems to have as her purpose for writing this a decided motivation to revise the history of Nixon from the accounts given by fellows ranging from Ambrose to Wills. Granted, her work is more informed and well rounded compared to Ambrose and less agonizing than Wills' Nixon Agonistes yet there seem to be a lack of entirely new information, which would make this work a better choice for the average reader looking for an unbiased, middle of the road examination of Nixon."},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"Joan Hoff's purpose in, Nixon Reconsidered, is to reassess the Nixon presidency by removing Watergate from the analysis. Hoff carries out this reevaluation by relying chiefly on newly released archive materials from the Nixon White House and interviews with Richard Nixon and many officials in his administration. Although she does mention Watergate, she states that her focus is on Nixon's domestic and foreign policies. Hoff's central thesis is that Nixon's presidency should be remembered first for domestic policy, next for foreign policy, and last for Watergate.An empirical methodology is employed throughout this monograph. As such, it is no surprise that Hoff spent ten years consulting both primary and secondary source materials. Most of the primary sources came from government archives, but she was also able to gain access to the personal files of several key members of the Nixon administration. Hoff organizes this book into ten chapters divided in three parts. In Part I, Hoff reevaluates Nixon's domestic policy, in Part II, she examines his foreign policy, and in Part III, she discusses Watergate. Hoff uses no graphic aids in this text, but she does include a comprehensive bibliography, index, and abbreviation list.To support her assertion that Nixon's domestic policy overshadowed his foreign policy, Hoff focuses on four separate domestic issues. These issues include environmental legislation, Native American policy, New Federalism, and civil rights. In regards to the environment, the Nixon administration has a successful and progressive record of accomplishments. For instance, the Nixon administration oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, the Clean Air Act of 1970, and federal regulation concerning \\"oil spill cleanup, pesticides into the ocean, noise pollution, and state coastal zone management.\\" However, like many of Nixon's domestic policy accomplishments, these achievements are often ignored.The Nixon administration's policy towards Native Americans was also progressive and successful, according to Hoff. The essential element of this policy was that Native Americans should have control over the decisions that affected them. This policy took form in the appointment of several tribal members to key positions in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Another example can be seen in the Nixon administration's advocacy for the land rights of Native Americans. For instance, this administration drafted legislation that returned sacred land around Blue Lake, New Mexico to the Taos Pueblo tribe. These actions made Nixon very popular among Native Americans.Next, Hoff examines Nixon's \\"New Federalism.\\" This domestic policy was an ambitious effort to change the structure of the federal government. The results of this effort can be seen in the reorganizing of the executive branch to mirror a corporation. New Federalism also changed the structure of the federal government via the 1972 State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act. This Act created the very popular revenue sharing program by which the federal government gave money directly to state and local governments with very few strings attached. Essentially, this act transferred power from the federal bureaucracy to state and local governments. In this way, Nixon's New Federalism marked a significant change in the way that the federal government operated.Hoff asserts that Nixon's policy on civil rights is equally important. For instance, the Nixon administration oversaw the desegregation of Southern schools, expanded equal opportunity, and supported legislation aiding minority owned business. So, in these four areas, of environmental legislation, Native American policy, New Federalism, and civil rights, Nixon's domestic policy was both successful and ambitious. Hoff writes, \\"Ultimately, these domestic programs may be remembered longer than his currently better known activities in the realm of foreign policy.\\"In Part II, Hoff reevaluates Nixon's foreign policy by examining \\"Nixinger\\" diplomacy, d&eacute;tente, and Vietnam. Hoff argues that each of these areas show that \\"Nixon's diplomatic legacy is weaker than he and many others have maintained.\\" For example, \\"Nixinger\\" diplomacy refers to the process by which Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon would formulate foreign policy. Hoff argues that this system was seriously flawed. Hoff writes, \\"instead of compensating for each other's weaknesses and enhancing strengths, Nixon and Kissinger shared their worst characteristics.\\" One of those bad characteristics was an extreme distrust of the bureaucracy that created and implemented foreign policy. The result of this flaw, Hoff argues, was that during the Nixon administration, the White House served as the State department. Hoff goes on to explain the two most important foreign policies that resulted from Nixinger diplomacy: d&eacute;tente and Vietnamization.Hoff also faults d&eacute;tente, the Nixon administration's policy of liberalizing relations with the Soviet Union, for two reasons. First, since agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union were made in secret, the Nixon administration had to constantly contend with diplomatic initiatives in the senate that would undercut these agreements. Second, this method of negotiation made the personal relationships between Nixon and Kissinger and their Russian counterparts instrumental to accomplishing foreign policy objectives. So, after Nixon resigned, d&eacute;tente was much less effective. For these reasons, the significance of d&eacute;tente n in American foreign policy was short lived.Hoff concludes Part II with a discussion of the failure of American foreign policy in Vietnam. Hoff's primary argument is that in the pursuit to achieve \\"peace with honor,\\" via Vietnamization, Nixon prolonged and widened the scope of the war. This occurred for several reasons. First, Nixon's theory that bombing Cambodia would increase pressure on the Vietnamese to negotiate a settlement was not sound. This bombing also increased opposition to the war in the United States. Second, Nixon's argument that the war was justified on moral grounds did not ring true in light of the carnage caused by the war. Third, and perhaps most importantly, these policies destabilized the entire Indochina region. Thus, the failure of \\"Nixinger\\" diplomacy, seriously undermine the legacy of Nixon's foreign policy.In Part III, Hoff examines the legacy of the Watergate scandal using a computer analysis of the transcripts of the White House tapes. One important point that she makes about here is that Watergate established a double standard. To put it plainly, high government officials can get away with crimes that the individual would not. As evidence of this, Hoff cites George Bush's \\"midnight\\" pardons of the men involved in the Iran-Contra affair. Another important point that Hoff makes is that none of the Watergate reforms have resulted in a safer political system. Hoff writes, \\"Watergate is more than Nixon because the potential for future Watergates is as great as ever.\\" Essentially, Hoff is arguing that Watergate was an aberration that skews scholarly understanding of the Nixon administration.This book has both strengths and weaknesses. One strength of this book is its heavy reliance on primary source documents. On the other hand, one significant weakness is that Hoff does not achieve her aim of analyzing the Nixon administration by removing Watergate from the analysis. In reality, Watergate is mentioned in every chapter and the entire third section of the book discusses different aspects of the scandal. So, she makes a much better case that Nixon cannot be evaluated without an understanding of the Watergate scandal. Nonetheless, because of Hoff exhaustive research and use of primary sources, this book could still prove useful for an individual interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"Once upon a time, a long time ago, we had a president, America could actually believe in. This book shows the reader why. President Nixon is known for ending the war in Vietnam and his foreign policy achievements, which were impressive. However, when our British friends cashed in their American gold certificates, there was a really danger of a run on our gold reserves at Fort Knox. America did not have enough gold in reserve to cover all of the outstanding gold certificates. On 15 August 1971, President Nixon in a bold move, took us off the gold standard, imposed a wage freeze and price controls, cut foreign aid by ten percent and imposed a ten percent tariff. This is only one of his many domestic accomplishments. Nixon, without a doubt, was our greatest Republican president and this book proves it."},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"Joan Hoff's &quot;Nixon Reconsidered&quot; is a facinating look at one of the most exciting politacal gurus of our time.I have read several books about and by Nixon (such as Six Crisis, The Rise of an American Politician, Beyond Peace, etc.) but this book is a detailed original of the authors own personal feelings and knowledge of Nixon and the trials and tribulations that followed him to his grave.Its got something for every reader"},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"This book would probably be a very interesting account if it wasn't bogged down with so many minute details that take away from the overall argument. Ms. Hoff has some great ideas but the book could realistically have been much more concise."},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","review":"This is a complete whitewashing of Richard Nixon's political career written by an obviously pro-Nixon source. There is no attempt from the author to distance herself from Nixon or create an illusion of impartiality. Hoff is in Nixon's corner all the way and makes some incredible interpretive analyses. For example, Nixon's domestic agenda was actually &quot;extremely liberal.&quot; Hoff makes this claim based upon Nixon's environmental agenda, but ignores his viscerally right-wing Supreme Court appointments and his Neanderthal approach to civil rights. Doesn't sound too &quot;liberal&quot; to me.Hoff also makes a series of implausible and ultimately ludicrous excuses for Nixon's involvement in Watergate. Predictably, she absolves the President from much involvement and any guilt. She points the finger of guilt at a dizzying array of Nixon suborindates (all of whom went to prison). Nixon is the epitome of grace, honesty and courage in Huff's eyes, a view which will delight those who revere the 37th President. But for those who have a less charitable view of him, this will be regarded as hagiography at its apex."},{"Title":"The Stolen Throne","review":"The Stolen Throne (1995) is the first fantasy novel in the Time of Troubles series. This series is set in a world where plains dwelling nomads had long ago conquered the civilization between the two rivers. This Makuran empire is ruled by the King of Kings from his capital in Mashiz. Their traditional, and most powerful, enemy is the Empire of Videssos.In this novel, Abivard is the son of diqhan Godarz of the Vek Rud domain. He asks for insight into the future from his local soothsayer and receives a strange foretelling. Tanshar isn't even aware that he had spoken and so cannot explain his own words.The Klamorth nomads are stirred up and war is expected. Then the red flag is brought to Vek Rud and Abivard is allowed to ride to war with his father. All the Makuran noble castes are warriors, so naturally he is excited and pleased to be going to war.Yet Peroz King of Kings loses this war. Peroz is killed, along with most of the warriors in his army. Abivard escapes death by a fluke and survives to return home.His mother Burzoe advises him to do two things: marry his betrothed Roshnani and arrange the marriage of his older sister Denak. He sends messages to both domains and both marriages are consummated. Abivard is pleased to learn that his new wife is both good looking and smart.Soon a messenger comes asking Abivard to swear allegiance to Smerdis as King of Kings. At first he is puzzled, for his father had mentioned Sharbaraz as the heir. After the messenger explains that Peroz's son had abdicated the throne, Abivard swears fealty as diqhan of Vek Rud.Denak had married Pradtak, diqhan of the Nalgis Crag domain. About a month later, Abivard receives a letter from her stating that Sharbaraz is being held prisoner at Nalgis Crag and that he claims to be the rightful King of Kings. Suddenly affairs are no longer simple.In this story, Abivard and Denak, with help from Tanshar, liberate Sharbaraz from his cell and return to Vek Rud. They send messengers to all diqhans in the northwest province and set a date to discuss the upcoming civil war. Most of them are already angry with the usurper due to the Klamorth raids on their domain.At the meeting, Sharbaraz stirs up the diqhans and almost everyone agrees to follow him to roust Smerdis from the throne. One diqhan, however, tries to assassinate Sharbaraz, but what can you expect from rural diqhans? Still, Prypat goes to his execution with dignity.This story is obviously loosely based on the Sassanid and Byzantine empires, probably about the sixth or seventh century AD. Yet the geography is reversed and otherwise distorted and the major cultural themes differ significantly. For example, the Makuran religion involves four Prophets instead of a single Prophet -- Zoroaster -- and the Videssian religion has Phos -- the Sun God -- as its major deity. Still, the everyday occurrences of daily life in both empires are much the same.This series takes place in the same universe as the other Videssian series. It occurs about 150 years prior toThe Misplaced Legionand about 650 years beforeKrispos Rising.In many respects, this series is similar to the War Between the Provinces fantasy trilogy. It is alternate history of a sorts, but with fantastic aspects. It is also loosely based on history, but less so thanSentry Peak.Highly recommended for Turtledove fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alternate history, exotic cultures, and unexpected romance.-Arthur W.

It is set in the same world as the \\"Misplaced Legion\\" books, but several hundred years earlier.

At the start of the book he hears a prophecy:\\"Son of the Dihqan, I see a broad field which is not a field, a tower on a hill where honour will be won and lost, and a silver shield shining across a narrow sea.\\"Shortly after this, Abivard goes to war for the first time, and takes part in a disastrous battle, the effects of which will throw both Makuran and Videssos into years of bloodshed, war, rebellion, and chaos ...Abivard tries to follow an honourable course during the years of war and betrayal which follow. He learns that good and bad men are to be found in both Videssos and Makuran. The first part of the prophesy quickly comes true - but what does the rest mean?The first and third parts of the quartet are told from the viewpoint of Abivard, the second and fourth from the viewpoint of a Videssian general, Maniakes.There are currently 12 novels set in the \\"Videssos\\" universe of which this is chronologically the second.

The setting apparently is in the same world as his Videssos and Krispos novels, though the tale here occurs several hundred years before either of those series. The setting reminds me of descriptions of the Middle East, a dry landscape dependent on irrigation systems for farming with a steppe-land to the north. The main character is a young noble thrust into a leadership role by political events between his country, Makuran, and its main rival, Videssos. I found myself more than mildly interested in him but was only occasionally emotionally stirred by his trials. Plot progress varies throughout with numerous interludes examining women's life in a very male-dominated society. I found these enlightening of themselves and they helped push the story forward. Some twists occur but mostly the action is predictable. Turtledove's descriptions of war here, as in other of his stories, deals in reality and does not glorify it, an aspect of his writing that I wholeheartedly approve. Magic is present in this world though it is rarely depended on for effects or plot advancement. The ending chapters are a little disjointed, in part I think because he's trying to tie things up for this book while introducing the crisis that starts the second book in the series. I hope that one is at least as good as this one."},{"Title":"The Stolen Throne","review":"Turtledove wrote the &quot;Legion of Videssos&quot; series and the &quot;Krispos of Videssos&quot; series from the Videssan side of the world he created. This time he has crossed to &quot;the enemy&quot; in Makuran and is telling the stories of that side of the world.This book tells the story of Abivard, a lord from a small but loyal family who makes a king and marries his sister to the king. As a result he finds himself thrown into a senior military command and enmeshed in the complex politics of the world of Makuran.

The children write a letter to Santa Claus asking for a present for Mr. Gloams. Georgie and his friends find the letter, and work to make the children's letter come true.This is similar in many ways to Dickens' a Christmas Carol, except that there aren't any spirits (well, none that Mr. Gloams ever sees). Really, there is nothing supernatural in any of what Georgie does, except that Georgie happens to be a friendly ghost (He was a recurring character in several Robert Bright books, if you need to be told that) Mr. Gloams is transformed by the love of a couple of children, who saw a grouchy old man and instead of hating him or fearing him, they want to make him happy, and a few small friends who want to make some children's dream come true. Just a terrific story all around."},{"Title":"The witch, the cat, and the baseball bat,","review":"This is just one of several Georgie books that I recently purchased as a Christmas gift for my great-niece.

Unlike most to the other books, Alexander does not focus on a given battle or a series of battles, but on the almost decade long conquest of Persia and neighboring countries, such as parts of India. If one is looking for an overview of Alexander's conquests then there is probably no better book. The battles are described in such a manner as to acquaint the reader with the ins and outs and the maps are beyond excellent.Warry does a fine job in explaining how 50,000 infantry and cavalry troops were able to defeat an empire with troops several times their number. Focusing on the the tactical brilliance of Alexander and the innovations in battle field technologies, the book explains why Alexander was victorious. It is written in a readable fashion and is a good place to start for anyone who is interested in the conquests of Alexander."},{"Title":"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign)","review":"Don't let the size of this book fool you---the point of reading is to understand and this is the best book I've read that puts Alexander the Great's campaigns together in a way that military professionals and casual readers can understand. Every war form we use today has its antecedent in the past--there is a lot to learn from the past if we take the time to reflect on it.Warry shows some remarkable things--that Alexander's Army of 40,000 defeated a Persian Army of 600,000 and did it with almost no casualties because in ancient war shields defeated arrows and spears. The Macedonian phalanx--a formation of men with shields linked together would close on the enemy at foot speed led by Parmenio, while Alexander surged ahead with his cavalry and collapsed his enemy while the phalanx held the enemy. Think of how Commanders combined their arms in the film, Braveheart to see how Alexander waited until the time was right before placing himself and his Cavalry force at the critical spot to smash his enemy's structure. It was when enemy cohesion and formations collapsed---when they threw down their shields and ran---that the high casualties we usually associate with 1st Generation muscle-powered combat come from. That we are having too many casualties on the modern, automatic weapons fire swept battlefield, means its high time we re-examine the individual Soldier shield to recreate a phalanx capability today.When Alexander confronted the walled island city of Tyre/Sidon he built siege engines on both ships and rolled across a causeway of land he built by throwing stones into the sea as foretold in the Bible in Ezekiel 26. Warry shows the siege in amazing detailed, color illustrations that enlighten without boring the reader as a dry &quot;scholarly&quot; book tends to do. He then marched across the known world at amazing march speeds--Warry describes the weaponry/equipment in great deatil--you'll notice the macedonians wore a &quot;himation&quot; which could be used both as a sleeping blanket and as a coat--there was no wasted weight being carried on the Soldier's back--a lesson we could stand to relearn today.Reading Warry's book with its long-range and close-up maps and illustrations from ancient engravings and modern depictions is like an inter-active computer simulation of the battle---you can see both the &quot;big&quot; picture and the &quot;little&quot; picture, in short this book is a masterpiece. We need to re-evaluate our views that for a book to be &quot;accurate&quot; it has to be visually dull, especially in the computer age we live in where we can with hyperlinks go to an entire world of background information from all walks of life on any given subject."},{"Title":"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign)","review":"John Warry's Osprey book is a fairly typical condensed account of Alexander's most important battles; Granicus, Issus, Tyre, Gaugamela, and the Hydaspes. This is a solid but uninventive source, most of its information being availible in dozens of other books and in greater depth. The bird's eye maps of the Campaign series are of poor quality here (due at least in part to this being one of the first Campaign titles) though they suit their purpose well enough. One little detail this title does contain that many do not are several uncommon color illustrations of Indian warriors of Porus' Army (a topic Osprey really needs to do a book on).Overall, this is a decent quality source on Alexander by an experienced researcher of the Classical Art of War, but don't expect a huge amount of detail or any startling new revelations."},{"Title":"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign)","review":"good book on the ancient wars in the middle esat big fan on this subject good illustratetion good picture good"},{"Title":"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign)","review":"This is an excellent place to start for the student of Alexander's campaigns.

The campaigns he pursued and the many battles (and hundreds of skirmishes) through which he led his Macedonians, Greeks, and allied peoples are really too many -- and too varied in type, terrain, and goal -- to be covered in sufficient depth in ninety-six pages. The other volumes in this and Osprey's other series are much more focused in time and geography. The author is therefore forced to select only five battles spread over the eleven years and several thousand miles of Alexander's career. The fight against the Persian forces at Granicus, shortly after his army crossed the Hellespont, was his first major victory and the first example of the efficacy of his style of Heroic Leadership. The confrontation at Issus, on the coast near what is now the Turkish-Syrian frontier, allowed him to push on down the coast to Tyre, where his innovative use of a mole to besiege the island fortress enabled him to gain control of the entire eastern Mediterranean as far as the borders of Libya. The book then skips ahead to Gaugamela in present-day Iraq, and finishes up with Hydaspes five years later, on a branch of the Indus -- the point farthest east that Alexander was able to push to. The detail is pretty good, though there is simply a lack of surviving information about many aspects of all five battles. The battle maps are excellent, as always, but the color plates depicting the garb and weapons of individual warriors and soldiers -- usually painted, but here in shaded colored pencil -- are decidedly inferior to other Osprey books. This is one of the less successful entries in the series."},{"Title":"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign)","review":"It is a very interesting book. But it is written from the Greeks point of view about the Persians. For examole, it is well accepted by modern historians that the Persian army was not 600,000 men and yet the author fails to mention this and just repeats the old fictional account that was passed on from the past. However, I recommend this book for anyone interested on ancient history and Alexander the great. But it is a bit bias."},{"Title":"Origami Animals","review":"Easy step-by-step illustration.

Instead the first steps of each model consist of several cuts to the paper to make the points that form the legs, etc. Most origamiists prefer not to cut the paper except to form the initial square; cutting into the square is generally considered a flaw in a model's design. Therefore, this book will probably not appeal to the traditional origamiist. Nevertheless, the models are very cute, so if you don't mind the cutting, you may want to check it out."},{"Title":"Origami Animals","review":"I bought this book for my 11 year old nephew who loves origami.

We are three adults with varying levels of education (through post-graduate) and three children to 9 years old. We tried the Giraffe first and were immediately frustrated by the instructions. The pictures are insufficient and the instructions are obscure. It seems the author was attempting to give the shortest description possible and by this effort left out needed information.Independently and as a group we tried to understand his instructions by experimenting for over an hour. The purpose of the book is to eliminate experimentation and teach you how to \\"do\\" the work, it fails.I would NOT recommend this book/kit to anyone.

His parents couldn't buy him toys, so he made his own from what was right at his fingertips: boxes, cardboard, empty cans, and especially paper. He taught himself to make beautiful, fun paper copies of the toys he saw in store display windows, and he followed his imagination. He shares his artistic skills, imagination and love for nature in his book ORIGAMI ANIMALS.He gives tips on getting good folds and making basic forms. His choice of critters is fun but challenging. Critters include basset hounds, condors, deer, adult and baby elephants, adult and baby flamingoes, giraffes, adult and baby kangaroos, lions, pocket crabs, rhinoceros beetles, tarantulas, toucans, and turtles.His critters aren't just art for fun. They're also art for learning. With each critter, he talks about their homes and lifestyles. He tells what to use for wildlife scenes of grass, mountains, snow, trees, and water. The finished product's friendly to the environment. It recycles, from nature, dried mushrooms, grasses, leaves, mosses, nuts, stones, and twigs. In the environmentally-friendly tradition of Virginia Tech, the author gets us to recycle nature and deadhead plants, without adding to yardwaste!Another application is to use the author's art for fun and learning in master gardener-taught and science classes. The critters and their environments make good exhibits for school classrooms, hall display cases, and science fairs. The directions on basic forms and on the book's set of critters are so clear it'd be easy to figure out how to do other paper animals, birds, bugs, environments, and plants."},{"Title":"Origami Animals","review":"This is a decent origami book.

Daniel Mason's \\"The Piano Tuner\\" comes to mind as another example, though his book at least had some decent writing in it.This book started weak and went downhill from there. I could have accepted a lot of the faults of the first three-quarters of the book if the writing had been better edited -- as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the metaphors were laughable, when they weren't cringe-inducing. When the writer wasn't trying out her clumsy language flourishes and just told the story straightforwardly, she wasn't that bad. But the purple prose! I think one of the most laughable sections was the premature birth of Nisha -- the language there was just over the top. A strict editor would have done this book a world of good.The thin plot completely fell apart in the last quarter of the book, as did any pretenses to coherence. There were leaps from time to place without even the helpful inclusion of a line break, so that I ended up totally confused. Logically as well, things didn't fit together. Totally bankrupt young girl still has enough money to refurbish her mother's old house? Helloooo??I didn't expect that much from this book. Still, I was disappointed. Perhaps a nice beach read, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This book covered a lot of generations, I wanted to know more about my original character, who kind of got lost."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I was quite impressed with the good reviews the book received even before its publication, and so I bought it as a gift for a friend. She liked it so much that she lent it to me saying, \\" A lovely gift. I enjoyed reading it. Read it and tell me what you think of it. It's very good\\". So I read it. A multi-generational saga, I found the story very interesting. Told in first person, it is the story of Lakshmi who, at age fourteen, is duped into marrying a man more than twice her age. The marriage is arranged by her Aunt Pani who lies to Lakshmi's mother that the groom, Ayah - a widower with two children - is wealthy. Lakshmi goes to Malasia with her husband and bears six children in five years and learns quickly that she can't rely on her husband for much help and support. Ayah is depicted as a kind and loving man, but without strong will-power. Lakshmi, however, is depicted as a strong woman with an abundance of will-power. She survives World War II and the atrocities of the Japanese during the occupation of Malaya. Although the story was interesting, her narrative hindered me from really enjoying the book. It is loaded with too many metaphors and similes. Also, many of the sentences sound as if they were written first in Malay and then translated into English, ignoring the cadence, the natural flow of the English language: \\"Anger rose up from the black mud of my stomach.\\" \\"Failure was a badly trained dog that lived in other people's houses.\\" These sentences, for example, might sound natural and flow smoothly in Malay, but they sound rather strange in English. Also, I felt that her English lacked precision. For example, she writes about Mohini, the first daughter: \\"Mohini was hiding behind the curtains. Like a cat. Beautiful, soft, and perfectly white with large green eyes.\\" I have seen perfectly white gardenias and dahlias, and once even a perfectly white albino monkey; but I have never seen a perfectly white human. A reader, however, can gleam quite a bit of interesting information from the book: How to catch a cobra, and how to strengthen limp legs of infants - \\"bury the baby to knee level in a hole one and half feet deep. Slowly the legs will gain strength!\\" I found a few glaring errors also. For example, Sevene agrees to go to the cemetery with Raja to catch snakes. They go to the cemetery at night. However, when they leave the cemetery after catching a cobra, Rani Manicka writes, \\" His voice still sounded like the rasp of sandpaper, but now that we were outside, I felt better. Safer. It was evening, and there were people taking slow strolls, laughing and talking in low voices.\\" Writing about professor Rao, the gemologist to whom Lakshmi's children took stones they had gathered, Rani Manicka writes: \\"In the living room Professor Rao allowed nothing but the dour classical music of Thiagaraja to fill the air.\\" Having studied Thiagaraja's music for twenty four years, (the music is known as the South Indian classical or Carnatic music ; Thiagaraja was one of the three famous composers in this field) I am aware that it takes a certain bent of mind, a certain ear, to appreciate this divine music; not all can appreciate it, and some might even find it \\"primitive\\", but most certainly not dour. Lest readers conclude that I am complaing too much, let me hasten to add that I found the novel worth reading once. I wasn't disappointed. Infact I will be returning the book to my friend and say, \\" Not bad for a first novel. Rani's English has the distinctly Asian ring to it.\\""},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This is a book that will help you think more about your family, those who are alive and those who pass away.It will remind you of how important those people to us.

I would re-read certain sections, not because I got &quot;lost&quot;, but because the way she writes conveys so much meaning in a single sentance. Some of the parts are very sad, and I have been avoiding these kinds of stories lateley, but this was bearable. The following of the family really works."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This book has little to recommend it. The characters are cliched and Manicka lacks subtlety in the way she develops them. The story line is contrived and implausible from the beginning and doesn't improve.(Impoverished young girl tricked into marrying a supposedly wealthy man, taken far away before she realises the deception. Lucky for her though, despite her childhood poverty (oh yes, and the fact that she tells us on page 30 that she is trapped in the new marriage because she has no money of her own) she has actually secretly brought into the marriage a stash of precious gems she can sell off when things get really tough along life's pathway. This is just as well because things certainly do get tough -frequently). The devices Manicka uses are inept - eg, stories told retrospectively by different characters, some as children who amazingly remember more about the events than the adults who were actually involved - and their stories in places are boringly repetitive. The editors must have been having a holiday. The prose is saccharin and the metaphors are simply awful, so bad that I caught myself having a quiet chuckle in places that I think were meant to be quite tragic. By the half way mark I found it hard to keep ploughing through, but kept it up just to see if the next metaphor could out do the one before. I saw a review that compared this book to Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible. Lovers of that wonderful book, please don't be taken in. They are both books, and there any similarity ends."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I bought this in a lot of 3 used books, all dealing with female characters of South Asian descent. The other two are more fluffy chick-lit and the ones I bought the lot for--but when I picked up this novel and browsed through it, it immediately sucked me into its world and kept me there.The central character is Lakshmi, and we see the wondrous and often frightening world of Malaysia in the first half of the 20th century largely through her eyes and experiences. She marries and raises six children, fighting fiercely for them and facing terrible struggles and tragedies. She is a fascinating character telling her story forthrightly. At times I loved her and at times I wanted to reach into the book and shake her, but she and her world were 100% real to me as I read the book.But she isn't the only narrator, and this is where the book became really fascinating to me. Her husband, sons and daughters and eventually grandchild and great-grand child (as well as a few secondary characters) tell portions of the story through their eyes, adding perspective to the overall narrative and enlightening the reader on portions of the story that the other characters didn't directly observe. Each of the characters had a very distinctive voice and the shifts in tone and narration added dimensions to the story. Although the first half of the book is stronger with Lakshmi front and center, and loses some focus and steam once her grand daughter and great-grand daughter move to the forefront, events and themes ultimately come to a satisfying conclusion.While the story can be at times quite harrowing and sad, it made for a great read and kept me completely engrossed in its world as I read. I look forward to other books by this author.Although I didn't read this as part of a reading group, the additional reading group materials in the back, including an interview with the author and discussion questions, enhanced my personal reading of the book and are worth a look as well.If you remember fondly the generational sagas of 1970s and 1980s women's fiction (early Barbara Taylor Bradford, Belva Plain, etc) in which stories that start with one female character ultimately play out and resolve through her descendants, and like reading books set in lesser-known settings (I think this is the first book I've ever read set in Malaysia), check this out!"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This book is the most addictive read i've encountered for a while. The reason it is spellbinding is Manicka's accurate potrayal of life in Malaya during the second world war. The details of a Ceylonese family's life in these times are surprisingly accurate. It makes me wonder how my own family lived through these times. Her description of the family members and details of family life is colourful and rings true. She writes of food like she has cooked them all.The disadvantages are that at times her writing style is stifling with repetitions and mixed metaphors. Also, I feel there isn't enough closure on each character. They are all so vividly developed at the beginning, then they all mysteriously get old and die or dissapear. Also what is with Nisha, how can anyone voluntarily remain amnesic for more then a decade- not knowing anything about her mother or her family?"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This book took me on an extraordinary journey through the minds and hearts of several characters. The author's writing was so descriptive and imaginitive that I could feel the characters' pain and feel it deeply. As I was reading the novel, and even now after just finishing, I feel deeply connected to the characters, and I loved hearing \\"their story.\\" As the voice of the story changes to different family members, we get to see things from different perspectives, and hear new apects of the situation. Through every story prevades a love so heartbreaking it can't possibly be returned.There is much sadness in this book, yet I wouldn't say it was a sad book. It reflects the realities of happiness and tragedy within a family.I bought this book randomly and was pleasantly suprised. I wanted the book to never end!

How the choices in your life can affect the outcome of not just your destiny but even your loved ones.While reading this book you become an unseen family member of the characters, you share their happiness, pain, disappointment and so on.The book is extraordinarily well written with sophisticated vocabulary and leaves no one untouched.I don't want to reveal too much of the story, you just need to read the Rice mother to be able to understand what a great book this is!I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"A member of my Book Club suggested this for our next book, so I figured I'd give it a try. Within the first few pages I was engrossed and hated to put my book down! I loved how the author used different \\"voices\\" for each chapter, enabling the reader to get different perspectives on events that happened to this family. I found myself having wishes and dreams for the characters as if they were my own children. I enjoyed this book so much I'm planning on reading it again before my book club meets. Also recommend: The Kite Runner"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"When I read this book, it was the second of this authors, i enjoyed her other book, touching earth, but the Rice mother, i found it so awestriking that i had to write a review to let ot'hers know how i felt about it, and thats a first. The rice mother i found was a deeply inspired novel, the generational story made it seem like a fable, the spirituality and superstition in the novel gave it an air that lifted it above other books written in this genre. The magic and mysticality of every day life, and the harshness of the same all came out in one book. Amazing, she should be proud of this book. I didn't know what to do with the book once i'd finished it, i wanted all my friends to read it, but now im not sure if everyone would get the feeling i got from reading it and im not sure if i they should read it, i dont want them to have any halfling reactions to it.work well done,thank you"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I was impressed with this book for several reasons. For one, for the amount of characters that we meet, it is surprisingly well organized. There was only a moment or two in which I was a bit lost but the subtle reminders in her writing style quickly brings me back into the main story. She maintained a decent cohesion in the book and the secrets of the story are revealed subtly and through different characters. The other reason I was impressed is that the complexity of the story has a good flow. It's not flawless - there's a bit of disjointedness in the story - but overall the story flows into each section. I thought it was a particularly good idea for the author to write the beginning of the book in one narrative. It establishes a lot of groundwork that, as the book and characters mature, builds on itself. Lastly, the mysticism in the story isn't out of place - she incorporates it skillfully in the story and it only adds to the plot.Should this author write another novel available in english - I would definitely read it."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"The Rice Mother is a lyrical, exotic tale about a powerful matriarch, Lakshmi, who is married off at 14 and goes on to have six children, endure the Japanese ocupation of Malaysia, and guide her offspring through their various encounters with addiction, love, power and heartbreak. Rani Manicka's tale is bursting with exotic sights and smells, food and culture, mysticism and metaphor.So why only three stars? I know a lot of people loved this book, but I found it painful to read. After an engaging beginning that sucks the reader into caring about these characters, Manicka is just too cruel to them. The violence and horror that this family suffers was too much for me - further, it seemed unnecessary. In my head I envisioned a hundred alternate endings (ie Mohini dashing into the woods, Dimple and her husband communicating), and Manicka's plot just didn't convince me that her tragic path was the right one."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This story is a beautifully written one that takes you through four different generations of a Malay family. It starts around the 1910's or 20's until our modern time. As the story goes you see glimpses of the Malay society in WWII and its effect, you get to know how it looked like in the 70's and even in our most recent history. However, it doesn't overdose you with facts about the society or the culture. It so beautifully and subtly introduces it to the reader. It's really a mesmerizing book. Just make sure to take notice of all the names that you will come across. It could be a bit confusing."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This book was a wonderful read. It kept me very interested and was written in great detail. It reminded me somewhat of the movie &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; because it talks about different stories of generations of family. I absolutely loved it. I really recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"recommended by a friend. very interesting, compelling and educational as to region, war, family and romance. liked it so well. i ordered 2 ore copies s for gifts."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"A well-crafted tale with a cast of powerful and conniving, though vulnerable and tragic characters. Rani Manicka has painted scenes in my mind that I will not soon forget. It is one of a handful of books I will surely read again."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I was in the Book Den in Santa Barbara with my husband, looking for mystery novels for his grandmother. Carrie - a gifted librarian who works there looked at me - sizing me up - and said \\"You should take this book, I think you'll really like it\\". I was skeptical, I hadn't loved a book since \\"The Outsiders\\" in middle school, but my husband bought it for me anyway. I am now a converted book worm. This book made me love to read again!"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I LOVED this book. It is an honest, heartbreaking and heart lifting portrait of a family. This book spoke to me as a mother, a sister, a daughter and a wife. It was one of those books that you start to read more slowly as it comes to a close, just to savor the last moments and to keep it from coming to an end. Buy this book, read it, love it and share it with your family and friends."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This tale is wonderfully written from the point of view of each character in succession as the generations of a family carry forward through time. In first person, each character expresses his/her own hopes, assessing themselves and their actions, as well as reflecting on the events and the other characters with astonishing honesty. Exposed to both the good qualities and weaknesses in each character, the reader is engaged to appreciate each one and get a big picture of family dynamics.As a family saga, this story realistically captures the characters and their relationships. Then there is also the historical setting and cultural perspectives to make this novel intriguing."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I must admit, I read this book only because it was written by a Malaysian author. Otherwise, I wouldn't have picked it up at all. The subject-matter is new and inviting but Rani Manicka's writing methods are confusing. For a generational saga, it lacked the string that binds the characters, instead it feels like a box of scattered beads and the reader has to frantically attempt to string them. Being Malaysian myself, I applaud the writer's courage to dwell into the cruelty and sadomasochism of the Japanese during World War II. It needed to be said. I truly enjoyed the first generation \\"tapes\\" of Lakshmi the matriarch. It created a solid foundation. However, the second generation seemed to only create a setting for the third generation. It also seemed unrealistic that the great granddaughter Nisha in the beginning had no memories. The book abruptly ends with all her memories flooding back to her and she being so calm and collected about the true identity of her mother, her mother's suicide, and not to mention her father's infidelity. On the whole a good read. Malaysians would enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"The Mother figure is such a wonderful character, the book was a delight. Made me forget the horrible cold that I was nursing while reading."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I did not know about Rani Manicka until I stumbled upon this masterpiece at the bookstore. I stood there completely entranced, salivating over the next page and wishing for God's blessings and sunshine on this lacerated family. It moved me deeply. I became a sorrowing witness to the family's tribulations - and they were endless - as well as a cheerleader for their small victories. Her writing is rich and colorful. She has that rare capacity to endow all my senses with truth, beauty and pain as she poured out her words.If you want to experience rapture and literary fulfillment, ethnic wonderment and a whole other world, do not pass this up. It will become a classic in short order."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I'm not going to rehash the plot but the author has an engaging style of writing that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. The fact that the magic doesn't really work is easy to overlook. People die and simply disappear. Things are left unexplained. The father is taken off and tortured by the Japanese and never mentions it in his own story.There was an underlying anti-Chinese tone to the book which bothered me. It was subtle but definately there. There was no misinformation but the attitude was playing in the background the whole time. Very strange...Having been to Malaysia and having lived in China, it was an interesting read for me."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"While I found the book to be well-written and compelling as it explores life through the perpectives of 3 generations of diverse and interesting family members, I was irritated by its emphasis on physical beauty.The overall importance & worth of each character seemed totally dependent on how physically beautiful they were--and consequently, everyone else (regardless of their soundness of character, level of kindness, etc) was portrayed as deeply & irreparably flawed. Perhaps the author sees the world that way, but hopefully most others outside the book do not."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I am NOT a writer so bear with my lack of talent when it comes to wriiting reviews,I wont be able to do the book justice that it deserves.Take it for granted that, if you buy this book, you should only begin it when you have an available sick day coming..... youll be up all night reading it........literally !As the editors have accuratly stated, if you love Esquival, Tan, Hoffman, or Allende, ( etc etc) then youre going to ADORE Manicka. This is her first novel and beleive me, she ranks up there with the best.....excellant read*(multi generational novel that begins with a young teen being married off in Ceylon.........)"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I was totally absorbed with the first half of this book, but I lost interest in the later generations of the family. I began to skim and actually skipped the last 40 or so pages. I have never stopped reading a book after getting in 400 pages before."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"\\"The Rice Mother\\" by Rani Manicka is the one of those books, that stay in your heart forever.It's a family saga of a four generations, set in Malaysia. The story starts right before World War II and finishes in the present times. Not only does the author deliver an amazing story of one family , but also she takes you on a journey to the exotic places, inspiredly describing them with poetical subtlety and imaginativeness, so that you can feel the flavors and spirits of the southern Asia. After reading \\"The Rice Mother\\" I felt richer with knowledge, inspiration and....experience!Believe me, while reading this book, you are invited to enter its world and live the life of each character. It may sound surreal, but I assure you it's true! It's definitely the most passionate and multiple-dimensional novel I've ever read. Hard to describe, a must-read."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"The central character is Lakshmi Ayah, at the age of 14 was forced into an arranged marriage. Her mother was told the future husband was wealthy and her daughter would not want for anything. The mother was thrilled as that was all she needed for her daughter, a better life than she had. Ayah only saw her future husband on her wedding day. She was horrifed, he had protruding crooked teeth, very overweight and very dark skinned. She wasn't game to say anything she knew this was important for her mother and she must not react.Just after the wedding she left Ceylon and her mother behind and travelled by boat to live in Malaysia. When arriving at her husbands home it was just a shack it was tiny with dirt floors and nothing like she was told it would be. She kept quiet and started to clean and clean to act like she was doing her duty. She had 6 children in 5 years. Throughout the poverty and the husbands lack of handling money they only just survived. She fought fiercely for them and faced terrible struggles and tragedies. She became more powerful and confident. Her husband knew she wasn't in love with him but she stayed out of duty.We follow their life and each of their childrens lives each member telling their memories from their point of view.When World War II starts and the occupation by the Japanese their world is turned upside down. The girls are dressed like boys so the Japanese men wouldn't take them away and abuse them. The most attractive girl is hidden under the house in a cellar not allowed out except at night for excercise. There are some grusome scenes about the occupation.I have travelled to Japan 5 times and love the Japanese people of today. But in this story it is war time and war acts do happen. So I am not downgrading the score of the brilliant book because of the depiction of the Japanese during the occupation.The start of the story deserved 6 stars. Then straight after it came about 20 pages and I thought Uhhhhh????(I could have ripped out those 20 pages and thrown them over my shoulder!!! 2 star.) Then it picked up and flowed beautifully right up till the end. I believe this family saga is essential reading. The only problem with it was the Ceylon/Malaysian names I am not used to. In the front of the book there is a family tree drawn out which was handy."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"This was a great novel. You are immediatly wisped away to a far off land so much different from anything you have ever experienced. At the back cover it say that you should savour this book and readit slowly. I was so in love with the book that I read it in three days and then again.The book keeps you reading. There is never a dull moment! A must read!"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"The Rice Mother is not a book, it is an experience. Structured in a style reminiscent of Barbara Kingsolver's bestselling The Poisonwood Bible, Manicka takes the reader on a journey through times and cultures and contexts that, though foreign, become heartbreakingly familiar. The only drawback to this book is that Manicka's detailed family portrait, which begins before World War II and ends with the present, will make your own life and family insignificant for the duration of your read. Happily, no one will suffer for very long because the pace of her prose is such that pages turn quickly. When I put this book down, it was with a bittersweet sigh of sorrow over having to say goodbye to characters who will live in my head for a very long time to come."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I bought Rice Mother on the strength of reviews I read here. Unfortunately, I did not find the book as compelling as the reviewers. On the one hand, Manicka's writing can be lyrical and conjures up Malaysia nicely. On the other, the plot is less probable and she doesn't flesh out her non-protagonist characters. However, it is the rapant racism which prevents me from recommending this book to friends. All Japanese characters are depraved. This might be forgivable for during the Japanese occupation portion, but it continues after wartime. All darker skinned characters are stupid or lazy. In contrast, the lighter skinned characters are intelligent, talented and kind, until and unless circumstance and experience turn them bitter. All in all, this book could be better."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"Although focused on revenge and the dysfunctionality of families, this book caught me and would not let me go. Some have said that this book has strong racial overtones... it does. The bias that are presented are not pretty. Light skin is emphasized, Chinese and Japanese are not looked upon with today's need for political correct presentation. This story is a saga of the lives of a matriarchal family wound up with lies and deceit and the inability to communicate because of pride and heritage.I loved this book. It wasn't easy to read but at times it was incredibly lyrical and lulling. I cried, I laughed and I wondered along with the characters. I wished and hoped for the characters to make different decisions... but in the end, after only 2 days of reading, I felt like I had truly been taken to another time and another world.I highly recommend this book for it's beauty, it's honesty, it's drama and it's story."},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"Excellant! Loved it, loved it!Truly EXCELLANT written. Shocking, Deep, complicated, very educational historically and culturally...just what I enjoy, couldn't put it down"},{"Title":"The Rice Mother","review":"I don't remember why I bought this book- and when I started racing, I thought; Why? I suppose at that time I expected a stereotypical indian book. (and I don't even know myself what I mean with that). Anyway It was not what I expected- the book starts with an arranged marriage, and then goes on with telling the story of a family, centering around the 'rice mother- who is only called that towards the end of the book-, but in the words of every member of the family. This way a lot of history gets covered, starting before the second world war, with its invasion of the japanese in malaysia, until the present. It gives insight in how these periods influence the people living in it, but it mainly gives a view on the intricate way people influence each other, and I loved the way how some eventualities were viewed differently by the different people involved. Very cleverly written, and unbelievable this is a debut. I will definitely read more of this writer."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"I'm giving Pronounce it Perfectly five stars even though I have some reservations about it. The way this book works is to present all of the sounds of French one after the other. Each sound is presented in isolation, based on spelling. It could even be considered to be a catalog of sounds. That makes this book a good reference work. You can look up a spelling in the (very good) index and jump straight to the sound.I'm not sure, though, how good that approach is for learning the sounds in the first place. For example, I had problems with the various \\"e\\" sounds of French. I would have appreciated it if there had been a section that presented these sounds together with each other for the sake of contrast. Considered in isolation, I had trouble relating these similar-sounding sounds (to my anglophone ears) to each other.I did not find the descriptions of how to produce the sounds (i.e. how to hold the mouth and position the tongue) very useful either. There are diagrams, but the differences in the drawings between them are too subtle to be illuminating. (And at least one of them, the side views for [e] and [&#603;], appears to be wrong.) But thankfully the book uses the International Phonetic Alphabet, and I found that looking up the names of the sounds (e.g. \\"close-mid front unrounded vowel\\" for [e]) on Wikipedia to be a better starting point for learning how to produce them.In summary, this book presents all the crucial information one needs--most importantly it contains the recordings of the sounds--but it doesn't present them as well as it might have. But if the reader is willing to do some work, then this book can be very valuable indeed."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"I agree with the reviewer who found it irritating that each word is presented in isolation, rather than making comparisons. For instance, what is the difference in pronunciation between faire and fer?Another irritation is the fact that an English speaker introduces overall sections (this is good), BUT that for the most part, we listen to native French speakers, some with strong accents, speak English as well as French. For instance, the francophones are the folks telling us how to hold our tongues to pronounce \\"r\\" or \\"l.\\" Why not have the English speaker do ALL of the English, and let the francophones do the French?I debated giving this a 3, but the sounds covered and the extent of coverage of each vowel make it worth a 4. It is also valuable that the CDs run through the pronunciation of groups of vowels, such as \\"eil\\" (soleil)."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"I bought this book as I need French spelled out phonetically. This book, however, just proved to be an exercise in frustration. For instance, on page 71 they cover the 'our' sound as in amour and jour and say it is pronounced as in the English word poor. This is accurate if you are pronouncing poor with a French accent. On page 5 it says to pronounce the vowel in le and me as in the English word again. I heard no similarity between the two sounds. I found no problems except with the comparison to English, but that is a huge problem. I'm getting rid of this book and trying a Berlitz. But for all you other language guides out there, with French in particular, add phonetic spelling, please."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"The text and CDs work quite well as a pronunciation guide.

They should be used only as a refresher for those who have a basic knowledge of French or as a supplement to other teaching materials."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"One of the most difficult things about learning French for the average English speaking person is getting the pronunciation correct. There are many nuances of sounds, meter, connecting syllables, etc. This book and accompanying CD organizes the skills you need in priority order and delivers on it's objective. In a brief time, you will develop a good accent even working 10-15 minutes a day. If you combine the study of this volume with a digital recorder and a French Reader that comes with a CD such asEasy French Reader w/CD-ROM: A Three-Part Text for Beginning Students (Easy Reader Series)you will really move quickly toward proper pronunciation. There are also some resources available that organize the phonetic sounds of the language into sound tracks combined with consonants. This is also a good way to practice and come at it a different way. Lastly, you may want to check outExercises in French Phonics."},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"I am using this now, as a library resource, but may well purchase a version, because I suspect I will be spending several hours a day with this for the next few months, at least. Not only does this break down all the various, irritating vowel combinations which usually leave the beginner wondering what sound is intended, it also is VERY good at showing the exceptions to rules. As good as the lessons on vowels and consonants are, the CD/book surpasses itself by providing long passages by native speakers, both as \\"Practice in Context\\" selections, as well as selections from French literature. This is going to be the method I make use of to try to have nearly flawless French when I travel to France. It's almost impossible to completely remove a foreign accent from a newly-acquired language, but if i can at least sound as good in French as educated foreign speakers generally do when speaking English, that will be pleasant!!"},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"I bought this method not really expecting much from it but I was pleasantly surprised! I have yet to complete all the lessons but so far I think they it\`s really quite excellent. The book that comes with it is incredibly detailed and very useful. For those that require the IPA symbols they are also included as well as diagrams of how to position your mouth. For the price of the method it really is fantastic and it surpassed all my expectations. I live in France but struggle with my accent and pronunciation and let me tell you, it can be an incredible handicap. I haven\`t yet finished the lessons but I feel as though I have already made a marked improvement. If you can\`t take a French phonetics course at La Sorbonne than I suggest you buy this method, the makers themselves have studied there so you're really getting the next best thing!"},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages)","review":"This is a well-organized summary of French pronunciation.

However, if you are serious about perfecting your pronunciation, this is for you.The material concentrates on the many pronunciations for \\"a\\", for example. It covers in detail all the pronunciations for the various letters, beyond what most would attempt. In fact most don't notice or care about the subtle differences in how \\"a\\" is pronounced in different words.

If you want to know more about Mr. Wunderman's life or the history of direct marketing then this book is for you. However, the book promises to deliver on &quot;making advertising pay&quot; and it simply doesn't. What techniques you learn about direct marketing are antidotal and have to be mined from a lot of ore. The first few pages enumerate Mr. Wunderman's 19 principles which is about the only direct how-to we get."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"This book is interesting particularly for the evolution of direct marketing that Wunderman describes--and to a large degree, instigated. Readers will notice a tendency for Wunderman to toot his own horn, but don't worry; it doesn't ever become obnoxious.The book would be good as a general guide as to what works and what doesn't--and why--in direct marketing. If a company is looking at direct marketing as a possible direction, this would be a good place to start to get an idea of what is involved, and what it takes to be successful. It may or may not help the reader that Wunderman describes using his techniques in marketing both goods (flowers) and services (credit cards).In the end, you get more history from it than hard, specific tips. A very good read, but don't expect it to be &quot;100 tips to direct marketing success&quot;. The hints are there, but you'll need to dig them out."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"As a Direct Marketeer I was really impressed by Wunderman's clear, sophisticated, simple book that is REALLY about direct selling ! For a Direct Marketing &quot;freshmen&quot; it helps to think about what you should think about. And for profis it is a treasure of Direct Marketing strategies that allready worked."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"What a story! Wunderman invented so many of the marketing techniques we take for granted. Now he shares the inside story on how it did it. An inspiring trip through some of the greatest marketing ever."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"Wunderman provides a glimpse into a long and prosperous career in the direct advertising industry. Emphasizing the journey and the road to discovery rather than the actual destination, this book outlines how and when key direct marketing concepts were created, where he employed them, and the results which were achieved. I liked this book but it did take me some time to plow through it. I struggled to remain focused through parts of the book but, overall, it was a pretty enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"I have had the pleasure and honor of knowing and working with Lester Wunderman and still found this book informative adv full of new ideas. I can't imagine the impact on a relative newcomer to the field. It's absolutely brilliant. I can guarantee you at least five new ideas for your business."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"Since the book is over ten years old, I bought myself a used copy. It's terrific. I'm not sure the book is in print anymore but either way, the copy I bought was in such great shape that I don't even notice it's used.One of the surprising things about this book is that it's written without much of an ego. When Lester fails, he says so, when he does well, he attributes it to uncovering a direct marketing insight - not being chosen by the celestial gods and being struck by a lightening bolt. You can tell from reading that Lester Wunderman worked very hard, believed in himself and constantly searched for the unmet needs of customers. None of these disciplines go out of style.The organization of information in this book is more like reading a biography than a marketing textbook yet the insights build upon each other and help you sharpen your understanding of direct marketing. It's an easy weekend read and a useful book for anyone in the marketing field, particularly those who may be looking to create more value for customers with their marketing efforts. I also encourage digital marketers to pick up this copy too because Wunderman's insights have many applications for today's CRM, SEM, SEO and web analytics practices."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"If you are looking for a book that will give you the top 10 list of how to make your advertising pay, then this is not the book for you. Mr. Wunderman's memoir is a look back on a life-time spent coming up with creative direct marketing solutions to business problems.My key takeaways from this book are to understand that the way to achieve truly impressive breakthroughs is not to resort to tried and true formulas. The formulas will get you incremental improvement at best.For example Wunderman discusses how he sponsored a Chicago radio show of a prominent minister to target those in need of hearing aids. In another section he is challenged to develop a million leads for a rose grower who typically received 150,000 new prospects a year.In both cases, Wunderman hits it out of the park.The key insight to enjoying the book is to listen to Wunderman's repsonse to legendary copywriter Maxwell Sackheim's question, \\"What is it that you do?\\" Wunderman's answer, \\"I get clients and help them with their marketing problems.\\"Wunderman is a troubleshooter, and his toolset is direct marketing.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"Now in an updated second edition, Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay presents the wisdom and practical experience of advertising legend and direct marketing pioneer Lester Wunderman, perhaps best known for his guidance behind the ubiquity of the American Express card, the creation of the Columbia Record Clob, and the well-known L.L. Bean. Although Being Direct focuses especially upon successful direct marketing, the experiences recounted within the pages are critically important to any business striving to get the most out of its advertising budget. From inventing new direct marketing media to how to successfully start an advertising agency to speculations of changes in the future and more, Being Direct is an eye-opening look at the changing business-consumer relationship from the point of view of a man who not only adapted to modern revolutions of information technology, but put them to use for success beyond anyone's dreams."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"Lester's tale really gives you an inside look at how the entire 'Direct' movement started and his place in it's history. I loved the format of this book; being story formatted made it read much easier than many of the dry books out there on Direct Marketing and Advertising. This book should be a part of any real marketers collection. It's thick with timeless tips and techniques you may glean from it's pages."},{"Title":"Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay","review":"Being Direct uses many different company and industry examples to outline the development of the Direct Marketing industry. Wunderman does a good job, in a somewhat autobiographical way, as he demonstrates how direct marketing found its niche in the marketing world. Direct Marketing, due to mistaken perceptions among marketing industry experts and large advertisers, took many years to gain recognition. Wunderman asserts that Direct Marketing was, at first, seen as essentially no more than direct mail order advertising. Industry reluctance changed, however, as advertisers and marketing industry experts began to see that through direct marketing an advertiser could better know its customer segments and achieve better sales and profitability results by better catering to those customers' needs. Accordingly, Wunderman provides many examples to prove that the subtitle, \\"Making Advertising Pay\\", is certainly an appropriate descriptor for Direct Marketing.This book is written in a story-like narrative that makes it a pretty quick and easy one to read."},{"Title":"Dios en el Ritz: La atraccion del infinito (Spanish Edition)","review":"La sencillez y genialidad de Monse&ntilde;or Albacete se pone de manifiesto en este libro en donde va dando respuesta a las preguntas m&aacute;s verdaderas de cada ser humano.

A splendid look at actions in Missouri and Arkansas sets the stage for further accounts of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson and the usual litany of the AOT theatres of battle.I found the text very reader friendly, although a few more maps would have been helpful. This edition's use of large-style print was also a treat. His discourse on some key military personalities is very interesting - especially his take on Sherman. I never &quot;saw&quot; Cump Sherman viewed with these insights before! A new intro/preface brings the reader up-to-speed on the current literature concerning the Army of Tennessee to offer the reader a more modern take on exploits of A. S. Johnston, Bishop Polk, Bragg and Hood. An excellent starting point for future in-depth study."},{"Title":"The Army of Tennessee (Monographs, sources, and reprints in Southern history)","review":"I still find this book useful, despite the sources that have been discovered or reinterpreted since Horn wrote his book. He blends anecdotal information with larger views on strategy and poltical conflicts. The story of the Army of Tennessee is still a story that remains largely untold, and Horn tells it very well."},{"Title":"The Army of Tennessee (Monographs, sources, and reprints in Southern history)","review":"I like reading some of the older books written on various aspects of the Civil War. Stan Horn's book is often quoted in many of the bibliographies of more recent vintage. Despite its age, it remains a key work on the Confederacy's war plans in its Central theater of operations. It is remarkably devoid of Confederate excuses.The book focuses on the performance of the Army of Tennessee and Horn places the blame for its poor performance where it belongs, on the Confederacy's High Command. He does an unusually good job with the bickering that occurred in key command positions, analyzes Jeff Davis' curious support for Braxton Bragg and lays the blame for this Army's ultimate destruction under John Bell Hood where it belongs, at the feet of Jeff Davis.Well written and researched, it is a book well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Army of Tennessee (Monographs, sources, and reprints in Southern history)","review":"Stanley F. Horn's book was first published in 1941, but it still remains a key tool on learning about the Confederacy's tragic, \\"other\\" army. Although Lee's Army of Northern Virginia gets most of the press, the stories involving the Confederacy's other major army are just as compelling. And that is the key feature of Horn's book. His writing style is very compelling in its own right and will keep you turning the pages. And, surprisingly, as another reviewer pointed out, despite being a Nashville native, Horn's book is not full of Lost Cause mythology and excuses like some other books of this time period. What you get from Horn is the facts and certainly his opinion. If you are a fan of Braxton Bragg or John Bell Hood you might want to skip this book because Horn is not afraid on heaping blame on them. To his credit, though, Horn praises Bragg and Hood when he feels it is due (mostly for ideas they had as opposed to their execution of said plans). While Thomas Lawrence Connelly's two volume work on the AOT from the 1970s has surpassed Horn's for an academic, scholarly look at the Army, Horn's book still deserves a place on your shelf for its readability and stories from the command tent down to the privates."},{"Title":"The Army of Tennessee (Monographs, sources, and reprints in Southern history)","review":"The Army of Tennessee, By Stanley F.Horn. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1952.This book is a look at the Army of Tennessee; known by some as the Confederacy's \\"other Army\\", the first Army being the Army of Northern Virginia. Horn gives a detailed examination about the army that operated between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River during the American Civil War. The army fought until the end of the war in 1865, participating in most of the significant battles in the Western Theater. The book focuses mostly on the army's campaigns throughout the war with emphasis on the leadership changes and the problems that the army faced throughout the course of the war. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, renaming the Army of Mississippi. Its first commander was General Braxton Bragg, followed by Joseph E. Johnston and John Bell Hood. Horn demonstrates that it was these Changes in leadership along with lack of supplies that affected the army's performances in battle.The sources that Horn uses are mostly primary such as; Jefferson Davis' own personal accounts, Ulysses S. Grant's letters and several newspaper articles just to name a few. These sources are helpful in understanding the hardships that the Army of Tennessee went through as well as giving more insight into military strategies of the day. This book is written chronological order from the beginning of the war to the end. Each battle is given its own chapter, which provides great detail. While there is much detail in the chapters, they are short and easy to read and understand. There are not a lot of photos or maps, but the ones that are provided, are given with purpose. They provide examples to the reader of what it is that Horn is attempting to convey. The topics in this book are not controversial at all and are quite the opposite. The book was originally written in 1941 and the material is well established. In the notes, Horn provides information that adds to his original thoughts in the book. The notes section can almost be used as an additional source or chapter filled with information that did not fit anywhere else in the book.The Army of Tennessee's first commander was General Braxton Bragg, who fought Union Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland to a draw at the Battle of Stones River on December 31, 1862. However, Bragg was forced to withdraw from Murfreesboro and fall back on Tullahoma. In the summer of 1863, Rosecrans began an offensive, known as the Tullahoma Campaign. Union forces gradually forced Bragg to fall back into northern Georgia, abandoning the important railroad hub of Chattanooga. Chattanooga was important because it provided supplies to the Confederacy and ensured that they could hold the West. Reinforced by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps from the Army of Northern Virginia, the Army of Tennessee was able to inflict a significant defeat on Rosecrans at Chickamauga in September 1863.After Chickamauga the Army of Tennessee besieged the Union army in Chattanooga,. The Army of the Cumberland was reinforced by the troops of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee, along with two corps from the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, and Grant replaced Rosecrans in command. Bragg then sent Longstreet's forces to Knoxville and nearly all of his cavalry away, reducing his army's strength. The combined Union army was able to inflict a significant defeat on Bragg at the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, forcing Bragg to abandon the siege of Chattanooga and withdraw again into northern Georgia. Horn says this about Bragg, \\"Bragg could be trusted to bungle.\\"(293) Horn maintains that Bragg was an incompetent leader. Shortly thereafter, Bragg was replaced as by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston.In the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, Johnston faced the combined Northern armies of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, whose orders were to destroy the Army of Tennessee, with the capture of Atlanta as the secondary objective. Johnston, who felt the continued existence of his army was more important than protecting territory, tended to avoid battle with Sherman, executing a skillful withdrawal, which caused impatience among the Confederate leadership in Richmond, particularly Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had never gotten on well with Johnston. Following Sherman's outflanking of Johnston at the Chattahoochee River, Johnston was replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. Hood's tenure as commander proved disastrous. After several unsuccessful attempts to force Sherman's withdrawal from Atlanta, the city fell to Union troops on September 2, 1864. Hood turned west and headed back north into Tennessee, allowing Sherman to turn south unopposed for the March to the Sea. On November 30, 1864, Hood lost almost a quarter of his troops, but continued to advance north into central Tennessee, where he attempted to besiege Nashville. Hood failed to take back Nashville and in 1865 he handed command back to Johnston. The Army of Tennessee was surrendered at Bennett Place near Durham Station, North Carolina on April 26, 1865. The men furled their flags, stacked their arms, and received their paroles, and then headed home.This book is a well organized in depth look at the Army of Tennessee. Horn knows the history and the military aspect well. Even though this book is older, it is still a useful source for anyone who studies military history. It is not a light read however, I would not recommend it to anyone who is a casual reader of history. It is a long book and one should be aware of this."},{"Title":"The Army of Tennessee (Monographs, sources, and reprints in Southern history)","review":"The Army of the Tennessee is a good find for the War Between the States enthusiast.

It's an entertaining novella, but not Jones' best.Heather lives at Castlemaine, where her parents are the curators. But Heather hates the tourists and the lack of privacy. Then one day, she climbs onto an old mound and wishes that the legendary Wild Robert would come help her get rid of the tourists. Then she hears a voice: \\"Did someone call?\\"It turns out that Wild Robert has been trapped in the mound for over three hundred years, because he studied the magic arts. Now he's just as ticked off as Heather is about the tourists -- but unlike Heather, he has no problem using his magic to help drive them away...Diana Wynne-Jones seems to specialize in stories about the fantastical intruding on everyday people. And \\"Wild Robert\\" is one of those books. It's only a short novella (or long short story), but Jones manages to keep the storyline interesting and original (such as the feud of the old paintings).Jones' customary sense of humor carries the story along, with the background about medieval witchcraft, magic, and the clash with modern-day tourists (who can be pretty obnoxious). The problem is that there isn't much of a plot -- Wild Robert visits, works magic, and weird things happen. At the end of the book, the story is clearly ongoing. Nothing changes, except that Wild Robert is hanging around.Heather and Wild Robert are the principal characters in this book, and they are the only ones who get much development. Heather is a fairly typical Jones heroine, gutsy and willing to believe the unbelievable. It's Wild Robert himself who steals the show, with his tragic past and distinctly odd sense of humor.\\"Wild Robert\\" is an entertaining light read, with a likable half-living hero and plenty of supernatural hijinks, but at the end you wish that Jones had expanded it into a fuller book."},{"Title":"Wild Robert","review":"This story is about a little girl who lives in an old house where her parents are the caretakers and tourguides.

This work is good, but gives the feeling it's not one thing or t'other. It would make an excellent first two or three chapters for a novel, or, if rewritten, an excellent short story. As is, with 116 pages, it is either too much, leading nowhere, or not enough. Personally, since I can't get enough of her work, I would vote for a novel ;)."},{"Title":"Chords (Guitar Reference Guide)","review":"Chords are organized in sets that may make sense to the layout designer, but don't seem well thought out in terms of playing music. For instance, inversions of chords are displayed on pages that have no apparent connection with each other. . . this makes it messy to actually see the full scope of the permutations of a particular chord. I'd prefer to see the chords on facing pages, so I don't have to flip to obscure and poorly indexed sections in order to see other versions, or inversions.Worst of all is the large, silly picture of a guitar at the top of each page. It takes up a quarter of the available space on most pages and is sometimes repeated twice on each page, with two more on the facing page, taking up half the available space! This is intended to be an instant transposition guide and is the least elegant attempt I have ever seen in a book of this kind.Joe Charupakorn's book on arpeggios is much better, but even there some essential shapes are missing and page layout, while better than this effort, is non-intuitive and poorly conceived.His book on scales is better still, so obviously he knows how to do this work but it looks like some layout people, with limited knowledge of this field, actually put those thousands of diagrams together.All of these books are in black and white. No color. Music charts cry out for color. I would pay many times more for well bound books, with good concepts in color-coding. Gray roots, red fifths, blue minor thirds, or whatever. You can do this yourself with a scanner and computer, but we buy books so we don't have to do just that kind of donkey work."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"James Baldwin is a tortured soul. He pours his whole soul onto every page. This makes him one of America's greatest writers. His word pictures take you into the church, on a picnic, into a country farm house and into the lives of all his characters. Long Live James Baldwin. In our hearts."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"'Going to Meet the Man' is a diverse collection of short stories which attempt to explain the psyche of young black American boys/men in the early 1950s. Yes, there is anger and frustration. But the author's excellent prose elevate the stories beyond stereotype. He is compassionate without making these characters into martyrs of white America.Of course many will argue these stories are badly dated. And true, America has moved on (generally for the better) since the early 1950s. But it would be unfortunate to overlook these stories for this reason. Baldwin captures the essence of where American society has come from, and we can all learn from history. I also feel it is unfortunate that nearly all the readers of \\"Going to Meet The Man' will be African-Americans, unlike myself (..who have the most to learn).Bottom line: terrific tidbits showing Baldwin's brilliance. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"&quot;blues for Sunny&quot;.. is a great work.... Baldwin draws a fine picture without making any of the characters either too accessible or too distant.. plus the ending passage describing the jazz combo.. and the journey they were taking in the music is breathtaking..."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"But I had to read it for school so it felt like a chore to read it althoug I did find it a bit interesting at times."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"Baldwin's ability to weave through various times throughout a story is exemplified best in &quot;Sonny's Blues,&quot; where he alludes to Isiah with the cup of trembling, and moves through different periods of Harlem, the childhoods and young lives of the narrator and his brother, the constants, in the church and the community and the music, which tells that same story, which must be retold, again and again. The way Baldwin writes about music is virtually unparallelled. In these short stories, he manages to stay clear of the sometimes excessive sentimentality that comes out in novels like Another Country. We sympathize with everyone, we see everyone's need for love, the intense loneliness of human experience, and the individual alienation and experience that results from societal divisions of race and sexuality. The first two stories contain the same characters from his famous first novel Go Tell it on The Mountain. The biblical imagery in these stories is not always pronounced as it may be in Go Tell..., but Baldwin's command of the bible show us the fear and the decadence that it exalts even when the allusions are abstract. The cup of trembling, the sight of the father's foot in the first story. Baldwin is a writer whom people have expected something out of and have been disappointed with because he does not fit into the desired mold of the black writer or the gay writer or even the american writer. He can be an objective political essayist or a sentimental dramatist, and here, he offers cold, somewhat detatched portraits of american lives which are among the best portraits of these people ever written. He puts the lives of marginal americans, from poor white rural southerners, to expatriates, and black urban displaced men and women, into the dramatic realm that hints of myth. His descriptions are riveting, his sexual honesty can be rude, exposing the reader to the America that exposed him."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"Each of the stories contained in this book deal frankly and honestly with the fear and agony associated with love, hate, prejudice and the suffering humans endure at the hands of their fellow man. All the stories are intense, haunting and in the case of the title story, \\"Going to Meet the Man\\", just plain chilling. Other notable stories are \\"The Man Child\\", \\"Sonny's Blues\\" and \\"Previous Condition\\". This is a good place to start if you're just discovering James Baldwin. Also recommended are his novels, \\"Giovanni's Room\\", \\"Another Country\\" and \\"Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone\\"."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"I am slowly understanding why Mr. Baldwin elected to leave the United States for more than a decade in the 1940s and 1950s. He apparently is on record as saying that he needed to flee because his anger was going to destroy him if he did not seek a respite from American injustice.Upon reading this collection, I think I am really beginning to understand what must have been going through his mind. Read \\"Previous Condition\\" where a young African American man keeps being thrown out of hotels and denied jobs simply because of the color of his skin. There is nowhere he can go without meeting the hostile glances and conspiratorial whispers of people on the street simply because of his skin color. And there is a moment where it all came into focus for me, standing in the kitchen of his Jewish friend's Jules' apartment. And I quote:\\"Oh,\\" I cried, \\"I know you think I'm making it dramatic, that I'm paranoiac and just inventing trouble! Maybe I think so sometimes, how can I tell? You get so used to being hit you find you're always waiting for it. Oh, I know, you're Jewish, you get kicked around, too, but you can walk into a bar and nobody knows you're Jewish and if you go looking for job you'll get a better job than mine!\\" (78)It is deeply disturbing to think that a person has the suspicion and rage of the world cocked against their temple, but that was how it was (and still is). I have read much about the Civil Rights struggle and as a Jew myself, have listened to many stories from members of my family about prejudice but these stories, they uncover something. After seeing what happened in New Orleans with Katrina and listening to the empty discussions of \\"good schools\\", No Child Left Behind and test score mania, it opens your eyes to the fact that performance, optimism and opportunity are perceptions that, when absent, can ruin lives in ways that are hard to qualify.I highly recommend these stories but be prepared to become deeply uncomfortable because Baldwin had a powerful case to make about American hypocrisy and he makes it."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"A memorable book. It has been some years since I read this book but I still remember the impact it had on me, particularly the story about the deputy who remembers the day his parents took him to see a black man being publicly hanged. Powerful stuff and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"James Baldwin is known primarily for his essays and his first two novels (\\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" and \\"Giovanni's Room\\"), but I often tell readers that the place to start is with his first story collection, \\"Going to Meet the Man.\\" Baldwin's short fiction is more straightforward and accessible than are his essays (which are indeed excellent); each of the eight stories presents a different aspect of Baldwin's worldview; and unlike his early novels, where racism is treated as one aspect in the lives of characters, several of these stories confront the \\"racial issue\\" full on.Baldwin's short fiction may be easier to read, but it does not avoid uncomfortable truths. In fact, some of Baldwin's most heated writing can be found in this volume, which was first published in 1965. It contains work written over a 20-year-period, including \\"Previous Condition,\\" the first piece of fiction he ever published (in Commentary Magazine in 1948). A fledgling actor is torn between the black world of Harlem (\\"perfectly in his element, in his place, as the saying goes\\") and the white neighborhoods downtown. He stays at a friend's apartment in lower Manhattan, but has to hide from the landlord and leave the building at odd hours to avoid being seen by the other residents (\\"Why don't you go uptown, where you belong?\\").Each of the other stories is unforgettable in its own way, but my two favorites open and close the volume. \\"The Rockpile\\" is an early (yet different) version of an episode in \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\"; two of Baldwin's strengths are his ability to capture the memories of youth and to present the complexities of family life. The incendiary title story that ends the volume depicts a white police officer whose racial attitudes were formed by a lynching he witnessed as a child. Baldwin pits the very real horror of the police brutality experienced by a young man who attempts to register to vote against the officer's wholly imagined fear of the oversexed black stereotype.This last story--indeed, much of Baldwin's later fiction--has been criticized (by biographer James Campbell, for example) for lacking \\"a neutrality which Baldwin was finding harder than ever to maintain\\" and an unwillingness to \\"concede that somewhere, somehow, this corrupted man might incorporate genuine goodness.\\" Such comments seem unfair on two counts: the actions of some racists, while \\"pitiable,\\" are still beyond redemption or \\"goodness,\\" and (more to the point) I don't agree that it's a storyteller's responsibility to make lemonade out of every lemon.So ignore the critics who argue that Baldwin's fiction lost its shine as he grew older and more cynical and less \\"neutral,\\" and pick up this excellent collection of stories. I think you'll find that their bluntness and honesty and gritty realism make up for whatever stylistic faults the critics might point to."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"A fabulous collection of short stories that have not really aged in spite of the forty years gone since they were first published.Sonny's Blues is a real gem because it shows three ways out of deprevation, out of the mental ghetto that grows in a real ghetto, like Harlem, out of desperation and dereliction.One can go upward in society, become a teacher, through hard studies, get married, raise a family. In one way, accept the American Dream and forget about the tragedy, or the nightmare. God Save the American Republic !One can get into music and into a completely different world of imagination, art, harmony, research, rhythm, melody, all that the world does not provide. That is the Blues, Jazz, the fairyland of OZ. Unluckily you have to go there and come back.

Forget all that and shoot your veins. He who sees his veins can see his pains !James Baldwin is a master in the field of transforming human pain into heavenly light by sharing it with our souls. It does not erase the pain. It just makes it luminous, the light of a new way to some hazardous future. But where danger is, rescue is ready too , as H&ouml;lderlin used to say.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"James Baldwin is one of the best authors, in my opinion. Everything he wrote scores a 5 star rating with me. His stories are well written, full of compassion and drama. He puts so much of himself in his stories that it's sad to read them. The first time I read a book by James Baldwin I was hooked. If you like books about man's general evilness to his fellowman and the sickness of religious fanatics you'll love James Baldwin."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"I have been, as is my wont when I get \\"hooked\\" on some writer, on something of a James Baldwin tear of late, reading or re-reading everything I can get my hands on. At the time of this review I have already looked at \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\", the play \\"Blues For Mr. Charlie\\", \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone\\", and \\"The Fire Next Time\\". Those works, well written and powerful reminded me of why I was crazy to read everything that Baldwin wrote when I was a kid. I do not recall then having read any short stories by Baldwin, at least none that were memorable like one of the stories, \\"Sonny's Blues\\", in this \\"Going To Meet The Man\\" compilation.Now great writers, and I hope at this point in our common American literary experiences no one need argue James Baldwin's place in the canon, sometimes are capable of writing both great novels and short stories. Baldwin seems to be in that category, although off of this selection it may be a bit premature to make that judgment because most of the material appears to have been \\"first drafts\\" of later, full novelistic treatments. For example, \\"The Morning, The Evening, So Soon\\", the subject matter of which is the fame of a expatriate black actor-singer who despite that fame is still subject to all the racial taunts and tensions of a stay-at-home performer. (I am writing this review just after the passing away of the pioneer black singer/actress/black liberation fighter, Lena Horne.) That subject gets fuller treatment in \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone.\\"Other subjects that get a preliminary workout here are the deep religious experience of Baldwin's fundamentalist Protestant youth, \\"The Outing\\" that will get a full-blown treatment in \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain.\\" Of course, the subject of homosexuality, and bi-sexuality, are obliquely presented in several stories, Baldwin, along with Gore Vidal being something of American literary pioneers, if not honored as such at the time, on the subject. And of course, as with all of Baldwin serious work, we are treated to various manifestations of the ever present \\"race\\" question; interracial sex and marriage; degrees of blackness; white racism; black attitudes toward white racism; and the purposeful insularity of the white world in dealing, or nor dealing, with these questions, then and now.What you want to get this particular compilation for though, as I mentioned above, is for \\"Sonny's Blues\\". Now it is almost impossible to find any writer, any American writer at least, worth his or he salt who came of literary age in the 1950s who was not influenced, even if only around the edges, by \\"be-bop\\" jazz. Baldwin is no exception, although his race is not the only reason for that statement. The rhythm of the cool, abstract, high white note \\"be-bop jazz\\" that sent audiences into a frenzy of delight are a simple companion to the sparser, less lyrical literary beat of 1950's writing. Mailer, Kerouac, and most of the New York intellectual crew feasted, and feasted well, on that inner sound. But, nobody got it righter than James Baldwin in \\"Sonny's Blues.\\"What seemingly starts out as another one of Baldwin's epistles on, literally, brotherly love; that of two brothers, one, Sonny, several years younger than the other, who \\"grew up\\" in Harlem, grew away from each other by choice or circumstances,, reunited when now famed jazz pianist brother, Sonny, got caught up trying to reach that \\"high white note\\" via the \\"horse\\" drug connection that also has been associated with bop, turns into one of the best expositions of what jazz meant to the listener, and to the artist struggling to find his inner voice, that I have ever read.The last several pages, in counterpoint to the first several, are truly lyrical as Baldwin puts in words on the printed page what a struggle it was for Sonny, and his fellow band members in New York cafe society, to \\"make the gods listen.\\" And to make the heavens cry out for the high side of the human experience. You or I could try to write such lines for two hundred years and we could not get it right. Kudos, James."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"The first story I read in this was \\"Sonny's Blues\\" and I realized there was more to it than just a story- and that the blues is more than just b5ths but a greater understanding of life - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Going to Meet the Man","review":"Should be required reading for high school and college students. This is the kind of book I pick up throughout the years and it is still great."},{"Title":"Trolleycars, Streetcars, Trams and Trolleys of North America: A Photographic History","review":"While there are a number of books about streetcars and interurban trains of the past, few come as close to putting readers around and onboard them as this book does. Its modern-day, color photography of these vintage rail cars -- all preserved at rail museums around North America and Britain -- is nothing short of stunning.Grouped into chapters by historical era and car type, each featured car is profiled in a one or two-page spread containing a wonderful balance of words, statistics and photos. Combined, each chapter and profile allows readers not only to understand the history behind each car and its use, but also appreciate the details of each car's design and craftsmanship, right down to the brass controller handles, stained glass windows, and sleek curvatures.Covering everything from the 19th-Century horsecar predessesors of the trolley right through to the streamlined PCCs and Liverpool &quot;Liners&quot; that represented the end of the classic trolleycar era; this book is bound to satisfy both the serious urban rail enthusiast or historian, and anyone wanting to see what trolleys were like. If you enjoy the magic of trolleys, or the wonder of history vividly come to life in the present day, &quot;Trolleycars&quot; belongs in your hands!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I am a novice at financial markets. I picked up this book &quot;just because it was there&quot; (mountaineers will understand the pun!). I loved every page of it. The author's sense of humor and writing style is very impressive. What's more, for a finance novice, it is an education on bonds with a good mix of historical perspective. I found, at times, the author's low opinion of himself, a bit strange. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a candid account of the upheavals, tricks and treacheries of the financial market."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"An insider's look at the inside of an investor banking firm, with no holds barred. I enjoyed the descriptions of the characters particulary The Human Piranha, who sounds like Joe Pesci, Alexander the boy wonder trader, and Lou Ranieri who rose from the mailroom to the head of mortgage trading. Well written and great use of humor!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"First, this book is a biography of a chapter in Michael Lewis' life. It is NOT a book about increasing your personal wealth or about Wall Street high finance.That being said, this book is wonderfully well written, full of surprises, and the reference to the game of Liar's Poker carries well as a vehicle throughout the book. It was scary and comical to see what brokers and traders are actually doing with my money once I hand it over to them.I am glad that Michael Lewis survived his time on in the stock market and lived to tell us all about it. I will undoubtedly reread this book some time."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is hilarious. You don't need to have a Wall Street or business background to enjoy it. Think of the movie \\"Wall Street\\" if it had been a comedy instead of a drama. Michael Lewis relates his personal experiences with wicked humor mixed with thoughtful insight."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"As a business school student, I cannot thank the author enough for introducing almost everything on Investment banking and financial maket in the rawest depiction. The book is not only educational to any investors in any form..., but deliciously entertaining. MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The impression I gained from Liars Poker is that the book is almost a series of short stories, linked together by people or events. The writing style is very witty. But make no mistake, though this book is entertaining, it is not light. I learned plenty about the trading rooms, and such debt instruments as mortgage bonds that the heroes of this book traded.It also is a bit frightening- America has (or used to have) an image of financial people as rational beings- this book exposes them as living, breathing, emotional people who have an equal capacity to hit the lottery or go bust. Truly frightening considering the percentage of the world's capital that trades through &quot;the Street&quot; daily.This is not just a great book about the financial services industry, this is a good book PERIOD, and can be enjoyed by anyone who has some intelligence."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"LIAR'S POKER is a good read. This book offers a clever, even funny, first-hand analysis of what wrong with American business during the end of the 1980's. Author Michael Lewis provides a fascinating explanation, from an insider's point of view, of how those involved in the highest levels of the financial community made their obscene amounts of money--and how they destroyed the nation's economy in the process. His report is revelatory indeed. Anybody with an interest in the history of American business, or a curiosity about the high life in New York during an overheated decade, will find that LIAR'S POKER offers a great amount of detail."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Gutfreund's meeting with Merriwether at the beginning of this book is one of the greatest vignette's in financial history and sums up everything that is right and wrong with this industry.This book is required reading for anyone working in and around this industry. It helps that Lewis is a funny, witty writer with an unforgiving eye."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is the true story of a former Salomon Bros. bond saleman during the free wheeling mid 80's when they ruled the roost until their abrupt collapse.Much of the book is both hilarious and cautionary--and often for the same reason. The excesses of the cut throat and weird culture at Salomon and their &quot;screw the customer&quot; mantra (and action) if it conflicted with Salomon's perceived interests yield a not often seen inside view of the goings on. I should also point out here that the customers were wealthy individuals and institutions. A customer with 20 million dollars to deal with (in the mid-80's) was small potatoes. In fact, they were the ones that Salomon let loose their fledging traders on (this was a learn on the job job), since it wasn't considered of very great import if they &quot;blew them up&quot;, i.e., caused them to lose most of their money.Any business book that's actually readable stands out. And this one more than most. It's not only readable but quite cynically humorous. Since many of the reviews describe the very positive qualities of the book, let me mention some of its deficiencies, as I saw them.First, the author underplays his abilities. While directly depicting himself as not very good at his career, in fact it's quite clear he was an excellent salesman. This isn't so important in itself, but it is represents a tone in the book that to me indicates that the author was more into it and the Salomon culture than he writes and from which he tries to ethically distance himself.Additionally, most of the individuals (and the corporate culture) were so extreme that I would have liked to know what they were like and the lives they led away from work. One thing I would definitely be curious about is to what extent their cut throat and sleazy work behavior carried over into their personal lives. Were they solid pillars of the community (many of them were more than wealthy) or were they as much sleaze bags off the camera as well as on. Or, since it would probably be a mixed bag, how did they divide in general along these lines.This is one respect in which I think Tracy Kidder's _Soul of a New Machine_ is better, in addtion to Kidder's more natural language flow.But, I don't mean to appear negative. I really enjoyed the read, again finding it both amusing and cautionary.While reading it I remembered what a friend of mine who married wealth (&quot;I married her only for her money,&quot; he confessed to me as she stood beside him) and then increased it. I had visited him in the early 80's. &quot;If you ever need a bond salesman call Mr. X. He's completely honest.&quot; His wife seriously nodded in agreement.I, obviously naive, thought this a curuous remark. Why wouldn't he be honest? In general. But also when he depends on your repeat business.My friend was right, and this book will show you why."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The author did a great job in making this book as funny as possible while still sticking to the core of the book, the rise and fall of Solomon Brothers. (I REALLY fell of the chair laughing a couple of times). Details of various accounts that occuered during the authors employeement at solomon add to the excitment and provide valuable lessons to apply to the real world. This book is a classic and should be in every &quot;wall street addict's&quot; library"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I picked up a copy of this book after reading Moneyball - Michael Lewis's book on the business of baseball (an excellent book that I have now read several times). Although Wall Street does not hold the interest to me that baseball does, this is an entertaining and informative book on big money trading in the 80's. I was engaged from start to finish with the personalities of the folks at Salomon Brothers (the firm which Lewis trained and worked for). Although I am not familiar with the details of bond trading, this was a facinating journey and well told. Fun to read about Milken, Perelman, Icahn from the days when they were only known by readers of the Wall Street Journal and not household names. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys finding out about corporate culture and how the personalities of the individual can shape and effect the whole. Then pick-up Moneyball and see how a maverick personality has started to effect change in baseball."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael should never have wasted his time - and sullied his reputation - by writing his paean to Jim Clark, the elder statesman of the 'dot bomb' generation (\\"The Next Next Thing\\") By doing so, he missed out on the real story of the age. But hey, no one's perfect. \\"Liar's Poker\\" about the Wall Street of the 1980s and is one of THE finest books about the realities of that perenially shaddy business. Anyone who read it, and took its message to heart, would have seen the 'dot bomb' coming from a mile away. Too bad publishers weren't buying THAT story. Lewis is a thoroughly entertaining writer. \\"Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street\\" is a newly minted subtitle of which I thoroughly disapprove. There has been no 'rising' since 1980. It's been fraud piled upon fraud as Michael knows better than most. I worked on \\"The Street\\" in the 1980s and his account is 100% accurate - which should have scared the heck out of any investor with a brain."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Lewis spins a rollicking tale around the formative years of a niche in the bond market which still exists today. Aside from simply teaching the lay person a very basic lesson in finance, Lewis gives us glimpse onto the trading floor that we may or may not want to see. Investors will shudder and those ambitious souls with iron stomachs (you'll have to read the book)will pack their bags for the city to become traders.I originally read this book because of its relevance to my job in the asset-backed bond industry. For those just starting out in the business, it is a must read.For anyone else who enjoys a well-written yet hilarious trip to The Street, I highly recommend Liar's Poker."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Not a card game at all but a game of bluff and sizing up your opponent. It is very appropriate that the book starts off with the example of John Gutfreund (CEO of Salomon) trying to engage his chief bond trader in a single round of Liars Poker for 1 million dollars, because it is symptomatic of the egos of the players, the money that was being made and the excesses that characterised what is now generally called the greed decade.Lewis's perspective is that of an insider as he was a bond trader for Salomon Brothers in their New York and London offices. It's generally a very funny story with some hilarious descriptions of some of the characters and their behavior. Hilarious that is, until you realise that damage was being done to lives, companies and industries. As the author so succintly put it &quot;the range of acceptable conduct...was wide indeed.It said something about the ability of the free marketplace to mold people's behavior into a socially acceptable pattern...this was capitalism at its most raw, and it was self-destructive.&quot; That this was true he goes on to illustrate with stories about trades gone bad, deals losing millions, and people skewered for things they had no knowledge of. I guess you could say that this was Darwinian Capitalism, these people had evolved into predators and were at the top of the food chain. Lewis himself says as much &quot;the place was governed by the simple understanding that the unbridled pursuit of perceived self-interest was healthy. Eat or be eaten.&quot; It is no coincidence that one of his colleagues was called the Human Piranha!. Naturally, behaviour like this will lead to a messy ending and so it is, with the story culminating with a description of the Stock Market crash of '87 and Salomon itself in trouble.I read this book at about the same time as 'Den of Thieves' and would recommend both (that is, if you are interested in a historical view of Wall Street; remember these events took place 10-15 years ago). Liars Poker is good for the witty personal perspective Lewis brings, the other book gives a broader view of Wall Street and an investigative journalistic perspective of the insider trading scandal involving Michael Milken et al."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Coming from an &quot;insider&quot; this tells the story about the inner workings of the finance company rather beautifully. The situations created are hilarious and the author is certainly witty at times - which overall makes it a nice, light book to read. Some of the chracters created are very interesting and funny. However, I have two gripes. One, the author is unable to hide his dislike for his company's CEO and it comes out from the book that he is less than fair to him. Two, the book gets a little technical at times going into, for example, the details of how a mortgage bond work and why is better (or not) vis a vis a junk bond. Coming from a bond salesman they are not rather expected but they do take away the basic flow of the book. Overall a funny book with average grades."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is the book so many others have tried to imitate, Michael Lewis's classic account of his time as a bond salesman. Like many of his imitators, Lewis has a seemingly endless supply of funny stories about his time at Salomon's bond desk during its glory days. Unlike others, however, Lewis is also tremendously insightful about what the real meaning of his job was, and what such a culture implied for the state of the American economy and culture."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Do you want a great laugh? Well I had one with this book. Normally it takes a while to warm me up, but Lewis did the job in 10 pages. The book gives a good impression about 'the big swinging ...', but watch out. Don't start reading, if you don't have the time to finish it the same day. The book kept me out of the pool for a hole day on my vacation, so, for all you big swingers, have fun and buy the book...(I read the book 2 years ago, but it's still in my head! )"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"LIAR's POKER by Michael Lewis is an interesting exploration of the excesses of investment banking, trading in the 1980s. The author's many anecdotes throughout the book are often fairly amusing, particularly his description of mortgage traders as well as the students who sat in the back row of his Salomon Brothers training class. More importantly, however, the book covers many important themes. I believe the book actually has something to teach the reader about mismanagement and the consequences of office politics. Furthermore, the nature of the broker is exposed insofar as his relationship to his employer and his client are concerned. That is, the broker will ultimately serve his employer at the expense of his client when necessary.I recommend this book not only for amusement and insight on the go-go 1980s trading years, but also for the reader to pick-up on some of the themes of management, the impact of office politics, and the history of investment banking and trading."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Sell your soul and buy this book with the change! I read this book -several times- a good few years back and having just picked up a new copy and finished it in one go, it is still a classic read after all these years. Lewis's behind the scenes peek at Wall Street's 'Greed is Good' mentality of Salomon's bond dealers in the 1980's is a book that gets a hook in you from the very start. People still talk about Liar's Poker after a decade, it's that good. Read it and believe it."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Lewis is a witty guy, and this makes it an enjoyable read. He does try to make some serious points, and basically demonstrates that an Art History major makes for great conversation and metaphors, but little true insight. Lastly, always beware of people who hold themselves out as the only rational/honest guy in the bunch."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I worked for CSFB for three years, and am still in investment banking for a smaller firm. So I have seen a part of the world that is described here. I'm not saying that this is an exact description of what I saw, because Lewis picks the most exotic creatures that he met, but the atmosphere is perfectly conveyed. This book will tell you all the stuff that they don't teach you in an interview or recruitment visit - the pecking order, the politics, and how to get paid.The other reason to read this is that Lewis is a brilliant writer, with a real talent for describing people and their situations. Lots of other people have written boring books with the same raw material. For a non-specialist like my mother, the technicalities were hard work, but you don't need a lot of special knowledge to like this book. My mother certainly did.Probably the best way to look at this book is like a travel book - you're not visiting a country, you're visiting a world. Great travel books are not word-perfect descriptions of a place, they are representations of what the author felt like when he was there, and they give the reader a feeling of what it was like to be there. If you read this book, you will understand what it feels like to work inside a big bank, and you'll enjoy the ride, even if you have no interest in actually working there."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In the 1980's, Michael Lewis was a neophyte bond salesman for Salomon Brothers in New York and London for four years. Liar's Poker is a high-stakes game the traders, salesmen, and executives play each afternoon, but it is also a metaphor for the Salomon culture of extreme risk-taking with immediate payoffs and clear winners and losers.This is the story of how Lewis survived the training program, inept but mean-spirited management, an aborted take-over even featuring a white knight, layoffs and the 1987 market crash before quitting to find his real calling as a business journalist. While Lewis's career did not take off quickly, he eventually became a highly paid producer, although not in the league of the true top dogs.Lewis tells the real story of Wall Street in both go-go and crash days with self-deprecating humor enlivened with his ecletic wit. Colorful and well-known Wall Street characters appear such as Michael Milken, Lazlo Birini, Warren Buffett, Bill Simon, Sr. and John Guetfruend. All business students need to read this as even those with advanced degrees in finance such as myself, will learn how things really work. The story of how the junk bond and collateralized mortgage backed security markets emerge is told to fill in a chapter in financial history. Perhaps most interesting is some of the political machinations, rampant at Salomon, which lead for example for Salomon to ignore the junk bond market, allowing others to flourish and eventually attempt to take-over Salomon using junk bonds.Lewis also describes for all investors the conflicts of interest and lack of governance on Wall Street long before Eliot Spitzer and Arthur Levitt became the champions of the little guy. My next step is to read Lewis's later books."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a funny look at life on Wall Street; especially the life of lower-level employees getting their start in the financial world. Michael Lewis uses the personal experience of his financial career in the Salomon Brothers bond program to tell the larger story of the rise and fall of the entire firm during the 1980s. Along the way he tells some funny stories and gives the reader an interesting, inside look at the fast-paced life on Wall Street. But in the end, the book starts to drag and Lewis's cynical view of the securities industry begins to get tiresome. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what a trader's life is like inside a major Wall Street firm. It is an interesting, initially humorous read that is appropriately not much longer than 200 pages in length."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"What a great read. A friend of mine recommended this to me and I can say that it certainly was a refreshing read.This book tells you about some of the influential people who shaped Salomon Brothers and Wall St in the eighties. I never realised the history that went with Salomon Brothers.The style is great and I can really identify with the author's early years going through the stages of obtaining and starting a job. Some of the characters in the book are hilarious, you can only just believe they are real.Only one complaint: sometimes the author goes on for quite a long time with his history e.g. the history of junk bonds and the history of various people in SB. I only wish that there was more about the author's story.Only one gripe though, and it can't prevent this from being a 5 star book.Buy it now! Thanks to the book, I am now constantly searching for books like this but this is the only one I have found recounting the story of a salesman as opposed to a trader."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Almost everyone who is graduating is tempted by the glamour and large bonuses of Investment Banks to wonder what it would be like to work in a large investment bank on Wall Street and actually consider it as a serious career option. LIAR'S POKER provides an irreverent, bird's eye view of the whole process. This is an extraordinarily funny but thought provoking account of a money focussed guy's innings at a venerable Investment bank Salomon Brothers, starting as a $48,000-a-year trainee in 1984 to go on to become an institutional bond salesman in Salomon's London office earning $225,000 in 1987. Far from just being entertaining the book gives lots of insight into the intense cutthroat investment banking industry and makes it accessible for even the naivest of readers the intricacies of the milieu. An insider's look at the inside of an investor banking firm, with no holds barred, which makes it probably one of the most recommended books for anyone considering more than a passing acquaintance with the investment banking industry."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"**** I read this book in my last undergraduate year of college.At that time, Lewis provided me with an eye-opening, first-hand glance oflife in the high-flying world of finance (1980's) and the personalitiesthat drove that period forward. It was relevant reading material since Iwas intending to pursue a career in the financial services industry, andhere was a book written by a former bond salesman in the New York andLondon offices of Salomon Brothers.**** Nevertheless, this book is not limited to only those interested or involved in the worldof business. This book is for anybody who is curious how the S&amp;L crisis emerged; how the Reaganadministration's deregulations affected the salaries of a select few in the US financial industry;how much the tax burden of the average American citizen grew as a result. This book is perfectfor those who dislike the dry writing found in historical textbooks.**** Lewis's anecdotes will leave you in stitches! I am now working in thefinancial services industry. Most of the people I run into seem to have read this book at an earlier ageand most enjoyed it as much as I did.**NOTE** Other &quot;financial history&quot; books that could be comparedto &quot;Liar's Poker&quot;, but written with very different writingstyles:&quot;Merchants of Debt&quot; by George Anders;&quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis writes about his journey in becoming a bond salesman and his two years of work experiences at Salomon Brothers. While the book does offer some information about the finacial innovations driving the bond business in the 1980s, I think the principle thrust of the book is an examination of the culture and the personalities of Wall Street trading desks. The first chapter story, which is the basis for the title of the book, involving John Gutfreund and John Meriwether encapsulates the nature of this world.This book is an important read for anyone who thinks they might want to become a trader/salesperson on Wall Street. If not, it is still a very interesting peek into a world that most people do not understand.My last comment is a minor criticism of Michael Lewis. Lewis writes in the first person and is obviously a very self-involved individual with an extremely high opinion of himself. This is more evident in his later writings and columns for various periodicals (e.g. his NY Times article on Long-Term Capital was sickening). Despite this criticism the book is still very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Somehow Michael Lewis went from Art History major at Princeton to investment banker with Salomon Brothers. In this book he shows that he understood what these markets are all about, in a way that eludes the grasp of people who may spend years majoring in finance, going to law school or business school and slaving away in these same markets without a clue as to how the whole thing hangs together.Using bond trading theory to trade whole companies and industries, as Lewis explains Michael Milken, is especially helpful, and it suggests that Warren Buffett is doing the same thing--buying companies by acting as a &quot;preferred&quot; lender.The &quot;us v. them&quot; relationship between an investment bank and its customers was interesting, and in our current market times, I see a lot of this in how financial planners do the same kind of petty ripoffs that Lewis describes using bigger dollars and bigger customers. It's possible that today's minor aspiring financial planner types could read this book and aspire to be an even bigger malefactor of great wealth. It's refreshing that Lewis bailed out of the business, and this book stands the test of time as a continuing accurate diagnosis of the problems with sinners running markets. The trouble is , there will never be anyone else to run them.At the end of the book, he seems to have a weakness for praising John Meriwether. Isn't that the guy who lost a huge sum of money in the recent &quot;Long Term Capital&quot; hedging disaster? Even that proves the point of this book, which is that none of these guys care at all about anything but the dollars to be made in front of their nose at the moment. Exactly as Adam Smith said."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liars' Poker is the quintessential business novel. Everyone businessman I know has either read it or heard of it. So, I decided that I should check it out.This book is an account of Michael Lewis' time at Salomon Smith Barney in the mid 80s, at the height of the junk bond craze. He perfectly describes the atmosphere of competitiveness and the vast rewards everyone was reaping as a result of the boom.What came as a surprise to me is that Lewis describes the mortgage bond market, an obtuse and vague instrument, very clearly and in a way most non-business people could also understand. This explanation also serves to show why these junk bonds ultimately collapsed.Then, of course, are his hilarious descriptions of his orientation, his bosses and coworkers. To read about these outlandish characters is worth the price of the book alone.So, to close, this book is a classic for a reason. It is informative and well written, but manages to be hilarious at the same time, a feat few authors can achieve. Read this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"A well-written book that exposes the \\"Money-is-God\\" attitude of Wall Street. From the profane, fat, slovenly, polyester-wearing traders that stuff their mouths all day long, to the frat-boy Ivy League trainees who heave paper-wads at the Salomon directors speaking in the training classes, one gets a highly accurate picture of the inside of a Wall Street investment banking firm.I was particularly amused by two anecdotes; the author had his first encounter with Salomon Brothers when he was seated next to the wife of a Salomon director at a St. James Palace dinner hosted by the Queen Mother. Of course, as close as she would get to the guests would be to stroll out of the room followed by her trained Corgi dogs who genuflect every 15 seconds. Perhaps insulted by the Queen Mother's indifference at her presence, the director's wife shouted out, \\"Hey Queen, nice dogs you have there!\\" after she passed. The second amusing anecdote occurs when the author is interviewed several times but not offered a job. Eventually a friend tells him that Salomon does not actually offer someone a job. Consequently, the author calls up the firm and says, \\"I accept the position\\", upon which he is welcomed as a new member of Salomon Brothers.The book also exposes the dirty little secret that Wall Street makes its money by entering into adversarial relationships with their clients. The author refers to this as \\"taking the other side of the fool\\". Specifically, Wall Street attempts to keep spreads on securities artificially wide in order to pocket that spread, for which they were ultimately busted by the SEC and heavily fined. They also hype stocks that they know are garbage because they have investment banking relationships with those companies (Merrill Lynch was just busted for this by the state of New York and heavily fined). Also, the investment banking fees they charge their clients to raise capital are grossly excessive, but their clients are too naive to understand this, or perhaps more accurately do not even care.Ultimately, the decline of the company that is chronicled in the book provides the following insight; even though Salomon always tried to hire the best and the brightest, this \\"talent\\" was eventually negated by the incompetence that arises from any hierarchical organization. That is to say, the brilliance of the few is always neutralized by the incompetence of the many inherent in the corporate structure."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I bought this book because I'd read Lewis' \\"The Big Short: Inside the Domesday machine\\" and was impressed by the author. But \\"Liar's Poker\\" is juvenile by comparison. It's not about what happened in the financial markets but rather about classroom hi-jinks and trading floor pranks. Who cares? I got 40% into the book and gave up."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis is one of those non-fiction writers who makes any subject that he writes about interesting, funny and enlightening."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The book was decent, but I thought that the writing style was a bit dry. I wish I could have paid 1/4 the price for the first 1/4 of the book, as I was really drawn in by the first few chapters. However, it seemed that the latter portions of the book didn't have much \\"new\\" material (they seemed to read more like a memoir than an introduction into the financial world). All in all, a good book, but I wouldn't consider it at the top of my list."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I got onto a finance reading kick recently, and Liar's Poker should have been near the beginning of my reading adventure. Why? He introduces some characters and problems that percolate through all of the other later stories. Wall Street seems perpetually plagued with only doing good for Wall Street.The narrative is funny at times. He got lucky, got a job, and then almost got rich. But, along the way, luckily, he kept his artist eye open and saw the follies of those around him and ultimately sees his own foolishness in participating. A good read. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I was enjoyable to read but i still don t get the big fuss and cross references to the book"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Although originally published in October 1989, Michael Lewis' 'Liar's Poker' is as timely a read today as it was back then. It seems the zero sum game in investment banking hasn't changed. For every money maker, there is a money loser, and usually it's the banks customers who lose.Described as 'wickedly funny,' Michael Lewis has a knack for articulating the absurd, and this is his first, and one of his best books. A true story of how he started his career as a trainee in the investment banking firm, Salomon Brothers, later becoming a bond trader based in the Salomons London office, until he left in 1988.He worked the phones, and on his customers, hard enough to become a 'Big Swinging Dick', or traders code for those who trumped the system, making millions for their company.Michael Lewis, unlike many other traders, did have a conscience, but he also wanted to keep his job. He makes up names for those who helped and inspired him at the firm, like 'Dash Riprock', his constant trader companion, and his 'Rabbis'; a mentor, or manager who took him under their wing.The author is less forgiving and used real names for those who deserve some kind of scorn, like John Gutfruend, who was chairman of Salomon Brothers during Michael Lewis' tenure there. Described as the 'last person a nerve-racked trader wanted to see.' He was the type of chairman who liked to sneak up from behind and surprise his traders.The author learns, soon after leaving his training for the trading desks that 'some of the men... were truly awful human beings... They didn't have customers. They had victims.'Other characters are colorfully portrayed in the book, although not many women are in the bunch, since, at the time, it was a male dominated play pen with not too many Big Swinging Dickettes. There was the 'Human Piranha,' a legendary trader who sprouted out profanities, stunning some trainees into silence and awe. And those 'mean gluttons' who worked as mortgage traders. Lewis wrote, 'nothing angered them more than being without food, unless it was being interrupted while they ate.'Michael Lewis also describes in the book the creation and use of mortgage bonds, but not too technically, so it won't overwhelm a layperson. And this is just one reason why 'Liar's Poker' is a timeless piece. After all, it was the invention of mortgage bonds that ultimately led to the financial crisis in 2008.And of course, the book would be vacant without mention of bonuses. Those fat sums of money handed out around December time to those who scored well enough to earn one. The size of a bonus measured the traders worth, and ego. Lewis adds and subtracts some zeros to give us an idea of how first and second-year traders bonuses were subject to a 'floor and ceiling.' And how the business 'froze' around bonus time. It was all anyone thought about. Michael Lewis explains that watching the faces of people coming out of their bonus meetings 'was worth a thousand lectures on the meaning of money in our small society.'The only difference between 1988 and now is that those excessive trader and executive bonuses are now part of a larger political and public discourse. In 'Liar's Poker,' Lewis describes how large salary bumps and bonuses are used to buy loyalty. But in reality, if an investment house across the street offers a better deal, the trader won't hesitate to go for more zeroes.Michael Lewis, is a respected financial journalist and non-fiction author. All of his books have been best-sellers for good reason. 'Liar's Poker' is an exemplary example of how truth can be stranger than fiction. Lewis describes life at Salomon like being in a 'jungle.' The players must be fiction, but, nope, they are real.The scary thing about this book is how timeless, and prophetic it is. Michael Lewis experienced the Wall Street crash of October 1987, and describes it in the book. And here we are, more than 20 years later. History repeating itself."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This ia an excellent and somewhat frightening explanation by an insider of how the financial world market works and the limited influence the average person has on a market that affects all of us. It is no wonder that the financial market finally collapsed. This is one of the best of the many excellent books on finance by Michael Lewis."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Regulators who read this book would have had a clue of how to see and prevent the crisis in housing finance. I saw it coming (experience from my days in real estate), but those in charge were either blind (naive) or blinded (corrupt). That's a pity, since the government-facilitated market collapse wiped many trillion dollars off our balance sheets and still has most of the world's economies in a twisted deep hole."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"\\"The Market, however, was inefficient\\" Lewis, 147.Michael Lewis has a whole career built out of dumb luck. He graduate from a top-flight school, bummed around, knew a guy who knew a guy, and ended up a wall street high-flyer. Then for his second act, he wrote about it and built a career out of that. That's right, part of me wishes I was Michael Lewis.I want to be Michael Lewis so I can take the acronym out of BSD and tell you what it really means, not just good traders, but a praise of the size of the male member.I want to be Michael Lewis because he has led an interesting life. He first had to live the years at Salomon Brothers he writes about here. I want to make millions for the company and spend my bonus in my head before I'm even given it. I want to live through the London hurricane and the crash of 87.Do you know why I want it? It is because Lewis is such a great writer. He is self-deprecating and us conscious of the limitations of the world he chronicled, but he writes so well about it I not only feel like I was there, but I want to be there. He got away from the trading world for a reason, but it helped create who he would become."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In 2006 and 2007, Goldman Sachs marketed and sold $40 billion in mortgage backed securities to its customers while secretly betting against them. 20 years prior, Mr. Lewis wrote about similar conflicts of interest between Salomon Brothers and its customers. With a few market crashes in between, no meaningful regulation has been implemented to prevent such breaches of trust. So once again, we learn from history that we do not learn anything from history. From page 222 of the hardcopy: \\"If it was a good deal, the bankers kept it for themselves; if it was a bad deal, they'd try to sell it to their customers.\\"Henry Kaufman, the head of bond research at Salomon in the 1980s wrote in the \\"Institutional Investor\\": \\"... freeing the financial system, putting into being financial entrepreneurship and not putting into being adequate disciplines and safeguards.\\" That was true then as it is now.Liar's Poker is the story of Wall Street excesses, where nothing seems to matter as much as lining up your pockets at the expense of fools, and Mr. Lewis lived the experience and told it magnificently. I'm not a fan of any particular author, but surprisingly, I find myself reading one book after another of Mr. Lewis'. He seems to have a talent for simplifying complicated concepts and events, and weaving it into an entertaining narrative from cover to cover. Mr. Lewis can write a bestselling phone book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"easy reading and good explanation on topics and concepts realted to trading. great narrative on the evolution of wall street"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Great take on the excess of the 80's financial scene, up there with the Big Short also by the same author."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"very informative.

A lot of people perceive the work of Wall Street bankers as something complex and complicated and yet Mr. Lewis admits that \\"Much of my working life [I spent] inventing logical lies... Most of the time when markets move, no one has any idea why. A man who can tell a good story can make a good living as a broker.

When a trader tells the young trainee Lewis that he is lower than &quot;whale shit on the ocean floor&quot;, he recoils to a corner at the trading room &quot;feeling the warmth of the whale shit&quot;. This is one of the funniest books I've read. Cynical, with the perfect timing of comedy, full of insights into the machinery of greed, it portrays Wall Street as the ship of fools.

Believe me, I never lie."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"It provides a good picture of the Wall Street during the 80's but it is sometimes tiring when describing the personality of some characters."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Reading Liar's Poker today confirms its status as a modern classic about Wall Street. Michael Lewis depicts the boom years at Salomon Brothers in the mid-1980's with a style that is simultaneously sharp and laugh-out-loud hilarious.As a complete outsider to Wall Street, I enjoyed the opportunity to get this insider's perspective on the culture of investment banking. Lewis cleverly combines his personal narrative of getting hired, going through the training program, and landing a job as a bond salesman in Salomon's soon-to-overheat London office with a more objective recounting of the key figures and episodes that led to Salomon's downfall.Lewis's most colorful portraits are of Lewie Renieri, the man who practically invented the mortgage bond market, and Michael Milken, the \`junk bond king' who made Drexel Burnham into Salomon's toughest competitor. Strangely, Lewis's depiction of John Gutfreund, then chairman of Salomon, is less sharply delineated.For all the \`animal house' behavior going on at Salomon Brothers--and Lewis tells a lot of unforgettable stories from the trading floor--the firm was also making serious financial innovations during that period. Lewis ascribes the faltering of Salomon to John Gutfreund's lack of leadership, especially for not retaining the mortgage traders who had made the firm so wealthy and for dismissing the market in junk bonds during its most profitable stage.Michael Lewis recounts his experiences at Salomon with a kind of detached irony; he avoids either glorifying the wealth Salomon created or deriding its culture of greed and gluttony. He recognizes that he and his fellow traders were being paid far more than they were contributing to society: \\"...if social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year.\\" But Lewis does not condemn Wall Street. Ultimately, he suggests that Wall Street functions best when salesmen and traders value long-term relationships over making short-term profits."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I recommend this book to see the ruthlessness and greed of Wall St. Its highly recommended literature for anyone who is, or wants to be a trader. the narrative is very tongue in cheek; spoken as an outsider since he lambasts everyone in it. I wonder how much the author, Mr. Lewis would have made had stayed in the industry?Ultimatley a critique and commentary on Wall St. is not going to make people stop wanting to become traders. Greed will always be a prevailing force in capitalism. As he points out, people do not run away after hearing how ruthless trading is. Conversely, in England after a lecture Michale gave on bonds, people line-up to learn how to become a trader.... because of the fantastic pay-out. The game is about greed and money. Ultimately, I have mixed emotions to spend time reading a book about a trader, instead of trading/making money."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I read Michael Lewis's \\"The Big Short\\" before I read \\"Liar's Poker\\".

You see, from an insider's ironic detachment, how clueless these people were, how little they understood what they were doing with the incredible amounts of money seeking to make more money. Not only do they care little about what they are doing for their shareholders, but they make bad mistakes that ruins lives. The excesses - like huge buckets of guacamole for snacks or unbelievable arrogance - are sickening after a while.Lewis writes extremely well, truly a unique voice. While I felt a bit disappointed pnce I finished the book as I gained little understanding of the protagonists' motivation and reflcetions (assuming they had any), the descriptions of what it was like are very interesting.Recommended."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"My son (18) read this and was on the floor, laughing.

Brokerage firms as described in Liar's Poker still have much of the same personalities, although cut throat competition has made it a much different landscape and not nearly as profitable as it once was.

Finance, understood as how money is moved and earned, is something else. It is closer to a good bottle of wine than to a better financial model. A hard lesson for a lover of techniques.

The 1980s bond market. He continually contrasts the practice and culture of trading bonds with the dogma of Economics.Over the course of the book it becomes easy to draw parallels between Wall Street and Feudal Europe. The Economists are like the Catholic Church in Feudal Europe. The Traders are like the Nobles and Royalty in Medieval Europe. The Job of the Nobles is to fight other Nobles over the right to control land, rent, and protection fees. The Job of the Church is to teach people who aren't Nobles that they should do what the Nobles tell them to. In exchange, the Church will occasionally ask the Nobles to behave a little better."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Finally read this book my first semester of business school, after wanting to for years.

It sounded remarkably similiar to what happened in 2008. This is a remarkable book which touches on such sensible topic as our pockets but at the same time made me laugh out loud at the simplicity and total madness of the reign of greed. Read it and think whether you would not do the same or even more... whether some other people are not doing the same with your money."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"One of the best books I have read. Funny and witty book on the boom and bust of the stock markets. Chronickling the fall of one of Wall Street's once great financial institutions, it opens your eyes on what goes on in these institutions. When Goldman and Sachs were accused of peddling sh**ty deals, you would have known this goes on all the time in these institutions."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a book which truly reveals the daily life in investment banks in 1980's. Michael Lewis is such a smart and talented guy that he really knows what the others smart people are thinking, even though they behaving so differently from what they think. This is the beauty of this book. He can find out the unique insight of people's behavours and it's so true. Sarcasm is the key point of sucess of this book and the reason why I could not stop reading it.The first half of this book is smart and sharp. However, the later part of this book is a bit of boring and too clumsy.I would say this book would be more attractive to those which finance or banking background. You will find lots of resonance when you read this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a very well-written book. It is fun to read and hard to put down at times. The author does a great job of showing the realities, and the absurdities, of the wall street culture he finds himself in.The only downside is how much effort he spends to position himself as an outsider - at times, it felt somewhat fake and over the top. Nevertheless, this is definitely one of Lewis' best works."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"When I think of this book, I tend to shake my head and smile.

What a great and accurate account of Wall St. in the '80's. Very informative with an enertaining slant."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Can this book really be 20 years old?I found a copy while visiting and have read it again -- still as hilarious as I remember, but in hindsight it seems even more on target.Visiting a Geneva money manager who handled a mere $86 million, he was told the manager had dealt with 285 different investment banks in the last year.\\"And they are all the same,\\" said the manager. So much for the importance of keeping the too-big-to-fail global institutions intact.\\"In other words, the whole idea of globalization was a canard. The brave new world of advanced communications and a single worldwide market for capital did not necessarily imply that a small handful of investment banks such as Salomon would dominate the world. It meant that money bounced more freely around the globe. But there didn't seem to be the same economies of scale in handling that money as in, say, frozen green beans.\\"And this was, as I noted, 20 years ago.Lewis also has the launch of mortgage-backed securities. government guarantees -- Ginnie Mae before Freddie and Fannie -- and an S&L; bailout that allowed the home lenders to deduct current losses against taxes paid in the previous 10 years.It's kinda like the $33 billion tax break that US homebuilders recently received from Congress, as reported byGretchen Morgenson in the New York Times.\\"ON Nov. 6, President Obama signed the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 into law, extending unemployment benefits by 20 weeks and renewing the first-time homebuyer tax credit until next April.\\"But tucked inside the law was another prize: a tax break that lets big companies offset losses incurred in 2008 and 2009 against profits booked as far back as 2004. The tax cuts will generate corporate refunds or relief worth about $33 billion, according to an administration estimate.\\"She added:\\"Before the bill became law, the so-called look-back on losses was limited to small businesses and could be used to counterbalance just two years of profits. Now the profit offset goes back five years, and the law allows big companies to take advantage of it, too.\\"Good value for lobbying dollars. Major homebuilders spent $200,000 or so each on lobbying for the tax change and expect to make $200 million to $450 million. from the change in law.It is always a delight to watch the free market in action.

I really enjoyed this book as a prequel to The Big Short. It shows how unregulated greed has caused many of the problems we have today in the financial system. Essentially, if you want to find the roots of the subprime mortgage debacle, start with this book as it traces the origins of CDO's. The book is a real page-turner and then gets a little slow near the 3/4 point. This is why I give it 4 starts. But it picks up and makes a walloping splash at the end.

This was a good book from an entertainment perspective so I would recommend it to anyone both inside or outside of the field of finance.

I had expected a little more of the mechanics and forensics of the bond market than Mr. Lewis provided, but it is clear that he thought that the reader would find that kind of depth and detail boring or that it would go over the reader's head. Lewis delves into the personalities in an entertaining way, but I bought the book expecting to get a deeper understanding of the physics (or art) of bond generation and trading and what happened and was a little disappointed in that regard.I intend to also read The Big Short.I recommend House of Cards. That is a fascinating account of how the credit market unravelled."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"A decent read about the happenings inside Salomon Brothers during the 1980s. The author's writing style makes the book very readable and is quite comical at times. It covers the birth of Mortgage backed securities and the junk bond market. A good intro into what the training class at Salomon was like back in the day and tales of various practical jokes/pranks that were apparently commonplace.A good weekend read if you are in the mood."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book was written in 1989 by Michael Lewis after two years as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers. The book ranges over a numer of topics: his recruitment and training, Salomon's earlier rise to prominence in bond trading, and in particular its early dominance of mortgage bonds, the author's experience as a Big Swinging Dick in London, the rise of Drexel Burnham and junk bonds, the stock crash of 1987, and the author's subsequent departure from the bank.Of particular interest today, two decades later, is the description of how Salomon created the first mortgage securities department on Wall Street, with Bob Dall and Lewie Ranieri selling Ginnie Maes. In 1979 a policy change by the Federal Reserve to fluctuate interest rates was accompanied by an explosion of debt and rapid growth in bond markets - and established players such as Salomons. Ironically, at first the mortgage market was hit badly by rising interest rates, but then two years later Congress passed a tax break for savings and loans that incented them en masse to securitize and sell their loans: the resulting flood into the market enabled a handful of Salomon mortgage traders to make $800 million in four years. The traders, however, were not individually compensated in line with their extraordinary profits, allowing them to be poached by Merril Lynch, First Boston, Shearson Lehman, Morgan Stanley, Prudential Bache and Drexel Burnham. The resulting competition reduced the bank's profits, but so also did the spread of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO) that blended pools of mortgage bonds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, creating instruments that were more predicatable and better priced. CMOs were then tweaked in various ways to sidestep regulation, and in particular to allow thrifts to carry them \\"off-balance sheet\\". Eventually Ranieri was promoted away from mortgage securities and pushed out of the bank.The remainder of the book is more biographical, with numerous anecdotes and comments on the culture at Salomon's that I found entertaining but perhaps not as insightful."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis' story of investment banking in the 1980s deserves it classic status.He writes about the investment bank Salomon Brothers from 1980 to 1987. The first years of Lewis' (nonfictional) story the bank does tremendously well, growing to the largest investment bank on Wall Street.This fantastic growth is due mostly to the bond trading department. The new monetary policy paradigm, introduced by Fed chairman Paul Volcker, means interest rates vary wildly. That opens the door to trading opportunities.In 1979 Lew Ranieri is made head of the mortgage operations of Salomon. He hardly makes any money before the Congress gives tax incentives to the savings and loans, if they sell their mortgages, in 1981. The development of the mortgage securities market is vividly described, and very interesting to read today.From 1985, Salomon gets into trouble. The cunning Michael Milken makes junk bonds the new fad, and steals customers and traders away from Salomon.Michael Lewis, the author, quits in 1988, and that ends the book. Salomon goes on until it is acquired by Travelers and then Citigroup in 1998.Liar's Poker is easy and fun to read, despite being accurate and rather specific on many issues of bond trading. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the development of modern finance. It made me understand the crisis of 2009 better."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I am only half the way through the book and I have learned more about trading than the past 20 years.

Michael Lewis is a gifted writer. The ethos of our &#34;credit society&#34; is revealed, in no uncertain terms. A must read for all."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The book is a good read and entertaining for those interested in Wall Street. This book should be required for anyone thinking of getting a job on the Street. Some stories may be hard to understand for readers not familiar with finance terminology."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a personal account of life at Wall Street's most successful firm in the 1980s: Salomon Brothers. The novel follows the wild roller coaster ride that was Salomon Brothers; from their ascension to the top of the mortgage-backed securities market led by the charismatic Lewis Ranieri to their eventual descent into Wall Street mediocrity. The author, Michael Lewis, chronicles his personal experiences starting with Salomon's frat-like trainee program and following his career across the Atlantic to the London offices of Salomon Bros. Along the way he describes the competitive, cut-throat atmosphere of bond trading at Salomon and fills in spaces with a variety of colorful, charismatic characters.One character that stood out to me was the \\"father of securitization\\" Lewis Ranieri. Ranieri, a college dropout, got his start in Salomon Bros mailroom in 1968 and managed, in 10 years, to become the head of their Mortgage department. At the time the rest of Salomon Bros looked down their noses at Ranieri and his blue collared group of mortgage traders. Their department made less money and was comprised of fat, obnoxious, loud traders. Lewis Ranieri personally traversed the country selling the idea of MBS to investors and politicians and ultimately lobbying in Washington D.C. His hardwork paid off as he created a market and made Salomon Brothers hundreds of millions of dollars. His hardwork and success was paid back by Salomon when they fired him in 1987. Such a shame.Back to the story though...Lewis's retelling of the raucous, juvenile attitudes that purveyed at Salomon is hilarious. Certain portions of the book get a bit too technical when Lewis over-explains stock market intricacies. Unfortunately some parts read like a textbook. I almost put the book down about halfway through due to the boredom I found reading the ins and outs of junk bonds, MBS and other trader jargon.Thankfully I didn't put the book down. I perservered and was rewarded with an engaging, enjoyable second half of Liar's Poker which focuses on Lewis's evolution from trading floor \\"geek\\" to his final status as the ultimate trader, a \\"Big Swinging Dick.\\" Excellent book whether you're into the stock market or not. Lewis isn't the world's greatest writer, but he certainly gets the job done."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I thought this book was a fascinating truth-is-stranger-than-fiction insight into the high-powered Wall Street subculture. It is a must-read for people thinking about pursuing Wall Street jobs or CNNfn/CNBC junkies who want a behind-the-scenes look at those big investment banks you hear about all of the time. Lewis suffers from a one-sided cynicism about the people and culture of the street, but backs up his attitudes with engrossing, yet completely horrifying tales about the way 80's Wall St. traders behave."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"How boring, a book on bond trading, I thought when someone gave me this book for a gift. Thanks a lot (grrrr)! But, boy, was I happy to have been given this book after I started it. It is riveting, hilarious, educational, insightful. Lewis is utterly a disciple of Tom Wolfe's, and he almost does Tom Wolfe better than Tom Wolfe does, and that is a total compliment. While Wolfe has disappointed with his fiction writing, we can be grateful that we have Lewis to turn to for brilliant nonfiction, now that Wolfe isn't producing any (other than the occasional article in FYI). I even read LIAR'S POKER twice. The sign of a truly wonderful writer, is one who can write about something seemingly boring, and make it riveting. Lewis pulls that off here."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"For those of us that have an innate disbelief for brokers, traders, advisors and the likes working from Wall Street, this is a must read. For those of you who take lessons and advise from financial advisors, money experts, radio and TV charlatans, this book should be mandatory.The basic premise (mine, not the Author) is, why someone who knows what will go up or down, will share that with me? By a simple rule of supply and demand (and its effect in price), when more people find out about a \`good deal', the \`less good' the deal becomes. I.e. the fewer people that \`know' that a commodity will go up in value, the better, as the demand for that commodity remains low. The more people that find out about this commodity (stock, bond, investment, metal, etc.) the demand will rise and so will the price. Why will someone that \`knows' what will improve in price, share that with you? If your advisor really knew, he/she would not be wasting their time telling you about it, they would gobble up on that commodity, spend all they have to buy more, and then borrow some more. Then the opposite is also true: once he/she accumulated as much as possible of such commodity, then they would have a credible and legitimate reason to \`spread the knowledge', so people would start buying and he/she can sell... and the price will go down!The only reservation which would oppose this logic is that the large and prestigious Wall Street bankers, with such tall buildings and important names, century old reputation, so much marble, granite and stainless steel, etc. \`have' to be ethical, professional and give you a good service for your money. They can't be a sham; or can they? Introducing Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker. This is a book that is hard to put down. For a person like me, not very familiar with the doings of the stock market, banks, etc. this is extraordinarily revealing. What an education! This book should be required reading in any MBA program.The books is very entertaining and easy reading, Lewis' style is fun. There are some stories so amusing that I had to put the book aside until finished laughing. Constant references are made to true names, places and newpaper articles at the time of the events described. All this gives it the color of truth. I \`googled' the Author and the book, and could not find a single article refuting any part of this book. Given the fame achieved by being listed as a # 1 bestseller in the New York Times, if someone had something to say, I am sure we would know by know.I happen to have a neighbor who worked as a stock broker for a decade or so. To my questions, especially to why he quit (he is still young and not a millionaire), he just handed me his copy of this book. He only added \`there is a dark underbelly to trading'. And was he right!This book shows, from the inside, the inner workings of the famous, prestigious and powerful Wall Street banks. Nothing sugarcoated, the plain truth. I read the last 20 pages very slowly because I did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is an engrossing chronicle of the rise and fall of Saloman Brothers during the 1980's. It cannot be possible to write a book about bond trading that is both so entertaining and informative. If you want to understand the cultural shift regarding debt in America over the past 30 years, I think you'll find this story to be alarmingly relevant. I for one am thankful Lewis decided to \\"tell the story rather than go on living the story\\", as I never knew Wall Street could be so humorous."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Great read and good inside look at Wall Street in the 1980s. Haivng just finished Barbarians at the Gate (which I also highly recommend), I was searching for a similar read. An attorney for the RJR Special Committee recommended Liar's Poker as a great view inside. He was dead on."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is an incredibly poignant book now that the market has collapsed and many of Michael's \\"characters\\" have come to justice or some other demise. The story is well written and, for me, an incredible job considering that I'm not a financial person. Once I picked it up, I could hardly put it down; and, that is saying a lot for a book on finance and Wall Street. Now that we find ourselves in the midst of the desolation created by a handful of incompetent, but clever, swindlers, this book clearly shows the reader how this happened. It is entertaining and scary at the same time. Lewis' writing is captivating and I plan to read his other works. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis does an excellent job describing the internal history of Salomon Brothers in the 1980s. He writes an easy-to-read narrative that is not only a pleasure to read, but is also a sarcastic and detailed examination of how business is done on Wall Street. While Lewis writes specifically about Salomon Brothers, it is not difficult to apply his various criticisms toward other firms.I felt the book was split implicitly into three parts. First, Lewis describes his first impressions of Salomon Brothers, the training program, and his initial experiences getting the job. Second, he steps back from his autobiographical narrative and explains the bigger picture. He tells the reader of the people who ran and built the firm in New York, the crazy things that happened on the trading floor, and how the mortgage trading department grew from a one-man team to a behemoth that would dominate Wall Street. Finally, he returns to his autobiography and talks of his experiences as a bond salesman in the London office. He outlines the fateful events of late 1987 and finally describes his last day at Salomon in 1988.In the third part, Lewis also gives a brief history of Michael Milken and his rise to power at Drexel Burnham. Lewis gives the reader a lesson on how junk bonds became popular (Milken essentially made the market for junk bonds, just as Lewie Ranieri did the same for mortgage bonds). He describes how the demand for junk bonds greatly exceeded the supply until a new use for junk bonds was found - financing leveraged buy-outs by corporate raiders.This book is a very enjoyable read. It is not as vengeful as Monkey Business (also a great read, but very different), but more descriptive and historical in nature. I was a bit reminded of Barbarians at the Gate when reading it. I felt that I got a great overview of Salomon Brothers in the 80s and of the people who made the firm great, especially Lewie Ranieri. Lewis also does an excellent job describing various finance concepts that he discusses throughout the book. He keeps things simple but he doesn't leave out details that would leave me hanging. That was very thoughtful of him, in my opinion.In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the corporate culture on Wall Street in the 1980s. It's a quick, easy, and enjoyable read.Pros:+ great historical overview of Salomon Brothers in the 80s+ sharp, insightful, and satirical - an excellent look at Wall Street corporate culture+ lots of interesting detail on people who built markets in the 80s+ good definitions and descriptions of several financial concepts+ fun to read!Cons:- a relatively small window into the history of the firm- ends in 1988; would be great to see another edition wrapping up Salomon's story"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"An intriguing book. For someone with little exposure to the financial sector or Wall Street, this is a fascinating introduction to how a big brokerage house gets to be big. Sell! Sell! Sell! And let the buyer beware! Hilarious, scary and infuriating, it's enough to make you cash out your portfolio and put your money somewhere safe, like Vegas. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"When it was written people thought it was devastatingly funny. In December 2009 it is not funny. If you want to understand how Wall Street has driven the world over the edge read this book. The history of mortgaged backed securities is here is here is a nut shell. The greed that runs Wall Street is here along with the mind set that drives it. I suggest you read this book as background before you get the next part in March 2010- The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a great story about the inside, behind-the-scenes culture of Wall Street. Couldn't put this down as \\"page turner\\" is an understatement. Learned a little about trading and a lot about the pervasive culture that exists in the financial circles on Wall Street. Not a surprise that the folks there have their priorities focused directly on WIFM (What's in It For Me) in terms of their own financial progress. And no surprise that they learn this from the \\"top down\\". Even though it's a bit of a rhetorical \\"duh?\\" conclusion, the story IS STILL FASCINATING."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is your primer to what happened to the US economy long after it was penned.As a financier who worked amongst all of the moving parts herein defined, I can spell it out to you in simple terms: If loan becomes more valuable than its collateral, it's worthless.Liar's Poker is now a period piece which unintentionally disected the groundwork for the disasterous bogus inflation of mortgage values, which pushed up home values, in the buildup to the 2008 crash.The author seems to have been intent on just getting inside as an employee long enough to write the book, but he did manage to pull off more of an expose than I believe even he himself thought at the time.The history of the notorious invention of \\"traunching\\" mortgage risk, by Solomon Bros in the 1980's, was later unleashed to its full capacity for destruction by the elimnation of related regulation and anit-monopoly rules in the 2000's. In hindsight, it's rediculously obvious.On a dive boat with one of the employees of the the primary character in 1998, he told me they were 'knocking it out of the park' by making mortgages to 125% of value. That's when I got out of that business.A great read, written with great humor, this book is an educational classic I recommend all the time."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book helped me to actually understand wall street better than any experience in the past. (And that's saying a lot since I used to work for a firm which audited some of those firms, have had many friends on WS, etc.). Notice I didn't say this book helped me to understand stocks, bonds, markets, or investing though - just wall street and it's culture.From the outlandish behavior, over the top pranks, abuse of newcomers, and obsession with money, Michael Lewis describes the culture of Wall Street in a way that will feel oddly familiar because you understand the archetype, even if you've never been there.One of the best parts of the book is the history it gives. Lewis described the creation of thinks like mortgage backed securities and America's infatuation with junk bonds. He chronicles how the market crashes in the 80s affected Salomon brothers, and the forces that led to it. What he couldn't have known at the time of course was the havoc that mortgage backed securities would lead to decades later, but he explains how they came to exist, sets the stage, and leaves you with a better appreciation for the origins of our current economic troubles. Even though this book doesn't talk directly about our current economic problems (because it was published in 1989), it gives a better understanding of the root causes (the culture, the incentives, the short term thinking, etc.) than many other books I've read. It also has the advantage of not suffering from revisionism due to hindsight - for example many of the benefits of mortgage backed securities are mentioned. In my opinion, this is a much fairer and better look at wall street than almost anything else I've seen."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a bluffing game played by the stock and bond traders at Salomon Brothers. There is series of arbitrary numbers -- the serial numbers on dollar bills -- that the associates make bids on. No one has any idea what the other players are holding, so the actual numbers are less important than the traders' abilities to bluff each other. The game is how they learn and practice putting one over on each other.The game is also the title and central metaphor for Michael Lewis' 1989 memoir about becoming a bond trader at Salomon Brothers. His book pops up on a lot of best-of-business writing lists. It may seem odd to be reading it twenty years on, but if you really want to understand how the seeds of our current economic crisis were sown, you should read it.Salomon Brothers basically invented the \\"mortgage backed security\\" that are one of the major causes of our economic problems.What is revealing and relevant about Lewis' book is the dissection of the structure of the brokerage house and the attitudes that dominate it. The company, trader, and salesman's best interest are often at odds with those of their customers. The basic principle of trading is this: bluff the customer into placing big bets on stocks and bonds and take a commission on the sale. If the bet \\"blows up\\" the customer, well, \\"Hey, it's the market. It is unpredictable. Who knew?\\" (But the company and trader got their piece of the action.) If the bet produces a big return for the customer, then the customer has more money to use to make bigger bets with the now \\"proven\\" financial adviser.In the lexicon of Salomon Brothers, \\"blowing up a customer\\" is when the customer loses their entire investment. It is commonly known in the industry that associates fresh from the training program will \\"blow up\\" most of their customers for about six months. Salomon Brothers only allows these green traders or \\"geeks\\" access to small investors to prevent damage to their big institutional investors, the organizations that will make bets in the tens of millions to billion of dollars.The working class and middle class salary men who have bought into the common wisdom that the market always goes up over time and will beat inflation get fed to the \\"geeks\\" who are the most likely to blow them up. The trader/salesman gets his percentage. The company books the business. The investor takes all the risk and loss.Lewis' own description of the practice: \\"In need of a euphemism for what we did with other people's money, we called it arbitrage, which was just plain obfuscation. Arbitrage means 'trading risklessly for profit.' Our investors always took risk; high-wire act would have been more accurate than arbitrage. In spite of the responsibility implied by my job, I was ignorant and malleable when I advised my first customers. I was an amateur pharmacologist, prescribing drugs without a license. The people who suffered as a result were, of course, my customers.\\"Lewis extends the metaphor. The brokerage house is basically a casino. The traders and salesmen are dealers. The markets, like the odds of winning a game of chance, are vaguely knowable, but entirely unpredictable. The investors are gamblers.The difference, though, between Vegas and Wall Street is that people who go to Vegas know that they are gambling. People who take their money to Wall Street have been told that they are investing.Lewis, to his credit, quits his job.If you find yourself a little flummoxed by all of the financial reporting about our current economic meltdown, read Liar's Poker. It will help you make sense of it all."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a game involving deceit, skill, and luck. \\"Liar's Poker,\\" the book, is a much more interesting topic. Lewis was a Soloman Brothers bond salesman working mostly in London. The book's intent is to describe and explain events and attitudes of the 1986-era.Wall Street was the \\"in thing\\" in the mid-1980s. Forty-percent of Yale's 1986 graduating class (1,300) applied to just a single bank - First Boston. Lewis graduated a few years earlier from Princeton (art history) and had just finished graduate studies at the London School of Economics when he was selected out of 6,000 applicants for one of 127 trainee positions at $48,000; fellow classmates included ten Harvard MBAs, 70 other MBAs, and 15 PhDs. Lewis' account of his training offers no lessons.Soloman had a near monopoly on bond trading at the time, and by 1980 the mortgage market exceeded the U.S stock market. Soloman's mortgage bond trading made more in 1985 than the rest of Wall Street. The resulting giddy profits allowed employees to get away with incredible rowdy, boorish behavior.An early major problem with mortgage bond trading was pension funds and foreign buyers' reluctance to get involved with instruments that could be paid off at any time. CMOs and tranches, introduced in 1983, resolved this problem - allowing buyers to select both the maturity period and risk desired. Eg. a first tranche contained maturities of 5 or less years, 2nd 7-15 years, 3rd 15-30 years.After training, Lewis was sent to London and assigned to cold calling. Some Soloman traders would take advantage of customers and unload dogs that the firm was holding and couldn't get rid of; sometimes this bankrupted the customer or got the individual buyer fired. Lewis quickly learned better approaches - arbitrage, contrarian thinking, and exploiting secondary impacts (eg. buy oil after Chernobyl).Another ethics problem Lewis encountered was a manager that claimed credit for one of Lewis' innovative sales. The \\"good news\\" was learning how Lewis cleverly obtained revenge.Expense accounts for Lewis and his associates were unbelievable - $400/night for a hotel (almost 20-years later I was limited to $50). Lewis himself earned $90,000 his second year - half bonus.Eventually Soloman's low ethics, free-spending, high charges, and the hundreds of alternative firms almost led to the London unit's demise. (The market was much more of an oligarchy in the U.S.) Regardless, the firm's bad decisions (eg. temporarily getting out of mortgages) and penny-pinching bonuses led to a serious brain drain.The most interesting portion of the book is Lewis' knowledge of Michael Milken. Milken saw bonds from blue-chip companies as risky - little upside, lots of downside. (This was the era when American manufacturing was collapsing.) Small new companies and large old companies with problems could not persuade risk-averse commercial bankers and money managers to lend to them. Milken, however, analyzed the data and realized these risk premiums were excessive.Soloman tried to get into the junk bond market, but was undercut by a top managers of its resuscitated mortgage bond unit who followed the junk-bond presenters around and undermined them. (Lack of top leadership?) The number of new junk bonds rose from nearly 0 in the 1970s to $839 million in 1981, and $12 billion in 1987 - 25% of the corporate bond market. The market further expanded by using junk bonds to finance raids on undervalued corporations, then for LBOs and M&A.; Drexel Burnham (Milken's firm) netter fees of $100+ million for single takeovers. Soloman, however, misses out.Lewis left, and shortly afterwards Buffett rescued the firm via a $700 million convertible preferred investment. A 1991 scandal involving government bonds led to Buffett taking over as CEO for ten months, and in 1997 the firm was sold to Citigroup."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis is an excellent author. In Liar's Poker, he describes his life at Salomon Brothers in the 1980's as a bond salesman. It is not a mere biography which is why this book deserves my 5 star rating. Lewis does an outstanding job in 3 different areas:First, he manages to make his story funny and entertaining. Sure, he may have exagerrated in some parts and selctively wrote about the more entertaining characters at Salomon, but that does not take away from the story of investment banking in those days.Second, he gives the reader an honest and fair story of young investment bankers. He not only tells us his story but also dabbles in the stories of some of his classmates. Any young business school or college graduate interested in investment banking would benefit greatly from his book.Third, he researched other areas of investment banking - not just the area where he was assigned. He has a big section on mortgage bonds which is extremely relevant to today's markets given the downturn in the housing market and subprime mortgage problems. Also discusses junk bonds and equities. It may sound dull in my review, but the way he writes about them is a lot more interesting which is why he is a bestseller author and I am merely an Amazon reviewer.I highly recommend Liar's Poker to those interested in investment banking, Wall Street or investing in general. If you enjoyed Liar's Poker, then consider Stewart's Den of Thieves."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I read this book when it first came out. It was fascinating--providing a compelling insight into the way a real financial institution that got more respect than it deserved placed profit above ethics. Shocking and hilarious at the same time."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis writes a very interesting, funny account of bond trading in the eighties. While I often like to escape in fictional novels when I read, this memoir of Lewis' experiences on Wall Street are entertaining enough to keep me coming back for more.While some reviewers found his technical descriptions of mortgage backed securities, junk bonds, etc. a bit boring, I enjoyed learning more about the various investment options and how they got started. Lewis definitely gives you an inside look at the tricks and deception that could be used by the financial services industry - hoping that we \\"suckers\\" will be prompted to buy enough to make them the big bucks.And that's the point of the book - this game is all about making money for the trader and their employer, screw everyone else. Lewis includes hints about how the money and reputation as a \\"Big Swinging Dick\\" is enough to overcome any feelings of guilt about \\"blowing up\\" companies or clients (the nickname alone tells you about the lack of women in the industry).I also enjoyed learning about how traders see the world - and how fear is what really controls the market. If you understand fear, you become a great seller of bonds or equities. In fact, Lewis makes it clear that no one can really predict how the market will go. The most successful people in the industry are portrayed as being either great salesmen or having a true (though rare) understanding of the big picture effects of a causative event (in other words, how people react based on fear after an event).There is a deeper message here too, if you are reading closely. Michael Lewis decided that trading his conscience for making money was not for him. He felt that he and others in his profession were reaping benefits \\"out of all proportion\\" to their value in society. He makes no attempt to change the reader's views on the right or wrong of the system - he lets us judge for ourselves.Anyone working for a financial services company - especially if you are in an unrelated part of the business - should read this book. It offers great insight on what can seem like perplexing aspects of the company culture. And if you don't work for a financial services company, you would still be better off reading this book, if only to learn how not to be a \\"sucker\\" for the financial gain of a \\"Big Swinging Dick.\\""},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"read this book, you'll know if wall street is for you. there hasn't been a better book since."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book gives important recent history.

It goes into the founding of the mortgage market as we know it today and even gives a glimpse into how the closeminded views of upper management almost destroyed one of the greatest forces on Wall Street almost overnight.It should also be noted that this book serves as an important case study into business ethics. The book gives a clear view of the unethical atmosphere of Salomon Brothers which, in retrospect, should have been a red flag to the almost destruction of Salomon in the early 90s when Paul Mozer, one of its traders, was found to have broken a new rule restricting how many bonds were purchased at government auctions.In any event, the book is charmingly wonderful in nature and worth a read if only for pleasure. From a business standpoint it shows what not to do in order to run a successful company and from a trader standpoint it shows the dangers of screwing your customers over to better your own situation."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"\\"Liar's Poker\\" is a memoir of Michael Lewis' 3 years as a bond salesman for the investment firm Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's premier bond brokerage in the early 1980s. It follows Lewis' career from his serendipitous introduction to the firm, through his initiation as a trainee in 1985, to 1988, while recounting the history of Salomon Brothers' rise to bond dominance and subsequent fall brought on by excesses, poor management, and failure to compete in the junk bond market. Lewis' literate, swiftly paced prose paints a vivid picture of Salomon Brothers' boorish, competitive culture amid the frenzied atmosphere of a rapidly changing late 1980s economy. It shifts effortlessly between trading floor anecdotes and explanations of the mortgage trading department without seeming to digress. Well-written, insightful, and often hysterically funny, \\"Liar's Poker\\" is one of those rare Wall Street books that is immensely entertaining -and mostly true. I don't know if someone with no interest in finance would enjoy it, but no knowledge of the bond market in required to understand it. I have heard it said that \\"Liar's Poker\\" is accurate in its portrayal of Salomon Brothers but less so in the author's position at the firm. But it hardly matters if the account is somewhat fictionalized. It's just a great read."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I had long heard nothing but great things about \\"Liar's Poker\\" but it was not until I found myself in an airport bookstore before a cross-country \\"red eye\\" that I decided to read it. It was no disappointment--the book reads like a novel, and Mr. Lewis blends a perfect mixture of sardonic irreverence with a traders' \\"greed\\" to land the bull's eye. As someone familiar with bond trading, \\"Liar's Poker\\" was still informative and an enjoyable read; and quick too--the entire book was finished by the time my flight landed in LA!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"\\"Liar's Poker\\" is an insider's view of life at an investment bank. It is written in a cynical tone, with plenty of self-deprecating quips such as \\"It [end of year bonus] was more than I had contributed to society; Christ, if social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year.\\"The book portrays Wall Street as a testsoterone driven money making factory. It is OK to gouge the clients as long as it makes money for the firm. In fact, such activities are actively encouraged. The bottom line is always the bottom line. It matters not if you have to crawl over the corpse of your best friend to stab your colleague in the back. If, at the end of the year you made a lot of money for the firm then you were in line for a fat bonus and a round of back slapping from the \\"Big Swinging Dicks\\". Wall Street is a fine example of Darwinian forces at work. It is a near pure meritocracy where the strong survive and the weak are swallowed whole.I found the book highly entertaining. The author is not a professional writer, and this shows in certain sections of the book where the prose is unpolished. Nonetheless, a highly entertaining sojourn into Salomon Brothers and if you have even a passing interest in finance or investment banking, I recommend this as a good read."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is hilarious. I didn't think a bond trading floor could be so amusing, but Michael Lewis proved otherwise. Look up a picture of John Gutfreund online before reading the first chapter."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This was a really funny book that also gave me quite an education in investment banking and the world of finance. &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; is very well-written, and keeps things moving. While the subject matter may be complicated, Lewis keeps it comprehensible to those of us who don't have an MBA. It's fascinating to see how the big players work the markets - and in some cases, manipulate them outright. Indeed, &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; gives us a front-row seat to the creation of the mortgage-backed debt obligations that are commonly traded today, and that allowed the current real estate bubble to inflate as large as it has.Lewis' analysis of Salomon and its problems applies in many respects to professional service firms in general. Having worked in a law firm during the recent boom years, I can say that rapid growth and an abundance of cash can lead to hubris, disorganization, and a loss of core values. Lawyers, accountants, and anyone else who works at a professional service firm will particularly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book has received several one-star reviews from persons who apparently either believe it concerns poker card strategies or think that they have hit upon a clever way to promote someone else's books. They are wrong on both accounts. This is an important document from the last financial slump of the late '80s and early '90s describing how stock brokers are given incentives to dump losing stocks on small clients as a way to prop up the returns for their employers' own in-house accounts. Hence, the ability to claim that X bank has been able to achieve a phenomenal return on its own investments--just think what X bank can do for you! Well, thanks to this book, now we know: X bank can unload all of its junk on you and laugh maniacally as your account evaporates. Timely reading for the current financial scandals."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is to Wall Street as Anthony Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is to the restaurant business. It's an inside look from someone who not only was there, but lived to write the tale. It's easy to identify with Lewis, who begins his story while he's interviewing for jobs in college. One thing leads to another and he's soon making money and (mis?)-handling millions for his customers and earning the reputation of a \\"Big Swinging Dick\\" at Solomon.Lewis provides great insight into the bond trader's mindset, ranging from the abuse of interns to the creativity required to create a mortgage bond after-market through internal politics and external sales. The traders are continuously glancing at the financial numbers and running \\"what if\\" scenarios, imagining the impact on the bond market. The details of the instruments being traded are very well explained, even in financially complex configurations like tranched mortgage liabilities or stripped bonds. Just as much attention to detail is provided in descriptions of the paranoid manic-depressive tendencies of the traders on both the buy and sell sides. Lewis's first \\"exploding\\" customer provides a particularly poignant contrast to the equally risky goings on within Solomon.Lewis really moves the story along. He has a sure hand with dialog and scene setting, and the first person point of view adds to the tension. Thankfully, \\"Liar's Poker\\" doesn't get bogged down in psychological or social criticism; there's not even any Monday morning quarter-backing by the author-protagonist. The story is told and the interpretation is pretty much left up to the reader, which I find refreshing.I also really enjoyed Lewis's tale of Silicon Valley VC through the eyes of Jim Clark, founder of SGI and Netscape, in \\"The New New Thing\\". I'm afraid I just wasn't buying Lewis's more recent \\"Faster\\", which is much more analytical and much less (auto)biographical."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In many ways, it is not clear what sort of book Lewis intends to write. At times, it is a memoir, at times simple gossip, and in others a guide to how the street works. It is a testimony to Lewis' skills as a journalist that he largely succeeds in each of this tasks, giving clear explanations of both the rise of the mortage market and Milken's revolutionary ways with junk bonds, while managing to capture the surprising undercurrents of life in a Wall Street investment firm. It is, needless to say, not pretty -- and Lewis cynically (though honestly, I think) captures the petty interests and conflicts of interest that dominate the trading floor. I am not sure where to put my money now, but I am certainly keeping it away from those banks! There are, however, some unexpected heroes in the book. Lew Raineri's hard charging mortage desk, a bastion of old fashioned ideals (which is itself a good and a bad thing), is portrayed in loving and often hilarious detail, despite the lack of first hand experience, while Michael Milken's junk bond antics are singled out for special appreciation. These choices may seem suspect now -- Raineri's success didn't outlive the competition and Milken is now widely regarded as a villain, but Lewis' perspective has the advantage of capturing the time in which these views were developed. As history, it is fascinating if not always correct.The final pages of the book depict, somewhat artificially, Salomon Brothers as it grapples with a take over bid. The action, while dramatic, seems more like a pretense for a big finish than the climax of the story Lewis is telling. The market went on, and so did Salomon brothers. But Lewis left, and his reasoning is unclear. He was certainly successful, and stood to be more so. His stated reasons seem unsatisfying, and the distance between his experiences during the book and his reluctance to share more intimate details of the forces that compelled his decision ultimately renders the conclusion unsatisfying.This is a small complaint, however, and the book is certainly worth reading. Look for When Genius Failed for an update on some of the characters of Liar's Poker. It follows John Meriwether's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to revolutionize options trading and proves a compelling sequel (of sorts) to this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis knows how to tell some nice anecdotes about life on Wall Street, but after the first 20 pages, it's largely a tale of the stresses of bond trading. He does go into some detail about how the deregulations of the 1980's allowed for many interesting types of trading, but it remains largely dull for the rest of the book.If you're looking to be entertained, a better book about Wall Street would be Bombardiers by Po Bronson. After reading both books, it's very obvious that Bronson was heavily influenced by Liar's Poker, but by being pure fiction, allows for more interesting and sympathetic characters and is far funnier."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Lewis takes subjects that would seem dull and makes them come alive.

You do not need a finance background to enjoy or understand this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"LIAR'S POKER is one of those memoirs that immerse you in something far greater than one person's experience. It immerses you in a time and a place that were unique and spiked with all those base qualities of human nature: greed, arrogance, pomposity, (the list goes on). The vision he paints of Salomon Brothers in the mid 1980s is a contemporary verse pulled right out of Dante's Inferno.Lewis begins his career in high finance with a chance (hilarious) encounter with a S. Brothers partner's wife at a charity reception hosted by the late Queen Mother. What follows is a descent into a highly lucrative fraternity house where every pledge is initiated into a hyper-macho, hyper-greedy arena. S. Brothers as described by Lewis is a brutal landscape populated by obese, obscene tribes vying for dollars.For those of us who have read Lewis's more recent books, his debut memoir lacks one quality that his other volumes have - crystal clarity. LIAR'S POKER attempts to clarify the opaque, complex world of bond trading but the effort gets mired in jargon and wonk. I found my eyes glazing slightly at some of the internecine battles that emanated from convoluted bond schemes.This is a great book to read thirty years after it was written because it traces the birth of a Wall Street we've come to know. Reading about the men who first came up with novel ways to convert mortgages into bonds is like reading the private musings of a young Lee Harvey Oswald. It's eerie. Other scenes involving Lewis's dismay at the habit of S. Brothers disregarding the well-being of clients in the pursuit of revenue are troubling and completely unschocking in a current context. The practice of major investment banks of subverting client interests to bank interests is now well-documented. Only days ago, Greg Smith, a Goldman Sachs executive, published his Op-Ed in the NY Times decrying the culture of greed over relationships within Goldman. Smith's op-ed could have been written by Michael Lewis in 1987.LIAR'S POKER may be one of the most misunderstood books. To hear aspiring financiers express their love of this book is to hear someone who has seemingly missed the point. It's odd that someone would read this book and see it as inspirational. Did they not read the epilogue where Michael Lewis decides to walk away from untold riches because he sees there's little personal value in his job as a bonds salesman, where he questions the entire social value of a job that turns money into more money, where monotony and viciousness is rewarded with a minor heap of gold?To the young people vying for the life described in LIAR'S POKER, I say good luck."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I'd been meaning to read Liar's Poker for more than 20 years, since I read its first fawning reviews.

He tells his story by talking about himself and the people he worked with. Then he hangs the details of this beginning financial mess on a very human frame. He makes Salomon Brothers look like a financial frat party fueled by big egos, little foresight and too much testosterone. Men will often behave this way unless there is effective enforcement. That should have been the government's role. Instead of seeing what was happening and dealing with it the regulatory agencies were a bit lazy and were hamstrung and underfunded by congress and the administration.

This book is entertaining, well written, and gives us a view we normally do not have, the traders. With the movies Boiler Room and Rogue Trader, you can see that they take from this book. I think the best part of the book is the behind the scenes, almost sub plot story of Salomon Brothers and Wall Street in the eighties.The down side for me is that this book really just focuses on a small part of the whole 80's Wall Street, Junk Bond and M&A; world. I would have liked him to have tried to captures so of the other things going on in his business t the same time and try and relate them to what he was doing. The ending is also about 10 pages too long. Overall this is an average book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I didn't finish much of this book. The subject matter is very interesting, but the writing seemed like a high school term paper."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis made a mishmash out of a married man's life as a bond trader. The gentleman's wife was pregnant, andLewis recommended some iffy bonds to him, thereby getting the gentleman fired from his job.And thus begins the sordid tale of Lewis, Gutfreund, and Salomon Brothers. Michael Lewis was obviously hired becauseof his willingness to go the extra mile in selling bonds. Lewis later published a magazine article about invitingGutfreund to dine with him at a certain restaraunt. The article lists the meeting as uneventful except that Gutfreundswears a bit and says that book of yours (Liar's Poker) made your reputation [Lewis's] and destroyed mine. To the best ofmy abilityI have not found any verification that this magazine piece by Lewis is accurate, and risking libel, I will go as faras to say that Michael Lewis made this article up, about meeting a man whose life he ruined.In conclusion, Liar's Poker is a riveting read, and a morality tale that perhaps Ivy League undergraduate, thenBusiness Consultant, then MBA, is not the best way to live one's life (or to make money)."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Most remarkable thing is the same stuff we battle now, apparantly also happened in the 80's.Markets needs to be regulated, not least bond and stock markets"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I picked this up based on the enjoyment I got out of reading \\"Moneyball\\". Michael Lewis is a very good author, whose prose flows nicely, whose characterizations are memorable, and whose sense of humor is keen. This is the story of Lewis' job working for Salomon Brothers in the 1980's. If you are interested in Wall Street history or even getting a better understanding of the issues involved in the stock market problems in the late 1980's Lewis makes the topic fun and accessible. My biggest problems with the book were that is you wanted the history lesson, you could find a much more concise resource, and if you wanted a great story, you could find better ones, not constrained by the bounds of an author's experience. All in all, this is a decent read but pales in comparison to \\"Moneyball\\" and, I have heard, \\"The Big Short\\"."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is more of a brief history of Salomon Brothers from 1985-1987.

I would recommend this to a friend."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"During the Senate hearings on the market crash, CDS's and CDO's made quite a hit.

As far as giving the reader a look into the bond market of the 1980's, and a rudimentary understanding of what an investment bank does, it's good enough.My intention in reading this book was to understand something about how bonds work. I discovered why buying distressed debt (at the time) delivered value; and how government guarantees created a windfall for speculators. I could have found this out elsewhere. But I didn't know the questions I wanted answers to.I read this book as it was recommended to me. In fact this is the wrong book for me, because in general I am looking to understand (and be able to articulate) events and culpability for the banking crisis of 2008, but this is useful background into a subject I previously knew very little about. Nevertheless, the book is an easy weekend read.

This one proves why: too short and choppy, and you can tell that much is being left out. In addition, while the stories are interesting, the author's voice is quite incompatible with the material he's reading, and therefore a distraction. (If you want to hear the perfect Audio CD, try the unabridged Angela's Ashes, read by its author Frank McCourt ... pure magic. I'd venture to say you cannot truly understand from any other format what this incredible storyteller is trying to convey.

The writer offered some amusing commentaries, but as a whole the book was quite dull. There are no great revelations nor uncommon insights. Instead, Lewis spends half the book descriping events of which he admits he had no firsthand knowledge.Not a horrible book, but it is very lightweight and doesn't deeply penetrate any of its topics.

Some are very average people with phenomenal work ethic whereas some are quite comparable to people out of the Wild West.Anyone who is considering going into the financial services industry in trading, sales or research should read this. I tell you to read it because it does describe how cut throat the business is and it does provide some entertaining insightful look at characters in the industry. Liar's Poker provides a good top down look at the characters and process of Wall Street. This book, in particular, focuses on the rise of Soloman Brothers and its trading.Other books of interest would be John Train's Money Masters and New Money Masters (2 different books) that discusses the world's best portfolio managers and traders. Both are excellent reading."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Knowing the reputation Michael Lewis has, I had high hopes about his first book and how enlighting it could be. However, after hitting the midway point all I wanted was for it to end (never leave a book unfinished).Honestly, I struggle to find what all the hub bub was about with this book. His writing style is very drab and he introduces way to many characters in the book to the point you begin to just gloss over names as you realize no one matters, as there is no point to any of his stories.I cant describe other feelings as this book has left no impression on me what so ever and a better read if your looking for a bit of history and insight upon the inner workings of Wall Street tycoons is \\"When Genuis Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management\\" by Roger Lowenstein."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is a memoir of Michael Lewis' brief career as a bond salesman with Salomon Brothers, which was the largest investment bank of its era (think Goldman Sachs today). While the book is often humorous and insightful, it lacks direction at times. The book begins and ends with Lewis' own experience, but jammed in the middle is a brief history of Salomon Brothers and the decisions they made in the 1980s. The most interesting and humorous narratives in the book come from Lewis' own experiences.In addition to being a humorous take on Wall Street and its culture, the book also serves as a primer to anyone who is interested in the Wall Street today. Liar's Poker documents the creation of some of the financial instruments (mortgage bonds and CMOs)that are directly responsible for the financial mess American finds itself in today.The book is a great, easy read, but you should borrow it from the library; the book isn't worth owning; you will read it once and never open it again.RECOMMENDATION: Read, but don't buy."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"One may have a PhD or an MBA in finance or mathematics or the sciences, and by virtue of a fat paycheck, may take oneself far more seriously. This book will put things in perspective. Tells you the real deal; and believe me not much has changed, and will perhaps never. A true kinder-garden, that requires one in some sense to have poorly integrated ego states to prevail; in short various levels of neurosis and psychosis is your advantage; a persistent sense of distorted perception of reality is needed. Here to have a psychological problem is to have a psychological advantage. As the shear irrationality of the goings-on on wall street, should cause the healthy, rational and productive minds to step away to pursue meaningful lives, such as the author himself. This is not to say all of the financial services is this way; it certainly is a core aspect of all our lives, the services part of it that is.Read this and you would not be surprised why the financial crisis of 2008 occurred, and you will see why it will repeat again.Liar's Poker"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The testament to this book's greatness (and it's most ironic quality) is that traders for the past 25 years have likened themselves to the guys portrayed in this book.Instead of re-hashing why this book is awesome, I'd emphasize here that it's a great book for the economic layman to read today because it recounts the creation of the collateralized securities market in an entertaining and accurate way. If you want to know the origins of the current economic debacle (and why Lou Ranieri is oft mentioned as a culprit), this book is an ideal choice."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker goes down in history as the first-ever \\"high financial thriller\\" of the non-fiction variety. The first fiction thrillers were Zero Coupon (1993) by Paul Erdman and my own Lost Trust: The Great Credit Crisis (see 25-Feb-09 PR: http://www.mmdnewswire.com/book-lost-trust-author-lang-gibson-4662.html). When just a kid in college, I remember my godfather giving Liar's Poker to me for Christmas, and it was the book that first got me excited to work in the institutional bond side of the business (1990-2008). Despite Michael's brilliant marketing abilities and warnings about Wall Street greed (as well as my own efforts to warn the relevant parties about subprime CDOs), we are now sadly witnessing the quick evaporation of Lewis's bond business (along with the economy). Some forces are too powerful to override.While Liar's Poker does not explain brilliant things about Wall Street that you cannot learn from reading the news, it teaches the material in a far friendlier fashion. Lewis is able to translate his fantastic sense of humor onto paper better than most (why he was a good salesman for his short stint at Solly). As for the relevance of the book's material to the present day, there is a huge difference that many customer reviewers are missing. Lewis wrote about the creation of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which slice and dice interest-rate-sensitive prepayment-risk. By contrast, subprime ABS tranche out credit risk, a far less forecastable and riskier event, especially with no economic data on national home price declines. Even more, the subprime ABS were packaged into my product, subprime ABS CDOs. That extra leverage from the extra layer of securitization (and the higher risk from subprime defaults vis-a-vis prepayment risk) was the medicine it took - along with absent regulation, where the Govt feigned the opposite - to blow it all up."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"this book is a must read if you are getting into the financial industry along with \\"when genius failed\\" and others."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"OUTSTANDING!!

His description of his entry into the firm of the stinking rich and moderately restrained team of Bond Traders was funny, I thought. So was the description of the BSDs (Big Swinging D***) and their attitudes. There are many such instances in this great bookHe describes with great detail, and often with shocking honesty, the way the Bond Trading firms then worked. In fact, I strongly recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in the way Wall Street firms have worked, and the way they have earned their money, and continue to do so, Eric Spitzer or no Eric Spitzer! He writes charmingly, and the narrative is often captivating.

Don't pass this one up if you like Monkey Business or Barbarian at the Gates."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is Michael Lewis's first book, and in my opinion by far the best. It takes place at Salomon Brothers, the famed former investment bank (now part of Citigroup) that had a reputation for a brash culture and greed. Michael is a new member of the sales and trading desk in the 1980s, a time when Salomon dominated the bond markets and pioneered the mortgage backed securities market.In an often cynical but always humorous style, the author describes the internal dynamics of Salomon, where testosterone filled the trading floor and greed was placed above everything. Since the book was published, Salomon got in a lot of trouble for illegal actions in the government securtities market, involving Gutfreund (in the book) and Meriwether (of When Genius Failed fame). In was actually interesting to meet one of the characters, Mike Mortara, who was at the time head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs.Overall this is a funny little entertaining book, and a must if you are going to work on Wall Street, since people assume you are familiar with it and may even quote from it."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Hysterical assesment of the Investment banking industry.

I can still recall myself laughing away in the night hoping that neighbours dont find me crazy.Liar's poker is witty, makes sense either has you aspire to be on the street or makes you nod your head saying \\"I knew they are all rotten a lot\\". There are some who cant read beyond page 50, seriously disgusted at the mockery made of a serious bond deal.What is great about liars poker is the queerness of the characters and the fact that the author in principle hates what he is doing yet in life loves veery moment of it, or at least aspires to. The Human Pirhana is my personel favourite..a Harvard grad and the master of ... speak...its definitely well written.The book is not about its story, or the philosopical interpretations one may make about it..its simply a adrenalin driven story of a breed of people who thrive on risk, who leave their morals on their bed when they wake up, whose business is to play with money, whose religion is to make money on the seventh decimal place of the value of a bond...who havge guts of steel to be able to have a coffee after suffering a milion dollar loss, and ac as if nothing happenned after they make a milion..of course the do shout it on the hoot and the holler!!!This is not a finance book, its a book about a breed of people, their life, their world, their religion, where all that maktters is how strong you are inside, how worthy a man (yes) are you, what kind of life do you want it to be...Read it wheher you are into finance of not, it would be an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I could not put the book down once I started reading it.

Insightful and funny. Strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker offers a refreshing, amusing, and deeply cynical look at the investment banking world of the early 1980's, when Masters of the Universe lorded over all they surveyed (in their own minds anyway).This book was one of the earliest to roll back the i-banker canopy of secrecy and respectability, revealing Wall Street at its heart... a bunch of thuggish suits with varying levels of pedigree, endlessly looking for new and creative ways to mug their clients. Though the book is old, the flavor and rhythms are timeless. Some of the criticism is fair, some of it unfair... yet many years later, it's the same old Street.Because Lewis writes dispassionately and objectively, his words hit home all the more. He comes across as a excellent story teller, not much more or less. (This seems to be the way he wants it.)In my earlier days of getting acquainted with markets, I often wondered how investment banks could hire rooms full of \\"traders\\" and have most of those traders be profitable. If trading requires a special talent or mindset, which it definitely seems to, how is it that all these ivy league guys can be good at trading en masse, especially when they have zero patience and huge egos?Based on the Liar's Poker picture, the answer is that most of the \\"traders\\" in the employ of large investment banks are not trading in the true sense of the word. They are either siphoning money from unwitting customers with the help of product-pushing salesmen (no different than run of the mill brokers, except higher class), or else they are taking a bite out of the bid/ask spread, which is what many floor traders do. In exchange for providing liquidity, floor traders act as slippage extractors of a sort; the \`skid' you see between order price and fill price is what goes in their pocket. This type of thing is more about exploiting a structural advantage, and less about competition with other traders.Surprisingly, Michael Milken was one of the few who came out of this book looking like a winner. The rest of the world wrote Milken off as a crook without actually looking into what he did or how he made a fortune. Lewis gives a clear and lucid explanation of Milken's big idea--that the investment world as a whole had its credit rating apparatus backwards, due to a skewed perspective of corporate credit risk. The book recalls in some detail how Milken was able to leverage this single idea, with a sheer force of will, into billions of dollars in junk bond profits.As a side note, even after reading Den of Thieves (an excellent book that chronicles Milken's ultimate fall), I still wonder if he got the short end of the stick--painted as a crook because he was exceptionally greedy and made obscene amounts of money, rather than any truly grievous wrongdoing. The massive contribution Milken made to the capital markets was to reshape the assessment of credit overall, increasing the efficiency of capital deployment across the globe. This surely gives him claim to a better reputation than the one he's gotten from the press thus far.If you read this book and enjoy it, you might want to note that a 1990's successor to Liar's Poker is Fiasco: Blood in the water on Wall Street, written by another bond insider whose moral qualms eventually force him off the Street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I picked this up off of a bookshelf at a cabin I was staying in for a week and had trouble putting it down. The section on the mortgage traders is worth the price of the book alone. &quot;They committed acts of gluttony, the likes of which had never been seen on Wall Street before.&quot; Lewis' vivid descriptions of these guys had me rolling. Near the end he gets a bit cynical, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis is a great author with a nose for interesting subjects. Liar's Poker is a rare inside look at Wall Street culture in the 80s from Lewis' first hand experience trading for the prototypical Wall Street bank of the era, Salomon Brothers."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"A hilarious and grimly realistic look at the world of investment banking - as true today (2011) as it was in the 1980s when originally written. This should be required reading for anyone who has ever thought they could beat Wall Street at its own game - in other words, a cold-blooded reality check for those poisoned by the fumes of the \\"get-rich-quick\\" myth.Although an autobiography detailing the author's career with Salomon Brother's in the 1980s, it also serves as an informative study on the turmoil that rocked the markets in the 1980s that resulted in a major change in investor focus from the stock exchange to the bond market - and it is this that set the stage for the infamous crash of 1987 as well as the problems we face today with the mortgage bond market. It all started here.Lewis pulls no punches with frank commentary or his brutal prose: he has no problem ripping aside our comforting illusions of the investment world and is equally ready to turn his dagger against himself as well as against his former colleagues. He puts to rest the myth that 'anyone can get rich doing this' - advice that many former 'day-traders' of the 1980s probably wish they had heard at the time. True, if you know what you are doing you can likely make money - but that requires a twenty-four/seven commitment to keeping an eye on the entire market - not just stocks and bonds but the dynamics driving the industries behind them - which very few can do without quitting their day jobs. He shows the results of the dark side of the market - the consequences of losing triple your original investment - and how hard it is to avoid this. The odds are definitely stacked against the casual investor. Best summary of all this information: don't do it.This book also is an excellent business case study about what happens when a firm suddenly finds itself out of its familiar territory and makes no provisions or changes to deal with it. Consider the fact that we have an investment bank doing business in Europe - that has no idea who the European banks are! (Yes, you'll find that in the text). Or management that refuses to concede that their perfect plan has nothing to do with the business reality. Or, worse, that the lowest members of the hierarchy are able to see instantly that a firm, the most profitable on Wall Street at the time, is doomed to fail. It does.Readers who are offended by the use of uncensored language would probably do well to steer clear of this work - Lewis does not make any attempt to tone-down either the facts or the language used by the players. He does not offer a positive spin on the risks involved in the investment game and he makes it clear that all players need to be careful about assuming how much their advisers really have their best interests at heart. This is all to the good - this book is all the more striking because of this.Definitely a must-read for those who have ever considered taking on the market or for those who desire a clearer understanding of what exactly goes on in the world of Wall Street. It isn't comforting - nor should it be. But at least if a person still feels able to take on the windmills after reading this warning, they will be making sure that they aren't the fool in the market."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis tells an honest, hilarious, and somewhat disturbing tale of Wall Street bond men in the 80s that engages the reader from beginning to end. Although the book can be financially complex to the layman at times, if you have at least a basic understanding of bond markets and financial principles, you'll love this book. Also, I highly recommend reading Lewis' The Big Short as an immediate follow on to this book, as it really rounds out the story."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I found this book quite amusing read. Its language is very down-to-earth and easy to comprehend. Michael Lewis has done a good job in depicting his own life experience in Salomon Brothers. Book is valuable in terms of describing not just events, but going beyond and attempting to identify the root causes and value drivers behind major activities. It is not a text book on finance, so few dull technical words, but you should expect some Wall St. jargon. Some points mentioned by the author describe already known issues with the Wall Street and High Finance participants. But it is a refreshing Insider Story, which is worth a read."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Entertaining, informative and engaging. A case study of how and why well-meaning government polices can have huge unintended consequences.You will learn a lot about the creation and marketing of home-morgage backed securites in the the 1980's, which is fasinating since you will know when reading it that this was the inception of a financial bubble that burst in 2008. It explains in detail exactly how very smart and highly motivated (\\"greed is good\\") bond traders exploited government intervention in the home morgage market. Politicians and government bureaucrats were no match for these guys, who made clever and entirely rational business decisions in response to financial incentives created by the government to promote home ownership by those who couldn't really afford it.The bond traders got rich from the financial incentives created by the government's home morgage program, which they brilliantly exploited. This was good for everyone as long as home prices kept going up. But when home prices declined in 2008, the game was up and politicians were looking for scapegoats to try and expain away a monster they had created thenselves.This history lesson is all the more compelling as it was clearly not the author's intention to blame anyone for the morgage crisis or even to explain it. But the story explains it.The book made me feel like I was there as it all unfolded in the 1980's and 1990's."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book gave an exceptional review of the Bond Market in the 1980's ending with the stock market crash in 1987, and the attempted hostile takeover of Solomon Brothers. This is the fifth book of Michael Lewis I've read and he delivered a great story once again.This story certainly filled in some gaps in my knowledge of the 1980's economic scene. Discovering this book after I completed \\"The Big Short\\" made it difficult to believe the existence of the U.S. bond market for mortgages is younger than I am. As always it is difficult to go back and read an author's prior works, as they always seem choppy and most author's get better over time, but Lewis did a great job here for his first foray into a complicated subject for a novel.With all the consolidation that occurred in the banking and financial industry post 2008 market crash, I still have trouble figuring out which companies have merged with other companies in the 20 years since this book was written.Once again after reading the inside scoop of on bond salesmen, I'm more assured that anyone managing your money but you is a big mistake. Also, Lewis makes it clear that all a salesman wants to do is push you a sale, whether it works out for you or not, their loyalty is to their commission, and to the firm long before their customers. Parts of the book were dry, but what can you expect from a book about bonds.I'm very excited to read Boomerang when it comes out in October of 2011, and if nothing else I learned how to play the game liar's poker. Lewis explains the rules on first four pages of the book, but once you get that far he draws you into the rest."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book was a nice prelude to the 2008 disaster. It is unbelievable the complete disconnect between the financial institutions and their sense of responsibility to their clients.One of the clients they toyed with had 82 million invested with them. Exactly how much money to you need to have before someone on Wall Street actually values your patronage?!It was and still is a public sector without values and run on ego and competitive lust. Millions have suffered directly from these peoples' actions...people have loss their retirement, homes, jobs, everything. And some have even died early because of the stress. And why? So a few dozen self congratulating fools can buy $20 martinis confident in the knowledge that they will never come face to face with the people they hurt so grievously. I hope there is such a thing as Karma."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I expected to read a lot about the men who gave Wall Street its bad name and I was not disappointed. The copy I bought was a little over 300 pages long and about 200 of those pages was devoted to the men working the phones and making the deals. Lewis devoted the final 100 pages to his career and both sections had interest and disillusionment contined therein. First, liar's poker was barely mentioned and I got the impression poker was chosen for euphony, the game as explained how played seemed much more like Scrabble, with money and/or its equivalent taking the place of words. That made an introduction to the men who worshipped money, lived for it, fought for it and what they did to acquire it, and how to use it as reward or punishment. The men's personaities shaped their companies and/or departments, their life codes and their struggles for what money they did get. Money was power, money was reward, money ruled their life.Lewis showed how it attracted him, what benefits it could bring, how he could handle it and how he could handle other men in the struggle for the available money. He closed the book by saying he lost interest, he never knew what he was doing but he had the power to handle money and interest speculators in what he was doing. All his training and experience meant nought, he copied others to hide his lack of knowledge. However he made it all interesting but was it truthful? Even he said he did not know."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Makes me wonder why anyone would trust their money with the quintessential picture of 1980's excess that was Solomon Brothers. Really interesting look on the inside of the firm and how things were run. As every Michael Lewis book seems to be; filled with witty humor and very detailed. A must read for Lewis fans or those interested in any financial sector. I would also recommendThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machineand those interested in sportsMoneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair GameandThe Blind Side (Movie Tie-in Edition)."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"As a fan of Moneyball and The Blind Side, I was interested to pick up this book (in its abridged audiobook form). Lewis doesn't lie about what the book is - a memoir, not a book about investment. Much like Moneyball doesn't teach you how to manage a baseball team and The Blind Side won't help you find the next Michael Oher (much less manage a Taco Bell), this book isn't meant to teach much about the profession, but more about the society. It does a good job.This audiobook, complete with its faux-jazz chapter bumper music, captures the feel of the early 80s. Lewis turns the structure of his work into a compelling story, though like other reviewers I feel like the disillusionment toward the end becomes a bit heavy-handed. Coming in knowing what to expect from Lewis' later works, though, I got exactly what I expected: a story."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"If you want to believe all the myths you've heard about Wall Street, read this book. If you want to really learn about what sales and trades is like on the Street, read a more factual book, like &quot;FIASCO.&quot; I felt that Lewis did a lot of embellishing so he could sell more books."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is tremendously overrated. Lewis' writing style, while amusing, is also quite amateurish. Plus he seems to have a major superiority complex - is he really the only honest guy on Wall Street? Puh-leease."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Basically a typical &quot;story&quot; about a typical financial firm. Some fimilar names if you have read other books of the time. Author himself doesn't show up until last quarter of the book. A passtime if you have nothing else to do, but definitely not worth 100+ 5-star reviews"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I was impressed about how fast this item was shipped to and actually received in Peru."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is terribly overhyped. Overall, it's a pitifully dry memoir of a man who never made it big on the street.I would recommend Rolfe & Troob's _Monkey_Business_ over this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I read the comments of both the customers and critics and was excited when the book arived at my home. Then, after reading the book, I re-read the comments to see to see if they were perhaps talking about the same book I read. This was pure drivel. Read the back cover on the book...then multiply that drivel by 250 pages."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Got about a third of the way through it and couldn't take it any more. I was surprised because I liked some of his other works."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Probably, I misunderstood that I would learn something from this book about finance or markets in general and would be able to use these ideas to add to the bottom line - make more MONEY. But it seemed like my goal behind reading this (or any other) book was too clearly defined and this book did not help at all. If you have too much time, nothing to do, and are looking for something to pass time then read this. But if you want to achieve something such as gaining insight into trading, selecting, analyzing stocks or securities etc then do not waste your time. This book has no direction, no substance, and not much to learn from it which can be used to produce results."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I have to agree with the older gentlemen above. I am 28 years old and have pretty worthless IRA's and savings plans that I am trying to grow at a better rate. Before buying a book I like to read the good and bad reviews, and like most of the 1 star reviewers, I can't believe anyone gave this book 5 stars. I suppose from an investment point of view I would encourage the ignorant to waste their money chasing fast easy money, but for those who actually know or want to know more about investing and the workings of Wall Street, do yourself a favor and pass over this book. I don't know the average age of the readers of this book, but I am guessing that I must be older than most of them because even I can't help thinking this is a hollywood rendition of a \\"real life\\" experience."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I am an experienced,well educated, retired, 63 year old entrpreuneur that is making a 20% return in this down market. I read a lot, but I have learned to read the 5 star and the 1 star reviews before wasting my most valuable asset, my precious time, and then buying a book like this. Look at the reviews if you are like me you will find that Michael(they'll never call him Mike) Lewis thinks this is a game not his future. After graduating from Princeton as an Art Major, ourl ittle micheal spent 2 years at Saloom Brother's as a flunky. Never mind, I too was a flunky for a small investment banker at his age while attending Univ. of Washington but then again I couldn't draw so I studied Samualson in Economics 101 and know why oil went from $147 to $42 in the last 6 months. Hint it has something to do with how prices are set at the margin. The lower reviewers called this author's opinion drival and a waste of time and these reviewers seem older, like me. But the book got the highest star rating I have seen, so now I feel out numbered by the young naive, economic ignoramuses who are a few years out of a liberal collage, who will miss the opportunity to see oil go back up soon and are head for a life of financial mediocracy and jealousy.If describes you buy this book.Meanwhile I am still looking for a worthwhile,rigorous read about the challenges for the Obama nation because in this market you can monatize real knowledge a sthe ignorant herds fear to double downat life's poker table.I have two beautiful daughters who are also young and naive, but I hope they never date little michael. I have supported them for 25 year's and while they are working hard making it on there own, no one needs an anchor. Of course again maybe Michael will be the next Rembrandt."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book should be required reading for all wanna be I-bankers. The author very convincingly describes the inner workings of a major financial institution. From the outside, the public only sees the expensive suits and tall glass buildings and are suitably impressed by the knowledge and skills of those who works inside. But the author takes us behind the doors to show frighteningly how the lifeblood of the world is controlled by a bunch of 25 year olds who have little idea of the magnitude of their actions."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"As an analyst on Wall Street (yes, I do make a lot of copies) I must confess this was insightful reading even for me. If you want to work on Wall Street or you want to know what your broker really thinks of you, read this book. But to update the epilogue a bit, I temped at Salomon in 7 World Trade while waiting for my current job to begin. Much has changed. Real efforts have been made to combat the sexism in the system, though far more than mere vestiges remain. Each morning in the final months of the merger with Smith Barney pink slips were handed out and the process was very judiciously calculated. The pall of this book hung over each lay off. So be assured, if you have not read Liar's Poker, you are not culturally literate on Wall Street.One final word: The Market is Efficient! Only the investment banks made money on the buyouts of the 80s. With Liar's Poker in one hand and A Random Walk Down Wall Street in the other, you'll have the basic insights to manage your relationship with both your broker and the market."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"You will crush this book in 8 hours. Then your free-loading friend will borrow it and ruin it. Buy this book on your kindle so your friends won't borrow it and spill coffee on it."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"At times funny but, for me, generally disturbing view of the interior workings of wall street. Lewis essentially squeals about the life Wall St. Insiders would prefer to keep hidden. With great clarity he describes how disconnected the Wall St. Financial system hasbecome from it's purpose of allocating capital most productively. Any scam is justified to enrich the firm and or it's employees. AsLewis freely admits, Las Vegas would never accept the risk taking and reckless activities invented on Wall St. - Vegas would not consider it good business.Anyone interested in understanding how our our system continues to replicate one scam after another from Vesco's mutual funds scams in the sixtes on throughout the S&L; scams during Lewis's 80's on to the recent scams of the late 90's and 2000's would be helped by Lewis's candor and frankness.This inside view further encourages my belief that our capitalist system is not even close to a capitalist system at all. In fact American Capitalism(including Europe) could now best be summarized as a system of \\"Privatized Gain/Socialized Loss\\". I want all the gain when leverage is benifiting me but we must all share the loss when this leverage works against me. Lewis's inside expose only reinforces my feeling that some other hybrid state/privates system will be needed to deal with the realities of modern electronic money management. Perhaps this system will be developed In other developing nations or small independent developed nations. in any event Lewis makes it clear to me that a change must come or all the developed worlds wealth will, in my humble opinion, be frittered away - if it hasn't been already!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"What do you get when you combine greed, a bunch of smart guys, and an opaque bond market? Salomon Brothers in the 1980s. Michael Lewis chronicles his early days as a trainee and then salesman in London for Salomon Brothers. What he depicts makes for very entertaining/informative reading and provides an insider's view of what actually occurred in the brokerage business during the 1980s.Liar's Poker refers to a game in which people would take a dollar and claim to have a certain set of numbers as the serial number on their bill. The other participants either continued the process or called their bluff. This game used similar tactics and skills to traders when making trades in the market so was very popular.It was a testosterone fueled environment focused on one thing, making money pour out of phones. Lewis and his fellow salespeople/traders made millions of dollars for Salomon Brothers selling bonds to investors/speculators. The customer frequently got the short end of the stick as still happens today in the individual bond market. Because of the lack of transparency in bond pricing, usually only brokers know what the actual ask/bid price is and so take advantage of individual investors. Many times the salesmen, then as now, had no real concept of what they were selling but were instructed to jam bonds down customers throats to move product.A good portion of the book describes the invention of the mortgage bond market inside of Salomon Brothers. This led to the products which caused much of the crisis in 2008.Towards the end of the events in the book, Lewis seems to grow a bit of a conscience and stops intentionally selling customers products he believes are bad. He grows disenfranchised with the market and Salomon Brothers deception and quits after making $225,000 as a 27 year old kid 2 years out of the training program.While it probably quite accurately describes the environment, one negative part of the book is the frequent use of profanity, especially the F-bomb.This book is good for anyone wanting an entertaining and eye opening account of what really goes on in most Wall Street companies. If it creates in you a desire to know what actually matters as an investor instead of what a salesman tells you, I highly recommendThe Investment Answerby Daniel Goldie & Gordon Murray."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. You learn a lot, you understand why the world is going the way it goes, with such a bunch of guys playing with our money. You understand Greed in its full scope. And one finally understand better what it might come to our countries in the coming future, if the market makers are this way."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Great read. Makes one think twice about doing any kind of business with investment banks. Buyer beware is their only creed and anyone who doesn't realize this could be in for a rude awakening."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis worked at Salomon Brothers from December 1985 to February 1988, first as a bond trainee and then as a bond salesman, during the epicenter of one of those events that define an age. Never before had so many young adults made so much money in so little time as did the traders at Salomon Brothers in the late 1980s. Liars Poker is his book about life in the epicenter.Salomon Brothers had been the leading bond house among investment banks before the 1980s, but it was Paul Volcker's announcement on 0ct 6, 1979 - as the newly-named chairman of the Federal Reserve - that money supply would be fixed, and interest rates would float, that marked the golden age of the bond market. Big changes in interest rates would mean big changes in bond prices. Those who valued bonds properly - as Salomon did - stood to make big profits.The number of bonds issued during the 1980s exploded. Early in the decade, the American government had to increase its borrowing to finance its large deficit. As luck would have it, an unrelated event allowed these bonds to be financed fairly easily. Socialist Francois Mitterand of France nationalized several big banks and insurance companies when he took office. Owners were paid amounts that they deemed unsatisfactory and even confiscatory. The flop of this policy reminded investors that there were factions in nearly every Western European country who could come to power and seize property through parliamentary means. It triggered huge flows of capital into the United States, where such risks were considered small.In 1970, investment banks figured out how to securitize mortgages, and a decade later, Salomon figured out how to sell them to investors. Yet Salomon missed out on the explosion of speculative-grade debt, which not only cut into its profits but made the entire company susceptible to corporate raiders using junk bonds to take it over.Michael Lewis focuses on the personalities at Salomon Brothers, making Liar's Poker read more like a novel that a financial; history. Many of the names were changed to protect the guilty, although it was not possible to change the names of certain Salomon executives. It's easy to emphasize the gluttony of the mortgage backed traders as an example of Wall Street excesses, but it was really market inefficiencies that allowed these people to make so much money. They were just doing their job, and trying to deal with the demands of it.While Wall Street profits defined the age of the 1980s, the crash of October 19, 1987, was probably the most newsworthy financial event of the decade. It was the first crash of such magnitude since 1929, and it galvanized public reaction. Since then, we have had similar-sized market adjustments, and these types of fluctuations cause less consternation to the public. The crash of 1987 is best-known for the blame placed on computerized institutional program trading of stocks arbitraged with indexes. New Legislation was approved shortly afterwards to add special handling rules to computerized institutional orders if the Dow Jones Industrial Index moved by 2%. Circuit breakers were added to shut down trading if the Dow Jones dropped by 10% in a day.The crash of 1987 prompted regulators to resolve the insider trading scandals in 1986 and 1987 involving Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine at Drexell Burnham Lambert. A series of amendments were passed in 1988 to the SEC Act of 1934, which made the trading of junk bonds on insider information illegal. The definition of insiders was widened, and tippers were made liable for damages as well as those who received the tips. While Lewis claims that Drexell did not technically break the law, that statement is rather nebulous. The SEC Amendments only further defined what everyone know was wrong in the first place, and it added more teeth to efforts of the SEC to obtain justice.This book, and Bonfire of the Vanities, are considered two of the most enjoyable to read books about the Wall Street scene of the Go-Go 1980s."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In this book, author Lewis is unlikable. But he's honest! He tells how you make your bones in this industry. One of the ways to make a great contribution to your investment firm is to \\"jam\\" a customer. This occurs when your firm has an incentive to get rid of a \\"bad\\" asset without taking losses. The salesperson is incentivized to put it on a trusting customer. Pretty bad - it's all in the book.It was interesting to see how the prestigious firms can treat their employees. At times there were generous bonuses for mid-level employees. At other times they were sidelined, encouraged to voluntarily depart by the lack of a bonus. Liar's Poker gives an impression of Wall Street as a place where lasting friendships are rarely formed. This is more a dog-eat-dog world than most.As a book that informs about the functioning of the bond markets, it is useful. Lewis explained what went on behind the scenes to make certain bond markets (Treasuries) so incredibly liquid. This should bring comfort to Treasury investors. The book will make any other type of investor additionally nervous, I think."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This a very funny and well-written account of Lewis' brief career as a Wall Street bond saleman in the mid to late 1980s. The culture at Salomon Brothers is, in essence, to set 250 junk-yard-dog trainees into the backyard over the winter and see who remains alive next spring. It's an ultra-competitive environment that encourages risk-taking, often at the expense of the customer. It also creates a weird kind of loyalty to the firm that chews you up, albeit one that pays ridiculous amounts of bonus money to twenty-somethings.Lewis captures the brutal politics and humor of this culture. To his surprise, he succeeds as bond salesman only to walk away from the rat-fight to become a journalist.Although dated, the book does capture some essential truths about Wall Street culture. The 2008 collapse does not seem surprising in light of this culture."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"...In short, reading Michael Lewis' account of his tumultuous two-year stint at Salomon Brothers in the mid-1980s delivers all the pleasure and enjoyment of reading good pulp fiction. Lewis is -- much to my surprise, I must admit -- an extremely talented writer with a gift for metaphor and the art of character description and analysis.One of the endearing things about this book, I think, is that it is laced with a certain self-deprecating tone. Lewis' basic thesis (although I don't think he really believes it) is that the the most glaring sign of Salomon's impending demise was that it started hiring people such as himself. Despite many self-effacing comments, however, Lewis points out repeatedly that he was the highest paid -- and thus best producing -- young bond salesman at Salomon during his tenure and seeks to assure the reader that he isn't some scorned ex-employee who couldn't hack the perils of life on the trading floor.Lewis dedicates a few chapters to explaining the rise of the mortgage trading desk at Salomon and the junk bond market under Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham, although neither have much to do with Lewis' career as a government bond salesman in Salomon's London Office. Did the author think this gave proper perspective and background to the telling of his personal story or was it an effort to pad out an already short piece of work? Probably a bit of both, is my guess.In sum, if you approach this book (as I did) as a roman a clef, with all the exaggerations and artistic license associated with fiction, rather than a legitimate memoir, you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it. It is funny, fast-paced, often incredible -- and will quickly expunge any thoughts you once had of being an investment banker, no matter how high the salaries might be."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I have read a lot of 'insider' accounts of high finance and I am amazed by how much they all seem to owe Michael Lewis for writing \\"Liar's Poker.\\" From \\"Monkey Business\\" to works of fiction like \\"All I Could Get\\" to even movies such as \\"Boiler Room,\\" all of them seem to have borrowed heavily from Lairs Poker.In this book Lewis tells the story of Solomon Brothers from its ascendancy from a small bond trading house, to the world's most profitable corporation to it's decline and eventual reorganization.Lewis narrates his story from the perspective he had as a Solomon bond salesman in the mid 1980's. This book shows off two of Michael Lewis best talents:1.) The ability to covey the feeling of how it was while he was there.2) The ability to write about events/activities in the past (or halfway around the world) AS IF HE WERE THERE.In this book, Lewis is a witness, a critic and a historian all at the same time and in comes together well. Reading this book, I kept think that Michael Lewis is too observant, insightful, and people-oriented to stay on Wall St. Maybe deciding to write this book, getting himself out of Solomon while getting back at his superiors, was just another smart trade.Maybe someday I'll read another \`insider' account book that will blow me way, but for now &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; is the gold standard for the genre."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is a great book. A home run. While I am not an industry insider, I did read it while I was getting an MBA from the Michigan Business School and enjoyed it a great deal. It provided a great deal of background to what I was learning in various finance classes. Mr. Lewis helped me see the people who make these markets work and move and that it isn't faceless formulas free of emotion finding perfect prices; rather it is ambitious men (and women) ferociously and sometimes crazily pursuing their own financial interests.The book is amazingly funny without being slapstick. There are some amazing images - not only the Meriwether games of Liar's Poker, but the food being delivered to the physically rotund mortgage bond traders, the bond trader who felt like the price would rise and then kept buying billions of dollars in bonds to prove himself right. I loved reading about the training he received and what he was taught about selling bonds and how those folks really do view their customers. Some of the institutional stuff is a bit dated (but still valuable as history), but the human stuff still rings fresh and true because people and still, well, whatever it was they were back then.If you just want an entertaining read - read this book. If you want to read about the early go-go years in the bond trading and the pre-boom boom years on Wall Street - read this book. If you want to learn about some of the big names in finance and what they did - read this book. You get the idea. I am saying you should read this book and you will be glad you did. Really."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Though Liar's Poker was written roughly a decade ago and Wall Street has changed somewhat since then, it is still a humorous and pertinent read. Lewis' prose flows well and pauses occasionally to bring his reader historically up to date. As a memoir, it is the only one I've found that truly takes you into the mind and life of a Wall Street trader. Perhaps it is time for someone to write about the late 90's equivalent of the hotshot Lewis...the Wall Street Research Analyst."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The book is hilarious. It's still one of my favorite gifts for friends in school or starting out in the business. Some people don't like the middle of the book, which is a bit of a history lesson. But the history lesson is a good one and should be be compared to in the industry today for those who are in the business. The beginning and the end are hilarious"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Last summer I worked on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs (the Salomom Brothers of the 90's). Going to NYC I expected to find the phone throwing backstabbing, disrespectful jerks in the book. What I did find was 90hr 6 days work weeks. The traders and salesmen were highly intense, intelligent, and most of all stressed. I did come across a few traders who still had the same mentality of the traders in the book. However, most of the &quot;Liars Poker&quot; types Wall Streeters have left. I actually met about three people in the book including Mike Mortara now head of fixed income @ Goldman.My advice read this book. But, even after reading this book if you want a Wall Street career be prepared to give up you life and sleep."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker takes the reader through the Go-Go era of Wall Street in the 80s, where banks expanded rapidly and ethics seemed to take second priority to making piles of money. (The more things change, the more they stay the same)Three big stories are at play here. First is the creation of the Mortgage Backed Securities business at Solomon. Creating this market generated a ton of money on the street, and also highlighted both the challenges and gains from creating a new business from scratch. It also demonstrated the knives pulled out in both stopping a new business from starting, and then fighting for scraps of credit.The second story is of junk bonds - a vehicle initially created to fund less creditworthy companies, but eventually used to finance corporate takeovers. This is the Michael Milken Drexel Burnham story. This was the other major move of finance in the 1980s, though in reality junk bonds are not as awful as the hype surrounding them. (Providing financing to less creditworthy companies is still a very valuable activity, and many funds did very well on this.)The third story, and perhaps the most important, covers the conflict of interest between banks and their customers. Many banks, traders and salesmen take their customers long term best interest to heart. This is not neccessarily a given, and Lewis highlights his own experience in trying to walk the line.Liar's Poker has earned it's place as required reading for all moving to Wall Street. It should also be required reading for investors."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"*This book is for everybody. Even if you've never worked in finance in your life, you will still think it's funny and entertaining. Besides which, you will get a thorough education on the bond market and its growth in the mid eighties.Since this was one of the books often referred to by MBA programmes, I was hesitant at first to read it (one of my pet hates is all those silly books about &quot;how to&quot; from supposed &quot;experts&quot; who have since lost all their money or credibility because they were too greedy or didn't see change coming - which is why they had to write the book). Yet, I found myself in need of literature one day and spotted the distinctive yellow cover (in Singapore at least). I was attracted immediately by the title and then proceeded to read the first paragraph. I almost sat down promptly on the floor to keep reading it - a good sign that this was good reading.Lewis has a talent for story telling. He combines this talent with an uncanny ability to be able to explain a very complex market in a very simple way. The &quot;pull&quot; of this story is that you KNOW it really happened. It is easy to cast your mind in the author's shoes, and BE on the trading floor with him. You can feel the excitement when the market turns, taste the sweat of other traders, hear the noise of the commotion on the 42nd floor, and sense the tense environment created by several hundred people in one area all trying to make a quick buck.The story begins by an explanation of the game &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; itself. From then on, the gambling begins and the dice continue to roll ... the very bizarre way in which Michael gets a much sought after position at a prestigious investment bank ... to an intriguing story about the movers and shakers at Salomon Brothers, and the company's inevitable downfall.Pseudonyms, of course, are used. But we can all imagine what &quot;the Human Piranha&quot; looks like and certainly know what type of person this is. Women can despise the competitiveness and prejudice that reaches its ultimate point in this type of environment, and is practised only by men, for men.The book tails off a little at the end. The author (rightly) describes how his career takes off with the company and his inevitable resignation from the firm (Michael, I'm totally with you -- it takes a certain type of person, without scrupples or morals to be able to sustain themselves in this type of workplace).The only slight weakness is that the author tries to justify his choice at the end (there's no need to, because we understand why early on), by saying &quot;money isn't everything&quot;. Sure, it is not everything, but it's a lot to those who haven't got any.*"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker is a must read for anyone trying to understand the 2008 crisis in mortgage lending and home ownership. In fact, a new edition of the book should be published with a forward by Ben Bernake or Hank Paulson. The autobiography describes a mid-1980's newbie to Wall Street and his induction into the fraternity of mortgage traders at Salomon Brothers and junk bond traders at Drexel. This book rises above a rite of passage story because of the financial chaos which happened during the next three decades.The 41st trading floor of Salomon Brothers is where millions of dollars exchange hands in minutes. There is a blue collar culture of practical jokes, profanity, Mexican food and pizza. The characters might have come right out of Damon Runyon or Animal House. The main difference between the interns, the traders and the clerks is neither their demeanor nor education but their wealth. In contrast to other books which tell us about the best and the brightest, this book describes ordinary people with excess body fat, perspiration, greed and wealth.As more homeowners face foreclosure and the US dollar loses value, it is not clear what message to derive from this book. Were it not for these failures of economic policy the book would join other interesting stories about the rich and privileged of Wall Street. But because of this failure of oversight, the book takes us from humor to cynicism and from a sense of national pride to a feeling of national shame.Is there a ratio of capitalistic reward to risk which is unconscionable in a democratic society? Can this behavior be limited or controlled by financial transparency, tax code, money supply and credit leverage? How do we avoid these consequences of the creation and destruction of capital without moving down the path of socialism? Can we ever put to rest the saying that behind every great fortune is a great crime?"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is one of the most insightful accounts of the investment banking world that one could read about without being an insider. It is in most respects a brutal story about the ruthlessness and total lack lf scruples that govern the world of high stakes finance but nevertheless an insightful account for the consequences of the explosive surge in bond markets from 323 billion at the end of the 70ies to 7 trillion by mid 80ies, following the FED's decision in late 1979 to let the rates float. With uncanny precision, methodical approach, and copious amounts of humor, Michael Lewis takes us on an insider tour de force of the investment banking business as embodied in the Salomon Brothers, Lewis' employer between 1985-87, during their time of fame and what made that company great, or shall we say notorious. Salomon greatly capitalized on the golden opportunities in bond markets starting with mortgage bonds, going through all related exotic instruments and derivatives, and ending with the junk bonds. Greed, ambition, and deceit were ranked top priorities at all organizational levels and duping the clients for corporate gains was the norm to attain success, recognition, fat bonuses, and promotions. Last but not least every was in pursuit of the much coveted title of Big Swinging Dick (women qualified for that title too) and even the occasional Balls of Brass title, the culmination of all deceitful selling techniques to uninformed/disinformed investors (read victims). The portraits of the Salomon high rollers are scary but at the same time comical; John Gutfreund, the CEO of Salomon, Lewie Ranieri, the mortgage bond superhero, who started from the bottom, in the mailroom and made it to be the top Swinging Dick (for a very short period though...nobody lasted too long), Michael Milken of Drexel Investments, their sworn enemy, all of them are unforgettable. Michael Lewis writes with insight and chilling realism. He cuts deep into what the deal is all about without fear of exposing the dirty, even illegal side of the business he was part of during the mid eighties, including his own role in ripping the naive investors off as a senior bond salesman.Overall great reading; witty, sarcastic, satirical and captivating from start to finish. The reading is easier if you understand finance, especially bond pricing and bond market mechanics, otherwise it may become a little cumbersome. Liar's Poker particularly makes great reading for all Wall Street aspiring candidates, it's good to be prepared, you seldon know what awaits around the corner..."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The book is clearly satire, and definitely exaggerates a bit, but it still gives you a sense of the Wall Street culture, where people are extremely wealthy but also extremely unrefined (scarfing greasy cheeseburgers while making millions). Very funny. Also extremely informative on topics such as the rise of mortgage bonds and junk bonds as financial tools. The book gives a great portrayal of the genius of the people behind these financial innovations. In fact, its portrayal of people in general is very funny and memorable. One final upside: there are some books, where, if you don't read them for about a week, you have no clue what's going on anymore. This is not one of those. There are relatively few people to keep track of, and they are described so well that you can't forget them.I would DEFINITELY recommend this book. Funny and informative, a window onto a strange culture known as Wall Street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis' inside look at the heady days of Salomon Brothers during the 1980s and the decay that followed is a mildly amusing, albeit disjointed narrative with little new information. It is funny in parts and some of the character sketches make you pause but overall a strictly average book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I bought this in 1997 and only recently found the time to read it and am I glad I read it!The narration is incredibly funny and often I found myself chuckling out loud. Thoroughly enjoyed reading this, Kudos Michael!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is both entertaining and informative of the situations facing many of the people at trading desks on the Street and in the City. While things have changed since Michael Lewis's time, much has stayed the same. The money, intelligence, ego, and drive of many market participants twenty years ago are still a requirement for success in the IB world today."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker is to future investment bankers as Scott Turow's One L is to future law students. Not only is this book informative, it's entertaining and filled with a vast array of characters. Lewis has the gift or storytelling. Not only does the book cover the process by which the author got the job offer at Salomon Brothers coming out of the London School of Economics and the fearful weeks of the Training Program in New York, he aptly tells the story of the firm and its rise and fall, from the beginning of mortgage-backed securities and the millions made by MBS traders to the crash of October 1987. This is an excellent book that my generation can learn from. And while the ability to communicate and trading technology has become faster, from what I can tell, many of the personalities within the i-banking world described in this book have not. This is an exciting book that will keep you reading. Know what happened twenty years ago and you firm will not likely send you to trade equities in Dallas."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is a must for people interested in Wall St dealers. It's entertaining, but does not discuss anything in depth in terms of trading strategies. It's the story of John Merriweather, Lewis Ranieri and their crew...It gives a detailed account of who the top traders were at Soloman and where they ended up. The book is very good with describing the specific of individuals responsible for making Salomon the bond house of the 80s and 90s. This book describes how the mortgage market was invented by Lewis Ranieri who started out his career in the mail room"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is one of the finest books I've read in a while. The book kept me up many nights, knowing I'd regret it the next day, but unable to put it down. For a detailed, first-hand, insightful look at the madness and excitement at Wall Street's top bond trading firm in the 80s, this is the book to read. Even if you have only a tangential interest in the financial world, Liar's Poker will be worth your time. I read Monkey Business before this, and thought that highly entertaining. It pales in comparison to Liar's Poker, however. Highly recommended..it fully deserves its status as a classic."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is a superb ,blow by blow, in the trenches,account of how the capital markets of the USA are organized and function on a day to day basis.In chapter 12 of the General Theory(GT},Keynes correctly categorized the financial markets as a game of Old Maid or Musical Chairs,where the goal is \\"...foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public\\"(Keynes,1936,p.154).Wall Street speculators\\" are concerned,not with what an investment is really worth to a man who buys it \\"for keeps\\",but with what the market will value it at,under the influence of mass psychology,three months or a year hence\\"(Keynes would have said three minutes or three hours if he were writing the GT today)(Keynes,pp.154-155).The capital,financial and stock markets are not organized to maximize long run net present value,but very short run net present value.The markets are essentially based on a short run ,short sighted,pennywise poundfoolish approach that does not maximize long run economic growth and welfare.Keynes's views were the direct result of his extensive hands on experience in operating in such markets himself over a forty year period.The potential bookbuyer is urged to read this book simultaneously with chapter 12 of the GT."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I have a hard time deciding 4 or 5 stars for this book. Lewis paints an enjoyable and informative picture of Wall Street and the London branch of Salomon Brothers, but takes a long hiatus in the middle chapters, delving into more history and neglecting his own experiences entirely. It's the (more) boring middle chapters that rehash Wall Street's history and cause a reader to lose interest.Lewis is at times funny, but this book is FICTION and loses some of its power when the author chooses pseudonyms or oblique references for real people in real situations. All in all, a good, easy read -- but don't expect a Salomon learning experience."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I have worked on Wall Street since the beginning of the 90's and have met many of the actual characters in the book (with the exception of the author who was long gone by the time I turned up). So I know who Dash Riprock, Herman the German and others are in real life as well as what they are doing now (or at least until recently). This book is now something of an anachronism - a testament to a different age when banks were places where real risk-taking happened. The atmosphere on &quot;the street&quot; by comparison today is very antiseptic with the quants (geeks in the book) having a larger role and everyone panders to customers.Having spoken to a number of the protagonists of the book the big question is how true are these stories? My impression is that Mr Lewis uses a liberal amount of literary license but without foresaking the feeling of the time and the place. Notwithstanding the book's age, I encourage everyone who is thinking of working in the global financial markets arena (especially fixed income and fx) to read this book and reflect on a different time when the pizzas were stacked high on fridays and not sushi boxes...Postscript - Ironically, one of the principal background players in the book - John Meriwether; became perhaps even more famous long after this book (with LTCM blowing up in 1998) as being the only individual person (fund) who has directly provoked the Federal Reserve to adjust monetary policy (interest rates) downward, and surely 1 of the few people in the world to have lost more than a billion dollars of investors money in the market. Unlike Liar's Poker the partners at LTCM didn't all follow the &quot;no tears&quot; rule (by complaining about market conspiracies (!) etc.) when they lost the money."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"If you're looking for an insider's view of investment banking in the mid 1980s - then this is the book for you.If you're interested in the history of mortgage backed securities and junk bonds - then you might find something of interest here.If you're interested in what Salomon Brothers got up to in the 1980s - then you should check this book out.If you work in investment banking - then you have probably already have read this book.If you have dealings with investment bankers - then you should read this book.Easy-to-read; ironic; engaging and entertaining. Trading floors aren't quite like this anymore but that's only because things are (a little) more PC these days.Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"\\"Liar's Poker\\" is worth a read if you want an insider's account of life on Wall Street. The book doesn't pretend to glorify the easy money that Lewis and his ilk made during the bond schlepping go-go days of the 1980's. Rather, Lewis is disillusioned by the greedy culture and hypocritical short-sightedness at Salomon Brothers, but not enough that he doesn't enjoy the ride for a few oh-so-profitable years. Like his other books, \\"Liar's Poker\\" is fun to read. His anecdotes about the training program and the trading floor, albeit surely embellished, read like a day at the amusement park. The key shortcoming is an oozy 20-something self-righteousness that pervades many of the book's chapters, and reaches a crescendo in the final pages. But hey, arrogance begets credibility. And when it comes to describing Wall Street in the 1980's, Lewis is as credible a spokesman as anyone."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is the author's coming of age story, set in the world of investment banking in the 1980s. As a growth and wisdom book, it's pretty good, but it's really a non-fiction version of Tom Wolf's Bonfire of the Vanities. Of course what makes it interesting is that Michael Lewis came of age by successfully trading bonds for Solomon Brothers.Among other aspects of the firm, LP describes Solomon's Mortgage Bonds department, its influence over the savings and loans, and the effect of Fed Chairman Paul Volker's 1981 decision to let interest rates float. Lewis does a brilliant job of explaining how this lead to S&amp;L's selling their mortgages in order to fund investments in higher yield securities.Here's the catch: Liar's Poker appeared before the S&amp;L debacle but it laid out all the signs needed to predict the disaster to come.Much of the hand wringing over S&amp;Ls in the early 90's could maybe have been avoided if the warnings given in this book had been acted upon. To be fair, the warnings are clear but they are implicit. Lewis never actually projects the current state of the S&amp;L industry into the future, even if he does mention that the basic problem with mortgages (short term funding of long term loans) is not solved.Good read."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Lewis is articulate, insightful, cynical, and hilarious in his analysis on the rise and fall of Investment Banking at Solomon Brothers during the 1980s. Liar's Poker is a brilliant portrayal of Wall Street during an era of unprecedented greed and arrogance. Until the early 1980s, equity traders were the most revered people in the industry. However, unforeseen circumstances, largely spurred by the highly leveraged Savings & Loan industry, led to the innovation of new types of financial derivatives. Essentially overnight, a new market for bonds was created for speculators and commercial banks. Volume and profits soared on the bond trading floor, and from that point on the bond traders were the \\"big swinging ....\\" of investment banking.So, against the backdrop of billion-dollar deals and million-dollar salaries enters Michael Lewis, Princeton Art History major and unlikely protagonist. His depiction of the Fraternity-like culture of investment banking is laugh-out-loud, I wish I had thought of that, funny. Lewis reaches rare form in describing the Solomon mortgage traders, a group of fat, mean Italian men with street smarts and a dislike for Ivy League MBAs and every other group within the firm.Nonetheless, Liar's poker is more than just funny-it's insightful. Lewis combines personal narrative and investigative journalism to present a fresh perspective on the collapse of Solomon Brothers. He argues that Solomon's superiority complex resulted in a failure to react to the changing trends in the industry and the retention of key personal. This book is a quick read and a lot of fun. I wouldn't list it as a reference in an academic publication but it's a great addition to the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is a wonderful read. It tells the history of eighties finance through the vantage-point of one firm, Saloman Brothers. Lewis' writing is lucid and engaging, it reads like a novel, but is very informative."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"very good two thumbs u"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is interesting and still timely for a number of reasons. Michael Lewis was not hired by Salomon Brothers by going through the usual channels. That is, he didn't just send in his CV and go through a series of interviews. He did have or was finishing his master's degree at LSE and that would ordinarily be considered very competitive. But the details are quite intriguing. There are also several pages dealing with John Meriwether of Long-Term Capital fame. Meriwether, of course, directed the largest financial collapse in history, and he was trained at Salomon as were many other of these infamous bond traders. Its evidently no longer true that &quot;Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those (the banks) who lend the money&quot; (see the article on Alan Greenspan in BusinessWeek, 12 Oct. 98)! Or has the FED always been in front of the eight ball? You would think that Frank Partnoy (FIASCO) would REALLY be upset with this idea rather than fuming about a zero-sum game in which there is always a winner and a loser with fairly normal contracts. I can't think of a worse case nuclear-waste derivative than 80:1 margin with long and short positions on every possible bond, CMO, and currency in the world all controlled by an arrogant hedge fund manager. This unheard of leverage could only be done by dozens of banks loaning out money on collateral that was already used to procure a loan across the street. Where was Frank when this was going on? Morgan Stanley was not even involved directly with LTCM, and perhaps that explains Frank's silence. Even to this day those at LTCM have a mantra that goes like &quot;You know the model worked really well except for this tiny little problem&quot;, and that phrase is usually followed by &quot;You don't understand (we are just too smart for you), all that was wrong was a tiny bit of bad timing and not quite enough leverage&quot;. Yes, a little tiny non convergence in interest rates did all that damage, and you boys and girls should be in jail. No retail broker would ever do anything like that. My answer to all this is that if you have spent 15 min studying the Black-Scholes equation and geometric Brownian motion of stock prices, you have wasted more than 14 min of your time. Lets hear from Frank. I think what I found most interesting in Liar's Poker was Mr. Lewis's detailed explanation of the development of the mortgage security market at Salomon Brothers. This info is not readily available, and I have no reason to doubt Mr. Lewis's account. If Salomon was the top investment bank when this book was written, times have certainly changed, because they are not even among the top three investment banks today."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I bought Liar's Poker thinking that it will teach me the game of the same name, but instead it taught me a lot about the bond markets and traders in general. It makes me want to be a trader. Very interesting read and definitely teaches you something about how bond and mortgage markets work. If you are looking to learn Liar's Poker as a game, then this is not the book for it though, except for learning how to bluff like in the game. You can learn how to bluff by bluffing and not by reading books anyway."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis has yet again proved what a great writer he is with his lucid style of elucidation. In this book, Lewis talks about the raging 80s -as far as bond trading is concerned- and the events at Solomon Brothers during that period of euphoria. Lewis gives us a glimpse of the street- the exuberance, the egoistic, and the bizzare among the various cadres of the bond value chain, as he walks us thru his memoir of 4 odd years at Solomon. The depiction of each of the extreme characters are just great."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Definitely worth reading, not a waste of your time. Of course, you must have some interest for I-banking drama and bonds."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"It is a lot fun to read this book.

It made me realize Enron is not an isolated case."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is about investment bankers at Salomon Brothers in the 1980's who are portrayed as spoiled crooked kids that were creating and exploiting inefficiencies in the capital markets to enrichen their firm and themselves.The educational and really interesting parts of this book could have been boiled down to 10 pages, max. The rest is filled with tales of office pranks and squabbles and the author's attempts at poetically describing the atmosphere at an investment bank through colourful descriptions of people and stories that aren't really that interesting. The book is largely fluff. Sorry to be so harsh.I would instead recommend Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone, which, to me at least, is much more exciting and educational."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Product was delivered very quickly and in the condition specified by the seller.

I had to put it down."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis's ten-year-old account of his two-year stint as a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers has become a literary classic in the world of finance, and has probably stroked aspirations in more Wall Street-bound MBAs than any other book. I know many an individual who, after reading the book, become so enamored with the culture described therein that they take it upon themselves to act like the &quot;human piranha&quot; or any of the other clownish characters from the book.Having worked on Wall Street in various client-facing capacities over the years, especially as a trader with a volatile fund, I feel the book is a bit over melodramatic and over-sensational. Are there such personas on Wall Street? Absolutley. In fact the real people on Wall Street -- the traders, the whiteshoe i-bankers, the jewish deal-makers and deal-breakers -- can be even meaner, nastier than Lewis describes. But the clownish characters he creates are probably more fiction than real. Still, his observation that most traders have huge egos and are among the most despicable human beings (despite their MBAs, Ph.D.s, or MDs) to ever walk on earth, is deadly accurate. The constant politicking is captured vividly by the author, although, again, his writing seems to border on fiction quite often.Don't take me wrong; I think this is a must-read for anyone interested in how Wall Street breathes and works. Lewis does a fine job at exposing the disgusting nature of greed, the only thing that feeds Wall Street's daily existence."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Was not made clear that I was purchasing an abridged copy. The advertisement hides and obscures this important fact. Not the authors fault, what little I heard of the book was good."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.If you want to get an \\"inside view\\" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style. The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity. He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it. I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers. He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential. I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place. But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is a great book about wall street. Although it was written over 20 years ago, the picture the book paints about wall street culture is still alive and current: if you watch \\"Margin Call\\", movie released in the first half of this year, you should notice it.Another big subject approached by the book is the creation of the mortgage department inside Salomon Brothers and how wall street adopted the new instruments and expanded them to astonishing numbers. Eventually, their volumes would reach their peaks 20 years later, leading the world into the GFC. If you are interested, read \\"The Big Short\\" from the same author.I would say that what makes the book stand out though is how the personal profile of the author (this book is about the author's life spent inside Salomon for two years of his early professional life) clashes against wall street culture: the author is not the trader type. Sometimes he ends up acting against his own moral codes because the culture envelopes him completely and forces him to make some questionable decisions.In summary, if you are a retail trader or have an interest in what goes on inside the backstage of the world of trading, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I was looking for a book which could help me understand what happened in the stock markets. It's voice from the inside did just that adding a human side to the explanation of financial phenomenon. Lewis' capability to explain and entertain made me feel sad, surprised and somewhat justified in my doubts on the practices of the financial establishment."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"There are a large number of young people (now in their mid-forties) who, like myself, have been fundamentally influenced by the contents of this book. While the author himself will absolutely cringe at this notion, he will certainly acknowledge that the insider tale spun from his time working at Salomon Brothers convinced many a young college graduate to turn to investment banking as a career.Personally my life took a different turn after reading this book, as I knew a person like me (a person of strong ethical inclination) had no business being on Wall Street.It is my belief that anyone with a 401K account, IRA, or managed stock portfolio would benefit from reading this book. Inside you will get a series of indelible images of the types of people and personalities who work beyond the reach of the public and the law and never EVER have your best interests at heart.Liar's Poker may not stop you from investing, but at the very least you can expect to have the blinders removed when you do put your money at risk."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I purchased this book after reading the follow-up book \\"The Big Short.\\" This book is good although not quite as compelling as \\"The Big Short.\\" It gives an interesting insider perspective to the financial industry. Thankfully the author does not drag politics into the book - rather it is an honest account of his experience as a trainee at Solomon Brothers and covers the first years of his career there."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I I had to go back to the beginning after already having read Mr. Lewis' other financial books. Clearly, his style has evolved but this is a great preface and sets the stage for the drama of what has happened to the financial industry. A good read for anyone who likes economics or history and plain old good story telling."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis is a great writer, he is equally entertaining as he is educational. This book answered a lot of questions I had about finance, and brought a lot of insight about the culture and history of wall street. I read the book twice because I enjoyed it so much. I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in business and/or finance."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Highbrow Ivy League educated business students get hazed like frat boys before entering the fray of bond trading at Salomon Bros. This insiders' look will make you giggle as you read about the antics of Wall Street while cringing with a sickening, sinking feeling that said antics shape our economy and likely our politics. Keep a pen handy and take notes as Lewis provides an apt description about the structure and movement of funds associated with the bond markets. Lewis occassionally hops on a high horse to issue judgement on his then colleagues, but they are typically spot on. Filled with outrageous characters that one will love to hate and bizarre personalities, this is a must read for any American wondering about the state of our economy."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Very interesting insight into the culture of wall street during the bond boom of the1980's. Fun read, tough to put down."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"As someone who worked in the financial advising business this book convinced me there are a lot of people who work in the industry who should be doing something else.

However, that being said, Liar's Poker is a very enjoyable read and books by Michael Lewis are always hard for me to put down."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I read some of Mr. Lewis' later works before reading this and was already familiar with his writing. While the character development might seem a bit slow to some (my sister to whom I recommended the book) the writer does get there with the characters and when he does you can almost reach out and touch them! Great author and great and timely subject matter."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Still the best book on finance ever written. Others have tried to copy but none has come close to the original. A must read book for everyone interested in Finance and making a career on Wall Street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"If he didn't describe it with such wry, amused detachment, Michael Lewis' chronicle of his time at Salomon Brothers during the 1980s could easily be mistaken for a modern installment of Dante's inferno. Each day on the trading floor, as computers blinked and eager brokers barked into the phone, bright young people yielded to siren call of greed. Personal destruction was the goal of the game, as Darwinism ran rampant and the strong metaphorically devoured the weak as a matter of course.Somehow Lewis avoids turning this often disturbing display of human baseness into a morality play. His sense of humor is most likely what allowed to him survive, and even succeed, during his time in the lion's den. In \\"Liar's Poker\\", he uses it to great effect, painting vivid portraits of the colorfully flawed egoists who drove the bond market into excess and chaos. For all their blustering, Lewis reveals many of the redoubtable players in the bond game to be sad and insecure, and avoids the temptation to pass judgement on them.It's no wonder that Lewis finally answered his calling in journalism, because he displays amazing skill here, and not only as a writer and observer of the human condition. He's equally adept at ferreting out facts, analyzing them, and presenting them to lay readers in an entirely comprehensible way. In the course of his rollicking story, he manages to deliver a pretty detailed lesson on the basics of finance, the bond market, and the ways it impacts our daily lives.As a neophyte himself when he went into investment banking, Lewis seems to tutor the reader even as he's learning some of the basics himself. He explains how the bond market drama of the eighties began with the adoption of a new operating system by the fed, targeting money supply growth instead of interest rates. This caused bond prices to swing wildly and created a window of opportunity for traders in the heretofore backwater bond market to reap huge sums in arbitrage. At the same time, consumer and government debt skyrocketed, creating a enormous demand for fixed income products.Many of the big shots, \\"or \\"Big Swinging...\\", as Lewis oftenrefers to them, happened to be in the right place at the right time. Luck definitely played a large part in making many of them legends. As for Lewis himself, he emerges as one of the luckiest of all, escaping with a rich experience, the material for a terrific book, and maybe even his soul."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"What the heck do all those Wall Street insiders know that we normal people don't?

It's set in New York and London in the 1980s, where the writer built his career in the bond department of Salomon Brothers. Along with Michael Lewis' progress from trainee, to lowly geek and to Big Swinging Dicks, there are amusing stories to tell and larger-than-life characters that became 1980s classic tales. All of this described with great detail, sharp wit and humor, in an era when Salomon Brothers was probably the world's most powerful investment bank."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"What Michael Lewis did in 2010 for the sub-prime mortgage meltdown inThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, he did twenty years earlier for the S&L; crisis inLiar's Poker. Wall Street bond & securities traders like to think of themselves asEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Roombecause they can sell ice to the Eskimos. They can dream up new ways of selling risk and even the future of risk, in increasingly-obscure derivatives which not only fooled the buying public into investing in these worthless bonds, but were so arcane and convoluted that the ratings agencies (Moody's and Standard & Poor's) horribly misrated them. The Securities and Exchange Commission, eviscerated by Reagan and his henhouse wolves, was unwilling -- or unable -- to regulate the pending disaster.Either time!And the pieces are all in place for another monster Wall Street blow-up, to be bailed out once again by unwitting (and unwilling) taxpayers (\\"TBTF\\"). Wall Street has figured out how to pass all the risk of gambling with other peoples' money to the taxpayers, while keeping all of the profits for themselves. You don't even need to be be an investor in the stock market anymore to get fleeced. Uncle Sam will reach into your pocket on behalf of Wall Street!Lewis warned us of the danger after the first time it happened, but apparently nobody listened (or not the right people). Page 163: \\"The mortgage trading desk evolved from corner shop to supermarket. By increasing the number of products, they increased the number of shoppers. The biggest shoppers, the thrifts, often had a very particular need. They wanted to grow beyond the limits imposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington. It was a constant struggle to stay one step ahead of thrift regulators in Washington. Many 'new products' invented by Salomon Brothers were outside the rules of the regulatory game; they were not required to be listed on thrift balance sheets and therefore offered a way for thrifts to grow. In some cases, the sole virtue of a new product was its classification as 'off-balance sheet.' To attract new investors and to dodge new regulations, the market became ever more arcane and complex.\\"Is it any wonder that the same thing happened again in 2008?If there's any doubt that Wall Street acts solely in their self-interest (customers are there to absorb losses, nothing else), Lewis lays it out on page 199: \\"I should have felt guilty, of course, but guilt was not the first identifiable sensation to emerge from my exploding brain. Relief was. I had told him the news. He was shouting and moaning. And that was it. That was all he could do. Shout and moan. That was the beauty of being a middleman, which I did not appreciate until that moment. The customer suffered. I didn't. He wasn't going to kill me. He wasn't even going to sue me. I wasn't going to lose my job. On the contrary, I was a minor hero at Salomon for dumping a sixty thousand dollar loss into somebody else's pocket.\\"Taxpayer, sew up your pockets."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Accurate indictment of the greed which brought down the savings and loans in the 80's and a good companion for Lewis' other book, 'The Big Short'. Americans should be fighting this legalized larceny tooth and nail. We have such a short memory we cannot remember the damage done to our nation and the world by a small group of spoiled brats who just happen to be a little brighter than the rest of us. Wall Street needs more regulation, not less. As long as these clowns continue to operate in an unbridled manner we will have huge, divestating swings in our economy. Our silence is nothing more than tacit approval of their terrible ways."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This was the second Michael Lewis book I've read, the first being \\"The Big Short\\", which I also recommend.As a financial advisor, I find Mr. Lewis' account of his time on Wall Street in the 1980's as a direct reflection of the kind of culture that no doubt persists to this day. I couldn't help but think that this same environment contributed to the financial meltdown of 2008.Yet, to some degree this book is the classic discussion of \\"nature\\" vs. \\"nurture\\": are you born the way you are or are you a product of your environment?Mr. Lewis would suggest that the culture of Wall Street, and perhaps most of the entire financial services sector (of which I am a part), can be so strong that one's actions, beliefs and values are greatly influenced by the environment in which one works. The influence from the environment can be so strong that at times one may not be able to see the forest through the trees. In other words, the environment dictates that ones actions are justified because everyone is doing it and that's just how things work...until they no longer work.In many ways, as an industry participant, I found it shocking how self-focused the organizations Mr. Lewis described in his book could be. Perhaps I found it shocking because I was always brought up with the ideals that if it was good for my customer, then it would ultimately be good for me. Yet, the book tells of many tales, some humorous and some very sad, of competition, deceit, success and failure.Now, in all likelihood, the examples cited by Mr. Lewis are examples that could be fit into any industry. The big take away for me was the realization of just how dog-eat-dog and self-serving our capitalist, democratic society has really become. Despite the fact that this was written in the 1980's, it is scary to think how little has changed.While perhaps our environment can have great influence over our actions (ie: nurture), perhaps the greatest sadness is that human beings, in general, repeat the same mistakes, generation after generation. This may be a clear reflection of really who we are (ie: nature).Thank your Mr. Lewis for your many great books. I'm looking forward to reading more of your work in the future."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book was a very good read but, on reflection, I did not find that much to cherish. I felt this was especially true in comparison to Lewis's other works. There's many cute phrases -- e.g. \\"Bankers use curses as nouns, adjectives, and verbs -- against the random hovering trainee\\" -- but I didn't feel that I really got a new perspective on Wall St. the way that Moneyball gave me a perspective on sports or the New New Thing gave me one on Silicon Valley."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"A classic. Never read it until 2010. Loved it! Parts of it made me sick. Other parts made me howl!Here are a few excerpts I found poignant (Any emphasis is mine):\\"The thrifts paid a fee to have their mortgages guaranteed. The shakier the loans, the larger the fee a thrift had to pay to get its mortgages stamped by one of the agencies. Once they were stamped, however, nobody cared about the quality of the loans. Defaulting homeowners became the government's problem. The principle underlying the programs was that these agencies could better assess and charge for credit quality than individual investors.\\" P. 135\\"Most of the time when markets move, no one has any idea why. A man who can tell a good story can make a good living as a broker. It was the job of people like me to make up reasons, to spin a plausible yarn. And it's amazing what people will believe.\\" P. 231\\"Risk, I had learned, was a commodity in itself. Risk could be canned and sold like tomatoes. Different investors place different prices on risk. If you are able, as it were, to buy risk from one investor cheaply and sell it to another investor dearly, you can make money without taking any risk yourself. And this is what we did.\\" P. 232\\"If social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year.\\" Pp. 250-251.You'll laugh, you'll cry - yet you cannot deny - Michael Lewis remains on of America's literary greats.

This book has changed the way that I look at investing."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book is an excellent look at the culture of the 1980's investment bank, primarily, the now non-existent, Salomon Brothers. This book takes the reader through the training program at SB with the author Lewis. Liar's Poker does a great job describing the characters in this investment house as well as the insanity that occurs on a daily basis at the trading desks and the woeful decisions by the CEO's of these banks.The look at SB was hilarious in its time, but now it is an excellent view of the creation of the Mortgage Backed Security and the large market of home loans that was created. This gives the reader a firsthand view of events that would eventually lead to the credit crisis of 2007-2009.In standard Lewis fashion the reader is given an easy to understand explanation of complicated financial transaction and markets, even the unsophisticated person can read this book and understand the happenings of the markets.I recommend this book; it is a great way to become familiar with Wall st and its interworkings."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This book had me after the first chapter, which left me with the hair on the back of my neck tingling with excitement. Michael Lewis is a great story teller and since he was on ground zero for Salomon brothers during their early years it gives him a massive amount of insight. This book is hilarious to read because it documents the mortgage trading culture wonderfully during its infancy...and explains how salomon bros sowed the seeds of it's own destruction early on with poor business practices while simultaneously creating the dangerous market of mortgages and derivatives. Excellent to read, complex but in layman's terms, and most importantly it is organized like a good novel: complete with beginning, middle, and end. I highly recommend this book for not only its informational value, but for its entertainment value as well."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Very well written. Fast moving. M. Lewis brings Wall Street to you in understandable terms. Exposes the financial hype for what it is.

He didn't last long at Wall Street or in London but he managed to look around and see the foibles of the trader, salesmen and others. It is quite entertaining and a quick read but it certainly gives a look at the around for the crash that followed not to long after he was there. Anyone wanting to understand the crash should read this book before some of the others that have delved deeply into the troubles. Highly recommended as a background look at what happened."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"You can neglect all the reviews and go straightly to any local bookstore to read the first chapter which describes the game \\"Liar's Poker\\". You will buy it then, I bet. It's not a trading book which I had expected, but a true story told by a bond salesman in Salomon Brothers about how bankers \\"stole\\" or sometimes \\"robbed\\" investors shamelessly. Though I still found two chapters quite boring, the rest are really interesting. Even you may not like the story, you will learn to be more careful when your private or personal banker calls you for a deal or two! Finally, I must agree with Management Today's comment that it \\"Should be made a legally required component of every MBA course\\"."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Unlike (nearly all, or all) academic economics books, which 'explain' that arbitrage does not and cannot exist, Lewis explains to us how the big bond houses live from arbitrage (buying low from the government or somewhere else and selling a bit higher to you and me). The book is a rare, a highly entertaining and very informative jewel: Lewis rightfully and poetically calls brokerage houses 'full servive casinos', far better than Monte Carlo or Las Vegas. Not only will they accept and place your bets, they'll also lend you (a large fraction of) the money needed to place your bets (margin)! A very good book to read now (1/27/00) during the 'wild ride' before the present big market bubble goes: POP!Unfortunately, Lewis tells us too litlte about Meriwether, who later seduced two of the top finance academics (they were willing) and, with their aid, constructed the huge, uncontrolled experiment in 'equilibrium theory' called 'Long Term Capital Management' (LTCM). Their philosophy, also believed uncritically by most working economists, was and likely still is: Equilibrium will prevail (even in the absence of restoring forces!). For the continuation of the story where Liar's poker leaves off ('portfolio insurance', arbitrage and more arbitrage, and the formation and collapse of the bubble called LTCM), see the new book &quot;Inventing Money&quot;."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker is a revealing account of his days as a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers, a bulge-bracket investment house. In the 1980's, bonds were in their heyday, and consequently, investment houses dedicated a big part of their operations to the almighty bond. Enter Michael Lewis. Fresh out of the London School of Economics, he relies on -- at least partly, anyways -- some chance connections to land a job back on Wall Street. Lewis has a knack for fully developing the characters that made Salomon Brothers and it is both enlightening and entertaining to revisit his life in the frenzied 1980s on Wall Street. As hilarious as Liar's Poker is, it also, in some respects, is a bit of a sobering read, knowing now how much Wall Street has disintegrated since Lewis' time at Salomon Brothers. bought this book for 1 cent (plus $3.99 shipping, of course) and it remains one of my all-time favorite books. A must read for anyone who has any interest in business/finance or anyone who wants a closer look at what life was really like as a bond salesman in the 1980s."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker, written by Michael Lewis, describes life on Wall Street during the 1980's and the four years the author worked for Salomon Brothers. Lewis discusses the evolution of the bond market, how mortgaged-backed securities came to exist, and the misfortunes of missing the junk bond market. The fantastic character portrayals are absolutely hilarious and they make the book come to life. Liar's Poker depicts many business ethics issues such as gender and race discrimination, consumer and investor protection, and hostile work environments.Lewis begins by describing John Gutfreund, Chairman of Salomon, and the Liar's Poker game. Gutfreund is portrayed as a manager that was both feared and respected. He was once a trader and managed Salomon with a trader mentality. Traders by nature are gamblers, so they are willing to take bets, or better yet, they are risk takers. Gutfreund apparently loved playing the game, Liar's Poker, because if a person was good at it, he was probably a good trader as well. The game is played predominantly by Salomon traders whereby a group gathers in a circle holding a dollar bill close to the body to hide the serial numbers. One player begins by making a bid such as \\"three fives,\\" which means that all the players in the circle have at least three fives in their serial number. The player to the left can either challenge the bid or up the bid by saying three sixes or four fives. Only in a challenge do the players reveal the serial numbers on the bill. Essentially, it is game that rewards players for their ability to bluff or deceive the other players. Lewis uses the game to illustrate Salomon's corporate culture and its leadership.Liar's Poker does a fantastic job explaining how the mortgage trading business originated and how Salomon/Ranieri created mortgaged-backed securities. Lewis also details more stories about his escapades after the training program. The book is easy and fun to read because it is presents an accurate picture of Wall Street firms. Business ethics issues are presented through the text. The issues that are identified in this report are sexual and ethnic discrimination, hostile work environments, and unethical business practices. Many more ethical issues are present in the Liar's Poker. This book should be read by anyone hoping to join a Wall Street firm or simply a trading environment."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"When you were young, your parents probably instilled you with a respect for adults. Michael Lewis performs a public service by showing that adults don't always deserve this respect, and sometimes even behave worse than children. Indeed, as Michael puts it, Wall Street is a vast playground where corporate executives can be bullies and rob people of their lunch money.The truth is that young people accepting their first job on Wallstreet probably have no idea what they're getting into. After four years in the meritocrasy that is academia, most college students are unprepared for the brutal darwinian slugfest that awaits. College professors do not offer instruction on how to deal with abusive managers, back-stabbing coworkers, and double-talking executives. New hires (i.e. geeks) are beaten and kicked until they either learn how to fight or perish. Life is cheap on Wallstreet.This book is a definitve recount of the madness which typified the 1980s. Michael lets us rid shotgun with him on his journey through the capital markets. Along the way, we meet strange indigenous animals like the Human Piranha, Sangfroid, and Dash Riprock. We learn the native language (i.e. f---speak) and observe a tribe of bond traders engaged in ritualistic gluttony. Michael does not try to shield our eyes. Rather, he provides the reader with an uncensored look at Salomon Brothers and life in the trenches.Michael's sketch of John Gutfruend, Salomon's then CEO, is both droll and insightful. In so many words, Gutfruend was a king without clothes. He smoked cigars and affected a british accent to convey the image of an English gentleman. He worked very hard to give the impression that money was secondary to the &quot;contributions&quot; that Salomon made to the business community. Yet, the minute that Gutfruend ascended to the throne he initiated an IPO that would both line his own pockets and enrage the founders. Gutfruend was also responsible for a number of disasterous mistakes, like trying to open an office in London in an effort to become an international bank. By the end of the book, there is no doubt that Gutfruend is naked.If there is a message to Liar's Poker, it's that finance is a zero-sum game. What this implies is that your broker is not necessarily looking out for your best interests; he may be looking out for his own. As the E*trade commercial so aptly put it, &quot;if you're broker is so smart, why does he work for a living?&quot;"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"My expectations of this book were perhaps mislead. I thought that this would deal with more the generalized view of Wall Street. However, it really concentrates on the lives of traders.Lewis does shed some light on Wall Street trading in general, including a good description of mortgage trading and junk bond trading. However, this book sort of throws it into the mix. I wasn't sure what Lewis was trying to do. Sometimes it felt like a history book, sometimes a biography, sometimes an economics lesson, sometimes a comedy. It felt haphazard and lacked direction, and with the writing style presented, it lacked a certain amount of fluidity.It was fun to learn the different people in Wall Street. From the obese, abusive traders, the short sighted and greedy executives, the brown nosers, to the \\"back row\\" trainees. It's basically a fun little description of office life at Solomon Brothers in the eighties, not an exciting expose on the finance industry as the cover would like you to believe."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"If you want to know what the big Wall Street bond firms were like, before the MBAs took over, this is the book. It's a great portrait of 1980s Wall Street, the way that traders and investment bankers used to appear (in the eyes of the young MBAs they hired) and the ridiculous training that newcomers received. It's not a pretty picture, but if you want to know what happened recently you have to remember that the current mess happened when a different group was in charge. That group included Michael Lewis's peers, the well educated, affluent Ivy Leaguers who run Wall Street today and took the places of the BSDs. (Lewis's term meaning big, swinging...well you get the idea.) The current mess was also created by the banks, who were just beginning to enter the market in the 80s.Engaging as it is, studying Liars Poker to understand today's Wall Street is like studying the Carter Administration (before the Reagan administration privatized a thousands of governmental operations) to find out how federal government \\"really works.\\" Who were the BSDs that Lewis describes? In 1975 a white man (and you had to be both) with smarts and a recent degree in any subject from a state college, could get a job at a bond firm by using connections. Connections were everything. This guy's boss probably did not have a college degree. (The college degree jobs went to stock brokers and private and commercial bankers.) The key talent for 1970s traders on the way up was the ability to crunch numbers very quickly without pencil and paper. By 1985, with talent and nerve, the bond trader who had started ten years before, could be making millions for himself and for his firm.This guy was the BSD that Lewis describes. And this guy hired the MBAs who were only beginning to have a foothold when Lewis worked at Salomon.Michael Lewis tells the engaging story of how a talented MBA joined Salomon Brothers and was simply astonished by the culture. What he describes isa culture where a formal education takes a back seat to chutzpah. Lewis's descriptions of uneducated, but astonishingly rich, men doing things like meeting the Queen Mother in England, are hilarious.What Lewis cannot tell you (because the book was published so long ago) is how Wall Street replaced those guys with men and women who look and sound like Lewis. Salomon, once a firm of 7000 headed by its founder, is now part of Citigroup. The BSD's with their coarse language, huge lunches and cigars have been replaced with highly paid MBAs who know exactly what looks bad on an expense report, would know what to say to the Queen Mother. Is this better? Well, it's different.I worked on Wall Street, at big banks and at Salomon, before and after the change.The typical BSD that Lewis describes couldn't get a job on today's Wall Street. The Liar's Poker portrait of the gross, uneducated, cigar smoking, overweight middle-aged trader is something that every firm makes it a point to avoid. Firms hire young people (emphasis on young) with fantastic academic backgrounds and Hollywood good looks. Traders today are still mostly male and white, but they come from affluent, highly educated backgrounds. The firms hire more women and minorities from the best schools so while the numbers still show mostly white men, the annual report pictures and the EEOC audits go better. Sexual harrassment, which was rampant in the 80s still happens (as it does everywhere) but because of huge lawsuits, firms have HR departments that will come down on any employee (includng traders) like a ton of bricks if the firm's money or reputation are put at risk.The current Wall Street mess wasn't created by Liar's Poker crowd. Trading with computer models was something few understood. Today's trader is tied to his computer and Blackberry and there is no assistant to enter the tickets. There are no tickets to be hidden or manipulated. By the early 90s the BSD's described in this book, older men with their lightening fast calculations, street smarts, nerve and passion for the game, had all but been replaced by Harvard, Yale and Wharton MBAs.When this book was written the Mortgage Backed Securities Market was just taking off. Most banks were still holding their loans on the books, not selling them bundles. Fannie Mae still thought it was part of the government and hadn't gone completely off the reservation. It was the Michael Lewis's peers, the ones who did not get out when he did, along with a myriad of other people involved in mortgages and credit, who caused the current mess.The BSD's do make a good target though."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"It's been almost 25 years since the publication of Liar's Poker and perhaps that has diminished the fascination with the Wall Street world depicted by Michael Lewis. A bunch of fat cats taking big bets on the market while putting clients, investors and their own firms at risk is not as eye opening as it might have been in 1989 when Liar's Poker was published. The characters as depicted in the book are for the most part two dimensional and not particularly compelling. The insight offered by Mr. Lewis into the workings of bond, equity and other markets are minimal. There's a bit of wit, and certainly we have Mr. Lewis to thank for bringing the term Big Swinging Dick into the lexicon, but overall I was hoping for a bit more meat from a writer of such well received works as Moneyball and the Big Short."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"While it has been some time since I read Liars Poker it still brings a smile to my face by bringing back fond memories.

Having spent 42 years in municipal finance with, 23 of those years as a municipal bond analyst/portfolio manager/investment director, at a major institution I can speak with some semblance of authority. You would have to say that at various points in my career I experienced some of what he talks about. He does a nice job of pointing out the nature of characters, some of who, use to prey on unsuspecting porfolio managers.

Among the thugs and thieves are firms that are, in some cases, no longer in business.

Lewis provides a description of the rise and fall of the mortgage bond market at Salomon Brothers as well his experience with other derivative markets. Included in the book are several outlandish incidents that went on behind the scenes at Salomon brothers. Many of the undertakings by the high net worth investment professionals will leave you taken aback as their actions show an often significant lack of any real viable market knowledge.Beyond some revelations revealing the sophomoric attitudes of the investment professionals and a peripheral description of the financial markets, Liar's Poker offers little insight that one would not acquire by working as a temp at any major brokerage firm. Expecting to find a perceptive analysis on the financial markets, I was disappointed only to find a marginal account of the industry and some commentary on the author's personal experiences.

If you are at all curious as to what goes on inside Wall Street you must read this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"To be honest, I only read about 30% of the book according to my Kindle - thats all I could handle. That actually says a lot, since I try to finish any book that I start. The first 30% of the book seemed to repeat itself over and over without adding anything useful.While in the training class, the people in the back of class threw paper wads and spit balls and the people in the front row were seen as brown nosers. The students acted rudely to an instructor. Traders swear a lot and think that they are the most important person in the world. That covers about everything that I read - and it was repeated over and over and over again."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Paid for a newer edition, recieved the older one.

Instructive as well as entertaining."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Speaking as a Los Angeles Economics student I found the book to be a highly entertaining, refreshingly interesting, delightful tour through the day-to-day activities of what was at one point the world's premier investment firm. Mr. Lewis provides a fascinating insider's look at the bond markets and the leveraged buyouts that made the period famous. Highly recommended for anyone tired of stultifying economics textbooks."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis was still a bond salesman at Solomon Brothers when he began writing Liar's Poker, and it is obvious that he was right in the middle of the action this book discusses. The book is set in the frenzied 1980's when bond traders were raking in millions of dollars a year and were at the top of the investment banking-heap. It is a wild world where unbelieveably confident, ambitious, and greedy men put their all (their money, time, and energy--all of which they have in large reserves)into making more money than anyone else in their firm and any other firm on Wall Street. Lewis is always funny and a very careful observer of the world which he describes, so this is a wonderful insider's perspective of a fascinating career. It really makes investment banking come alive, does a wonderful job explaining complicated financial matter, and though it is non-fiction all of the outlandish characters make it a very entertaining read. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in finance or who just want to read a very well written, fun book about &quot;the real world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Lewis, as always, writes extremely well in this book. He spends most of the book explaining the details of bond futures, whole mortgages and other esoteric financial terms, but manages to do it in a way that never bores you. The book is filled with a colorful cast of characters who are entertaining throughout (although they're more down to earth than those in Po Bronson's Baombardiers).The book looses a star, however, for its somewhat impersonal and inconsitant nature in parts. It starts with an account of Lewis's own start in Salomon Brothers, but then drifts into a narrative about people he heard about, or who worked with his friends, etc. In the last chapters, Lewis struggles to relate the story back to himself. Unfortunately, the ending left me frustrated -- Lewis talks about all the people leaving the firm for various reasons (mostly for more money) and says he'd never leave for money; &quot;I'd leave Salomon Brothers for other reaons, however. And I did.&quot; That's more or less the end of the book. A wandering eplilogue closes without telling you any more about his motivations.Those criticisms apart, Liar's Poker is a great book for anyone who's interested in how Wall Street really works, and especially what happened during the 80s boom."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is one of the classics on Wall Street trading rooms in the 80s. It is somewhat outdated by now. The book is fairly well written, although Lewis has an annoying habit of always telling you what he is planning on telling you before he actually tells you.For a newer, fresher book I would suggest Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle. It does for investment banking what Liar's Poker did for trading. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I want you to realize that Michael Lewis is only one perspective albeit a very biased and skewed one at that. If you speak to any one who worked at Salomon they will bluntly tell you that the book is not completely factual. Michael Lewis has an agenda, and it is very obvious that he has it in for the Salomon and Wall Street traders. And, he is willing to bend the truth and exagerate things to make the people look like monsters. Using the endearing term of Human Pirhana speaks to this point. I loved the book, because it gives you somewhat of a perspective on the life of traders, but I don't think you truly know what it is you're up against until you go and do actual trading. I wouldn't believe everything you read in Liar's Poker, and I would weigh each word carefully, because Meriweather isn't the only playing Liar's Poker here. Enjoy, and don't let the book discourage you from hedge funds and investment banking, especially if you really love finance."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was excited when this book finally arrived. However, after reading 3/4 of the book, I felt the reviews were highly misleading. Lewis is by no means a highly gifted writer. This book is sloppy and disorganized. He throws around dates and names in random pages, which leads the reader out of the loop. Most of the names could have been left out and weren't important to the story. A brief synopsis of the story goes like this \\"Yah, we made a lot of money in the 1980s at Salomon Brothers\\". And for the a whole synopsis, reiterate that 100 times in a 100 different ways. I'm so disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"If you a dying to work in the industry or imagine the stock market to be a big mystery this book might be more engaging.Personaly I found it a little boring and hard to get through.

Michael Lewis is one of the only authors aside from P.J. O'Rourke who can make the inner working of economics and trading seem amusing to the average reader. While all of us have our own view and biases of the crazy trading and greed of the eighties, Mr. Lewis offers an astute and often humorous account of his experiences as a trader of bonds to clients who were as clueless as himself about what they were doing. A must read for all, not just economic gurus. Ben Stein himself couldn't give a more amusing tale of wall street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This is a great book. I mean, everyone else says so, so they can't be wrong. Yes, I want a job on wall street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I am told that the average tenure of a new investment banking recruit is under three years. This is mainly because they are worn our and weary. Apparently, an eighty hour week is considered a short week and anything less than showing up in the office six days a week means that you are not committed to your job. This never sounded like an attractive profession to me. I strongly suggest that if you are thinking about entering the investment banking world, or just thinking about investing, you should read LIAR'S POKER. What drives this industry to hyper-activity? Part of the answer must be that that is the way trades are made and business is done - or always has been. It's The Tradition Stall from THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION, by Mitchell, Coles and Metz. The industry also suffers from The Bureaucracy Stall - lots of inefficient policies and rules, and The Communications Stall - They don't really all get the same information at the same time. Perhaps, by replacing the bad habits of investment bankers with new good habits based on totally rethinking the way this business is done (see Mitchell's Eight-Step process), they would earn more and have more fun. Now that's a 2,000 percent solution! (Solving a problem is a 100% solution. Achieving 20 times those benefits or getting there 20 times as fast, equals 2000 percent.)"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I read this because I was required to for (MBA) school. I read the entire book over two weekends; a difficult task for me because of poor reading speed and poor attention span. I generally do not like to read and find most of what I read a painful bore and highly unbeneficial. This book was an exception. This book gives us an interesting insight into Michael Lewis' real world experience, something we cannot get a real feel for in traditional textbooks. If it is not already, this book should be required reading for all MBA programs. Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for sharing your story."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I must say this is an all time classic.

Read this book and learn about the titans of Solomon Brothers like John Meriwether, Lewis Ranieri, and John Gutfreund. Lewis also gives the reader a first-hand account of the immature behavior of both Senior Executives as well as newly minted Associates. You may have a difficulty believing the info in the book, but it is, in fact, true."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Finest book on wall street affairs. A clear page Turner. This book does not require any finance background. But one must be interested in finance a little to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"As a current Mortgage bond trader, this was an essential reading to get familiar with the history of the market. It is written well, it goes into the sales and trading model that is essential to understand for every new person getting into Wall St. Much of the technical aspects of MBS trading and securitization is redundant now as the advancement in computers have made complex cash flow modeling easier. So much of the arbitrage depicted in the book does not happen now. But it is essential to understand the trader mentality of those days. Now most of the traders are Quants and this culture does not exist. But Solomon brothers like LTCM was one of the defining firms on Wall st and no one could have told the story better than Michael Lewis."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker, used as the title of the book, is a high risk game that salesmen and executives at Solomon Brothers played; the game was a true reflection of Solomon Brothers' organizational culture of high risk and high short-term profit - a real macho culture. The book is truly the funniest book you will ever read on Wall Street. Lewis first starts off his book by emphasizing the power of a network as the primary source of landing a job on Wall Street. He argues that one's first job is more about how many and what kind of people one knows rather what degree one graduates with. He then talks about how overwhelming and how bad his experience was during the training program at Solomon Brothers; a former Wall Street firm.Throughout the book, Lewis describes an employee's life on Wall Street in a very humorous way and denounces bad management team of Solomon Brothers - referred to as \\"big swinging dicks\\" - under the leadership of John Gutfreund, the chairman at the time. He also explains what made Solomon Brothers one of the leading firms on Wall Street and the most powerful force in the financial market: the fact that they were building the bonds market while many firms on Wall Street were still busy trading stocks.In fact, Lewis really gives reader an insider's look at the fast-paced and overwhelming life on Wall Street. The book is easy to read; you get hooked once you start reading and never going to put it down. The book is just hilarious; I recommend it to anyone interested in the financial markets and a future career on Wall Street."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"The book was a great read in understanding the Financial attitude and confirming how most people in that realm view customers."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"In today's economic climate this book remains a pertinent cautionary tale. We don't seem to learn much from our political approaches and faliures in monetary matters, perhaps because of greed and narrowness of view, and this book brings these historical matters to mind in relation to current problems. Perhaps this should be required reading for all in politics who can affect monetary, banking, and investing policy. The author manages to keep the readers interest, and despite the known and obvious conclusions to the tale, he makes it almost like a mystery raging to a bad end. Excellent read, pertinent today, and unfortunately likely tomorrow."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I found this book very good to read especially during the current financial crisis. Even though the author wrote it in the 80s, it shows the culture and business of investing. The author used to be a bond salesman in the New York and London offices of Salomon Brothers.The description of the S&L; crisis is in a way similar to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. The greed and obsession with money made both crises possible. After reading this book, I realized that no matter how much regulation we have, we will experience similar events. Yesterday, it was the S&L; crisis, today it is the subprime mortgage crisis, and tomorrow the greedy minds of Wall Street will create something even more interesting that will have more devastating effects.For those who are not familiar with the business of high finance, this book will be an eye-opener. It shows what traders, salesmen, and executives of Wall Street firms do every day to make money by taking huge risks with the hope of a payoff. I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"An entertaining look into the life of a Salomon Brothers bond trader in the 1980s. The book offers a cursive overview of the financial innovations during that period, but the real contribution is in examination of the culture and the personalities of the Wall Street traders. Not without some embellishment, Michael Lewis does a great job of communicating the eccentricities and absurdities of the traders - 'the big swinging dicks'. At the very least, 'Liar's Poker' is an entertaining read, at best, an insightful look at what (and who) turns the wheels of our financial institutions."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Much of what Lewis' writes about is true. Particularly as a trainee investment banker you are thrown in and expected to know how financial markets work. I have been a banker for 20 years and can only now confidently say I know half of what I am talking about. Mind you most clients I talk to really don't have a clue - another anecdote that Lewis brings to life. This is a great read for those with insight or interest in the Wall Street set, fast paced and so funny because its true. On top of it all, it offers great insight into an interesting part of financial history, much of which has parallels to the 2007 Credit Crisis - happy reading"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"When I bought the book, I expected it to be a funny narration of the wall street life in 80s. And the first 70-80 pages kept me quite entertained. Well written and funny ! Its the second half of the book which becomes more rhetorical with a dull narration of the events and developments on the Wall street. Perhaps my expectations from the book were unrealistic. I would recommend Monkey Business if someone wants to have a real laugh at the wall street world."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Very fun, easy read. Michael Lewis brings you into wall street with a very easy to read style. You get the feeling that you're really learning about something new and at the same time, it's about one of the largest transfers of U.S $ in history. So if you like business, but don't like to read much, this book works for you!"},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Michael Lewis launched his successful career as an author with his book Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street, which is both a youthful memoir and a journalistic look at the inner workings of Salomon Brothers, a Wall Street firm that grew fat trading bonds and then crashed and burned. The book takes place, roughly, between the years 1984 and 1987, and so I wasn't surprised that the book reminded me of the movie Wall Street - just replace Gordon Gecko with Salomon's head John Gutfreund. At the beginning of the book, Lewis has just been hired, quite unexpectedly, by Salomon, and he takes us through his trajectory at the company, from the cut-throat training process to his days as a bond trader in London. From this vantage point, Lewis was able to watch the company, emboldened by spectacular success in the 1980s, become a symbol of corporate gluttony. Along the way, Lewis profiles many of the company's outsized personalities. He also delves into the intricacies of the bond market in such a way that the arcane becomes pretty readable. The book is also filled with anecdotes about the conspicuous consumption of those times and the raucous, inelegant trading floor, filled with foul-mouthed traders who threw phones and insults and reveled in their gluttony. Lewis' revelation was that the company (and its competitors) made profits at the expense of its customers, and, while the period that Lewis chronicles is interesting in its own right, its impact is somewhat diminished by the many corporate scandals and Wall Street improprieties that have occurred since the book was first published. Against this backdrop, Liar's Poker is no longer an exceptional story that defined an era, it is merely another moment in the cycle of Wall Street corruption and ensuing retribution that continues today."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This was a very good read. It kept me entertained the whole time. I came away from it with a better understanding of the bond market and many of the Wall Street firms.I read the book after having it recommended by a friend who has a friend that made a killing as a bond trader. He was constantly relating stories from his days trading, and said the book was very close to the way it was when he was trading.Even if it is only half true, I realize that they make their money from commisions, not from making my money grow.If you are looking for Wall St. entertainment, I highly recommend it. If you are thinking of investing all your money with brokers, again I highly recommend it so you can rethink that plan."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I picked up this book because it is highly popular among investment bankers, whose fat wallets were enough to take this book seriously. I am not an investment banker and do not intend to be one but I was keen to find out what makes Wall Street special. The book not only satisfied my curiosity but also was pleasantly amusing.The author traces the glorious and gloomy times of Salomon Brothers, a big financial enterprise in which he worked long enough to be able to tell this tale and become a rich man. He explains some financial innovations of Salomon brother's in lay man's terms, which makes this book very readable for all.The author's self-deprecating humor and his vivid analysis of the people he came across in his organization make the account entertaining.Whether or not the author's opinions on technical matters in this book are meritorious-I am not qualified to say. If you are a finance novice and curious to find out about life in that universe, you will find this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Liar's Poker provides the reader with a wonderful account of one of Wall Street's most formiddable houses being left by the wayside. Embodied in the compensation structure at the firm, Lewis' tale describes vast numbers of star employees fleeing Salomon for greener pastures. This book gives an excellent account of how a once mighty firm was driven into the ground by the haplessness of an ineffective board personified by John Gutfreund.Without doubt, this is one fo the finest accounts of what really happens on Wall Street that one will read. It truly dives into the depths of ignorance on the trading floors where no one truly knows what they are doing or where their futures will lead them.I fully recommend this book to anyone interested in the greed and decadence that plagued the 80s culture. For the business buff, this is a combination of humor and sadness of a once great firm that cannot and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"Great book, definitely worth a read, especially if you're in the finance industry.

Michael Lewis weaves a story of what makes our financial system the greatest and the worst in the world.

A good listen for a long trip. Follow it with \\"The Big Short\\" for the next trip, it will broaden your understanding of greed and corruption."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"\\"I could tell when Dash was about to sell a few hundred million dollars of government bonds because his torso would jackknife in his chair so that his chest was almost in his lap and his head went into the sound booth. Just before consummating the trade, he'd plug his empty ear with a finger on his free hand and speak rapidly in a low voice. (One of his customers nicknamed him the Whispering Dash.) Then suddenly he'd pop up, hit the silencer button on his receiver, and shout into the hoot, \\"Hey, New York... New York... you're done on October ninety-two to September ninety-threes, one hundred by one hundred ten... yeah, one hundred million by one hundred ten million.\\" (p. 221)It's that kind of salivation that Lewis generates with his page-turning, compelling descriptions of life as a Wall Street trader in the 1980s. Although published back in 1989, it was insanely prescient and reads like a current analysis (and forecast) of the economic crisis. He describes the origins of Collateralized Debt Obligations--the mortgage instruments behind the 2008 market crash and global economic meltdown, from which recovery has sucked, and only dipped again in 2011. Finally, Lewis has such witty prose, he includes a quote from former governor Edwin Edwards, \\"hell's hottest fires burn for hypocrites.\\" To Lewis's credit, what makes his writing so personal is how confessional and honest he is about his own shortcomings.Like when he describes a hapless newbie on the trading floor. \\"Someone bumped into him and sharply told him to watch his step.\\" But then after sympathizing, Lewis admits falling to what had initially appalled him about the life as a trader: \\"Then I thought a nasty thought. A terrible thought. A truly unforgivable thought. But it showed I was coming along. What a wimp, I thought. He doesn't have a #@%*ing clue.\\" (p. 66) By the end, however, Lewis also admits to the folly of the whole enterprise, however, including what he fell for--by describing his father's philosophy that \\"people who made a lot of money were neat.

Lewis wanders off for three chapters to describe the creation of a home mortgage market and the personalities involved. It is as if Lewis or his editor suddenly decided that the amusing anecdotes of life on Wall Street were fine pulp, but needed to be framed in the context of historical substence in order for the book to be seen as respectable. (Ironically, Lewis's account of the rise to power of Michael Milken is more gripping, perhaps because Lewis was more directly affected by Milken's ambitions.) The evolution of equities as an investment is ignored almost completely, leaving the reader to wonder how, in the span of two years or so, the equities department of Solomon Brothers could go from \\"powerless\\" to surviving the layoffs started days before the crash of '87 to being the reason Solomon Brothers had its worst year in history. The author is inconsistent in his granting of pseudonyms or anonymity, naming a great many employees by name while protecting a chosen few. All in all, Liar's Poker is a quick, sometimes amusing account of Lewis's time at Solomon Brothers, but little more."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"This was a story which had to be told. And it had to be told from the inside. It couldn't have been done any other way, and Michael Lewis does a fairly god job of it.The book essentially tells the story of the rise and fall from wealth (and grace) of Salomon Brothers, and in particular, their mortgage trading group. Those times were clearly heady ones, with the creation and destruction of ridiculous amounts of wealth - from thin air. (It's a more common phenomenon now given the increasing sizes and reaches of the global financial markets, but this probably represented the earliest of the really big cycles.) Lewis takes us deep into that world, giving us a view from a prime seat in the middle of the best action of those times - at Salomon Brothers. In doing so, he is able to create a fairly strong feel for that world, with all its extravagances and idiosyncrasies, while simultaneously providing a fair amount of objective narrative on the internal and external events. His fleshing out of the characters in the book is well done too, which allows the reader a fair level of involvement and empathy with the events. Another strength of the book is that Lewis never gets too technical, and is able to explain fairly complicated markets in terms simple enough for most people to understand.On the flip side, I have to caution you that at the end of the day, Lewis might have been a good banker, but he's not a great writer. The book could have been taken to a different level altogether in the hands of a better writer, and much of the strength of this book is eventually derived from the story. That said, overall, I still think Lewis has done a very credible job, and the book is a very worthwhile read for everybody, not just bankers."},{"Title":"Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street","review":"I you're really into investment banking, or just bond mechanics, don't let the three star rating get you down.

This may not make me more of an authority but hopefully will temper the following comments:Essentially, the problem with translating Italo Svevo's work (if it is a problem) is that it was already been translated once from Austrian German thoughts (Svevo was born Hector Schmitz in Trieste, an Austro-Hungarian port city) into Italian. When you read Senilit&agrave; (or its forerunner, Una vita - which is painful to read) you get an idea of how hypercorrect Svevo's writing was. This was not by accident, but rather through his desire to write perfectly in Italian. While this makes it an exceptionally easy read in Italian, if you translated it too closely, it would read more like Hemingway than anything else. In translations, I like the de Zoete translation (Bantam Modern Classics) because it is a little more fluid.On to the merits of the book, whatever the translation or title, it is a masterpiece of Italian decadentism. The protagonist, Emilio Brentani is the last member of a dying family who must find a way to keep it going. He is getting on in years (which I guess early in the 20th century was mid-30s) and this is his last opportunity to do it. The book traces his battle with Angiolina, who is more element of nature than human, and the story takes him through a vortice vitale (the vortex of his life) into old age.He carries out this battle against the background of caring for his sick sister Amalia and taking lessons from his libertine friend and sculptor Stefano Balli as they walk along behind the dog catcher. The time frame is Carnevale, the period before la Quaresima (Lent). The basic story is of his farewell to meat (so to speak) before the long fast that concludes his life.I think this book makes a great introduction to Svevo and the svevian concept of \\"inept\\" man, and it is more focused than La coscienza di Zeno. I give it the thumbs-up."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"I don't think Svevo is an artist that can be ruined or even significantly damaged by a translation, any more than Tolstoy can be messed up by Constance Garnett - it may not be as true to the quality of their prose, but for the most part I think their rare value is communicated as long as the translation is accurate: and this one is. The comparison to Tolstoy is apt, because I think Svevo is sort of a bridge between that tradition and Proust, where the writing starts drawing a great deal more attention to itself - and the internal workings of consciousness come to the forefront.Svevo strikes the perfect balance between the 19th century's skill at construction complete characters (well, at least the Russians and George Eliot) and the 20th century's desire to focus intensely on processes of thinking, to lay bare the way they function. What Joyce did by actually splitting up and writing Bloom's individual thoughts, Svevo accomplishes with sentences that have the precision and wit of a French aphorist, while retaining a level of compassion that can coexist with his irony.I remember a passage in The Confessions of Zeno (I read the Zoete translation on that one too) where, after a hilarious sequence when Zeno ends up marrying a woman that he has no interest in marrying, he comes to realize - many years later - just how much he's come to love her. Svevo is, I think, the most warm-hearted of great 20th century writers, even though all of his books are supposed to be merciless unmaskings of ineffectual men.As much as I loved The Confessions (or Conscience) of Zeno, this is the more complete work of art. The five linked stories in Zeno didn't really cohere (especially the last chapter), but this book is beautifully paced and constructed, the work of a young man who is already a master - funny and sad and wonderful. A book to treasure.(Incidentally: I like Joyce's title, As a Man Grows Older, but it would have been nice to have Svevo's original title back - which was only abandoned because they didn't think anyone would buy a book called Senility - certainly very few people bought Senilita when it was in Italian. And people were, understandably, confused, since there's no one in this book who is old, or any discussion in it of aging or senility.But the whole book is filled with an atmosphere of last things: it is also about virility, and the lack of it, and the desire to both have and get away from the mental clarity that comes with intelligence. Senility: a great writer knows how to come up with a great title. But this is still a lovely book in a beautiful edition: another wonderful reissue from NYRB.)"},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"But by about a quarter of the way through this novel, I realized that I was mesmerized by it. Emilio's obsession with Angiolina is less long-winded than Proust's obsession with Albertine, but the two stories have much in common. They both are about men involved with women from a slightly lower rung of the social caste system. Both women are inveterate liars and both men are adept at fooling themselves. Both stories employ a mixture of emotion and irony. I thought Beryl deZoerte's translation was serviceable and unobtrusive, which is what a good translation should be. I'm sure that it's missing a lot of the subtleties of Italian, but that's something one has to deal with in any translation. The flow of the words seemed natural and I didn't detect any Britishisms.Svevo is quite adept had economically drawing fully realized characters who have the power to engage the emotions. Emilio (the man in younger middle-age who naively thinks he'll have a painless romantic fling), his spinster sister Amalia (whose silent suffering is almost unbearable), his artist friend Balli who does not see his own foolishness and Angiolina, the object of his obsession are all riveting characters. I quote my favorite passage in the book:\\"She [Angiolina] lied obstinately, though she had not really mastered the art of lying. It was easy to make her contradict herself. But when the contradiction had been proved she would return with unruffled brow to her previous assertion, for in her heart of heats she did not really believe in logic. And it was perhaps this simplicity of hers which redeemed her in Emilio's sight.\\"AS A MAN GROWS OLDER is ultimately unexpectedly powerful. This is another outstanding novel I'd especially recommend to older readers. I think younger people can enjoy the book but it will mean more to the over-40 reader."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"Readers should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as &quot;Emilio's Carnival.&quot; Don't be fooled by the classy NYRB edition; the usually impeccable editors of that series have passed this &quot;vintage&quot; translation into print with nary a warning. Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems. For more information on de Zoete as a translator, see William Weaver's excellent introduction to his wonderful translation of &quot;Zeno's Conscience,&quot; which nicely dispatches de Zoete's &quot;The Confessions of Zeno&quot; to the dustheap of translation history."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"This is the book whose relative failure made Svevo abandon his literary career for a decade or two until a young Irishman named James Joyce happened upon it while tutoring the then old man in English and realized its greatness. It's a wonderful story, the one of the future luminary resuscitating the old, broken spirit and it gave me the impetus to even pick up a Svevo book (that one being The Confessions of Zeno). But what is here? It is a very engaging, very biting, very vivid story, and one that is told with wit, grace and style. But (and there is usually a but) it clearly pales against his later masterpiece. If given a choice, I would definitely recommend Zeno over this one, but this is still a truly excellent read. The story of liasons gone awry, psychological musings and other problems of that then new creature, the Modern Neurotic, are the spine of this story, and they provide sturdy support... even if they get a better treatment in his next book."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"\\"It coursed powerful as ever through his veins and annulled whatever resolution his senile mind had made.\\"I don't profess to fully understand the title \\"Senility,\\" except to say that Svevo reserves a specific meaning for the word beyond normal, everyday usage. The NYRB Zoete translation only uses the word once, and for Emilio Brentani, it refers to a state of mind in which he has just attempted to fool both his best friend and himself into thinking he is no longer infatuated with Angiolina. This \\"senility\\" is then opposed to \\"youth\\" or Brentani's reckless abandonment to his passions. I can only surmise that the title refers to Brentani's fluctuations between love, indifference, and disgust. For those who enjoy this about Svevo's characters, there is enough to go around in \\"As a Man Grows Older.\\"While I have noticed other reviewers claiming this to be Svevo's master achievement, and somehow a more perfect work of art than \\"Zeno's Conscience,\\" I disagree. The first-person narration of Zeno (simultaneously one of the saddest and funniest characters in literature) provides an immediacy and consequence that the other novel lacks; AaMGO mostly depicts character interaction through description, narrated by a rather unremarkable narrator. The prose is not \\"flat,\\" as another reviewer claims, but often quite workmanlike. There are moments when the prose attempts to reach a higher register, such as Amalia's scene in the opera house, and Emilio's closing thoughts of Angiolina, and these are quite lovely, even in translation. However, I felt this novel was missing the unforgiving verisimilitude of ZC, which I sorely missed.Similarly, while the novel does develop its characters, it takes quite a bit of time. I would much rather have spent this time engrossed in their lives, not waiting for them take shape--especially since the novel is so short. ZC doesn't need this buffer, and for the simple reason that Zeno is such an engaging and sympathetic narrator. I believe in both his loving and venomous descriptions of characters (Ada, Guido) in a way that I cannot fully believe the descriptions in AaMGO; while at times one feels they are truly living in Zeno's memories, I can at best only watch Emilio from a short distance, and often then quite disinterestedly.In my opinion, Svevo's greatest strength is his ability to seamlessly interweave humor and tragedy, which is one of the defining characteristics of ZC; while there is plenty of tragedy in AaMGO, I found little of it to be actually funny. There was one excellent comic scene near the end of the novel, which I will not spoil, that made me laugh out loud. I reread it a couple of times just to prolong the effect. Unfortunately, these moments were very few. While this novel is indeed more \\"focused\\" than ZC, my question is, \\"Who cares?\\" It has no excuse not to be. ZC is written in the form of a memoir by a very eccentric individual who makes no attempt to write a focused narrative; AaMGO lacks this fictive lens, and therefore cannot really claim tight structure as one of its recommendations--insofar as this quality supposedly elevates it above Svevo's later work. One could easily argue that Gaskell's \\"North and South\\" is more focused than \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but who would actually argue that it's a better book?Criticisms aside, this is an engaging novel, and worth the read. I think it misses its chance to drive its tragedy home through less-than-optimal characterization, but that there are enough good qualities here to recommend to fans of Svevo. He's a brilliant artist, and one whom more American readers should experience. Four stars."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"As A Man Grows Older (English title given by James Joyce; the Italian is Senilita) was the second of only four novels written by the Hector Schmitz, the Italian businessman known to the world now as the Italian writer Italo Svevo. He wrote this and his first book, A Life, in his thirties to little acclaim. But when Schmitz began taking English lessons from Joyce in 1907, he dared give the 25 year-old budding author the novels to read. Joyce loved them and became a life-long admirer. And in 1923, Joyce was instrumental in getting Svevo best known work, Zeno's Conscience, published. It is because of this that we can now read Svevo's great work.As A Man Grows Older is the story of Emilio Brentani, a thirtyish business man who is obsessed with a young woman named Angiolina. We follow Emilio's unstable thoughts and feelings as he tries to understand and control his love for her. Anyone's who's been in love, especially of the unrequited variety, will recognize most of what goes on in his mind. Emilio is happy when he is with Angiolina, but when he is not, he is often pre-occupied with seeing her again, or jealous from rumors he's heard about her with other men. And over time, we begin to understand that Angiolina is in fact a liar and unworthy of Emilio's trust. But, even when it should also be clear to Emilio, he still finds new ways of rationalizing her behavior. He fluctuates between wanting to free himself of this painful love, but then tries to manipulate her into bed or devise some stratagem to see her again. He even pulls the old trick of leaving her in hopes of making her see how much she loves him, only to find himself going back with her. She sleeps with him now, so perhaps his tactics have worked. But the reader will know from very early on in this book that their relationship is an accident waiting to happen.We also hear and see from Stefano Balli, Emilio's sculptor friend who is successful with women. As such, he counsels Emilio about how to handle Angiolina. But when they go on a double date, Angiolina flirts with Balli, adding to Emilio's anxiety in a way that never truly heals, and almost comes between the friends. The other main character is Amalia, Emilio's sister and roomate. She is unbearably lonely and in love with Balli. Emilio's neglect of Amalia for his obsession of Angiolina leads to the critical event of the book, and will leave most readers heartbroken.Svevo interest in psychoanalysis pervades all his work. Here he is almost clinical in his rendering of Emilio's thoughts. Yet we care about him, despite his foolishness. There is no plot, yet we are pulled forward with desire to see where events and Emilio will turn next. As such, Svevo's work fits in a nice spot between the realists and the modernists in its ability to teach and entertain.As A Man Grows Older is considered by some to be a better and more complete work of art than his episodic masterpiece. I agree with that assessment. I felt more satisfied when I put this book down than when I finished Zeno. This novel is wonderful work of art, filled with every emotion imaginable. When we read this, we will remember what it's like to love, to be anxious about love, and to lose love."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"Emilio, a retiring, cautious insurance clerk with some literary pretensions, decides he needs to broaden the scope of his life. He figures he knows all about love and affairs because he's read a lot. He decides his \\"amour\\" shall be the blonde, luscious Angiolina, full of life. He launches on his affair, ignoring the disapproval of his friend, Stefano. Emilio lives alone with his mousy sister, Amalia. A man may grow older, but he doesn't often grow wiser. Svevo's novel, written in 1898, definitely bears out this observation. Emilio's love connection goes from bad to worse, fouled up not only by the unfaithful, sluttish behavior of his paramour, but by his own immaturity, lack of worldly experience, and psychological hangups. His casual love affair balloons into an obsession. Meanwhile, sister Amalia falls hopelessly in love with Stefano, who hardly even notices her. Things do not end well.AS A MAN GROWS OLDER, a novel I first read in Southeast Asia 26 years ago and recently read again, may not have a thrilling plot line. It is overwhelmingly a psychological study of lovers and as that, a brilliant piece of writing which has held its power for over a hundred years. The evocations of Trieste, of the society that surrounded the love story is equally excellent. Emilio's plan to be more or less a casual playboy comes to grief as he is consumed by love and jealousy. It takes him a long time to get Angiolina into bed, which in turn opens up a new page for doubts, regrets, unfulfilled vows, and momentary steadfastness, always undermined by both desire and hatred. The double nature of love affairs---bringing out both passion and anger, love combined with hesitation, desire for approval, wild swings of emotion and inability to leave---has never been better described. At the same time, the purely imaginary love of Amalia for Stefano adds a further dimension to this veritable catalogue of realistic romance. Italo Svevo, who died in a car crash back in 1928, certainly left behind a classic with this novel. It does not seem to be widely read, which is a shame. A gem for anyone interested in a novel of the kind I've described."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"This review complements a review I posted on the other available translation of this work, published by Yale University Press:Italo Svevo's novel Senilita is one of the great achievements in the bourgeoning era of early Modernism. It has rightly been credited as a forerunner and influence on James Joyce, and any fan of Flaubert, Chekhov, Proust, or Fontane (as well as less celebrated figures such as the Yiddish writer Dovid Bergelson or the Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis) will find much that is familiar, edifying, and entertaining in this intimate and masterfully observed novel. It is a book full of irony and empathy, artful paradox and plain-spoken truth; it stands half-way between romantic decadence and modernist realism, poised on the cusp of the 19th and the 20th centuries.It is also representative of the most interesting trends in High Modernism precisely because of the self-consciousness of its atttiude toward narrative and language. Svevo, as is well-known from any synopsis of his career, was an Italian Jew brought up primarily in a German-speaking milieu. He is therefore demonstrably and purposefully uncomfortable in his use of Italian (just as Kafka in Czech-speaking Prague is deliberately not quite at home with German, or many post-colonial authors from Africa or India are fluent writers of English but nonetheless not native speakers of the language--this disparity is by definition and design a feature of their writing). And although there is no explicit reference to Jews or Judaism anywhere in this novel, it is not difficult to extrapolate his anamolous presence as a Jew in Catholic Italy as a motivation for his estranged, alienated, detatched mode of storytelling and social observation.All of these factors account both for what's interesting about this novel, and what's difficult about trying to translate it--starting with the title, which nobody seems to understand or care for. There are two available translations in English: this one, and the one published by Yale University Press as Emilio's Carnival. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE buy and read this version!!!!!This is a reprint of the original English translation first published in 1932. It is well produced and idiomatic; it captures the strange and indelible spirit of the original, without compromising its fidelity to the letter of the text. It also benefits from an unusually helpful and insightful introduction (in conspicuous contrast again to the Yale UP version) that is so well-observed and persuasive that I would recommend readers to do as I did and save it until after completing the novel itself.Best of all, this is the less expensive of the two versions! Case closed--who could ask for anything more?! Only that more people read, think, and talk about Italo Svevo, and that more people purchase and read this version of his first great novel."},{"Title":"As a man grows older","review":"Very good about passion in a Proustian way.

Imagine a mechanical drawing, say, an exploded diagram of a pencil sharpener.. why not call it a work of art? Glorious detail, exact descriptions, complete and entire...

No. Could she tell a recreational liar from an honest confidante? Yes. In fact, Mead treats all of her research subjects with some skepticism and makes her own attempt to reconcile the extreme traditional prohibitions on extramarital sex, with the fact that it was indeed occurring, and frequently at that.As was typical of the times, however, she did not appear to see the Samoans in the proper light of a fully developed culture, but rather in the manner of a Tarzan novel.Is this offensive? Yes. Does it reveal a good deal of insular cultural ignorance? Yes. Does that mean that all parties interested in the history of anthropology, should avoid the book? No."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Poorly researched book, which is completely wrong on the facts of Samoan adolescent behavior, as subsequent scholars have discovered.

Clearly, she was writing as the product of her time-- and in fact noted in the preface to the 1952 edition that this kind of book would provide more evidence about the time and place the author was from than about the culture being studied.It is certainly a pleasurable book to read. She paints a picture of an approach to childhood that sets ours off in a not-too-flattering light-- it successfully questions the values of her own culture regardless of how well it captures Samoan culture. I can understand why people from Samoa might find that &quot;regardless&quot; offensive, but I find it (again) a rather hopeless thing to try and judge. I do not find this book less valuable because I question its truth-- I do not know any scholarly book from the 1920s whose veracity would not be tested-- and at this point in time I think everyone who reads it is not accepting it as an authoritative view.File it under history of our cultural thought or under Utopian philosophy if you'd rather not file it under anthropology-- but I'd still recommend that you read it and file it somewhere."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Famous books in any academic discipline draw a lot of attention (thus making them famous). When negative, most such attention arises from personal jealously about the success of others, and given that Mead is a woman, she draws additional scorn from male academics (and their female supplicants). As a result, many myths develop and circulate around academic departments, and even worse, people rely on textbook (mis)representations in place of their own reading. I encourage anyone with serious interest in traditional Samoa and/or anthropology to read this book for themselves, consider Mead's evidence and analysis, and develop your own assessment. Clearly, most of the reviewers here have not read the book.

Both methodology and (inevitably) conclusions have been shown to be suspect. For instance: some of Mead's subjects survived long enough into old age to be questioned by Freeman, whereupon they stated that they lied to Mead regarding their past behavior. With what certainty can it be presumed that they are telling the truth now?But I shan't go on. Suffice it to say that it is of little use to base a critique of one book (Mead's) based upon another of equally unsound and uncertain scholarship (Freeman's). It is simply dishonest of the writer of that review to attempt to discredit Mead by quoting Freeman, while (conveniently) omitting to mention that Freeman's work is not accepted either.Without being able to either substantiate Mead or debunk her, her book remains fascinating for its own sake, more than for its admittedly tenuous conclusions, and is interesting not least for the insight that it gives into the nature of its author."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Freeman's nonsense aside, which seems to be taken as gospel by one or two reviewers below (apparently, Mead's Samoa is ladden with cultural intentions, but Freeman's work is not with his sociobiological intentions), this is a good book.

For shame that he has any followers at all.Mead is not my favorite author: her writing is discontinous, but this book is a good work. Seeing as how many people haven't even realized just how conservative this book is, they believe that the author has had a clear social agenda. The agenda is there folks, but it is not the one you think.Mead's Samoa is probably more correct than Freeman's for a variety of reasons, but to go into various details would require several books.For those with access to JSTOR, I would strongly urge to look at some critical reviews of Mead and Freeman. For those that have access to HRAF, I would suggest looking at short ethnographies of the area. Now, which sounds more accurate? Neither will be completely, but Freeman's work is the REAL emperor without cloths, and its followers should take a closer look at the world ethnographies before they advance either Freeman, or downright simplistic (and insulting) sociobiological nonsense that was already buried some 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Dr. Meade truly was one of the most well-known American Anthropologists in the 20th Century.

Of course I'm not a professional anthropologist, I just share a passion for it. But, for the followers of Freeman, I have a few things to say. For one, he wrote his critique AFTER her death, in my opinion this is pure cowardice. Another thing, he claims that the Samoan women Mead interviewed had lied to her. This is probably because the women she interviewed were mothers and grandmothers, not to mention born again Christians. And they probably weren't going to admit that they engaged in casual sex to a middle aged white man. Just my take on this whole thing."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"I can't see what is so bad about this book.

I also so many similarities to Malinowski's Trobriand work which I find intriguing.Yes, I am clueless. I enjoyed this book and used it, among other works, for research. I can't imagine why it would offend anyone. Her limitations made it impossible for this to be seen as an authoritative work, of course, but nobody is an authority, especially in the anthropological community, since culture is always in a constant state of evolution.

She finds it needful to 'shout' that advice because during her 1971 brief visit to Samoa, 'young critics even asked me when am I going to revise this book and look unbelieving and angry when I say that to revise it is impossible'.This is a reference to an abrasive session with students who told her that her description of fa'aSamoa (Samoan custom) was false and insulting. They were miffed by her styling Samoans 'primitives' and her pronouncement that since anthropologists enjoy an 'immense superiority', they can 'master the fundamental structure' [of primitive society] . . . 'in a few months' (p. 8). In keeping with this arrogance, Samoans attending university were told by their instructors that their experience of fa'aSamoa was not valid evidence against Mead's scientific study. And, as we've just seen, Mead refused to revise her book even when she knew that it was mistaken in many particulars.For Samoans this patronizing manner was the familiar voice of the papalagi (the colonial power). Mead's hosts on her field trip, aware that she enjoyed the protection of the Pacific Fleet admiral and boss of Western Samoa, went to great lengths to provide reliable information. When they learned of what they call her luma fai tele ('shameless defamaton'), they could not comprehend how she could have betrayed their hospitality. They were also aggrieved that she deceived them about her marital status. For she accepted the title taupou (ceremonial virgin) although as a married woman she was ineligible. Then she disgraced the title by carrying on with Aviata, a young man regarded as a rake.While Samoans long knew the mendacity of this book, its correction in academic circles commenced only with the 1983 publication of Derek Freeman's Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth (Harvard University Press). That event shook anthropology to its boots. Such was Mead's prestige that the popular mind identified her with anthropology. If her credibility was seriously questioned in respect to the most widely believed anthropological study ever published, the credibility of the profession was at risk. That is why Freeman was attacked with great vehemence, even by those who agreed with his critique.Freeman's book initiated a reappraisal of Coming of Age in Samoa. Martin Orans and Freeman have recently published studies of her Samoa investigations based on her field notes. They confirm that Mead's account of Samoan sexual moeurs is a travesty. But they go beyond that. Mead recorded the accounts given by her informants, but by ignoring key facts, twisting others, and inventing still others, she contrived to represent Samoa as a free love duck pond. She also misrepresented the research she carried out. She was funded to conduct a study of adolescent girls; and she states that she spent 'six months accumulating an intimate and detailed knowledge of all adolescent girls in the community'. Her field notes tell otherwise. She devoted her time to assembling ethnography; the funded study never got off the ground. She states that she conducted 'all' her interviews with these girls in the Samoan language ('I spoke their language and ate their food'). Orans found however that her information on adolescent girls came from 'English-speaking informants using English to communicate'. He notes that 'no conversations in Samoan are recorded in any of the field materials'. This is consistent with Freeman's finding that the study of adolescent girls was not conducted at all.Mead built her picture of free love by tossing off unsupported one-liners. The 'inept lover is a laughing stock'. There are 'no neurotic pictures, no frigidity' in Samoa. Masturbation 'is a universal habit'. Homosexual activity is 'very prevalent' and is regarded as 'simply play'. '[Samoan] girls' minds were perplexed by no conflicts . . . [to have as] many lovers as possible and then to marry . . . these were uniform and satisfying ambitions'. The field materials do not show that Mead collected any evidence whatever about masturbation, homosexuality, or incidence of neuroticism and frigidity. She had but one informant about intimate sexual practices--an eighteen year old school teacher. In 1981 that person told Freeman that he had an affair with Margaret. Thus Samoa's alleged free love amounts to no more than a loose wife's gullibility to the pillow talk of her teenage lover. Such is the 'science' that made this book famous.Research on Mead's field notes clarifies a feature of this book that has puzzled many readers. It is the drastic and repeated inconsistency between Mead's descriptions of Samoan vigilance of virginity and punishments of straying girls, and the attribution of a casual attitude toward sexuality. What we now can see is that Mead patched her free love pillow talk into descriptions given to her by her adult informants.How is that anthropologists for so long were taken in by Mead's yellow anthropology? One part of the answer is that many weren't taken in. The controversy brought to light numerous statements to this effect. Thus Weston LaBarre wrote: &quot;When I was a graduate student in anthropology at Yale in the late '30's, Mead's Sex and Temperament came out. Puzzled that even a big island like New Guinea should have had three tribes waiting to be discovered to prove her point about the non-biological nature of gender, I went to Edward Sapir with my puzzlement. He said laconically, 'She's a pathological liar'. I was startled as much by what he said, as by the fact that an eminent anthropologist and chairman of a department should say this to a mere graduate student. But over the years, I have come to believe that this is literally the case.&quot; The next round in the evaluation of Mead's anthropology, we may hope, will collect and critically assess this largely unpublished expert opinion.Hiram Caton, Editor, The Samoa Reader: Anthropologists Take Stock. University Press of America, 1990."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"A few reviewers have referenced the Mead / Freeman controversy. I'd like to explain this controversy and provide some historical context for readers unfamiliar with the book.Coming of Age in Samoa is Margaret Mead's first publication. It launched a career that made Mead one of the most famous anthropologists in American history. I find this book interesting in two ways: historically and stylistically.Coming of Age in Samoa is historically interesting in that it represents one culmination of the conflict between cultural and biological anthropology. Mead was a student of anthropologist Franz Boas, a famous advocate of \\"nurture\\" over \\"nature.\\" Mead borrowed and expanded Boas' ideas, and many cultural anthropologists still cite her work as evidence that a person's cultural upbringing--not his genetic makeup--accounts for most of his personal development.Anthropologists that valued \\"nature\\" over \\"nurture\\" did not dig. Mead's claims were big, bold, and well-received.But Boas' opponents (or his opponents' students and their students' students) were able to breath easy once Derek Freeman, an Australian anthropologist, published a book refuting Mead's findings. Freeman accused Mead of conducting sloppy fieldwork, approaching her subject with predetermined conclusions, and refusing to correct her work after its publication. In response, Mead supporters accused Freeman of attacking Mead personally rather than professionally. While they disagreed about the quality of Freeman's own fieldwork, these critics all thought that he could have written his critique with more tact and civility.Coming of Age in Samoa is stylistically interesting in that it targets a general audience. Some sections seem to come from a travelogue, others from a novella. Very little sounds like the anthropological writing of Boas or other American anthropologists that preceded Mead. Mead's writing has been called unscientific, revolutionary, appropriate, novelistic, and refreshing. Because of its accessibility, it has introduced several generations of undergraduates to anthropology.With that clarification, I'd like to offer my opinion of how Coming of Age reads in 2005.While the book is historically and stylistically relevant, I don't find Mead's prose that exciting. For an introduction to the field, I'd start somewhere else entirely--maybe Malinowski's Argonauts of the Western Pacific, which offers a thorough representation of a culture and an ethnographer's experience with that culture. Mead's book offers clear answers to clear questions, but I don't understand why new students should seek clarity. Something like Malinowski's diary--the strange and honest account of a witness--is more valuable. Mead's book flows, but plenty of books flow. I'd start with vague and rich anthropological writing, the sort that emerges from years research among radically different people. Even if it is a little more difficult, that sort of writing will introduce you to some really meaty and unfamiliar concerns."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"I was the Medical Director of American Samoa a few years after Mead's sixmonth in Ta'u, a village in the Manu'a group and spent over two years there. On my trips to Manu'a I found and talked to Chief Tufele and those Mead worked with. With two years study of Hawaiian I was able to converse with them quite easily. Mead studied Samoan for only six weeks in Pago Pago.There are many errors and self-projections in the work of a 23-year old girl fresh out of college on her first field trip, but not enough to incurFreeman's wrath. About half of his criticisms are not true."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Coming of Age in Samoa is a pleasantly-written South Sea fantasy, heavy with the author's social agenda upon it. If you buy the agenda, apparently you can hardly help like the book. (See reviews below.) Even if I bought the agenda (and it is hard for me to look at American society and say the sexuality Mead encouraged has made people entirely free of guilt or conflict), I would still choke on her dishonesty. But as they say in the anthro business, different strokes for different folks.Some of the defenses of this book below are hilarious. \\"Sure, it's largely untrue. But it reads well!\\" (And here I thought it was supposed to be science.) \\"It stimulated my thinking about culture! Mead really did interview thirty live Samoans! (In some language or other.) \\"Besides, what scholarship from that era would not sound like fiction today?\\" (Uh, honest scholarship? Do you want a book list?)The interesting thing about this book, to me, is the way it illustrates human self-deception, in particular the hubris of those who claim to speak for \\"Science.\\" Being interested in such curiosities, for me personally the book was worth buying. Mead's sexual fantasies are not the only instance in the 20th Century in which anthropologists sought to throw out \\"religious dogma\\" in favor of \\"scientific\\" new theories of their own cultivation. As pleasant as an idyllic trip to the islands may be, those for whom such theories hold charm should remember that honest scholarship and imagination are two different things, that vacations in Fantasy Island usually cost something, and that the one who takes the vacation is not always the person who pays the bill."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"Freeman's harsh book criticizing Margaret Mead was itself ultimately declared by the American Anthropological Society to be \\"unprofessional\\" and simply not scholarly.

Mead has an ability to present a scientific study in poetic form drawing the reader in while communicating social observations.From a psychological perspectives there are several shortcomings. Mead did a revolutionary work; it was however somewhat incomplete and romanticized to fit Mead's personal predispositions. While stomach or back pain were indicated, No reasons for the high percentage of possible psychosomatic pain were not addressed. In addition, after only 5 months in Samoa, the level of intimacy required for disclosure of familial sexual encounters, both heterosexual and homosexual, is not often attained in such a short amount of time inside the familial clan setting."},{"Title":"Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization","review":"In the unpaginated \`Preface [to the] 1973 Edition', Margaret Mead stresses that her description of Samoan moeurs should be read as applying to conditions at the time of her research.

By eschewing professional models, Bessange manages to capture from his subjects an innocence, a spontaneity and a vulnerability rarely seen. And yet there is an overwhelming sense of masculinity and maleness often missing in the work of others. These models seem to exude an unconscious sexuality. These are the images not of buffed circuit boys, but the boy next door. Not of gym bodies, but the bodies of natural athletes. And not the flawless faces of magazine models, but the face with the crooked smile that is ultimately far more sensuous. In short, these are the men we see and are visually attracted to everyday - walking down the street, sitting at the table across from ours at a cafe or playing soccer in the park.

The photography of Marc Bessange is certainly no exception to this rule. I discovered Bessange's work through his website several years ago. Since then, I have witnessed his photography blossom and mature in a few short years. With the publication of Edition Euros 12: Marc Bessange, his photography becomes available to a vast international audience. In this photobook Bessange has gathered some of the finest examples of the male form. The models exude a heightened degree of masculinity that is harmoniously sublime and erotic. The photos displayed in black &amp; white, are a collection of snapshots and sensual poses. Each image highlights the muscularity, sensuousness, and artistry inherent in the male figure. The lighting, tone, and framing in each picture forms a unique oneness for each of the models depicted. Bessange's style is highly individualistic, neither vulgar nor pornographic. With the release of this book Marc Bessange has achieved the stature of previous &quot;Edition Euros&quot; luminaries such as Bel Ami, Klaus Gerhart, and Jose Messana. Readers captivated by the photos exhibited in Edition Euros 12: Marc Bessange may also want to purchase the selected postcard images presented in the Marc Bessange Postcard Book, also published by Bruno Gmunder (Germany)."},{"Title":"Marc Bessange (Euros) (No.12)","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews that it recieved onAmazon.The models are very handsome, in a street tough sort of way.Which can be quite appealing.

Now, because of this woman's book, we are supposed to believe that, not only was the Black Dahlia a promiscous whore, but that her father was also Beth Short's baby's father? There was no evidence mentioned in the autopsy report of her having recently been pregnant. I find Janice Knowlton's book very graphic, and maybe she did see her father murder someone, but she hasn't proved to me that the person he murdered was Beth Short."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Having just read this book, I, too, had to put it down from time to time, but that was because of the astronomical use of cliches! Did neither Ms. Knowlton nor Mr. Newton have enough writing talent to use their own words? Also, we have photographic evidence of Janice spending the summers from 1948-1950 on an island in Casco Bay, Maine. There is no evidence cited throughout the book, and the tales woven about what Georgie did with Beth's body are so fantastic they are hard to believe. Even a lot of the family information she has is in error, aside from using aliases. Janice, and her book, are simply unbelievable."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I am an avid reader of true crime books, but this book reminded me too much of another book dealing with shocking claims-- Lauren Stratford's \\" Satan's Underground\\"-- and that book was revealed to be full of lies. I do not trust this \\" recovered memory\\" syndrome as to accuracy to the truth and while I do not know of this person other than what was described in the book, certain claims seem conviently no longer verifiable while some other claims, such as her alleged births of some bablies , can be revealed even with the hysterectomy ( the pelvic bone). While I have no doubt that severe sexual and physical abuse does happen, the authors seem to say trust us, we are telling the truth, without providing legit corroborative evidence. The descriptions of some acts are suspiciously too vivid, as is her claim she remembers being raped while still an infant. The claim of the LAPD being corrupt so they will not reveal the files sounds like an excuse to avoid possible information that may contradict the claims. It is POSSIBLE she is telling SOME Of the truth, but I would need more actual proof that validates her claims before I actually believe her. It just doesn't fit."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"When I first read DADDY, I didn't want to believe that someone could ever be forced to endure such horrific abuse, especially at the hands of her own father. This book is the most graphic, nauseating thing I have ever read, but even more disturbing than the gory details (and there are a lot of them), is the fact that 90% of the material is fictional. The percentage may even be higher, though why Ms. Knowlton would want to fabricate her own childhood experiences is a matter upon which we can only speculate. Most disgusting of all is the shameless and complete character assassination of Beth Short herself. The reader is led to believe that she was somehow to blame for her own rape and murder. A physical abnormality (underdeveloped, childlike sex organs) made it impossible for her to have a normal sexual relationship, yet she has been portrayed as a prostitute and mother of an aborted child in DADDY. At best, it is nearly impossible at times to tell the difference between fact and fiction. I got the impression that the book was written more to entertain and shock rather than inform.Unless you have a passion for visceral detail, I would advise you to pass on this gorefest and search elsewhere for information on the Dahlia and the investigation that followed her murder."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This book is not worth reading. I rarely make a statement such as that, as I am a rabid fan of the printed page, but this book is simply awful. I also agree that it has no place in the non-fiction section.

As I read more and more I was disappointed to see that it was pretty much 100% speculation. I found myself actually rolling my eyes at times.I also found the book to be rather crude and vulgar. Like in one scene where \\"Daddy\\" asks her if she likes ... while raping her. Is this really necessary? It also tried way too hard to convince it's readers of it's validity, almost demanding, which made me suspicious.Since reading this book, I have been reading a little more into the actual murder case on the Web and have noticed that almost everywhere I have looked (including these reviews), Janice Knowlton has been there and has put in her two cents. Is she a survivor healing by telling her story or a media hungry opportunist? Too bad \\"Daddy\\" didn't kill someone more famous."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Spurious, opportunistic, vulgar and poorly written, this book is one of the poorest purposes to which paper has ever been put. The reasoning is idiotic, the ties to fact fragile to non-existent and the obvious need of the author to attract attention -- any attention at any cost -- make this a nausating read. The Black Dahlia case, a classic unsolved murder which has gripped imaginations for over 50 years, has generated any number of fabulous speculations, but none so ill-conceived as this piece of pure trash. Spare yourself."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Even though \\"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer\\" is a good read the reader will have the tendency of getting lost about what the book is all about. The author goes into great detail describing the family ties of Janice Knowlton. After an exhaustive description of the family members, the author then describes, again, comprehensively the psychological misgivings of Janice Knowlton. This would have been not only interesting and important information if the author had not extensively described both subjects. The extensive exhaustive family descriptions and psychological misgivings make the reader feel as if he or she was reading a Professional Manual in the study of Genealogy and Psychology.However, after getting out of that forest of Professional Manuals, the reader is able to get back in to what the story is all about. It is interesting and sad at the same time the Los Angeles police department at the time botched the investigation in such a way that not even the evidence provided by Janice Knowlton closed the case.The reader is led to believe someone or something made sure the case would never be solved. The Los Angeles police refused to make the Black Dahlia file open to the public for scrutiny and perhaps find out why the case has never been solved despite the extensive and credible evidence provided by Janice Knowlton.The story has various graphic and gut-wrenching parts which makes one think why didn't someone stopped the grotesque, devilish, unbelievable, and animalistic actions against human beings by Janice Knowlton's father. The reader will not be able fathom how a human being is able to perform such atrocious devilish acts.I recommend the book with the reservation that children and adolescents do not have access to it."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Although the book was fascinating and quite interesting, I found it very hard to believe. The book talks about one of the most horrendous, unsolved murders of the 20th century with graphic detail but I find it hard to believe that if indeed the author's father was the killer of Elizabeth Short, wouldn't it have made headlines that the killer had &quot;finally&quot; been identified? For that reason alone, I found the book to be a good piece of fiction, but hardly anything more."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This woman's story is completely fascinating.I personally believe that Janice Knowlton is suffering from False Memory. I do believe, however, that she suffered abuse, but I do not believe that the Black Dahlia connection is real. It's not that I think she is lying, I just think her fractured psyche is attempting to make sense of the abuse she suffered and is linking it to something that was prominent in the news during that time.Nevertheless, if you're into the whole Black Dahlia thing (and I am so I pretty much read/watch everything related to it,) or you're an avid reader of True Crime books, it's a must read. But I will warn avid followers of the Elizabeth Short case - this book is extremely defamatory toward her with absolutely nothing to coroborate anything that's put forth. I was pretty miffed throughout reading a lot of the Dahlia-related section of the book. I've read a lot of books about the Black Dahlia case and about Hollywood / movies / Hollywood murder in general, but I have never heard that Marilyn Monroe was a common whore who had a lesbian affair with Elizabeth Short. I must have missed that memo!It is written in a sensationalist style and the writer (Michael Newton) seems to revel in the more horrible aspects of this woman's (real or imagined) memories. The descriptions of the physical and sexual abuse and various homicides is extremely graphic.Whether she really did witness Elizabeth Short's murder or not, his book is an incredible read and a fascinating journey into the human psyche.I'm torn on what star-rating to give this, so I'm going to opt for right in the middle."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This book is not a book I would suggest to a reader who is squeamish. It has many unnecissary scenes of explicit sexual abuse and mutilation. Janice shows very good evidence in making her sexual, physical, and vocal abuse as a child believable. This book seems more of a auto biography rather than an allegation of the murder of the Black Dahlia. Janice Knowlton and Micheal Newton put much more emphasis on the horrific experiences she is put through instead of specifically addressing the issue at hand. I believe that one of the worst downfalls to this book is the very detailed accounts of what Janice experiences,that in some cases did not pertain to the Black Dahlia case.Because of these things I can understand where some speculation would be brought up. I do not doubt at all the account of any abuse that occured in the Knowlton house. Many people doubt her accounts because of the fact that they are repressed memories. She has many points in the book that support these memories though, such as Janice have authorities dig up a skeleton of a family dog that had been shot and buried by George during one of his spells of rage. Overall, this book is a pretty good book but I must say is is definately a gruesome account of her life."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I too had suppressed childhood memories, although not anything to compare with Janice Knowlton's. However I found myself breaking out in a cold sweat reading some of the all to familiar passages from that book that brought back some very scary memories for me. She knows what that kind of fear is like. I have no opinion on who really killed the Black Dahlia. But I am convinced the author has some background. I can't believe anyone could make some of this stuff up."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I've just read the other reviews and was horribly shocked.Anyone can see that this book was very hard to write for Janice Knowlton, and really people what &quot;evidence&quot; do you expect to find? This murderer took place in 1947! I salute Janice Knowlton for her courage to write this book,and furthermore thank her for it. As far as I'm concerned the murder of Elizabeth Short is solved."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I can't believe the negative reviews of this book. I read it a few years ago and it has haunted me ever since. (I believe I wrote a positive, earlier review.) The recent movie about the subject is based on James Ellroy's novel, which I did not enjoy anywhere near as much as this truly amazing horror tale. I completely believed the author; it was a great story; it was a terrifying, disturbing story, and it all made (and still makes) sense to me. I found it a great read - one of the best \\"true crime\\" books available, and I support Janice Knowlton's coming forward with an incredibly tragic story. Yes, it all adds up, including the fact that her father and Elizabeth Short came from Medford; and I was in agreement that it's possible her father was the Boston Strangler, too, since he was living in Medford and commuting to the neighborhood where the stranglings took place...at the time that they did. Everyone from Boston knows Albert DeSalvo was probably not the Strangler. I can't imagine why this story is not taken more seriously. It could be that people need the killer to be a physician or person from the Hollywood community....not a \\"common\\" serial killer no one's ever heard much about. I highly recommend this book, and I just wanted Ms. Knowlton to know that I still think about her and wish her all the best...she deserves it."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I completely believe in this book.

I don't know why people are so adamantly against her story, and certainlynot why they mock her and denegrate her. I completely support her. I have worked with the police myself on murder investigations and I think she has supported her account admirably.She is to be applauded, not taken to task, for reporting whatmust have been a horrific, traumatic life and grisly experiences.

Clearly there are some disturbed individuals involved in the production of this book. I kept getting the distinct feeling that these authors enjoyed writing those torture and mutilation scenes just a little bit too much. I tried to sell my copy at a yard sale for a dime.

I feel like I wasted my time and money. The book was a lousy, jumbled read. The ideas were haphazardly thrown together to outline a poorly scripted idea (the Dahlia) surrounding the memories of surviving sex-abuse victim. While I have no doubt that Ms. Knowlton endured the abuse described within, it lended little to the story of the Black Dahlia. Both stories leave too many unanswered questions for the reader. The Dahlia tale is confused and befuddled amid a graphic and disturbing tale of abuse. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This book really doesn't deserve any stars at all. It shouldn't be listed as non-fiction because everything in it is unbelievable and must fall under the category of fiction. Ms. Knowlton does not offer one shred of proof for any of her accusations. It is all totally unsubstansiated and seems to be the product of a very sick mind. I would not recommend this book to anyone, it is sick and violent, completely disgusting. One of the most repulsive and unsettling ideas is the &quot;blame the victim&quot; slant. It was bad enough that Elizabeth Short was murdered in such a horrific way but almost worse is the character assassination and the idea that she deserved to die that way."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"A BUNCH OF BALONEY.

She presented nothing factual to support her claims, just a lot of speculation and circumstantial information. After she was told that Westminster Police had no jurisdiction over an LAPD case, she suddenly &quot;remembered&quot; a second killing and victim burial in Westminster to get police to dig up the vacant lot of her former residence. She then showed up, dressed in all black, with the media, putting on a very dramatic display. I always felt her only intent was to gain attention by writing a book. The police (LAPD &amp; Westminster) did a lot more than they should have to investigate her questionable claims. I couldn't believe this book was in the non-fiction section of the book store. Completely contradictory to all other material relating to this case."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"If you've read any of Michael Newton's other books, you know what to expect from this one. As a writer, Newton has an agenda. He's going to twist facts and even write fiction to make what should be news stories fit into his model of the world. The publisher was sued for unsubstantiated comments he made in the first edition of this particular book. The writing is amaturish and the point of view so heavy handed you have to wonder who he's trying to convince, the reader or himself. In this instance Newton takes a deluded woman and exploits her delusion. After \\"Raising Hell,\\" and \\"Hunting Humans Parts I, and II\\" it comes as no surprise. Newton is a writer who never lets the facts stand in the way of $5.99."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Ms. Knowltons book is about as challenging as (and believeable) as the &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; books.

Unlikely."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Michael Newton wrote the book, 'Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer,' but more than that, Newton investigated and confirmed that what I remembered after 40 years of psychogenic amnesia, is true. Therefore, as the subject and contributor to the book, I feel qualified to review it. This is the only true account of the murder and coverup, and since its release in 1995, there has been additional corroboration from two law enforcement officers who did not wish to put themselves at risk by giving their names. We have the names; and a tape recording of deputy, Donald Gibson, (now deceased), saying he saw my father, George Knowlton's name in the Dahlia file of the L.A. Sheriff's Dept. in 1949 and was told to keep is mouth shut! Most of us know the term, 'the blue wall of silence,' which permits the LAPD to keep secret the fact that they let my father go. (Look at the scandal now emerging about the LAPD's Rampart Division.) Newton wrote accurately, as thoroughly as the book length and legal restrictions would allow, and I am grateful to Simon &amp; Schuster's Pocket Books Division for allowing this survivor to heal further by publishing her story. Which is not just my story, but that of others who may not have survived to tell. Thank you. Janice Knowlton, only witness to the murder of Elizabeth Short."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I have read the book based on the subject matter, the Black Dahlia murder, which I am very interested in since it was never solved. Although I do believe that Ms. Knowlton was defintely abused by her father, there is no proof that he has committed the Black Dahlia murder or any other. There is no direct evidence that would convince me that has committed the murders that are mentioned in the book. I do feel for Ms. Knowlton and her suffering, however, many of the things that she mentions about Beth Short (the Black Dahlia), do not meet the facts that are known about her. For example, Ms. Knowlton mentions that &quot;Aunt Betty&quot; had sex with her father (George Knowlton)and was a well known prostitute. Beth Short had a deformed sex organ that did not enable her to have intercourse with men. This was a fact that was kept out of the news papers in order to identify the true killer if they ever confessed. the picture that Ms. Knowlton paints of Beth Short is as sadistic babysitter and a tramp, as if to say in indirect words, that the Black Dahlia put herself in a position that caused her death and suffering. The abuse is too well described and I had to put the book down many a time because of its disturbing content. I am sorry to say that this book is not one that I would recommend to people who never heard of the murder of the Black Dahlia. It is full of rumors that could have been overheard over time and facts about the murder that could have been taken out of back issues of newspapers that were printed in January of 1947, when the murder took place.

Hopefully the author will find some more productive way to exorcise her demons."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I really just can't say enough bad things about this book. I will say that Mr. Newton should be commended for his research and presentation, however, the story of Janice and her alleged murderous father are the work of pure fantasy. Perhaps she was indeed a victim of her father's abuse, but the besmirching of a murder victim without a shred of evidence except for the repressed memory of an obviously disturbed woman for nothing more than making a buck is absolutely despicable!! I won't even get into the disservice it does to all victims of child abuse and incest. It is interesting to note that in James Ellroy's non-fiction account of the investigation of his mother's murder, MY DARK PLACES, he refers to Ms. Knowlton as the &quot;crazy Black Dahlia Lady.&quot; You see, Ms. Knowlton's father was ALSO the alleged murderer of Mr. Ellroy's mother if you are to believe her account. In MY DARK PLACES, Ellroy memorializes that the Crazy Black Dahlia Lady was constantly trying to contact him, probably with the intent on getting more media attention (or my theory is that she was afraid he was going to crack the case and therefore prove that she was indeed a phony). This book is pure garbage and I implore you not to buy it and reward this kind of behavior. If you desire well-written fictional accounts of the murder, read Max Allan Collins' THE DARK ANGEL, TRUE CONFESSIONS by John Gregory Dunne, and/or, of course, Mr. Ellroy's BLACK DAHLIA. If you want non-fiction, read John Gilmore's SEVERED or Mary Pacios' CHILDHOOD SHADOWS, or check out the multiple web sites that are out there, particularly those run by Larry Harnisch or Pamela Hazelton (Beware that some of these individuals seem to be at odds with each other for reasons based on the fact that they all are adamant that they know who actually commmited the murder, however, they all seem to agree on the fact that Ms. Knowlton indeed has a screw loose).

BIG mistake! This book was soooo graphic and unnessarily grotesque I had nightmares! I didn't see the point in torturing the readers with details of the rapes and molestations Ms. Knowlton was subjected to. I have no doubt she was abused as a child and that George Knowlton was an evil man but did he kill Beth Short? Highly unlikely. Ms. Knowlton gives no back up to her claims and every shred of &quot;evidence&quot; she does come up with falls apart when put to the test. She tells stories of horrible abuse and blatant infidelity her mother endures being married to George, yet when she demands he get Beth out of the house...he does it! Another thing that doesn't make sense is why would Beth Short date a man like him? From other books and interviews with people who knew Beth, she liked good looking young men, George was neither. He wasn't even employed most of the time so there goes the &quot;using him for money&quot; theory!

I read it (well, halfway through I started skimming through Knowlton's childish, ludicrously gruesome prose) and I'm glad I didn't actually spend money on this dirtbag piece of junk. What a steaming collection of half-baked trash!!! I won't go into the many specifics of bad logic, conveniently vague accounts and lack of corroboration (Knowlton conveniently explains these things away by hysterically suggesting cover-ups, witnesses too &quot;frightened&quot; to come forward, or testimonies of dead people) which other reviewers have already pointed out.Where does she get off, making unsubstantiated claims about her father and Elizabeth Short (both dead and therefore unable to defend their reputations) and then insisting that we take her words at face value? It's especially egregious that Knowlton sinks low enough to trash the memory of a dead woman in her bid for attention; her descriptions of Elizabeth Short as an abusive babysitter (Knowlton claims this relationship in her book) are bad enough, but her suggestions that Short was a prostitute and that her promiscuity more or less led to her demise are outrageously hypocritical; even if Knowlton's memories are true (and any casual reader will see the holes in Knowlton's manufactured plot) her exploitative treatment of serious issues like child abuse and sexual molestation render her morally unqualified to pass judgement on anyone else.It's obvious Janice Knowlton is sick enough to feel jealousy of Elizabeth Short's fame---Short has become a de facto icon of Hollywood's dark side and her image still fascinates and stirs the imagination after 50+ years. Janice Knowlton is nothing more than a bottom-feeder, so desperate for attention (whatever fame she gains won't be through her writing skills) that she would violate the memory of a girl who, in all likelihood, never did anything bad to Knowlton and certainly doesn't deserve the treatment she gets in &quot;Daddy...&quot; I won't discuss John Gilmore's excellent book &quot;Severed&quot;; to mention that in the same breath as Knowlton's fictional account (gotta call 'em as I see 'em) is an insult to Gilmore.Shame on Simon &amp; Shuster for publishing this indefensible junk."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"When so many people only rate a one star, someone may get so curious and buy the book just to see how bad it is. But honestly, don't bother. I got to the middle and lost interest, and after a few months of it on the shelf I wound up throwing it away. The author has no credibility, and I don't want to waste my time with fantasies."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I am...at a loss for words when it comes to this book. Never before have I read such a thoroughly useless and perverse book. Not perverse in the content, but perverse in the motives of the author. Janic Knowlton's book is a a sick and blatant attempt to attain her 15 minutes of fame. Let me tell you, this woman deserves nothing less than what she got (to be dismissed and attacked by critics). The entire book seems to be an \\"Ode to why we all feel sorry for poor, poor Janice.\\" I can understand that she was a victim of her father's abuses, but to use the name of a horribly murdered young woman (for whatever reason) is simply appalling. I simply cannot offer enough criticism for this book. The author(s) take circumstancial evidence and claim that they've found the end all be all of solutions to the murder of Beth Short."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I read this book after just finishing &quot;Severed&quot; by John Gilmore...and what a letdown! &quot;Severed&quot; left me wanting to learn more about &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; and this book just made me sick. First off, I do not know what to think of Janice's assertions about repressed memory. I am in a psychology course in college right now and the professor says that &quot;repression&quot; has never been proven. But I believe Knowlton had to endure some kind of abuse to come up with this stuff, because it is VERY disgusting (I MEAN GRAPHICALLY DISGUSTING). The book makes me angry in so many ways. First off there is this insinuation that Elizabeth Short got what she deserved. Knowlton accuses her of physical and sexual abuse. Also the book assumes the readers are ignorant...for example every time something can not be backed up factually (and that is most of the time) it is blamed on a cover up, lost documents, lies of friends/families, and &quot;gaps&quot; in the recovery of Jan's memories. But the thing that really got me annoyed is that the book is written in this horribly sick, sarcastic tone...for example, an anacronym for Jan's sexual abuse was once referred to as &quot;daddy's love&quot;. The whole book is written in terms like that and it made me sick. I am not a very cynical person and I usually can give someone the benefit of the doubt, but this was too much. You have to wonder if this was such a painful real thing for Janice Knowlton to experience, why she had her story written for the world to see? If any of this stuff had come from my mind, repressed or not, I would run and hide!!!!"},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This book is GARBAGE!!!! The author presents flashbacks but no persuasive evidence! She had no recollection of the events until the 80's and you know what most of the &quot;recollections&quot; of the 80's were...JUNK SCIENCE. I could not believe the items that they provided as persuasive; she had a &quot;Flashback&quot; about a woman named &quot;Elizabeth with black hair&quot;! Can you imagine how many women in that part of the country named Elizabeth in those days??!! I read the book by Detective Hodel and his presentation was far more logical. At least he had some evidence, pictures and addresses that match the Dahlia murder and other like murders. His father was even a surgeon, which makes more sense than Knowlton's father; a hunter and wastral. A very disturbed women in her own right and trying to blame her father for her problems. Hey, get your head straight and leave your parents out of it...there is a thing called, &quot;initiative and self-drive&quot;. We are all responsible for how we end up, don't try the, &quot;cop-out&quot;."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Poor Janice Knowlton. It's a fact that many abused children lie, cheat, steal and grow up to be abusers themselves. This seems to be evident with Ms Knowlton's stories alleging that Beth Short was a prostitute and child pornagrapher. Recovered memory is a real *rare* syndrome which has been exploited for less-than-noble purposes. I think that's the case here. Most people who went through the horrifying abuse that Ms Knowlton claims was the staple of her childhood would give the world to FORGET that any of it ever happened. In her case, the oppostire seems to be true. In closing, I really doubt that &quot;Daddy&quot; killed Beth Short."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I believe Ms.Knowelton was abused but I don't be- lieve her father committed the murder of Elizabeth Short. She believes there was a police cover up, but why? Her father, George had no money or power to buy his freedom to continue to kill. I also felt that there was just way too much detail on her sexual abuse. The alleged mutilations of dead babies was just too much. Instead of giving evidence to support her story she just attempted to poke holes in all the other theories and evidence. It was hard to read and stays with you long after you put it down, unfortunatly."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"A well known German study of Holocaust survivors found that in each and every case from children to adults remembered everything.One thing forgotten ok, maybe repressed.

Money.This book is NOT fact but PURE FICTION!!"},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This is one of the worse books I've ever read. This poor woman needed to believe that the abuse she suffered had to be connected to a greater evil. It simply doesn't make sense in connection with the case. Add to it the fact that she was bipolar and eventually committed suicide- I think anything this woman said was warped by her own need to validate her experiences."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"The Black Dahlia murder mystery, which is one of this country's most talked-about murder cases is presented here by Janice Knowlton in a fashion that makes for great reading, but is of little actual signifigance to the case. Knowlton writes that Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia) died at the hands of her abusive father, George Knowlton. Some parts of the book are great, some are plodding, but overall, this is just fictional. If you want a great book on the case, buy &quot;Severed,&quot; by John Gilmore, which is probably the only &quot;real&quot; book on the case."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Please I beg you do NOT read this book!! It's disgusting and will give you nightmares...we do not need to hear every detail of how life was in George's house of horrors.

Hey can we burn the remaining copies now???"},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I can not say this book was well written. It did way too much skipping around to hold my concentration. I usually will finish a book of this size in one day. It took me over a week to finish this story. It also appeared that Janice wanted to use catchy phrases,throughout the book, that just backfired. I do belive Janice had the most horrible of childhoods, and did truely belive her daddy WAS the black dahlia killer. I pray Janice finds the peace in death that she never had in life."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"Janice Gail Knowlton was a troubled person because she was abused by her father and believes him to be a serial killer himself. Imagine growing up with that information can send anybody to the nuthouse or loony bin.It is amazing that Janice writes so freely about the horror of Elizabeth Short's murder. I don't believe she mentioned her friendship with another abuse victim, Tamar Hodel, whose brother believes their father Dr. Steven Hodel was responsible for the Black Dahlia murder.Regardless, the book does not hold back graphic imagery and information regarding the case. It's sad to know that Janice is no longer with us and I pray she finds peace on the other side.She was brave to come forward with her story in the first place. This book is not the best written book because there are doubts in Janice's own writing as well but to believe that the man who is your father to be responsible for one of the most disturbing murders in America."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"My late sister Janice Gail [Jan ] Knowlton, wrote this book. My sister was contacted by Tamar Hodel after her [ my sister's ] book was published in 1995. Tamar is the sister of Steve Hodel, the detective who wrote \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\", which first came out in hardcover in 2002 0r 2003. A police mock-up which I believe, is a picture of how a suspect looked as described by a witness, using various pictures of facial features to choose from, in Steve's book looks very, very similar to one of my father taken on Christmas day 1942. This is the mockup that is set between two photos of Steve's father with his father Dr. George Hodel's mustache airbrushed out. It concerns a murder of a woman who was a real estate agent in California in January 1948. Also, one of the suspect sketches in the murder of James Ellroy's mother Geneva, [ He wrote \\"My Dark Shadows\\" ], is a ringer for my father. There are two sketches in the case. The one that looks very much like my father is pictured on the right as depicted in Laurie Jacobson's 2003 book \\"Dishing Hollywood\\". The other has many similar features. My sister may be the person that Jamel Ellroy refers to as The Black Dahlia Lady in his book. My sister and Tamar Hodel were email pals for several years. They seemed to have been drawn together because of childhood abuse. My sister was also contacted by the late Donald [ Don / Gibby ], Gibson who served on the LASO from 1948 to 1954. He said that he saw my father's name in the Elizabeth Short, [ Black Dahlia ], murder file among several other names. He said he believed my father was the top suspect and believed there was a conspiricy among several people involved in her death. Janice was also contacted by the late Thad Stephen who had attended the autopsy and had been an LAPD detective. He sent her a copy of his hand written notes of the autopsy. I don't know whether or not my father really killed Elizabeth Short, my sister may have remembered another murder with similarities, but she believed that she did remember the murder of Elizabeth Short. Her therapist Jim Frey was also convinced."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"I saw someone mention this book on a documentary I watched and decided it looked kind of interesting. I will have to say I've enjoyed reading it, but the book was more about Janice Knowlton (The author) and her childhood than Beth Short. Don't get me wrong, the book is very entertaining and interesting but I highly doubt anything in this book happened. If you're looking for FACTS about the Black Dahliah case then this isn't the book for you. If anything in this book is true, I would be shocked. But if you're just curious about what Janice Knowlton has to say about this case, then this is a great book for you! I'm convinced Jan Knowlton was a very troubled woman and none of this is true."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This book was a disappointment. I am a true crime reader and found this to be nothing more than self-indulgence on the part of the subject, Janice Knowlton, and plain bad writing by Michael Newton who usually writes factual, good bite-sized takes on crime and criminals. I was bored and irritated with this book and finally trashed it. I suppose there is value as far as Knowlton sharing her past abuses, if they actually happened (I am a female who experienced sexual abuse by a brother), but in this case who cares and where does it lead? The 'recovered memory' theory has been done to death and certainly doesn't work here. The reader is advised to check out the book by John Gilmore, entitled SEVERED, which so far appears to be the only authentic nonfiction account on the Black Dahlia murder case."},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"The phenomenon of recovered memories, where grown adults will &quot;remember&quot;, sometimes through therapy, childhood sexual abuse that may have never happened, is one of the most disturbing developments in the field of psychiatry. The number of women being convinced by unprofessional therapists that they have been abused is alarming, and many families have been ruined when such abuse is &quot;remembered&quot; by grown daughters. The woman who wrote &quot;Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer&quot; undoubtedly was abused as a child, but can one really believe that her father was a serial killer, as she insists she remembers? If one takes the time to wade through her book (as I unfortunately have), she gives scant proof. She apperantly only &quot;remembers&quot; that her father was responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Short. My only hope is that this book doesn't give impetus for other impressionable women to &quot;remember&quot; other horrible things that may have never happened. For a credible book on the Black Dahlia murder, check out John Gilmore's &quot;Severed.&quot"},{"Title":"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer: The Identity of America's Most Notorious Serial Murderer--Revealed at Last","review":"This is a worthless book as regards the Black Dahlia case.

Ms. Knowlton obviously had a horrid childhood, that I don't disbelieve but everything she had to say about Beth Short and the allegation that her father murdered her is don't believe at all. I hope she gets help, no one should write such disgusting things about people I doubt they even met, let alone the all too graphic details on how her father &quot;got rid&quot; of the dead babies. It should be obvious Ms. Short was not killed by a blow to the head, just look at the morgue shots, no damage to her head at all. Now Ms.Knowlton is claiming sexual abuse by Gene Autry, who's next?
