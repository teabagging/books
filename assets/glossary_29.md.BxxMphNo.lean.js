I have to read it with the help of two different study guides (Don Gifford and Harry Blamires are good ones)just to understand the allusions and it still takes me fifty times longer to read a section of this than any other book I've ever read. However, this book is like the zenith of literary accomplishments for a reader (if you can make it through). Not for the casual literature fan. On the bright side, I guess I can now brag that I've read Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I hated Ulysses...and not just because it's practically unreadable. I actually did manage to more or less read it all the way through, in one long twelve hour night, which I can never have back now. And I don't know about all the nuances and subtleties that it supposedly contains, but the basic thrust of it was clear enough.Ulysses is basically an unbridled attack on the very ideas of heroism, romantic love and sexual fulfillment, and objective literary expression. This is made especially clear by the title's reference to The Odyssey of Homer (Ulysses being the Latin name for the Greek Odysseus)---and the unmistakably unbridgeable contrast between the two books, both in terms of the content of the stories, and their modes of expression.Odysseus is a great man, King of Ithaca, husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and a hero of the Trojan war. The Odyssey chronicles his heroic ten-year voyage to return home from the war to his wife and son. Ulysses, on the other hand, is about an ordinary day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a bumbling buffoon, impotent both in life and in bed. In Homer's view, man is a heroic, even God-like, being---and woman is more than a match for him. In Joyce's, man is metaphysically ridiculous, especially in matters of sex, and woman is his equal in patheticalness.And then there is the literary style Joyce employs to spew forth this sewage. While Homer's epic poem takes the form of strictly-metered verse, Joyce switches literary mode, from straight prose to dialogue to stream of consciousness (among other things), almost at random throughout the work, though it seems to degenerate more and more toward the end.If the point of Ulysses were to break free of outmoded and arbitrary restrictions of classicism, it would be admirable. But that's not what Joyce is doing. He doesn't offer a positive alternative to replace the Homeric values (which I think are genuine values) upon which he's pissing. He's pissing on them just to piss on them. It's pure nihilism, and it's disgusting.Ulysses is obscene, not because of any language it uses or its obsession with sex, but because of its thematic content---the ideas it conveys. The book expresses nothing less than an all-consuming hatred of man and any positive values to which he aspires. And that is why I think Ulysses is one of the most vile and evil books ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce had sometimes been called a writers writer. One reviewer even suggested we should give Ulysses the benefit of a doubt, for the same reason we uneducated lay-folk use to accept on sight modern physics or Einsteins Relativity theory. Now I can think of all sorts of definitions for the meaning and purpose of imaginative literature -- to serve as the arcane Cabala for the initiates of a secretive cult is not one of them. If a novel lacks what it takes to reach every conceivable kind of reader, regardless whether it is to be received as a pleasure or a nuisance, than it is a failure, plain and simple. I may detest what I read -- even successful novels dont come with a gun held to your head -- but Ulysses is simply an empty shell, nothing left to form an opinion or taste either way. A bad writer is just bad, because he cant cope adequately with his task. But there is also a possibility that I may detest a good writer for the waste of skill and talent on something I deem to be an unworthy or badly misguided effort. So even if I may not like what he has to say, I can still be impressed by the beauty and cogency of his delivery. I dont like it, but the man has something to say, and he says it well. But this here is different: can anybody tell me what else it possibly could be than the vain demonstration of stylistic skills from the portfolio of a great talent -- with absolutely nothing to say? God knows, I am all for a reader who pays to a good authors work the respect it deserves and pitches in a bit of his own effort. This should entitle a good reader to carry home something worthwhile. However it is not just the Ulysses, I got the same impression from the entire work of James Joyce, even from his early poems. Except for a precious few luminous moments (the travel of young Steven in the train compartment, the damp and creeping cold atmosphere on the rugby pitch in the Portrait) it really amounts to little more than an exercise in the rhetorics of imaginative writing. It must be me, but I cant help feeling something amateurish in all this contrived effort. Call Joyce a genius, if you like, we all know he was determined to be remembered as the outstanding writer of the 20th century. And we do! We remember his legend the same way we remember Cervantes or Kafka before we open their books. An aura surrounds Ulysses, and this awe may even carry us through a few passages and purple patches, but thats where the comparison ends. Take away the halo from Cervantes and Kafka and you still enjoy a robust read -- I doubt the same can be said of Joyce. He had the gift, and he knew it, but even his consummate admiration for Ibsen didnt help him to find for himself a story worth telling, that is a story which would make his talent shine and captivate the reader. Technically, Ulysses is a superb piece of narrative engineering. A myriad of leitmotifs and themes entwine, separate and meet again each delivered in a variety of different voices and styles. So, ok, a letter torn to tiny shreds into the river carries to a corresponding theme five chapters later, a piece of soap bought in the morning becomes an important item in late afternoon, a galaxy of town-folks revolve around each other and do their daily chores, though mostly in pubs, hospital-canteens and hostelries -- a tat one-sided should it ever become necessary to reconstruct Dublin from scratch. So our Mr. Bloom masturbates over the sight of a crippled girl -- the joke to write parts of this particular passage in the pseudo-elegant journalese of a turn of the century fashion magazine is lost on me: is it supposed to poke fun on the clich beset thoughts in the poor girls mind? In fact Joyce ventriloquizes a lot; all over the book the English language is taken through her paces like a dressage horse, nobody can deny the authors brilliance, and sometimes he even presents a superb artistic flash, like the gold coins the principle is handing out to Stephen. Yet even here I see the author glancing sideways under his eyelids: are we really looking? Do we catch the moment? (Kafka did such things in his sleep.) So what does all this amount to, on some 800 pages, except to small change? Yes, Ulysses has style, a whole museum of styles to be exact, and nothing but style. After you finish it, if you make it through, you will leave it behind like a confused dream, and forget it just as soon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading &quot;great literature&quot; over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I requested Ulises, Spanish version, which was advertised.Instead, I got an old English version for the price of the Spanish one.I contacted the seller and s/he never had the courtesy of getting back to me.

Anyone who writes and does not read &quot;Ulysses&quot; doesnot know what they are plagiarisin and what they are making redundant; thosewho write that have read &quot;Ulysses&quot; (and have at least somesense of its brilliance and pulchritude) are plagiarising.This book towers*unimaginably* over others.

The first edition of Joyce's text and many subsequent editions averaged about 7 errors a page. In a book this long, those add up rather quickly.

Hey, I came to hear the book not some other stuff the producer decided to put in."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This \\"Reader's Edition\\" of Ulysses cannot be defended on any grounds, not even those of the editor. Mr. Rose claims to have brought the beauty of Joyce's most famous work closer to being appreciated en masse. He strips the work of many techniques that Joyce is admired for, that set him apart as an artist and that he surely intended. Gone are many (there are thousands of revisions) of Joyce's omissions of puctuation, capitalization and other conventions of grammar. There are documented mistakes that Joyce attempted to correct during his lifetime, and three existing editions are far truer to Ulysses as it was intended. There is no reason to subjugate the techniques of James Joyce so people with short attention spans and speciously pedantic (why correct Joyce's purposeful misuse of grammar) leanings can appreciate. If you simply want to know the story buy the Cliff's notes or ask someone who read the book. If you want to find out all the reason's for Joyce's renown read the true \\"reader's editions\\" from the 20's and thirties or ,of course, the 1961 text. I am obviously very angry. Even if I sat and thought for weeks I couldn't put any of my points in a technical manner. If you have read previous editions and enjoy seething, buy this one. Then you too can ask the question: Why would anyone do what Mr. Rose has done?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not a novel in my view, more an artist using all his materials in a vast experiment, with the secondary agenda of shocking the establishment and sensibilities of his time. Constantly changing style and using a truly massive vocabulary, often seemingly at random, he seems to be using his powers to toy with the reader. There is no real story, no exploration of the human condition and yet it is truly amazing. Like watching a world class gymnast who has total mastery of their body you are left feeling Joyce can do anything with our language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

I must admit it is not the most accessible book ever written, but it gets four stars for its intent ... and that it is better than \\"Finnegan's Wake.\\" Be warned: This book is not for the casual reader."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's later works are aimed at that type of person who likes to theorize about the forms of &quot;art&quot; endlessly, without ever being able to point to any meaningful specifics this type of thing may have. In fact, much like the splatter-painting of Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like. At least the more general reading public has never been swayed by such frauds, preferring mere entertainments like Lord of the Rings--which indeed have more going for them, on any level, than anything Joyce and his kind have ever done."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The greatest novel of the twentieth century? Hardly. A babbling, senseless tome upheld by &quot;literary luminaries&quot; who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent? Yes, that's the gist. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L. Renner, who claims that Joyce's dull (if bedlam) world parallels our own - that &quot;we are all Leopold Bloom&quot;: I deny that I am so uncouth that I would exhibit such behavior on a public beach - in the midst of a fireworks display, to beat all! (Perhaps some literary critics unwind by doing such things on public beaches . . . To tell the melancholy truth, it wouldn't surprise me.) And if I wake up one dark morning to a world gone Joyce . . . Why, you may then hand me my cup of hemlock!That said, I do not recommend James Joyce's _Ulysses_. Being, however, a charitable chap (and a chap who'd rather not be tarred, feathered and ridden on a rail by an agitated gaggle of bas bleus and &quot;lettered&quot; gentlemen), I've given Joyce a single, shining star. Charity, though, ends here. What Dryden has said of Richard Flecknoe will serve for Joyce:&quot;This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, young Was call'd to empire, and had govern'd long: In prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute Through all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses by James JoyceKindle edition of Joyce's extraordinary novel. Great ebook!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A lot of things have been said and written about James Joyce's most famous novel. Most of these remarks are high praises for the quality of his work and particularly for his originality.Before buying the book, I went on-line to check Amazon's review about it. At the time, the comment seemed helpful. It clearly explained the structure of the novel, the personality of the characters - Leopold Bloom ans Stephen Dedalus -, as well as the outline of the plot - a day in the life of these people.The review is very positive. It mentions that it is a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot; and that it is the greatest expression of realism in literature. Furthermore, it is said that the novel tells a &quot;funny, sorrowful and suspenseful&quot; story where &quot;everything happens&quot;.Since I am not an expert in literature I wonder what a masterpiece is? I cannot convince myself this is the best literature can get.Nevertheless, other characteristics mentioned are impossible to grasp. It is obvious that I wrongly assumed that Amazon and I shared the definition of basic concepts such as &quot;funny&quot;.Therefore, I discovered that the novel was not what I though it would be. I like thoughtful and dynamic story telling books. I should have never bought Ulysses because it is slow, distant and numbness of one's brain is required to understand what the author is describing.To sum up, the book did not impress me. Actually, it was a nightmare. And the review did not help me at all."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is (obviously) a classic, but not I didn't get through more than the first few pages.

I knew the book was famous, considered by many the greatest book of the 20th Century, and I had a vague recollection of having tried to read it when I was still a teenager. Fully conscious and wide-awake I closely read the first 40 or 50 pages. I can't say I don't remember what I read, but I can say I had no idea where the &quot;action&quot; took place, no idea of who was talking, and absolutely clueless to what any of the characters thought. The experience was completely mind-numbing. I then turned to the last chapter, and turned page after page looking for the period at the end of that chapter's opening sentence. I don't know how thorough my scanning was but I believe the whole last chapter, several pages, is one very long sentence.Joyce is an aesthetic bother of Marcel Duchamp (known for The Fountain, a urinal, now a museum piece) and John Cage (the composer of pieces for prepared piano, where the piano's strings are mangled with trash. He also is the &quot;composer&quot; of violin piece where the performer goes through the motions of playing without making a sound. I don't know if Amazon's audio capabilities can capture the nuance of that piece.) In this &quot;club&quot; we have a composer who writes noise or silence, an artist who exhibits a toilet, and a writer who is incomprehensible...long may they rest in peace.Two positive things I can say about James Joyce is that he has a great sounding name and he gives wonderful titles to his works."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I spent months to read this crappy novel, hailed by modern pseudo-intellectuals as 20th century best (maybe because they are so close to its flimsy thoughtless characters and broken up narration -typical to Post-Modernist 'masterpieces'-). Although better and more sincere compared to its modern literary heirs, Ulysses still is in no way capable to elude its very nature. The thoroughly unreadable ramblings found inside are under no circumstance manifestations of artistic rebellion, being in fact just excuses coming from extraordinarily self-indulgent authors.Of course, some non-indoctrinated people could object and say: this book portrays well Dubliner &quot;middle&quot; society from ITS OWN perspective (not from a critical eye). However, I don't think this was author's intent. His intent was just &quot;getting rebelious&quot;: being &quot;new&quot;, unbounded by (older) rules and responsibility.Why two stars, then? Because I LOVED the chapter where Bloom's wife events perspective is provided. Everything had no organization whatsoever: no sentences, no punctuations, just one phrase that ends with the chapter.

I'm sure it has tons of allegorical layers but whats the good of that when you can't tell what the hell is even going on.It seems that for a book to be considered great it has to have layers of meanings hidden that are very hard to figure out. But I'm sure that half of these &quot;great&quot; books are written with a meaning intended by the author and then the critics and readers assume that there is some great meaning behind everything so they make up something just to make sure they don't look stupid.

By treating a formerly taboo area in body work--the male pelvis--he demonstrates how the lack of attention to that area has only increased the tension that our culture has inculcated in men. Professionally, with diagrams and photos, he shows how bodyworkers can assist their clients in releasing the pelvic tightness that has accumulated over the years for social psychological reasons. This hands on book is a must read for all bodyworkers and is obviously based on a lifetime of experience in the field. He ends with a discussion of healthy male sexuality as opposed to the sexual and postural dysfunction that can result from unhealthy pelvic tension and its resulting malformation."},{"Title":"Out in the Open: The Complete Male Pelvis","review":"This is a superb book. It is written particularly for Rolfers, but is essential reading for any other body worker as well. Since studying this book on my own, I have become much more confident doing pelvic massage with male clients. Having detailed knowledge of the underlying structures allows me to explain to men what I'm doing and why. Clients can be informally instructed at the same time they are made more comfortable with touch in this area. For this reason, the book is valuable for all men who want to learn about their own bodies.The text is clearly written and technical terms are explained. A particular strength is close-up photos of the genital areas of a variety of men. Each of these is paired with a line drawing of the same scale based on that photograph and showing the underlying anatomy. This arrangement makes it easy to relate what one sees on the table during a session with what one is feeling beneath the skin as one works.Other chapters on foetal and juvenile genital development, posture, and sexuality are also very informative.I have no hesitation at all in giving this excellent book five stars."},{"Title":"Out in the Open: The Complete Male Pelvis","review":"The author has written an intelligent, frank and provoking book about the area of the body least talked about in an intelligent, frank and provoking manner.

An excellent and important book for any Medical Doctor, Psychologist or Physical Therapist yet easily understood and enjoyed by someone with a less scientific mind. In fact, I consider this book a \\"MUST READ\\" for P.T.'s, Massage Therapists, and all body workers, consultants and trainers who work with men. I would also consider this book an excellent primer for any one (woman OR man) involved in a sexual, romantic, or loving relationship with a male.

As a manual for structure and function, the book is very good; the sections on pelvic movements are very clearly explained. Unfortunately, the references to Rolfing and bodywork seem too vague"},{"Title":"Out in the Open: The Complete Male Pelvis","review":"The first thing that needs to be understood is that this book is not a science book. The author mentions that right off. It is filled with logical fallacies and hypotheses that are not backed up empirically at all. What I was looking for when I bought this book was an anatomy book that had a narration that linked physiology to actual everyday movements and events. I don't think this book was exactly what I was it.Another quirk about the book is that, although it is \\"not written specifically for body workers\\", it is written by a Rolffer. This means that there is an assumed lexicon which you will quickly notice with the authors use of the word \\"protection\\" among other references to Rolffing topics.That said, the book is definitely interesting. It is not vulgar or pornographic although it does openly talk about topics that normally would not be brought up in non-intimate settings. Additionally it is filled with pictures of naked men in different states of arousal from different angles. But if you don't expect that from the title then you are not very perceptive. Something else I think I should mention is that the book is not about homosexual stuff. I bring this up because of the fact that its about men's pelvises and the title starts with the word \\"Out\\" has led some of the people who see it in my house to assume that.The author makes a lot of good observations and is detailed in his descriptions. Additionally he postulates on the possible causality of his observations and his thoughts are interesting and cause you to think about how your own body could be effected in the same way. I found myself describing the book to some people in conversation ( oh its definitely an ice breaker ) and extrapolating a lot from the author's base ideas.

I'm not a vegetarian and I liked the way that it wasn't \\"shoved\\" down your throat (as some of my friends have done). There were also hints on how to change some of the recipies to suit your meat loving friends."},{"Title":"Teany Book: Stories, Food, Romance, Cartoons and, of Course, Tea","review":"Although there aren't a ton of recipes, this book has a lot of heart. The recipes, though, -- especially the Raspberry lime ricky and cashew butter sandwiches-- are amazing but very simple, using a lot of everyday ingredients. Perfect for a romantic dinner or summer lunch with friends. The recipes span from cosmetic facials using tea and other natural ingredients, to cold drinks, to hot herbal infusions, to meal ideas. The little cartoon drawings a la Moby, suggested music playlists, and anecdotes along the way make this a book I love to read cozy near a bay window-- not just a cookbook you read standing up in the kitchen with the ingredients sitting before you. Many of the recipes have a loose, improvisational feel to them, which makes it feel like you can incorporate them into your life, not just for the rare fancy smancy dinner party-- although many of this recipes would totally impress dinner guests too."},{"Title":"Teany Book: Stories, Food, Romance, Cartoons and, of Course, Tea","review":"If you are stuck for something to give someone in your life who might be vegetarian/vegan, tea-totaler or just enjoys collecting unique cookbooks, look no further.

Even if this book sometimes looks like a huge advertisement leaflet for teany, it also has really useful information and recipes that may or may not involve tea, but that are really good. When I read the one for Pan Bagna, I actually dreamt I was eating Pan Bagna that night! That's how yummy everything is! And I've already bought online a large amount of teas that come in the book.

As a devoted tea drinker, I was hoping to find some new ideas for what to serve up to go with my afternoon break -- instead, while some of the stories and touches of humor are funny, the ingredients were just a bit too odd for me to contemplate. Too, the book gets overly cute in spots, and while I do admire the author's stand on vegantarism, his self-effacing manner really begins to grate after about the fifth time that he mentions that he's trying not to be self-promoting.

The story of Prudy, a young girl who obsessively collects anything and everything, moves at a brisk pace. The prose is sharp, the story inventful, and the illustrations are superb. It's fun to read about all the oddball items Prudy gathers and keeps, but without these first-rate illustrations, this might be just an average book. With them, you and your kids will find a pleasant diversion just checking out all the objects, drawings, animals, plants, etc. the spill all over the pages.Prudy's collecting is way out of hand, driving her parents crazy. And when her little sister starts her own collections, things look dire. But then, the final straw, so to speak, occurs when Prudy tries to add to a gum wrapper to her already bulging closet.So she confronts her collecting problem creatively, culminating with the creation of the Prudy Museum of Indescribable Wonderment. But Prudy still has this little problem. . .I'm not sure how well this book will stand up to repeated readings, but better than most I suspect. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Prudy's Problem and How She Solved it","review":"While Prudy's Problem is ostensibly a children's book, it is quite entertaining for adults as well. The illustrations of Prudy and her amazing collections are witty and often laugh-out-loud funny. Prudy's single-minded obsession with collecting may remind you of someone in your life who has a similiar quirk. Our five-year-old daughter has asked for Prudy nightly for several weeks as an addition to other stories before bed. If you put Prudy on your bookshelf, beware -- you may want to begin collecting children's literature."},{"Title":"Prudy's Problem and How She Solved it","review":"An adorable book, with a fun, readable story and wackadelic pictures full of amusing details!

I recognised myself and many others in Prudy's dilemma. Her curiosity and her parents' patience are a winning combination. I have read this book to several children and have heard other parents say that their children thoroughly enjoyed the story and the delightfully detailed pictures. I own a shop and, because of the fabulous illustrations, have sold several copies to adults with no children. Armstrong-Ellis has written and illustrated a lovely first book. I look forward to more from her."},{"Title":"The Imperial Quest and Modern Memory from Conrad to Greene (Literary Criticism and Cultural Theory)","review":"The Imperial Quest and Modern Memory from Conrad to Greene provides a critical bridge between modernism and postmodernism--especially in its use of multiple interpretive lenses. Its author presents a contextual analysis which synthesizes the historical, cultural, political and aesthetic forces which contribute to the modern and postmodern ethos. The book compares the archetypal quest of the epic hero to the quasi-imperial quest of the modern anti-hero and examines the narrative dissonances within the modern novel. The inner and outer journeys of modern protagonists such as Marlowe and Fowler provide strong indictments of imperialism (whether in Africa, India, or Vietnam). Conrad and Greene critique imperialism in its British, European, and American masks by confronting the human dimensions through their introspective, albeit unstable narrators. This work also offers a well-focused and contemporary analysis of the social and political role of the modern novel in exploring the psychological and political discourses between the East and West, male and female, colonizers and colonized. The author connects the psychological and moral dilemmas of these modern protagonists with existential philosophy, further exploring the dimensions of objectification in both interpersonal and international relationships. This probing study is relevant to the contemporary reader in its analysis of imperial power in both the 20th and 21st centuries."},{"Title":"The Imperial Quest and Modern Memory from Conrad to Greene (Literary Criticism and Cultural Theory)","review":"The Imperial Quest and Modern Memory from Conrad to Greene is a thought provoking read that combines literary criticism and cultural theory. The book explores the politics of the quest motif in Western literature with an emphasis on modern novels. Many will find this book accessible and worthwhile. The Imperial Quest is written in a clear and direct style but readers should expect some postmodern interpretive techniques. Those interested in studying Western civilization (and imperialism) via literature should find this an interesting read. The book transcends literary criticism to become a work of cultural criticism."},{"Title":"To a Very Special Friend (To Give and to Keep)","review":"To a very special friend showed me the way of friendship"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of Man","review":"Gibran's reputation as a poet and profound thinker is confirmed in this book.He employs history, Biblical text and his imagination to conjure 'interviews' with folks who may have been intimate with Jesus or affected by His presence from a distance.His insight is exceptionally believable and he takes you on a journey that is both mystical and practical with the varying points of view. The positives are for believers primarily, and one will be filled with a sense of awe and intimacy toward Jesus. Nevertheless the voice of skeptics is heard, though in the minority, but it is given due attention.The downside may be for those who are not so poetically inclined. Khalil's voice through those who admire Jesus is extremely metaphoric and it may be lost on those who need a more 'down to earth' description of feelings, emotions and attitudes. I felt at times that the discourses were perhaps too symbolic, though one understood the implication of the experience of encountering Jesus as beyond words.In the end one is left understanding Jesus' impact more but hungering to know Him in a way that is more understandable than the sometimes amorphous descriptions by Gibran's characters. The interviews are fairly short and this makes it a manageable read for the most 'unbookish' of us.All the same a great read and a classic anyone should have."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of Man","review":"it is so wonderful to read a book by a man who is not a christian in the literal sense of the word and yet so much a true christian in the spirit of things. this book was absolutely beautiful. i am very very sparing with my stars, but i have given this book four because it is absolutley beautiful... loved it so much i even gave my dad a copy. he enjoyed it too.i guess that its in reading books such as this that ones belief in humanity is really boosted. a wonderful book. i do love Jesus and Gibran, clearly does too, though not a \\"Christian\\". this man does great honour to the name of Christ in writing this book.i guess that in the Christian walk, a time comes where one begins to think and feel the importance of humanity... the importance of being one of the people, not just one of the material church... the value of love and openess to all men and women, whether 'good' or 'bad'. what has become a closed book, begins again to open up too all people, and ones faith moves downwards from the head and into the heart. (not always easy). its so easy to let life and culture, or experience to harden oneself towards others, especially people like 'publicans', 'prostitutes' and sinners and yet we are reminded in this book that jesus was a dear friend and lover of such people regardless of the spiritual pain they must have caused him.this book portrays jesus as a true human, his humanity is what makes him so beautiful and the people he meets. sorrows, joys, pains, love, attraction, attachments, anger, deep caring... all the things that make us thoroughly human are found in Gibrans portrayal of jesus.i have spoken with two or three people about the hardness of the western heart. people come from countries where emotionality is profoundly important and often find a lack of this in the west, but religious paths can also root out the delicate flowers of emotionality and caring too.this book is full of emotion and atmosphere. it is my own prayer that i will share intense emotion with those that i love. sorrow with the sad, joy with the happy. bring back emotions!i love this book!Jesus the son of man, Gibran the friend/lover of Jesus.love, flakey. xxx"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of Man","review":"One of the most beautiful books of prose-poetry ever written, Kahlil Gibran's JESUS, THE SON OF MAN, is a profoundly moving collection of \\"Gospelettes\\" presented as being told by the various people with whom Jesus had contact in his life.Gibran used all of his not-inconsiderable powers as poet, author, artist, philosopher and theologian in writing this book. Barbara Young in THIS MAN FROM LEBANON, describes how one evening in his New York studio, Gibran somehow channeled Judas. In writing down Judas' words, Gibran was moved to tell the tales of other individuals as well.Gibran also drew a portrait of Jesus at the same time. The one used as the frontispiece in this book is NOT that portrait, but a near-copy commissioned by his editors at Knopf, who objected to the fact that the original portrait was only a partial profile. Yet, that partial profile, when shown, has caused its audiences to gasp or to weep, so vital is its effect. As one young man reportedly said, \\"I could dig a Jesus who looked like that.\\"Gibran was a Maronite Christian Lebanese (or Syrian, depending on the vagaries of politics), and he referenced his view of Jesus as \\"Jesus the Palestinian\\" as opposed to \\"Jesus the Christian.\\" Of course, the historical Jesus was neither Palestinian nor Christian. Nor was his name really Jesus. He was a Jew, Joshua, born and raised in Judea. \\"Palestine,\\" as such, did not exist until the Romans renamed the province after the Jewish Diaspora of 70 CE.There are legends that Jesus went to India as a young man and learned from Buddhist monks (one Eastern sect claims he died not on the Cross, but ended his days in Kashmir). There are the Glastonbury Legends, that say that Jesus was in Great Britain for a time. While Gibran does not reference these ideas, his Jesus is certainly a person who would be suited to such an existence. Gibran does reference many of the non-canonical Gospels (of which there are hundreds) in creating this portrait in words. This gives JESUS, THE SON OF MAN, a uniqueness and an atmosphere that is decidedly different than, particularly, the Western, Christian, view of Jesus.If you are a reader who believes that the Western, Christian view is infallible, then you will not accept this book. However, this book is remarkable as an intimate portrait of Jesus, invented or not, and as such, should be visited by all readers, Christian and non-Christian alike, for a deeper understanding of This Man From Judea. I can really dig a Jesus who looks like this."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of Man","review":"This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing \\"Jesus, the Son of Man\\", he thought of \`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.

Miller in his fine volume, The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America. Contrary to the stern stereotypical image of a thousand Thanksgiving pageants and grade school centerpieces, Dr. Miller creates an anecdotal quilt that captures a diverse frontier world that edged the rocky shore of the cold Atlantic. If Dr. Miller's book had been the primer for legions of school children there would have been little dozing in the classroom; America wouldn't have had to wait for Mel Gibson and the Patriot to discuss the finer points of &quot;bundling.&quot; Nor would we have questioned Samoset's motivation when it's revealed he boldly marched up to the Pilgrims and asked for beer. The extarordinary range of detail, gleaned from diaries, letters and other primary sources surprises us with anecdotes of crime and punishment, recreation, education, dress, labor and medicine among others. From cockfights, slavery, urban life to mean cabins on the frontier, the first Americans emerge as a diverse species, as unique as the forest they push back from the sea. Consider that, Harvard educated and Stanford professor, Dr. Miller first wrote this thin tome in 1966, makes this undiscovered gem a treasure for any serious student of the American frontier. But, like Washington's Expense Account, it reaches across the coffee table and seizes the mainstream reader's interest. This is a Don't Miss. coleman@gunnison.com"},{"Title":"The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America","review":"A lot of oddly interesting facts about the colonial period fill this book, which causes you to realize how blessed you are to live several generations later. When a secularist writes about spiritual matters, however, it becomes apparent that a materialistic worldview is used for the examination.To his credit, Miller uses extensive quotes from the people of the period. He discusses the internal contradictions of people believing one thing, while struggling in the day to day world. One gains a good overview of what life in colonial America was like by reviewing the mundane routine of the people. Various classes are included and how they evolved over time as well.Certain professions that are mainstream now, were looked on unfavorably at the time. For example actors were thought to have a negative influence on youth. Physicians were not licnesed and only 5 percent of them held MDs in 1776. Laws were in transition as various parts of the country were at different levels of being civilized and in fact, during the revolutionary period the entire legal system was being created from scratch.Miller's secularist stance is subtle. Only the discerning reader will pick up on it, but it's there. If your looking for a survey of oddities, they can be found in this book."},{"Title":"The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America","review":"Long a definitive work on the colonial period, this interesting work gives the reader the broad base of knowledge necessary to understand the period."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Agatha Christie's sleuthing couple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, made their debut right after WWI had ended. \\"N or M?\\" finds the couple middle-aged and in the midst of WWII, desperately hoping to be of service to their country once again, but nobody seems to want them. Then a covert mission comes along that pits the married pair as strangers in a search to find traitors in their midst. \\"N or M?\\" is a fast-paced thriller, different than Christie's usual mysteries, that fans of her fiction will love for its unique if slightly easy to figure out story.When Tommy is approached by the Home Office to discover German spies at a seaside boarding house, Tuppence feels left out and takes matters into her own hands. As disguised guests \\"unknown\\" to each other, the duo tries to figure out who these spies might be, a male referred to as N and a female known as M. There are several candidates, the most likely being a young German scientist who supposedly escaped the horrors of Germany after his family was imprisoned. But the woman who runs the boarding house is certainly of a foreign descent and strange things begin to occur that let Tommy and Tuppence know they are on the right trail even if they have very little to go on. In an era of suspicion and war, everyone is a likely suspect, especially those who claim to be something they are not. And when Tommy goes missing, Tuppence must call upon her wiliest scheme to rescue him and uncover the treacherous spies.\\"N or M?\\" is an enjoyable thriller, its time period perfectly captured by Christie, as it was originally published in 1941, not long after WWII began. It plays magnificently to the fears that existed that German spies had infiltrated English society and that so-called patriots could be turned by the enemy. Christie plausibly fashioned many suspects, and while one identity may surprise, I felt that one was rather easy to figure out since it was the tried and true least likely suspect.

It is the opening days of WWII, England is bracing for the Blitz and all citizens are anxious to \\"do their bit\\". Unfortunately while the twins are away on military assignments, the older Beresfords are deemed to be too old for active service. They are urged to take up service at home, like knitting. Ultimately though Tommy's old contacts pay off - for him at least - he is offered a desk job in a restricted area, Tuppence must remain at home, with the hated knitting.It is later revealed that the desk job is a ruse and Tommy is needed for an undercover assignment. Tuppence is one step ahead as usual and arrives on the scene before Tommy. Together the two work to ferret out a spy ring on the English coast. As always with these two there are deceptions, kidnappings and last minute rescues before the triumphant conclusion.It is nice to see what old friends have been up to in the intervening years and good to see that they haven't lost a step. Christie does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the time, the tension as the war builds and the anxious waiting to hear news of loved ones in peril.There are a couple of problems though for long time fans of this series. Judging from the publication dates of the earlier novels, 1922 and 1929, Tommy and Tuppence are in their early 40s and the twins are 11 years old during this one. Even going by the slighly different time frame listed in this novel the twins cannot be more than teenagers and Tommy would still be very young to be retired.The plot is, as usual for Christie, clever and designed to keep the reader guessing until the end.

It is like a collection of short stories that all tie together."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"It is 1940. England is at war. Blitzkrieg is about to begin. Tommy and Tuppence are being told they are too old for active war service. Their twin offspring Derek and Deborah are of course younger and are in the Air Force and nursing respectively.A Mr Grant turns up at the Beresford flat to offer Tommy a clerical job in the wilds of Scotland. When Tuppence is called out to assist a friend Mr Grant tells Tommy that in fact what he is offering is a spy job hunting down some Fifth Columnist Nazi spies known as N and M. The previous agent on their trail is dead, run down by a lorry. Tuppence is to be kept in ignorance of this venture.Tuppence of course adroitly outwits these attempts to exclude her and joins Tommy in Leahampton where they both attempt to track down N and M, but at the same time both under assumed names and definitely not married. But neither are as clever as they think.This is #3 in the Tommy and Tuppence stories (see below).#1, THE SECRET ADVERSARY, was not published until 1922 but was set mainly in 1919, when World War I was fresh in readers' minds. As I said in my review I thought Christie was probably reflecting contemporary paranoia with Bolshevism and secret agents and conspiracies, and showed a political awareness that we don't often give Christie credit for. THE SECRET ADVERSARY was also Agatha Christie's second published novel and had many signs of an author still coming to terms with her craft.#2 in the Tommy & Tuppence series, PARTNERS IN CRIME, published in 1929, was set mainly in 1925. Tommy now has a desk job with the British Secret Service, and Tuppence, much to her displeasure is at home, though when the Chief of British Intelligence asks them to take over the International Detective Agency, both jump at the chance of new adventures. The fifteen stories contain parodies of fictional detectives who were well-known to readers of the 1920s. In each story Tommy and Tuppence assume the mannerisms and methods of a different detective or detective team, including Sherlock Holmes. The stories are bound together with an overall theme of a rather vague Russian plot. Again Christie appears to be reflecting popular paranoia.So World War II is the perfect opportunity for Christie to add to the Tommy & Tuppence series (and you may want to reflect whether they would have made another appearance without the war) but now Christie is a well established and successful novelist with 30 novels to her credit, so she doesn't wait for the war to end, but publishes N or M? while the issues it reflects are still topical.Once you recognise that, you realise that Christie is reflecting a lot of contemporary thinking. It certainly must have made the average English reader look carefully at those around him. It is a very patriotic novel.Christie introduces the idea of a \\"wooden horse\\", Fifth Columnists, people who are very attracted by Hitler's ideas, a network that has infiltrated English society and infrastructure.N or M, you see, is a term we have heard before. It refers to two of the most important and trusted German agents. We have come across their activities in other countries and we know just a little about them. It is their mission to organise a Fifth Column in foreign countries and to act as liaison officer between the country in question and Germany. N, we know, is a man. M is a woman. All we know about them is that these two are Hitler's most highly trusted agents.\`But there are those for whom we've neither respect nor liking-and those are the traitors within our own ranks-the men who are willing to betray their country and accept office and promotion from the foreigner who has conquered it.'\`We know The Day is fixed. We know, or think we know, roughly, where...(But we may be wrong there.) We're as ready as we can be. But it's the old story of the siege of Troy. They knew, as we know, all about the forces without. It's the forces within we want to know about. The men in the Wooden Horse! For they are the men who can deliver up the keys of the fortress. A dozen men in high places, in command, in vital spots, by issuing conflicting orders, can throw the country into just that state of confusion necessary for the German plan to succeed. We've got to have inside information in time.'Our Leader does not intend to conquer this country in the sense that you all think. He aims at creating a new Britain-a Britain strong in its own power-ruled over, not by Germans, but by Englishmen. And the best type of Englishmen-Englishmen with brains and breeding and courage. A brave new world, as Shakespeare puts it.There are some interesting little cameos too. I was very taken with little Betty Sprot, not yet 3 years old, but exploring language and relationships in a very engaging way.I think it is a very powerful novel in which Christie pins her own colours to the mast so to speak. If there is a weak part, it is the final roundup of information, where Christie ensures that no stone is left unturned for the reader."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Agatha Christie has done it again! N or M? is an ingenious novel set in the World War II days of London and Leahampton.

Her late husband was executed by the British for pro IRA activities and neither she nor her daughter ,the embitteerd Sheila .shows any kinship with the war effort.Shiela indeed openly scorns patriotism and is hostile to the British.Might it be Carl Von Dienam ,a German and allegedly a refugess from Nazi persecution?His scientific background makes him a useful man to have as a spy.How about the mountainous Irishwoman,Mrs O'Rourke -a mysterious and intimidating figure ?Or the hypocondriacal Mr Cailey, a man whose pre war travels in Germany have given him favourable views on the Nazi State.Could the almaost caricaturial Colonel Blimpishness of the bluff \\"Major Bletchley\\" be a double bluff ?Or the vague spinsterish Mrs Minton ,or the Londoner Mrs Sprott with her precocious daughter Betty.And who is the demented Polish woman who kidnaps Betty ,only to be shot by Mrs Sprott who is unexpectedly good with a firearm?And how about the forthright naval man ,Commander Haydock ? is he all that he seems to be .The book exhibits a strong vein of paranoia -the Germans have allies eveerywhere -in the government,civil service ,military etc.It reflects a very similar jumpiness to that in The Secret Adversary ,where trade unions were the focus of the author's McCarthy-ite maunderings.The book is second tier Christie but it has verve and pace and neatly melds thrillerish aspects with the trappings of the \\"whodunnit\\" or traditional mystery.it will give you an enjoyable few hours of reading and genre fans will lap it up"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Viciously evil sinister German spies terrorize Britain during WWII. Meanwhile Tuppence and Tommy Beresford investigate and solve a mystery about German spies N and M. I would recommend N or M because it has a complex mystery, suspense and interesting characters.The N or M mystery is very complex because usually in a mystery you are looking for one criminal, but in this you are looking for two. On top of that, there weren't 2 or 3 candidates, there were 10 or 15 suspects. Also these criminals were not normal criminals. They were very determined because they supported the Nazis. One other thing was the criminals looked like normal everyday people . They were good at fooling people like when Mrs. Sprot kidnapped Betty and she pretended she was a mom. Also they studied English to make it look like they were English, not German.N or M has a lot of suspense. For example Mrs. Sprot's daughter Betty was being kidnapped by a mysterious Polish woman. They were near a big cliff and a roaring ocean. You don't know if the Polish woman is armed. Another suspenseful part is when Tommy is at Commander Haydock's house. It is suspenseful because Tommy finds a secret compartment with the telegraph in it and realizes Haydock is a spy. One other suspenseful part is when Tuppence talks to Commander Haydock. It is suspenseful because Haydock was interrogating Tuppence. You don't know if Tuppence will get rescued in time and Commander Haydock has a gun.N or M has many interesting characters like Mrs. Sprot because she is brave. Also you don't know what will happen. She was very good at fooling people. She was smart enough to kidnap a kid. Also Commander Haydock is interesting too because he is a spy so you don't know what he will do next. He is also brave to be a spy because he could get in serious trouble for spying. One other interesting character is Tuppence because she has an amazing mind. Also she is brave for messing with the criminals. Also she is enduring because she doesn't stop when the mystery is hard.N or M is a heart pounding mysterious things and interesting chapters and a unusual setting. I would recommend this book.A Bynum"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"This story has Tommy and Tuppence serving as spies during WWII. It is the third of five T&T mysteries that Agatha wrote, and fairly typical of the series. In the series, each story has T&T roughly 10-15 years older than the last, so you see how they age and how their adventures change over time. In N or M, T&T are middle aged, too old to enlist and too young to stand by and do nothing. The identities of the baddies were fairly evident to me rather early in the story and Tommy's rescue involves some rather unlikely coincidences (Albert the (former) butler makes a key appearance), but the story has its charms. It provides an interesting perspective on the British view of things during WWII. The anti-German bias is understandable but the characterizations of the Germans are stereotypical and simplistic."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Normally Agatha Christie chooses to focus on the mysteries and not really concentrate on political and social events of that period; consequently her characters sometimes seem to be living in a vaccuum, removed from all that is happening around them. What makes &quot;N or M?&quot; unusual is that Christie chose to focus on WWII and what was happening in England at that time. Tommy and Tuppence who are living quietly in London suddenly find their routine interrupted when Tommy is called away on a secret assignment to try and find Hitler's most dangerous agent who has infiltrated England in advance of a planned attack by the Nazis. Of course, Tuppence who refuses to be left out of anything, follows him and actively helps him while posing as a garrulous widow. The book is more powerful than most because of the very real sense of menace that Christie creates and the feeling of evil lurking in the air. Wingding suspense and a knock-out ending - the only flaw was the focus on romance. Normally, it is nice to have a romantic attachment develop in Christie's books as they provide a nice relief to the mystery, but in this case I thought she should have concentrated only on the mystery; romance is almost superfluous in such a setting. It's interesting to think that while Tommy and Tuppence never actually existed, there may have been characters like them - ordinary people who possessed above-average intelligence who were picked to lead dangerous spy missions and who succeeded precisely because they were so ordinary and therefore not what the enemy was expecting."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"When one thinks of Agatha Christie, one usually thinks of novels in which a sharp-minded detective--such as Hercule Poirot or Jane Marple--unravels a tightly plotted puzzle from the comfortable safety of an arm chair. But Christie sometimes defies this concept of her work with a spy-thriller, and N OR M?, set during the early days of World War II, is among her best efforts in that direction.The novel re-introduces husband and wife Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, characters Christie originally created for the much earlier spy-thriller THE SECRET ADVERSARY--and they are among her most immediately likable protagonists: quick witted, snappy, and unwilling to sit in an armchair when they can be up and doing things. Although they have been long out of the espionage game, when rumors indicate that one of Hitler's most trusted agents has arrived in England. they are sent to a small coastal boarding house in an effort to unmask the spy who might be hiding among the apparently innocent residents.Readers will enjoy becoming reacquainted with Tommy and Tuppence, who Christie presents with considerable charm--and unlike the other novels in which they appear N OR M? is as much mystery as pure adventure: the book contains one of Christie's trademark twists at the conclusion. Although somewhat mild by the standards of her more famous novels, Christie endows the tale with a subtle sense of menace that serves it well; fans will enjoy the book, and newcomers will have a good time too."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"i have been borrowing a couple of her books from the library after a long hiatus of 5-6 years. n or m is my first introduction to tommy and tuppence, and i must say they are a light-hearted, action-oriented departure from christie's other investigators, who give the impression of spending a lot of time in situ, whether at the murder scenes or comtemplating the case. christie veers from teh pack in her stubborn regard for the facts and teh circumstances; i have never done any professional spying, but i imagine if i did that i could take a few hints from her detailed analysis of how her characters think and act. so many detectives in detective novels strike you as so ordinary - some are not even very smart - but in this book you see the true complexity of wartime counter-espionage come to life, all the more frightening because it lurks beneath a veneer of everyday monotony. i love how she injects obscure words now and then...reminds you of a time when people didn't just use er..awesome as an umbrella expression for pleasure!"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"During World War II, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford follow an obscure clue to a small English seaside town where a Nazi mastermind is recruiting Englishmen to help their cause. But who at the hotel is the mastermind? When a young child is kidnapped, Tommy and Tuppence believe they're on the right track, but are they? This riveting thriller is Christie at her best. It's a noteworthy for the political slant she includes, because that's not terribly common for her books. It constantly amazes me the amount of pertinent details Christie includes for the readers. Some are red herrings, and some are decisive. Agatha Christie was certainly the best."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Tuppence (about the British Secret Service): \\"I don't think the Intelligence is anything like what it was in our day.\\"Tommy (gravely): \\"It will attain its former brilliance now we're back in it.\\"As much as I appreciate M. Hercule Poirot's little grey cells and Miss Marple's insight into human nature, my preferred Agatha Christie sleuths are the fun-loving and very engaging Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Christie, in 5 novels, chronicles their exploits, which, while often containing elements of real peril and intrigue, managed to convey an air of lightheartedness and real fun. And this stems directly from the personalities of Tuppence and Tommy (but mostly Tuppence). Near two decades of married life find them still best pals, still devoted to each other. No change in personalities, either, as Tuppence remains intuitive, quirky, and impetuous while Tommy is solid, practical, and plodding - \\"plodding\\" meaning that he takes his time figuring things out. But he gets there, to the ruin of various so-called clever criminals. Meanwhile, Tuppence's ear for the preposterous surfaces again with the fashioning of her alias. Gotta admit, Mrs. Blenkensop is a pretty silly moniker. Anyway, N OR M? finds the duo back at catching enemy spies.A bit on the plot of N OR M?: Tuppence and Tommy's glorious amateur detecting days are years and years in the past. As we catch up to the Beresford couple, we now find them in their mid-40s and once again inhabiting a war-torn London. The still adventurous couple volunteer but are outraged to find their services spurned by the war effort. Discouraged and feeling useless, they suddenly receive a visit from British Intelligence and are offered a secret mission. Or, rather, Tommy is offered a mission. Tuppence pretty much elbows her way in.A British operative has expired thru mysterious circumstances. His baffling dying words: \\"N or M Song Suzie.\\" British Secret Service has already ferreted out that \\"N or M\\" are codenames for Hitler's two most trusted agents. N and M have been responsible for establishing fifth columns in nations opposed to Germany's warmongering, and it seems one or the other or both are doing their thing in England. N and M's true identities remain veiled in secrecy. \\"Song Suzie\\" might actually be Sans Souci, the name of a sleepy guest house found on Britain's South coast. Tommy's long shot of a task is to take up lodging at Sans Souci and nose around and hopefully unearth a spy or two. Persistence pays off as Tommy and Tuppence (or \\"Mr. Meadowes\\" and \\"Mrs. Blenkensop\\") are soon up to their necks in sinister skulkers, break-ins, kidnappings, and deadly espionage.Reading N OR M?, the Berefords' third outing, is like dropping in on comfy old friends, and Tommy and Tuppence make such charming hosts. I always enjoy re-reading this one. Agatha Christie has always excelled in peeling back the sedate, banal layers of British society to reveal the startling villainy festering beneath. Gradually, the routine of the seaside resort gives way to an atmospheric mood and an air of quiet menace. Written during WW2, the author does her patriotic bit as she has her cast express damning commentary on the appalling rot within the system: English turncoats. The mystery in N OR M? isn't as intricate as in her Poirot or Marple bafflers, but, still, her flair for the clever whodunit, her planting of the odd red herring or two are much in evidence.As usual, she works from an unassuming cast of characters. Who's N, who's M? Is it the blustery Major? The faintly superior landlady or her feisty, moody daughter? The fretful invalid or his fussing wife? The foreign woman who's been spying on the premises? Or the German refugee? Hell, could it be the merry two-year-old girl who enjoys being read \\"Goosey, goosey gander\\"? (well, no, it's probably not her). One letter's identity is stumbled upon, but the other is ferreted out quite nicely in a clever twist. Tommy and Tuppence are urbane and amiable company and make for competent detectives, and I had fun as they bask in the excitement of skullduggery afoot. But these two are now mature enough and have lived long enough that they aren't any more as frivolous in nature. They still live in the moment, but they comprehend the gravity of this war.Whereas Poirot and Marple always seemed old but never aging, Christie does pile the years on Tommy and Tuppence with each progressive thriller/mystery. In five novels (The Secret Adversary, the short story collectionPartners in Crime (Tommy and Tuppence Mysteries), N OR M?, BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS., andPostern of Fate) Christie has Tommy and Tuppence go from the bloom of careless youth to spry middle years and finally on to graceful old age. I've mentioned that the Tommy and Tuppence mysteries had a fun, breezy quality to it, and that definitely holds true for the first three books. But there's a change of pace and feel with the last two books. In BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS and the elegiac THE POSTERN OF FATE, Tommy and Tuppence are decidedly getting along in years, although still with all faculties intact. There's a melancholy, bittersweet flavor in these last books, which satisfyingly round out the lives of this fictional couple. Because I witnessed Tommy and Tuppence get old, they seem more real and resonate more with me than her other, more celebrated detectives. N OR M? finds them a bit long in the tooth but still delightful and still very effective at what they do, even as they have fun in the doing of it. Carpe diem, Tommy and Tuppence."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"This book just goes to show who the master of mystery books is: Agatha Christie!The book kept me guessing all the way until the very end.

She published it in 1941, in the mid of World War II. It is said that she wrote this story while London was suffering under the German air attacks. Agatha never wanted to leave London during these attacks, because she felt too involved. The novel is one of two which the author worked on simultaneously during World War II while she stayed alone in London. She alternated writing 'Body in the Library' and 'N or M?' to keep herself \\"fresh at task.\\"Although not being a big fan of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford I must admit that this story was quite special. This book is one of the few Agatha Christie wrote that have a historical background. It has certainly a nice atmosphere to it. First I was a bit put-off by the amazingly unrealistic espionage rubbish often seen in this kind of books, but discovered to my surprise that some -not all- subplots would not have been miscast in an average Poirot adventure. It was quite refreshing to see that Agatha had put this story in an almost realistic setting: the struggle against collaborators that tried to prepare a German attack on the coast of England.Not the best of her works, but certainly very close."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"The first book of Agatha Christie's that I read was And Then There Were None.

Yet, the biggest complaint that many people have when reading or discussing Shakespeare is the language: \\"People don't talk like that.\\", \\"Why don't they speak in English?\\", \\"I can't understand a word of what they just said.\\" are just a sampling of complaints I've heard when attempting to teach Shakespeare to high school students. I try everything I can think of to get over the language issue, but very little seems to help (comments such as \\"You do know that the way people talk in movies usually isn't the same way people talk in real life, either, don't you?\\" seem incomprehensible to students). That's why I'm thankful when books such as SHAKESPEARE'S JULIUS CAESAR: THE MAGNA EDITION come around; it provides another avenue to use in trying to get students connected with the themes of the play and not worry about the language.SHAKESPEARE'S JULIUS CAESAR takes Shakespeare's famous play and puts it into graphic novel form (even though subtitled \\"The Magna Edition\\" the book isn't a true magna because magna reads from the back of the book to the front). Some minor scenes have been cut out, but Shakespeare's language remains. The result is an engaging and accessible graphic novel that young people and more visually oriented people might be able to relate to and understand better than just reading the play directly from the text."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Julius Caesar","review":"I purchased this with the other titles (\\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" and \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" to help my remedial English students (which included a bunch of ESLL students) to understand Shakespeare.

They must have held this book upside down while reading or turned off the light while they read. Whatever, to say Carroll writes ANYTHING because his readers expect it is to miss the point completely. Nothing this writer has ever done is predictable. Absolutely nothing. That is his greatness and his burden. He is one of the few writers around who really do give us insight into how to live. I liked his earlier books too but rejoice that this one is structurally and philosphically so different. It is more profound, surreal, and in its own peculiar way very touching.

You missed all the points."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"There are writers we read for amusement, to learn something, or simply to keep our brains in motion. But there are a rare few who change everything. Jonathan Carroll's books change the way we see the world.

A woman who learns who she really is and along the way realizes too well that is definitely not who she wants to be. Is there a satisfying ending, as some people have complained about Carroll's books in the past? There is an ending that will make your mouth drop open and as far as I'm concerned, that is the greatest reward of reading."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"This was a very original creative story.

Yes, it was very confusing, which certainly makes it a good Carroll book, and adds to its charm.

He's one of the very few authors whose books I devour immediately upon getting them. The Marriage of Sticks is his latest, here published with a gorgeous Thomas Canty cover, and an elegant feel to the whole book. The book itself is as smoothly-written as ever, but with an oddly nonfantastic first half, and a wildly fantastic second half. It seems like halves of two different novels, seemlessly woven together. Despite such a minor cavil, the book is still another wonderful Carrollian novel. I'll let him lead me into whatever strange places he wants to go, and I'll always enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Vienna resident, Jonathan Carroll is well-known for writing about extremely ordinary people who become involved in extraordinary circumstances, thereby finding their lives transformed. These quirky and original characters often encounter fantastic dreams and nightmares, surrealistic visions and worlds within worlds, often with no warning at all. Anyone who reads a Jonathan Carroll book must be willing to remain open to a myriad of possibilities in life, possibilities than many of us simply have never held true.In The Marriage of Sticks, Miranda Romanac considers herself most fortunate to be working in a business she loves and at which she excels; she is a successful rare book dealer based in mid-town Manhattan. When Miranda attends her fifteenth high school reunion with her good friend, Zoe, she has more in mind than just a fun night out. Hoping to reconnect with her high school sweetheart, Miranda receives shocking news instead. Although she is yet unaware of its impact, this is news that will prove to be the catalyst of the slow-but-sure unraveling of the existence Miranda has so carefully carved out for herself.Miranda later meets the charming and witty but married Hugh Oakley at a dinner party. And art expert, Miranda innocently consults him regarding a business matter. The inevitable happens and the two are so highly attracted to each other they begin a love affair. This love affair escalates to the point that Hugh finally leaves his wife and children to be with Miranda. A little implausible, maybe, but certainly not out of the realm of possibility. It is Hugh who tells Miranda about the marriage of sticks. Couples write significant events, together with the date of their happening, on whatever stick in available to them at the moment. Every so often these sticks are then culled until the couple is left with only the most important and significant ones. At the end of one's life, when not much time is left, the sticks are burned, rendering the many into one.When Miranda and Hugh move into the home of Frances Hatch, an eccentric old woman who was one of Miranda's clients, the bizarre events step up their pace. (Crane's View, the home's locale, a small town on the Hudson River, is also the setting for Carroll's previous novel, Kissing the Beehive.) Here, both Miranda and Hugh experience visions of striking intensity. Miranda, in particular, is deeply affected as she experiences an ever-growing stream of visions and ghosts. All are, somehow, related to her directly and all help to lead her to the most important decision of her life.Carroll is a master at pacing and his story unfolds exactly as it should. There is no flab in this novel; every word counts, yet Carroll's presentation is effortless in its effect. Every detail is dead-on and the suspense threads its ways subtly through the lives of each character uniting all into one gossamer whole. The everyday and the mundane are transformed, the incongruous becomes the only reality.Carroll doesn't write works of undying artistry. But that's okay, not everyone wants to read that. What he does do is create novels that are highly entertaining yet extremely well-written. Novels that pull the reader in and allow him to escape for awhile into a completely different world. His unique talent lies in telling a darn good story and it is a talent he utilizes extremely well."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"If you enjoy books of self-discovery, suspense, romance and the unexplained; then by all means, enter into this book without knocking.When I first began reading I thought 'where's the si-fi that was promised when I pulled this book out from under that section'. I admit that even the beginning was captivating, but it all seemed pretty normal to me. I was wondering where the magic was, the vampires, the ghosts, the mysterious twist? But you must be patient, because it all comes pouring forward, slamming into you like a battering ram when you least expect it. Sure, it all starts out pretty normal. Miranda visiting her high school reunion,her life as a rare book seller, but then her well ordered life starts to desintagrate. She finds that she has been reincarnated yet again, and its high time she discovers the truth about herself and gives her immortality away. This book is full of ghosts and 'vampires' like herself, from a kindred spirit Frances,to her high school sweetheart James,to her husband Hugh, all the way to her long time best friend Zoe. She must face the truth in herself along with how she wronged all the people she loved. This book is certainly something new, along with its new and unusual twist on vampires. Forget the drinking blood, for all a vampire is is one who preys on others. For if Miranda can discover this truth in herself, their just might be time to make amends."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Jonathan Carroll's novel of love and loss and memory and life is wonderfully told for the first 200 pages, with his trademark strangeness tiptoeing in bit by bit by bit. I thoroughly enjoyed Miranda's story until I turned that one page and suddenly found myself in an entirely different novel...and one I didn't care for at all. The break was so abrupt, so jarring, it took me completely out of the story...and the big twist as revealed in these last 70 pages was an overdone plot device and a tremendous disappointment.Despite this major shortcoming, several of the characters Carroll has created are simply marvelous. I loved Frances, the old woman who leads Miranda to her truth. I really liked James, the high school boyfriend, until the point he turned into a whiny git and blamed Miranda for his poor choices. Hugh was interesting but not sympathetic. And given how the story turned out, I'm rather conflicted about Miranda herself...in a way that's impossible to discuss without spoilers.Don't get me wrong: The Marriage of Sticks is not a bad novel, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. It's just this particular tired plot twist is one that sets my teeth on edge, and I'm dismayed that he employed it. I suppose if this had been my first Carroll novel I wouldn't have been so disappointed."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I only gave it three stars because of the way it was written. I got confused a few times as the story changed all of a sudden. In a movie theater, people and places change and you can show it in different ways like fog or fade out. In this book I had to keep reading before I figured out this part wasn't of this earth. It was interesting enough to keep me reading, but it wasn't what my idea of past lives would be."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I work in a bookstore, and I happened to pick up Marriage of Sticks one day during lunch. The cover had caught my attention originally; the jacket synopsis held my attention a bit longer. Still, I probably would not have bought the book, being unfamiliar with the author. But I needed something to read for the moment... and I was amazed to find myself sucked in as early as the second page. I can't even explain why exactly I loved this book so much, or why I'm loving every word of Sleeping in Flames. All I know is that after welling tears and goosebumps and occasionally laughing aloud, I put down this book and knew that I had a new favorite author"},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I think three times Carroll has written books in the voice of a woman and to my ongoing amazement, he has pulled it off every time. THE MARRIAGE OF STICKS is the latest trip into the female psyche and it's terrific. Warm, touching and then very very frightening, it has one of the most exciting and erotic depictions of a new love affair I have read in years."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I read this book in a couple of nights. . .right before bedtime. Needless to say, I had some of the weirdest dreams during those couple of nights. Thats why I love Carroll's work.J. Carroll will fill your head with stories, people and situations that can be scary, funny, sad, weird, and TOO believeable, all at the same time. Read any of his novels and you'll know what i'm talking about.I gave a copy to someone and i'm sure she will treasure it and thank me for the rest of her life."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Reading a Jonathan Carroll novel is like going on a holiday to a rewarding, comfortable place full of unexpected suprises - jaw dropping suprises, pull-the-carpet-out-from-underneath-your-relaxed-body suprises. Who can Carroll (his works) be compared to? Kafka? Ray Bradbury? Stephen King at his best but on a word count diet? Classic European 'magic realism' literature? All of the above and yet he is unique. Sticks has as much 'magic' in it as, say, Carroll's Bones Of The Moon or The Land Of Laughs but Sticks is more thought provoking than either of those wonderful novels, in the way that From The Teeth Of Angels was. There is such compassion here for the human condition but not done in a sentimental way; deliciously perceptive and very rewarding. Full of gems. I was often in a state of bliss while reading this novel. Reading it on the bus, I twice missed my stop. Thank you Jonathan Carroll."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"The Marriage of Sticksslides along the slipstream, as most of his works to. His writing is filled with magical imagery and moments when you can't quite figure out what's going on, but in the end it doesn't matter because Carroll can tell a great story. Carroll's works always manage to live in the ordinary world and in the magical world that lies adjacent. InThe Marriage of Sticksthis is quite clear as the book moves through its paces and becomes increasingly creepy and fantastical.The main character, Miranda (yes, I thought of Miranda inThe Tempest, too), is looking for love and surprised when it finds her through a man who embodies her past, but is only tangentially connected to it. An exploration of love, of memory, and of loss - Carroll draws us effortlessly into a world where characters find happiness only to be driven from it relentlessly. His writing is creative and surprising and his stories unsettling and ambiguous. Lovely read."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Marriage, has the same strengths that most Carroll books have. Interesting characters that Carroll delves deeply into. A sense of magic, something not quite right with the world.Enjoy the journey with Carroll. Don't rush to the destination."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"In a recent glowing review of THE MARRIAGE OF STICKS, the great cartoonist/short story writer Gahan Wilson said it was arguably Carroll's best novel. Having read it straight through not one but two times now, I couldn't agree more. Reading the few negative reader's review of the book here, I wonder if we read the same novel."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Welcome to the world of Miranda Romanac... or rather, the woman who remembers being Miranda Romanac... or (in a manner of speaking) the women who were and will be Miranda.The main question that permeates this tale is &quot;Who is she?/Who am I?&quot;... the scenarios are prefectly created, the characters live and breathe and the scenes unfold in fron of the reader's eyes with astounding grace. Certainly, when the very first dark and disturbing passages appear nothing prepares you to see the horror that evolves in the pages of this slim novel which spirals towards one of modern fictions' most haunting (though non-violent) finales.Addictive? Certainly! This is a good way to start on Carroll as any other... a fast-paced nightmare full of tender moments and humor, and insight. Miranda comes forth as a facetious, complicated and utterly unforgettable character, made (perhaps unconciously) to suit Calista Flockhart perfectly.A novel that will please horror mavens and novel addicts alike, whom will want to read, re-read, and treasure it for a long time."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Having just finished the wrenching and one of a kind THE MARRIAGE OF STICKS, I read the review from the reader in Fayetville and laughed out loud at their obtuseness. They must have held this book upside down while reading or turned off the light while they read. Whatever, to say Carroll writes ANYTHING because his readers expect it is to miss the point completely. Nothing this writer has ever done is predictable. Absolutely nothing. That is his greatness and his burden. He is one of the few writers around who really do give us insight into how to live. I liked his earlier books too but rejoice that this one is structurally and philosphically so different. It is more profound, surreal, and in its own peculiar way very touching. Read the book again Fayetville. You missed all the points."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Jonathan Carroll is hands down my favorite author. His books always have surprises hidden in the pages. Marriage of Sticks was an awesome read! He explains lifes questions in such imaginitive ways you can't help but believe that he knows all! I highly recommend this novel. I have had my whole family read it so far."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Author: Jonathan CarrollPublished By: Open RoadAge Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanBook Blog For: GMTARating: 4Review:\\"Marriage of Sticks\\" by Jonathan Carroll was a good read that really kept me interested until the end. The novel started out with a high school reunion and then it blooms out with such intriguing characters that were all so well developed only presenting great thoughts only bringing out such creativity only adding to a great read that comes out a little fantastical and even somewhat creepy read. Be prepared for there will be many surprises that are well hidden in the read. I found \\"Marriage of Sticks\\" to be 'filled with suspense, horror and even magic.' Now, you may find Mr. Carroll's \\"Marriage of Sticks\\" novel may seem somewhat confusing but if you will stick with it till the end it will all come together giving you a mind-blowing fantasy of a read.If you are looking for a good read that will present 'scary, funny sad, weird, and too believable, all at the same time' you have come to the right place for \\"Marriage of Sticks\\" and yes, I would recommend this read to you."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Clearly I'm in the minority here, but I did not enjoy this book at all. Part 1 just did not ring true to me. First, I found the characters to be completely one-dimensional. Miranda reads like a female character written by a man. And Hugh -- handsome, philosophical, patient and willing to leave his wife! -- read to me like a man's idea of a woman's idea of the ideal man! Second, I had no idea where the book was headed and frankly, didn't much care.Then, Part 2, the weird stuff kicks in. I didn't care about the characters in the first place, so I didn't much care what happened to them or why. I had literally no interest in deciphering the events/visions/ghosts."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I wanted to like this book. The reviews were mostly very good and it sounded like a very intriguing read....intriguing is not the word for it. I have to disagree with other reviewers as I found it one of the most bizarre reads ever - and really, a waste of time. Maybe science fiction fans would enjoy it more. I am a huge fan of thrillers, crime drama, mysteries and the like - this is none of those. I find Dean Koontz a fascinating writer and he definitely does not fall into a specific genre but does write some way out there stuff - even being a fan of his often \\"suspension of disbelief\\" writing, I was NOT a fan of this book or writer. I won't be able to bring myself to try anything else by Carroll. I did NOT care about these characters, the plot was at best bizarre and I did have to force myself to finish. Not my cup of tea for sure."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I didn't care for the book because a good majority of it was back and forth between present day and past and was confusing. Other authors have a better way of distinguishing different time periods. Also, I felt that the main character made a few poor decisions in her lifetime, but paid for them too drasticly. The end of the book made me feel very sad."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Nobody disputes Jonathan Carroll's writing ability. He has a wonderful style and paints word portraits deftly. Some might not appreciate that surrealist elements appear in an otherwise straightforward novel. My mother, for example, hates anything that is animated or allegorical. She likes reality. I, on the other hand, enjoy the odd whimsy, the burning questions, the what-the-heck-was-that element of surprise that inhabits Carroll's narrative. He is a pleasure to read, at all times, period.This story is told in the first person by Miranda, a dealer in antiquities and oddities for eccentric Manhattanites. A high school reunion starts us off, as we join our angsty but mainly sympathetic narrator in media res, just before she meets the love of her life -- a married man. Miranda knows lots of interesting people who do interesting things, and she is about to have some amazing things happen to her.Whether or not you think you might not enjoy magical elements with your fiction, Carroll is a gifted writer with a fascinating story to tell -- what's not to enjoy? I am going to give my mother a copy and see if I can win her over to the surreal side. You should take a chance too!"},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"You are sitting in your chair reading, The Marriage of Sticks, by Jonathan Carrol, and suddenly there's a door flying on air. You don't think twice about the improbability of this strange appearance, but get up and turn the knob. Suddenly an aroma of every Christmas that wasn't spoiled cascades into your room...freshly baked cookies, cinnamon and spice, and everything nice. Now down the chimney comes a nightmare. It pulls up a chair beside you and is prepared to stay.You can put the book down. But memories are whizzing by like traffic on the Autobahn and surely illumination is near.Jonathan Carroll is a box of chocolates, the wind behind the door, the shadow that takes shape and draws you in. The Marriage of Sticks is about so much more than selfishness and sacrifice. If the doorbell rings while you're reading it - answer. It could be wonder come to call."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I loved the first part of the book, introducing the characters and their plaes in the world. And the descriptions of falling in and out of love seemed a bit unrealistic but still beautifully written and I couldn't put the book down. And I loved the ending and where the whole book went. The middle section of the book, as the weird X-filesesque events start to happen and you don't really understand why, seemed clunky to me, and was not as enjoyable. In some ways I wish he could have figured out a smoother way to bridge the two wonderful parts."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"...I both found a delightful author and a disappointment. Carroll is an excellent storyteller, weaving story within story ... I especially appreciated his German folktale without an ending. He does an excellent job of reinterpreting events in light of later understanding (self-understanding) of the characters. He illustrates the \\"seven degrees of separation\\" by the constant discovery of interrelationships between the characters. He easily blends multiple world views/realities into a coherent whole. The result is a book that keeps you reading, awaiting the next revision of your understanding of the storyline and of the motivation of the characters. This revision literally continues to the last page.My disappointment - the story depends upon an acceptance of a division of humanity into \\"them\\" and \\"us\\". Given the ordinariness of Miranda in the first section of the novel, I found it difficult to buy into her \\"otherness\\" - more difficult to accept than the alternative worldviews that caused the volume to be placed in the \\"fantasy\\" reading section.I will certainly read additional books by Jonathan Carroll, expecting that other books will not share this flaw."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"What made me read this book was the first two sentences of the book. Probably the most captivating two sentences I have ever read. I really enjoyed the first half of this book. Having never read Carroll before and not even suspecting where he was going, it was like hitting a brick wall when ghosts, reincarnation, animals talking and other &quot;strange&quot; stuff started happening. I don't find this at all scarry, I guess because I don't believe most of it is at all possible. It is pure fantasy. I need some believability to enjoy my stories. I continued reading, hoping it would get back to some kind of reality, but it never did.There were however some really excellent observations, some worthy of quoting by someone, somewhere. There's one on how dogs show people what life is all about, eating, sleeping, going for walks and peeing when you need to - real good. I loved the reunion scene. I got lost in the ending. It was just too weird, but after reading the other reviews, that's what you guys like and enjoy so - eat it up.Re-read those first two lines and tell me they aren't some of the best two lines you have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Thank you for all of your reviews. They really helped me figure out this book. I had never read a Carroll book before. I bought this book because I liked the cover. And it confused the daylights out of me. The beginning of the book, the setup, was excellently written and cleverly devised, but then he seemed to forget the ending. The second half became a mismash of half plots and confusion."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"A strange novel!I'd found this title by chance; I'd been perusing some reviews on a fantasy title and a reviewer had mentioned this work as a interesting read.Rather than a true fantasy story, I'd have to classify this book in the paranormal horror (mild) genre. I must admit this is not one of my favorite themes and as a result, this tale did not really work for me.The story itself is well written and easy to read; it starts very innocently (so benignly in fact, that I almost quit this book after the first chapter or so because I was bored) and then proceeds to get more \\"strange\\" as it winds its way toward its conclusion.This novel was not exactly what I was looking or hoping for, but I 'm sure there are readers that enjoy this genre and may very well be pleased with this book."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"A long time Carroll-fan, I bought this novel in London a few weeks ago. I devoured it eagerly, but I felt somehow let down by the author (something that is becoming a Carroll habit of late...). The first half of the novel is a gem, wonderful. Just that is worth the book's price and more. By all means, read this novel, but be ready for a completely dissapointing second half. Once all the cards are laid on the table, Carroll seems unable to solve the plot he has devised. He indulges in some sort of metaphysical mystery tour that simply won't fly no matter how much you want to. It seems to this reader that Carroll writes without a plan, exploring the plot and the character's world as he advances, much like a reader of his own work. That makes for wonderful, exciting and surprising set-ups and disastrous conclusions. Usually, except for Land of Laughs, and Bones of the Moon, his novels tend to leave you blank because of a non-efective conclusion. They leave all the ends unsolved, untied and =, therefore, he kills his own wonderous construction by not topping it. Never in his work this has been more evident. I hope such a wonderful, unique and gifted novelist would be harder on himself when it comes to the basic nuts and bolts of plot and structure. I am sure he is capable of it. If he did, I dare say he would become the best novelist alive. As it stands now, he is marvelous rarity, the most beautiful of unfulfilled promises. I will continue to read anything he writes, and I encourage anybody to do so, if only in hope of that day he raises to his own standards."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I read this book because it had an interesting review in Locus. I like Carroll's approach, using the conventions of mainstream fiction to create atmophere and expectation. It gives an unusual, hybrid voice. I found the strange events that began in the middle of the book genuinely intriguing.However, the resolution to the mystery dissatisfied me. It seems bizarrely harsh to characterize the main character as a &quot;vampire&quot; based on her behavior up until that point. It is not foreshadowed; if it is intended to be a surprise, well, it is, but it never fully meshes with the rest of the text. The presentation of the idea that she has somehow drawn her husband away from his &quot;real life&quot; is unconvincing. And the suggestion that she liberate herself from vampire-hood by passing the trait on to her daughter is peculiar. Why wish such a state on her own daughter? It doesn't seem in character. For that matter, why give up immortality so quickly? I would have tried it out for a few hundred years at least. Carroll has interesting ideas, but I'd like to see him reflect more on their implications. The latter part of the book becomes repetitive and unfocussed.I like a more carefully-constructed work, but the first half is enjoyable reading. If the author can carry this over into a complete text, I would enjoy such a book very much."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Im so totally awestruck and in love that I HAD to run right in here and talk to you about it! I have never been so impressed with a writer. He doesn't do any fancy dancing--no literary gimmicks...but man oh man, this Carroll can WRITE!His newest book Marriage of the Sticks starts off in a very ordinary way--a high school reunion. So ordinary that I thought, uh oh...I'm going to be disappointed. But then he slowly starts introducing characters that I would LOVE to know! I really really want to sit down and talk to them.Every darn time he taps into something so odd yet familiar, something really appealing. I just don't know how he's doing this, but he writes about such interesting things and thoughts. And I've just read a couple of paragraphs that are worth the price of the book and the shipping from England! (it will be out here in september I think) Where does he GET these ideas???? I'm not saying what it is because it's too savory. You should come across it and discover it for yourself if you read this book. Now of course, one of the notions imbued in the reading of Carroll is a tension-ANYTHING could happen. So every knock on a door makes you wonder who might reappear; every dog that enters a room makes you ask...could this be Vanasque or someone I'll love?Every segment has some little surprise and delight. The main character in this one is a woman (&lt;G&gt;) and she deals in rare books and other precious objects. The incidental characters (at least I think they are) are intriguing and yet unexplained in full. But they have flesh even though they only pass through a scene or two. The ideas....the things he talks about . . . it's like taking a mental bubble bath; I just want to soak and roll in sheer delight.Can one fall in love just by reading a man's words, even though they're intended for millions? I feel so foolish, but this guy amazes me! Again!"},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"For over 10 years I have read and enjoyed Carroll's novels. Every one gives you the same sensation: things start out seemingly normal until little by little odd things start to happen. In this sense, he reminds me of Rachel Ingalls, another one of my favorite but obscure writers. Because the odd things creep up slowly, everything seems plausible until you end up in a mind-blowing fantasy world and wonder how the heck you got there! Elevators open up into other epochs, animals talk and people look strangely familiar even though you have never met them before. I have never read a Carroll novel in more than 1 sitting: once you start, you are completely hooked until the end. I can't understand why he's not one of the most famous writers in the USA -- he's very popular in Europe (lives in Vienna), but here you can barely find his books -- all his classics except a few recent ones are out of print. Do yourself a favor and read his latest one, The Marriage of Sticks, as an introduction -- it's excellent, although others are better. I love Bones of the Moon and Voices of our Shadow the most. He inspires all sorts of subversive thoughts -- in my case, Carroll makes me wish I'd stolen the public library copies I found of all his old books. Seek out all his books and let's bring Carroll back to mainstream America. He'll change how you think."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Every time Jonathan Carroll publishes a book I put my world on hold and happily go live in the new one he has created. The nicest thing about his books is I always get the feeling they are talking directly to me and not anyone else. The main character in THE MARRIAGE OF STICKS is a woman in her early thirties who is sort of stuck in her life and doesn't know which way to turn. Me too. But reading Carroll and seeing what he has to say about the subject helped in many ways for me to see my own problems more clearly and maybe even find a way through them. This has happened with every single book of his I have ever read and that is the main reason why I will go on reading Jonathan Carroll. As one of the blurbs say, his work is addictive."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Jonathan Carroll has written some of my favorite novels ever. LAND OF LAUGHS, BONES OF THE MOON, SLEEPING IN FLAME, and OUTSIDE THE DOG MUSEUM are all wonderful, insightful, brilliant. And as much as I wanted to like THE MARRIAGE OF STICKS, I just couldn't. It begins well and tugs you right in, but then about halfway through, it just sort of gives up the ghost (pun intended). From there on to the end, it's a sort of mishmash of trippy visionsquests, with an ending that is neither satisfying--as far as I was concerned--nor actually all that coherent. The characters are not particularly likeable; I never got the sense that they were real people. They came across, rather, as stock players with cool attributes, great one-liners, and the right clothes. And the sorts of little satoris that always happen to characters in Carroll novels, which in his best books really DO make you the reader gasp at the insight, are not, I'm sorry to say, particularly meaningful in this case. They are trite, or cute, or both. Often, in recent Carroll novels, this particular trait of his--like casually mentioned rock bands you never heard of, or Austrian street names--seems forced, as if he knows the readers expect it and doesn't want to let them down. But it doesn't work. If you want something great by Carroll, I recommend one of the early titles. But I can't recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"I just finished The Marriage of Sticks by Jonathan Carroll this morning, and it was a wonderful, bewildering experience. Reading Carroll is like talking to that exciting friend of yours; you know the one, the person that makes you go places you wouldn't normally go, see things you wouldn't normally see, talk to people you would normally stare at quietly from across the room. If you EVER see a book by Jonathan Carroll on the bookshelves (he's typically listed in the Literature section, alongside Don De Lillo and Chinua Achebe and J.G. Ballard and Kurt Vonnegut and those fortunate enough to have escaped genre classification), grab it and don't let go. His books are very hard to find nowadays, and it's a rare treat to see one in a store. Tor, lovely book publisher that they are, have taken to reprinting some of his earlier books in a trade paperback, and The Marriage of Sticks is one of them, though it only came out a few years ago. This is Carroll's second-to-latest novel, it is the most similar to The Wooden Sea, in respect to style and technique and storytellingness. And characterization. Carroll's characters simply leap off the page and whisper their story in your ear. He has the phenomenal ability of drawing you into the story, like a big brother at a campfire. Carroll's books are to be treasured, and to be snagged wherever you can manage to find a copy."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"Fans of Jonathan Carroll know what it's like to crave for something else by this man to read. So when The Marriage of Sticks came out, a sigh of relief was heard round the world. It's like a drug, and just when our DTs were getting their worst, we get another hit of Carroll. This is a magnificent book and absolutely beautiful in parts, which is hard to come by these days. If anyone cares what I think, I recommend this highly."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"A friend who knows my taste in books suggested I read Jonathan Carroll. She told me she was sure I would like his writing and she was right. I do. Although I bought three &quot;Carroll books,&quot; I chose to read &quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; first because it seemed the most interesting. I especially liked the fact that I would find elements of both fantasy and horror in this book.It seems to me that Carroll has what might be termed a &quot;cult following&quot; and this is, in one sense, a shame. While it's certainly not bad to have avid fans (I am now one of those fans), Carroll is such a good storyteller and such a first-rate writer that he really deserves to be far more widely read, especially in his native United States.The fantasy of Jonathan Carroll is not the fantasy of Marian Zimmer Bradley and her legends of Arthuriana. It is not the fantasy of Tolkien. Carroll's books do not contain kings and queens, wizards and warriors or frogs who become princes when kissed by fair princesses. Don't get me wrong; I like that kind of fantasy, but I love Carroll's own unique brand, too.Jonathan Carroll seems to write about everyday people in everyday settings. In the case of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks,&quot; the &quot;everyday&quot; people are Miranda Romanac and Hugh Oakley, both people who love, hate, make friends, have careers and families and pets and, on the surface, at least, seem to want to do the best in life.&quot;Seem to want,&quot; seems to be a crucial phrase when talking about a Jonathan Carroll book. For his characters seem to be far more than we would have guessed had we met them at a dinner party or an outdoor cafe. They have strange, sometimes macabre, undercurrents and emotional lives that are often in a state of constant turmoil. And this is what makes them so interesting and compelling and alive. Fascinating even. We love to read about them, but we sure wouldn't want to be one of them.The first half of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; belongs to Miranda and seems to be more of a realistic (though passionate) love story than anything supernatural. This is just part of Carroll's subtlety and delicacy and skill as a writer. When the supernatural elements make a stronger appearance, as they do in the second half of the book, we are well prepared for them, though we may not realize it at first.Miranda Romanac is a woman who wants, and needs, to love. She's a warm and giving person, but she is a warm and giving person with one huge flaw...she preys upon others in a most unique way. It is this one terrible flaw, personified in the character of Frances Hatch, that will come to overshadow and torment Miranda's life (and Hugh's) in the most terrible of ways.When Miranda and Hugh move into Frances' former home, Crane's View, the supernatural gains a firmer hold. I think the readers who didn't like the second half of this book might have rushed too quickly through the first half. I have a feeling that Carroll's subtle preparation for what is to come may be lost on readers who try to get to the end of the book too quickly. Jonathan Carroll is far too much of a gourmet feast to be rushed through; he needs to be savored.In the second half of &quot;The Marriage of Sticks,&quot; Carroll gradually peels away the layers of &quot;everyday&quot; veneer that gloss his characters to reveal who they really are and what horrors they must face. These revelations are extraordinary, fascinating, horrifying and, ultimately, haunting.I loved the way Carroll juxtaposed the mundane with the fantastic. For me, this made Miranda's situation all the more horrifying; it made it seem as though it could, very definitely, happen to me. Add to this Carroll's delicate, perfectly-nuanced, watercolor prose and you have a truly haunting book that you will never forget.&quot;The Marriage of Sticks&quot; is, in my opinion, a very underrated book and Jonathan Carroll is a very underrated writer. His is first-rate writing coupled with first-rate storytelling skills. When added together, they make for a rich, rewarding and enjoyable experience that is simply unique."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"As someone recently bit by the Carroll bug, I may not be the most impartial critic. Still I found this book was very enjoyable. I understand the swiftly shifting underlying cosmology of the novel will lose many readers. But it is this which drew me in deeper. Yes, the characters may seem alittle too privledged to connect with some but the underpinnings are sound. I like the fact that while Miranda is sympathetic that when the revelation about her character comes we are not unaware of her personal flaws up to this point. The key to much of the characterization is though we like the characters, we can see their shortcomings. How often do you see that?!Also having read The Wooden Sea first, I was thrilled to see Frannie again. It should be noted that Kissing The Beehive, this novel, and The Wooden Sea make a rather discrete trilogy of novels. While indvidual stories, they certainly lend a certain resonance to each other.So if you want something that entertains and provokes thought, you can't go wrong with Carroll. Not the best place to start - I read Sleeping in Flame first but would recommend The Wooden Sea as a good place to start - but still very good. Then again just pick one and jump in. Well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"There is a bitter sweet surreal quality about this book, that is often found in Jonathan Carroll's work that I find incredibly addictive. This novel offers glimpses into the selfishness of our world and also the fear that drives that me-me-meness. The magic of caring for another person to the point of rising above this emotional epidemic of our time shines as well as the price exacted by the wonder of it. Its a terrifying, wonderful piece of work...I only wish it were longer."},{"Title":"The Marriage of Sticks","review":"After reading 5 of Jonathan Carroll's novels, I am certain of this much: his stories, told in clear and urbane prose, are compelling page-turners that, much like British fantasist Graham Joyce's, straddle the threshold of reality and fantasy. In The Marriage of Sticks, Miranda, his first-person elderly narrator, recounts in her journal a life turned upside down after mysterious, seemingly coincidental occurrences begin taking place after attending a 15-year class reunion.What's so enjoyable about Carroll's writing is the investment he puts in to his protagonists. Miranda is no different: I found her to be a sympathetic, flawed, and likable narrator. Which is why the explanation of the strange phenomena in Miranda's life, revealed in the book's second half, left me a tad befuddled. Without giving too much away, it was hard for me to believe this character, who seemed to go through life without treating others with too much malice or magnanimity, was declared by Carroll as a metaphorical vampire!Now, Miranda seems neither more or less of a vampire than the rest of human kind, and that may be Carroll's point: to make his readers examine themselves and question their own actions. If Miranda is selfish though appears otherwise, might we also be guilty of a similar selfishness? Might our actions, like Miranda's, reverberate with all of those we touch in the world?Needless to say, The Marriage of Sticks is filled with wonderful observations about life - as are all of Carroll's books. Unfortunately, also like his other books, the fantasy element, the metaphysics that make up the Carroll-world, feel incomplete and are rendered a bit sloppily: too much explanation through dialogue of his surreal world, which eliminates much of the story's mystery. Of course, this short changing of a richer fantasy world is one of the reasons The Marriage of Sticks can clock in at under 300 pages. Ironically, one of Carroll's comendable traits is his ability to write such taut novels.I really enjoyed The Marriage of Sticks, and also highly recommend the related, semi-sequel The Wooden Sea. Carroll's books, regardless of your opinion on their merits, are essential reading to understanding what's happening in contemporary fantasy."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"The author had a good basic plot, unfortunately our hero, Will Monroe Jr., is a totally unsympathetic character. Monroe comes across as a British version of a whining, spoiled yuppie. In one breath he is crying about the kidnapping of his wife Beth, the next he is admiring his ex-girlfriend's body. Please give me a break! Frankly, I was hoping Monroe Jr. would meet his demise somewhere along the way. You guess it, he makes it to the end just fine. You could also see who was behind murders of the righteous men, it could only have been one of two characters from the book. I hope Bourne can write a better leading character the next time around."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I read a lot of thrillers, and THE RIGHTEOUS MEN is probably the weakest I've read in quite a few months. This is an obvious knock-off of THE DA VINCI CODE, except it's nowhere near as good or well-researched.The first part of this book plays out as a straightforward kidnapping story. Will Monroe is a reporter for the NEW YORK TIMES, and his wife has been abducted for reasons that are unknown to him. Since the kidnappers warn Monroe not to contact the cops, he investigates the kidnapping himself. His investigation leads him to a Hasidic Jewish community in Crown Heights, New York. This, in turn, leads him to discover a highly improbable conspiracy plot rooted in Jewish mysticism.This book has a potentially interesting story, but it's severely handicapped by pedestrian writing and cardboard characters. The lead character, Will Monroe, is a clueless bore, and is downright unlikable when he makes a sloppy pass at his ex-girlfriend when his wife is still missing. Monroe hates himself for doing this -- so why should the reader feel differently?Also, this plot is highly based on a series of highly unlikely coincidences. For example, what are the odds that Monroe's ex-girlfriend would happen to be an expert on the religious community that kidnapped his wife? Or that his best friend happens to be a brilliant computer expert who can track down the source of certain e-mail messages that Monroe receives? None of this is remotely believable. Even worse, it's not entertaining.There are puzzles in this book, just like the Da Vinci code, but most of them are boring and have little relevance to the plot. Plainly, they were just thrown in this novel to capitalize on THE DA VINCI CODE and its success.It's slapdash books like this that remind me how well constructed THE DA VINCI CODE really was. Avoid this one. There are much better thrillers out there that deserve your money."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"This was an exciting, intelligent thriller. My response to the many negative reviewers is that a prior knowledge of Jewish mysticism helps understand the premise of the novel. Having studied Jewish mysticism, I found the plot extremely plausible, and therefore much more frightening. I loved this book because I couldn't put it down, but also because of its unique premise. It also came across as very authentic, right down to the Yiddish words and phrases. A great, fun, enlightening reading experience."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Sam Bourne's The Righteous Men is a silly, ridiculously unbelievable tale of a young reporter's attempt to find his kidnapped wife and save the world from religious fundamentalists. The story is predictable (I guessed the \\"number one bad guy\\" from the first chapter), the hero is both banal and grossly shallow (he spends as much time salivating over his ex-girlfriend's body as he does worrying about his missing wife), and the writing is uninspired and ordinary. Well, that's not fair . . . Bourne DOES use a few rather amusing similes in his writing, such as this from page 258: \\"Will was pulled out of his hiding place like the meat from a sandwich.\\" That one had me in stitches for a full two minutes!Bottom line, Bourne insults both Jews and Christians equally, and he seems to know little about Hasidic culture or the Kabala that couldn't be learned in a fifteen minute Google search. The book's worst failing, I guess, is that there isn't one moment when this story is believable. Save your money . . . this one's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Picking it up at an airport (ok, so I have only myself to blame), the reviews on the cover looked quite good, promising strong plotline. However, it didn't take me long to get bored with a light stile of writing, a plot that never picks up speed (it just plain never gets going), and uninteresting characters. He works so hard describing Hasidic Jews in New York, but only makes it sound like he's trying too hard to make it interesting. Don't bother."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Since the \\"Davinci Code\\", several authors have attempted to pen novels based around obscure facts, speculations or concoctions from the past. Sam Bourne has done this with this book. Will Monroe is a New York Times investigative reporter who uncovers a plot to kill righteous men around the world. He becomes earnestly involved when his wife is kidnapped and held hostage. He investigations leads him to the Jewish neighborhood of Crown Heights in New York. As time runs out, Will enlists the help of former college mates to help him find out why these men are being killed.This book is just good enough to keep you going, but let me suggest that you do not even start this book if you do not want to be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"This was a very average thriller. It didn't provide a lot of thrills and the protagonist, as other reviewers have stated, is not all that likeable. The storyline is not that convincing and it certainly doesn't have the depth or science backing that Dan Brown acheives in his novels.Don't let the blurbs on the back cover convince you to buy it new. Buy it used or check it out at the local library."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"*****THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*****Chew on this line from page 127 (paperback): \\"Will could feel the confusion in his own adrenal gland\\" He could? His adrenal gland has consciousness, and Will can perceive the mental state of this gland? Maybe it is confused because he only has one gland doing the work of the two adrenal glands that most people have. You know the old saying \\"Two adrenal glands are better than one.\\"Or think about this: on page 159, a character enters a room on \\"Saturday, 8:10 A.M.\\" He is murdered mere moments later, and his killer then \\"stepped out into the night\\" on page 162. Then page 163 begins with \\"Saturday, 8:49 A.M.,\\" both scenes refering to events in the Eastern Time Zone.Or consider when our not-particularly-likable \\"hero\\" needs help from a computer whiz, it just so happens that his college roommate happens to be one. And when he needs information from a police officer, it just so happens that another college friend happens to be one, having conveniently risen through the ranks faster than almost anybody in the NYPD so he could be in a position to help out. Oh, this friend's life-long dream was to be a police officer, so of course he attended Columbia University, where they do not offer a degree in criminal justice. But even more convenient for our hero, when he needs someone with knowledge of the culture and traditions of Hassidic Jews, it turns out - unbeknownst to our hero - that his ex-girlfriend not only grew up in the Hassidic community that he needs to infiltrate, but she is also the ONLY female in the centuries-old history of this community to ever be educated in the deeper knowledge of the Hassidim, which had always been forbidden to women. How convenient.And then there is his mysterious ally who sends coded messages along the way. How convenient is it that the guy just happens to be at the next desk. And no matter how you try to rationalize it, there is simply no reason whatsoever that this ally could not have simply arranged a private meeting for a whispered conversation that would have settled everything in five minutes. Or less. I wish I had put no more than five minutes into this book."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"After picking this book up on a whim, I found it to be interesting, well written, and fun. It moves along as quickly as a Dan Brown or Clive Cussler mystery/adventure. There's enough description of real places and things that as you read, you learn a few things along the way. Between the characters and all the action, this is one of those books that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I recently took this book for my airplane read on a transatlantic flight. In such circs, one can generally finish anything. Even Moby Dick. I couldn't finish this.The book is advertised with the newest tag for any conspiracy theory yarn: \\"better than The DaVinci Code.\\" (Really, Brown should get royalties for all the people who use his book as reverse publicity. ) OK, I didn't like The Da Vinci Code, finding it shallow, sexist, outrageously plotted and lacking in character development.The Righteous Men is even worse.Will Monroe, the hero, is - as reviewers here have already said - about as irritating a protagonist as I've come across: shallow, self-regarding, arrogant, not too bright. Yes, he has fits of self-criticism for one bit of behavior or another, but the number of unacknowledged acts of jerk-dom he perpetrates far over-shadows the behaviors he regrets.The cover promises world travel; it must get packed into the last 80 pages, because Will goes only to the Pacific north-west and Brooklyn in the stuff I plowed through.I read until page 354, but I have no idea what the conspiracy might be. Around page 100, Will decides that his ex-girlfriend is the only person who can help him rescue his kidnapped wife. Because she's Jewish, don't you know. Like all those people at the NYTimes, where he works. But he doesn't go to any of those Jews. Oh no. Just the one with the hot body and the blue-streaked hair.In between daydreaming about the body parts of his ex, minimized by a name that's only initials, Will periodically goes wild thinking that the horrid Jews are going to kill - or worse - dear little Beth. There's no sane reason why they would kill her, but this is a real flash-back to those medieval tales where the wicked Jews' favorite hobby is randomly killing Christians, the cuter the better.Two-hundred pages on, Will and TC are still playing footsie and working on an absurd number of word puzzles from a maybe-dead maybe-not Hassid in Brooklyn.Sound boring?Massively. Boring with a nasty little hint of anti-Semitism, despite Bourne's fulsome thank-yous on the acknowledgments page.Buy Melville instead. Or even Dan Brown."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"A series of murders are happening all over the world. The slums of India, New York and the beautiful city of Cape town in South Africa. They cannot possibly be linked can they?New York Times reporter Will Monroe thinks not, that is until his stunning wife Beth is kidnapped. The men who have taken her seem ready to kill without any qualms whatsover. Is it already too late for Beth?Desperate to fine the whereabouts of his wife Will follows a sinister trail that leads him to a mysterious cult, fanatical followers of an age old religion. Now he must unravel the puzzle of ancient prophecies and riddles that are buried deep in the bible to find the secret that people are not afraid to kill for again and again.With more and more victims dying the clues that are wrapped in an ancient code need to be solved as time as running out . . . not only for Will, but for the whole of human kind.I found this book far better than the Da Vinci Code (and I enjoyed that). The book is fast paced and it is difficult to find a lull in the plot where you can put it down to get some sleep. It really is an enjoyable book. Feeding off the Da Vinci Code bandwagon? Possibly, to a degree, but well worth reading in it's own right. Like me, you may even think it is the better book."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Whilst obviously written in the wake of The Da Vinci Code...complete with a pseudonym that sounds remarkably similar, I still thought it was a good yarn.I was surprised at the fact that Will's life at one point, depended on a simple test to see if he was Jewish, that was by no means fool proof...but all in all an absorbing story.I enjoyed the Jewish history, the characters AND the plot...it's a fictional novel for goodness sake...if you want to read fact you need a different section of the library!"},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Sam Bourne's \\"The Righteous Men\\" features Will Monroe Jr., a journalist in his late twenties who is married to a beautiful psychiatrist named Beth. British-born Will is delighted to have landed a prestigious job at the New York Times, where he hopes to swiftly make his mark. Although he is a graduate of Oxford with a special interest in economics, his current assignment, a murder in Brooklyn, is far removed from his area of expertise. It seems that an unknown assailant repeatedly stabbed a forty-three year old black male and well-known pimp named Howard Macrae. Little does Will know that this seemingly mundane crime marks the beginning of an incredible odyssey that will change his life.To all outward appearances, the victim was what he appeared to be: \\"a certifiable card-carrying lowlife.\\" Much to his shock, the reporter finds out that, a while back, Macrae had done a good deed for a woman named Letitia, and she never forgot his act of kindness. She calls him \\"one of the most righteous men I have ever known.\\" Next, Will is sent to Washington State to cover the death of a gun-toting militiaman whose private life was also very different from his public persona. Will suspects that something strange is going on, but he has no clue as to what it is. What are the odds that a reporter will cover two murders in a row of men who appear to be evil, but who secretly help those in need? When Will learns that his wife has been kidnapped and her abductors warn him not to call the police, he resolves to get to the bottom of the mystery himself.\\"The Righteous Men\\" is a fast moving page-turner with a likeable hero. The author wisely depicts Will as an average individual who must struggle to keep his balance while his entire world is toppling around him. In the course of his arduous investigation, Will visits the highly structured and ritualized community of the Hasidim of Crown Heights, who, it turns out, have their own hidden agenda. Making matters even more complicated, Will gets a number of cryptic messages from an unknown source; he tries to decipher these puzzles with the help of a former lover named TC and an old friend and computer whiz, Tom Fontaine. Eventually, Will and TC realize that the key to explaining the bizarre events of recent weeks may lie in the pages of the Holy Bible and the Kabbalah.Bourne inserts enough details about his characters and their surroundings to inject a note of realism into an otherwise far-fetched story. At over four hundred pages, the book is a bit too long, and the melodramatic conclusion will strain most readers' credulity. However, the plot is engrossing and suspenseful enough to earn \\"The Righteous Men\\" a marginal recommendation. It will most likely satisfy the many readers who enjoy \\"Da Vinci Code\\" type thrillers."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I just finished this book and I agree with everyone about the character Will. Not likable. This book was painful to read...too much information presented as confusingly as possible.

Born in England of an American father and English mother, educated at Oxford, and now happily married to his medical doctor wife, Beth, Will is ready to make his mark.Then fate intervenes. A pimp in the Bronx is murdered. In covering the story Will hears a phrase that will later haunt him. The pimp, Harry Macrae, was a sinner-yet at the same time he was the most righteous man people who knew him had ever known. The story gives Will Monroe his first front page-and earns him the jealousy of more senior reporters.Will is sent out of town on an assignment that appears to be a wild goose chase-until he digs deeper and finds that the murdered Washington State militia man was also called a righteous man by the doctor who was the only one that knew he had secretly donated a kidney.Then Will's wife Beth is kidnapped by people who want him to stop probing into the connections between these and other men all uniquely termed \\"righteous\\" who are being murdered all over the world. Beth will be safe, but Will must leave things alone, and not contact any authorities. Will finds himself calling on an ex-lover with a knowledge of the Hassidic community and a college friend who is a computer whiz to try to find out what's going on-and what he can do to get his wife back.Bourne creates a compelling story with plot twists in almost every chapter. From Will's judge father, whom he know only from summers spent at Sag Harbor, to the new executive editor of the Times who is an evangelical Christian, to the Rabbis of Covenant Heights, the reader is treated to a cast of colorful characters who throw out red herrings left and right.Armchair Interviews says: Only in the final few pages will the plot really be revealed and only an extremely astute reader will be remotely on the right track of \\"who dun it\\"!"},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I disagree that this book is a Da Vinci Code knock-off.

Then his wife is kidnapped because of what he knows. His investigation brings him in the heart of the jewish orthodox community, where he learns a lot about the kabbala, the end of the world and the lamed vav, the 36 righteous men.I give the book 4 stars because for once this is a religious thriller that has nothing to do with Mary Magdalene or Jesus Christ. Thank God ! You also learn a lot about judaism and the story of the lamed vav is very interesting. It is a nice read.But... some things are just too good to be true. Isn't it a coincidence that Will's ex-girlfriend is jewish? And that his best friend is a computer expert? Not ! The end is also incredibly predictable.

I was on a flight from London to New York this past Saturday, and I was browsing through the bookstore at Heathrow when I saw this book. Knowing nothing about the book or its author, I decided to take a chance and reluctantly plunked down 7 pounds (almost $14!) to have something to read on the plane. Boy, am I glad I did! I literally could not put the book down, and fortunately I was able to finish it before the flight ended (I am extremely fast reader). It's rare that I want a flight to last longer but that was the case with this book! It was absolutely riveting and filled with tension and never dragged like many other books. Also, this author really knows how to write, and fortunately there were no grammatical errors as one often finds in many books today.I thought this was going to be a ripoff of The Da Vinci Code, and certainly the cover might lead you to believe so, but this is a phenomenal story that, although religiously based, is completely different. It was also quite educational to me about Hasidic Jews. I live in New York City and see these guys running around all the time, and now I understand them a lot better.I looked online to see what other books this author has written and was disappointed to find that this is his first novel. I'm anxiously awaiting another novel by this gentleman and hope that he comes out with something else soon. I'm going to heartily recommend this book to all of my friends.

However, there's nothing more painful than figuring out a story's ending and then reading 200+ pages for the supposedly bright and talented protagonist to figure it out also."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"This book was a very pleasant surprise as it was plotted well and the story kept this reader in suspense with numerous twists existing. Will Monroe is a fledgeling reporter for the New York Times who receives a call concerning the death of a pimp in New York City. As he delves into the death, our protaginist realizes that there is much more to this murder than what appears on the surface. Without going into the detils of the story, other deaths begin tking place in various cities around the Globe. The job of this reporter is to find the common thread which connects these deaths. It takes him to various areas in the State of New York and he becomes involved with religious fanatics. This may seem like a ripoff of the Da Vinci Code, yet this book stands on its own. Although the development of characters is weak and the reality of some of this story is far fetched, the book is certainly well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"There's probably an enjoyable- if forgettable- fifty page novella in this book. Unfortunately, it resides within over four hundred pages of needlessly bloated novel, a length which gives the reader plenty of time to get frustrated with the lethargic pace of its first three quarters and fuels frustration and disgust with the ludicrousness of its long-awaited revelations. In a novella, these revelations might have led to amusement and perhaps a willing suspension of disbelief; in a work of this length, they lead to wondering how one could have been forced to read all \\"this\\" in service of \\"that\\".Other flaws: The introduction of minor throwaway characters as required to service the plot (the guy in the newsroom who can provide x, the computer expert to give information y, the cop to offer tidbit z.) The presence of \\"intermission\\" chapters taking the narrative away from the protagonist, sequences that are needless after the first and whose outcome is never in question, making them irritating distractions. And the anonymous source who provides coded clues the protaganist really oughtn't to be able figure out, barring author-like insight. (The source's clues are in code so as not to tip off their associates... As if sending dozens of cryptic text messages to the protaganist is somehow less than suspicious?...)Hopefully, if Mr. \\"Bourne\\" continues to author novels, he will learn from the writing of this one that having a single idea is not enough without the craft to make the readers eager to follow.Minor spoiler: One important revelation of the last hundred-odd pages is that the deciphering of particular segments of Hebrew scripture leads to the locations of specific individuals. These locations are listed by year, and for the modern year, they take the form of GPS COORDINATES. Putting aside that means of working out longitude was a few millennia away from discovery at the time of the works' authorship, are we to understand that these individuals remain at these precise coordinates for an entire year? The Lord does work in mysterious ways- but it seems the more likely explanation is that the author works in highly implausible ones."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Like a couple of dozen other books, the blurbs on this book compares it to The Da Vinci Code, and there are similarities, but not many. Say what you will about The Da Vinci Code, it was a fast-paced and fun read. \\"The Righteous Men\\" suffers from an uneven pace, and if you thought The Da Vinci Code was unbelievable, this one is much more far-fetched. To begin with, the main premise is unbelievable, even supernatural, and then the plot has way too many convenient coincidences.Despite its flaws, \\"The Righteous Men\\" is somewhat entertaining. For his next novel, I hope Bourne tightens up the pace, and doesn't write long explanations for things we already figured out (this is especially true for the epilogue). Don't put this book first on your shopping list, but if you need something to read on the beach or on a flight, you could give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Similarities to Da Vinci Code do exist in this book, however, the plot is much lighter - despite what it says on the jacket cover. Instead of an inside tour through Catholicism, we have an inside tour through Hasidic life, which I found fascinating. The plot was woven enough that the ending was a bit of a surprise, although one knew with all the pointing of fingers, that the ending would not be what was expected. Character development was good. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to other books by the author."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I don't usually read airport books- glossy covered thrillers splattered with blurbs that echo the urgency of a sideshow barker, and usually contain the words \\"roller-coaster ride\\"- but as I happed to be in an airport with a long flight ahead of me, I decided to condescend to the genre and chew on some mind candy for 6 hours. I was not too impressed.First of all, the writing was mediocre at best. It wasn't as bad as Dan Brown's, but certainly well below what I expected from someone who went to Oxford and writes for the Guardian. The plot started off somewhat interesting- a couple of mysterious murders, a reporter's wife gets kidnapped- but it quickly devolves into a bizarre and unbelievably far-fetched story revolving around the Hasidic Jews of Brooklyn and Talmudic legend. Almost imperceptibly, our protagonist finds himself allied with his wife's kidnappers, yet doesn't bother to demand her immediate release or even find out why she is being held. That nonsensical tidbit is revealed in the book's ridiculous climax, which I won't reveal. With a left-wing author with the name of Freedland, you can very easily guess who the real villains are. (no, not the Catholic Church- surprisingly enough- but close!) You can safely skip this one, unless you yourself are writing a book about cheesy religious thrillers that were written to profit off of the Davinci Code's success."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Interesting. Excellent thesis but unfortunately the delivery was average at best. Poor character development that left much of the story lacking. I did enjoy delving into the esoterica of the Jewish religion. Learning about the mysteries of the Kabbala is always interesting and insightful. Unfortunately, the \\"quick\\" paced story repeatedly bogged down. Matching action to book length is always difficult and requires the magic of storytelling. Mr. Bourne is just not up to the task. Few plot twists as by the book's halfway point much of the ending is figured out. Still a reasonable read for that weekend by the beach when it rains.Ending left much to be desired. One word sums up this book - Bland.Recommend waiting for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I do a fair amount of reading but usually don't end up writing a review.

But its so poorly written and drawn out that it fell apart on its own. I didnt give it one star because I did finish it (maybe I just wanted to say I gave it a chance. Pros are it flashes to the actual righteous men of the world getting killed one by one and their stories make you feel good and actually want to perform good deeds of your own. The cons are: he does such a poor job of expressing a husband looking for their kidnapped wife and his emotions. He has to write in that he is getting angry he can't find her, are you kidding me? And the whole ex girlfriend thing is ridiculous. He talks about her smell and their afternoons spent indoors about 40 times.As for a spin off on da vinvi code, I dont really see any similarities at all. Including da vinci code was good and this was not."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"A new writing style, of educating the readers on a particular subject while running at a crazy pace to solver murder mysteries, came into existence with da vinci code. Though not the first of its kind, it was one of the few which became popular in this style.Similar is the style followed by Sam Bourne in \\"The Righteous Men\\". But the content is too shallow to hold water. For a thriller, it keeps the reader interested, but i think some of the plots were too obvious and rest were coincidental that nobody could have guessed it.Puzzles in this particularly are not very interesting, as much as in Dan Browns. Suddenly the characters come up with a technique to break a encrypted message and they move on, no clue why is that the rite thing to do on that message. And in the next instance, they use another technique to crack it and again no justification why this is the technique other than the fact that if he use the same through the book, it will be obvious.Even with all these short comings, i still think this is a good read for thriller lovers."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Before reading 'The Righteous Man', I must admit I had low expectations. Perhaps the similarity of the book's cover to those of 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' prompted me to assume that this would merely be a poorly written novel, attempting to cash in on the success of Dan Brown's library.However, having just finished reading this book, I can honestly say that it has easily surpassed any book I have read in recent years, including the book that everybody seems to compare this to: 'The Da Vinci Code'.The characters in 'The Righteous Man' feel more human and are far more believable; i personally related with the protagonist, Will, in a way I cannot say I have many times before with characters in books. The writing style that Jonathan Freedland uses throughout the novel is gripping and feels very personal, and the way in which he weaves together pieces of a puzzle that didn't seem to be related to begin with so believably and with such flow is truly astounding. I'd rather not give away any spoilers from the book. I can only strongly suggest that you give this book a read!"},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Many before either loved this book or just didn't like it for a variety of reasons. I have had the book for sometime, but just picked it up to read because the primise seemed intriguing. I was right about that for me.

I now wonder \\"who are the 36?\\"."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"As one of the many 'DaVinci Code' clones, Bourne's novel does better than most in presenting a thrilling read. The concept of 36 righteous men upholding the existence of the world (and what happens if they are all murdered) is a neat one, but I felt the book lacking on many levels. The basic plot, concerning Will Monroe, a British-American journalist in New York, whose wife goes missing -- later found to be kidnapped by Orthodox Jews in Crown Heights -- is properly convoluted, and the supporting characters of Tom, TC, and Rabbi Freilich are well drawn. However, Will Monroe himself is, for lack of a better way to write it, rather stupid. The way Bourne presents the Jewish community is as if no one has any understanding of the religion, and seems, at least to me, simplistic. Will seems rather dense at times (you could argue, due to the shock of his wife's disappearance), and without his former girlfriend TC, would never have solved the mystery himself. I guessed the end midway through the book (not a good sign), and found myself slightly angry at Will and his density. I would say this novel is worth reading, but it's not the big mystery it purports to be."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I enjoyed THE RIGHTEOUS MEN, for all the Hassidic cultural things the author got right, but one not familiar with Kabbalistic Judaism would miss. Like the DeVinci Code, or The Red Tent -- fictionalizing religious worlds involves arcane vocabulary that requires exposition; necessary narratives that slow the action down. It's tough to pull off, but I think it's done well here. The legend of the 36 Righteous is a good \\"what if\\", but the way they were found -- gamatria codes, was a stretch; but hey -- it was a stretch consistent with the context. All-in-all, an entertaining read that highlights the joy and kindness within the Crown Heights world."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"The first part of the book was very good Liked the characters and the way it developed. Everything came together in the end but the kay was so too unbelieveable."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I loved this book to the extent of recommending it to friends and a book club. Very intriguing."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"I really enjoyed this. I am sorry butI do have to compare it the the DaVinci Code. I like learning about the 36 righteous men. It held my interest to the end. It gave me something to read and I wondered what would happen next. I rarely read these kind of books. I usually read women's fiction. But, I like the delving into the kabbalah and the righteous men. Something I don't know anything about. Maybe, because I am jewish it held my interest. And you never hear anything about the ultraorthodox(Chabad)."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Will Monroe, a rookie journalist for The New York Times, is trying his best to impress his superiors and his colleagues. His first assignment, \\"your garden variety gangland killing\\" will not make the front page unless he makes it into a bigger story.Will digs deeper in an effort to find something interesting, something newsworthy, and something that will get Will's name on the front page of The New York Times. Will Monroe gets his front page, but at what cost?Howard Macrae, the person who is now the corpse lying, covered in a blanket, on the dirty streets of Manhattan is not what he seems. To everyone who was acquainted with him, he was a pimp, an exploiter and a user of women. But to one woman, perhaps the one who knew him better than anyone else, he was a saviour, a righteous man.Will Monroe is intrigued by Howard Macrae's story, but does not think much more of it. Howard Macrae was only his means of getting that front-page slot. His next assignment, the death of Pat Baxter, considered by most to be a Unabomber, seems similar to the previous case; Pat Baxter, a man who had a dangerous and militant reputation was not what most people perceived him to be. He was another righteous man.Will Monroe stumbles across more and more of these \`Righteous Men' and becomes buried deeper into a world that is dangerous for him and all who care for him.The Righteous Men is a wonderfully fast-paced tale set, in a well-researched religious backdrop. Every character that emerges is pivotal to the plot and their own predicaments usually only add to what turns out to be, for Will Monroe, a race against time to solve the clues and save the person most dear to his heart.Of course, books of this type will inevitably be compared to The Da Vinci Code (I am sure The Righteous Men will do as much for the Hassidic religion as its counterpart has done for Opus Dei). But The Righteous Men stands on its own as a very enjoyable thriller that may not have you guessing to the very end, but will certainly let you to enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"After reading the word \\"righteous\\" one too many times, I had no trouble figuring huge chunks of the plot, as will anyone literate in Judaism. In short, the plot is predictable, and odd coincidences are just rabbits pulled out of the writer's hat, I regret having to say. This book is good for those who need to pass the time in an airport waiting room; it moves fast, but the characters need greater development than they have here. There are also inconsistencies in the plot--the book could have used some critical copy-editing. The book is is fast-moving, and, I grant, more believable than the Dan Brown series."},{"Title":"The Righteous Men","review":"Considered in a book review as better than the DV Code, it isn't. Good in parts, silly in others. Might enthral Jewish readers more."},{"Title":"Appleby House","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but I can't quite put my finger on why. I think a previous reviewer was on to something when she said it was cozy. It's just a book about the little details of the lives of some ordinary people who live in the same boarding house. There's not much in the way of plot, nor are any great secrets of the universe revealed. It reminds me of Carnival the Souls minus the supernatural element. If that sounds as appealing to you as it does to me, I recommend you read Appleby House."},{"Title":"Appleby House","review":"I can't really articulate what it is exactly about this book that I love, but I thought it was a terrific little read. It's the mid-80's and a then 38-year-old Sylvia Smith moves into a small furnished room in a house in east London. Her housemates include Sharon, an art student and her boyfriend (shhhh--he's not supposed to to live there); Laura, an odd, seemingly angry, single thirty-one-year-old woman; Susanna, a twenty-something woman and her teenage sister (shhhh--the sister's not supposed to live there, either); and Tracy, a twenty-four-year-old woman recently separated from her husband. Smith recounts her year living in the house and describes the dynamics between the residents. Everyone hates Laura and Laura hates everyone else. From the weird aspects of the house (putting change not only in the telephone, but the bath heater and kitchen stove as well); to Mr. and Mrs. Appleby, the sweet, older couple who own the house, Smith entertains the reader with her simple life in a house that, is a lot of the time, anything but simple. Smith's writing style is straightforward and draws one in immediately.There's just something charming about this book. It's a super-fast read, but hard to put down. It wasn't anything that I expected at all--I'm thinking London in the 80's: a lively, rocking house with lots of punk, parties, drinking, and drugs. With the exception of a few glasses of wine mentioned, none of the above made an appearance. To me it seemed more like the setting was the 50's or 60's rather than the 80's. But the drama makes up for the missing drugs and rock and roll. And the cozy feeling of the book made it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Appleby House","review":"I read this book in no time at all.

I didn't want to finish the book, but thought \\"there has to be something here.\\" Alas, I didn't find it. Sylvia moves into a flat, meets other people in the building ( most of whom don't get along), and then at book's end has to move out when the building is sold. There is no more story than that. There is no meat in the dialogue. I kept waiting, and waiting...There is NOTHING there."},{"Title":"Appleby House","review":"The overview on the book flap claims that this book is hilarious, a real page turner. However, the book must not be more than 20,000 words and is boring. Writing technique is bad too. Gee, if this is all it takes to be published, then what am I waiting for? I encourged my husband to read the book, not because it was interesting or funny, but because he himself wants to publish a novel and I thought it would give him a boost in his confidence. Now about the story itself: the book centers around a woman living in some kind of cheap apartment house in England, and describes what I guess are supposed to be quirky housemates. I can't understand why the author thought these people were interesting enough to write about. Their day to day lives are incredibly boring. However, a person with writing talent might have been able to do a better job. If you are curious about the book, check it out of a library, like I did, and don't waste your money buying it (sorry, Amazon.com, I know you're trying to sell books).

The plot concerns a mother, Mrs. Bennet whose sole purpose in life is to see her daughters married. That's it. End of story and yet Ms. Austin takes several hundred pages to repeat this Theme Ad Nauseam.One has to remember that this book was written in a time when the only four things to do at night were get drunk, sleep, read or make love and some people did all 4 of these things in one lonely night!!!Ms. Austin takes full advantage of this and decides she has a story worth telling which is without plot, believable characters or any hint of suspense or excitement.

Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This timeless classic by Jane Austin is probably the best illustration of why we should not let ourselves be guided by first impressions. Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them. Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad). She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him. I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it. Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham. She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written. There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action. I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.I also loved the believableness of her characters. Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era. I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well. Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader. Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. A review in here got me thinking though. They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective. This person is wrong, simple as that. Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter! I mean really! What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years. Pride and Prejudice has done this. It is &quot;better&quot; than other books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run. Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years.

She realized that people are complex, and included their different sides in these characters. It's a feel good book, and we need those once in a while. Its like a mature fairy tale. This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gave me an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\" It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"this is definitely an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. i believe that the subtleties and simplicity of the story is what makes it the masterpiece it is. Jane Austen's ability to turn a simple love story, into something greater, while completely engrossing us without the fluff of a typical romance are what make her a literary genuis in her own right. her novels are literary dessert. they aren't filled with the complexities and deep themes of dickens', hardy's, or eliot's works, they are light-hearted and this very fact is what makes pride and prejudice an amazng piece of art. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. The characters, their lives, the struggles they face, the decisions (and indecisions), and most importanty their eventual happiness are what make the book. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved this book! Once I started reading, I could not stop.It has a similar plot line to Sense & Sensibility, but S&S; moves very sloooooww. P&P; was much more enjoyable & interesting. I plan on reading it again soon.Because of the era it was written, some of the language is hard to understand & some conversations in the book, I had no clue what they were talking about. But overall it was understandable.As some people have stated, I did notice a lot of typos in the free Kindle version. It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of my favorite Authors of all time if your looking for a classical romance this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself.

And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle.

Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written. Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility.

After paragraph after paragraph of needless description and rhetoric, one must scrounge up what's left inside their brain after it being destroyed by Jane Austen's pointless circumlocution to dig up what was actually said in modern English.

I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved. Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed? It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for. I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?I'm not sure if I will be reading another.Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording.

Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens.

I also think Elizabeth is great heroin. the only thing I didn't like about the book is that the famly is so worried about the father dying and he doesn't even die. So what was the use of worrying. I also feel that Jane Austen was a great author and really wrote what womwn felt during the time when very few women wrote. What do men know what women feel. What gave men the right to write when they don't even know what women felt during that time. But I feel now that women and men are egual.

Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy!

I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout.

I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to.

I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty.

It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those novels which most people know the plot and the characters even if they haven't read the book. For myself, I had not read it in a long time, and I had also not seen any of the movies made using its plot, with the exception of the musical \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" a few years ago. I finally made time for it, and it was better than I had remembered. This was the second of Austen's novels to be published (published on January 28th, 1813), though the original novel (titled \\"First Impressions\\") was written between 1796 and 1797. There is no way to determine how much of the original novel remains and how much was rewritten, but clearly the two dealt on a larger scale with the some of the same themes.The main character of the story is Elizabeth Bennet who lives with her parents and her four sisters in the fictional town of Meryton. Elizabeth is the second eldest of the sisters after Jane. Outside of the Bennets, there is a large cast of characters including the three Bingley's, brother and two sisters, Mr. Collins, The Darcy's, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Lucases, Mr. Wickham, and the Gardiner's who are Elizabeth's aunt and uncle. The novel is told in three volumes, the first covers the period at Meryton where most of the key characters meet for the first time, the second covers the period after Bingley leaves Meryton unexpectedly along with those who came with him, and covers the period up to Elizabeth's visit to Mr. Darcy's home know as Pemberley, and the last covers the visit to Pemberley right through to the marriages and beyond.There are several plots running through the volumes. There is the relationship between Bingley and Jane, which Mr. Darcy tries to put an end to, along with the help of Mr. Bingley's sisters. There is Mr. Collins attempts to marry either Jane or Elizabeth, but ending up with Charlotte Lucas. There is the relationship between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy as well as between their families. There is Lydia's scandalous running off in volume three. But by far the mail story line is the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In volume one, Mr. Darcy arrives as the guest of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy's prideful manner results in a negative first impression with Elizabeth whose pride is hurt by his attitude and she develops her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy as a result. Mr. Darcy becomes intrigued with Elizabeth, but her own negative impression of him is reinforced by stories told by Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy's silent attitude towards her which she takes as his looking down on her. Thus, first impressions play a big role in the story, though to be sure other first impressions, such as the first impression of Mr. Collins which is shared by nearly everyone are fairly accurate.In volume two, their relationship develops. Mr. Darcy cannot ignore the feelings he has developed for Elizabeth and this results in three key events in this volume. One is Mr. Darcy's declaration of feelings to Elizabeth. The second is Elizabeth's stern rebuke of Mr. Darcy's feelings followed by an attack on his behavior towards the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley as well as Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham. This leads to the third key event, which is Mr. Darcy's letter to Elizabeth where he sets the matter straight about his actions. The second event results in Mr. Darcy writing the letter and changing his behavior, though we don't witness the latter until volume three. The third event is important as the reader is privy to Elizabeth's change in attitude resulting from what Mr. Darcy has told her.In volume three, their relationship completes its change, as Elizabeth gets to know Mr. Darcy from where he lives, and by those who work for him, and she also learns about his character from actions he takes on behalf of her family, which he never means her to learn about. We also witness the change in Mr. Darcy's behavior, not only towards Jane, but towards her entire family. Of course, it is obvious that the two will end up together, but knowing the end does not spoil the journey.There is good reason why this book is a classic and why it is still read and enjoyed today. The characters are believable and well rounded for the most part. There is humor, societal and family challenges, and moral lessons weaved together throughout the book. I can also recommend the Penguin Classics edition of this book, as it contains an introduction and notes by Vivien Jones, as well as an introduction written by Tony Tanner for an earlier edition of the book. The introductions are both interesting reading, and the notes are useful as well."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The Book:Dover Publications does it again. This has to be the ultimate reasonably-priced edition of Pride and Prejudice you could ever get your hands on. Don't be fooled by the image of the stuffy dust cover; underneath the beige paper is a red cloth-bound, gold-printed cover which would enhance the finest library. The endpapers are embossed with a floral design, which is a lovely touch.This is a republication of an 1894 edition, in which the typography is perfect - that is, there are fewer words to a page making it easy on the eyes, while your progress through the book goes rapidly through its 476 pages. The paper is high-quality yet lightweight, which is great for a large hardcover like this. But the best features this edition has are the original Victorian-era illustrations by Hugh Thomson. Just...beautiful!The Story:Reviewing a classic like this almost feels silly, so I will do so briefly. The story moves slowly from \\"interesting\\" to \\"greatness.\\" For the first third or so it seemed like a funny, lightweight girly-gossip novel, and I kept thinking, \\"This book has got nothing on Jane Eyre!\\" Then it took a twist, and another, and got complicated, and the characters were developed, and the story darkened and I got totally sucked in until I could not put it down. Yep. Classic. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I feel fully unqualified to pass judgment on Jane Austen, it is true. But I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus of acclamation that has attended it for decades. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book--a masterpiece because of its writing (difficult and archaic, but beautiful), its plot (excellently woven and fully believable), and its characters (in whom Austen has perfectly captured the tendencies and caprice of human nature). It is lovable, enthralling, candid, and resonating.I don't like writing reviews that make the product sound flawless... except in this case, where I really believe it to be so."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice has long been my favorite book. But I must say, this edition is my favorite. The side notes are helpful in clearing up details that of the era which we don't understand. I would definately recommend this edition of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history. Sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett are of a marrying age. When a handsome and wealthy young man comes to stay in their neighborhood, the Bennetts waste little time making his acquaintance. It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly. Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances. Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood. Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy. Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom. That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner. Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel. I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries. The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators. None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading.

This book tell us about the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt. It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice. The best chapter was the last one when Mr. Darcy goes to Elizabeth's house and they tell each other about their feelings, and Mr. Bingley and Jane got together too. I would give this book five stars because this is a great book of love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In my view,I think Jane Austen is a very successful author and I enjoy reading her book very much.For example,Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility,especially Pride and Prejudice.All are very perfect works but Pride and prejudice has always been the most popular of her books.And this novel is now available in new movie version.I think it must be very exciting.Pride and Prejudice is widely-read and well-loved.The story is about the love between Elizabeth and Darcy and it is really romantic which readers can easily fall into the role and know their feeling.Also,this book is centrally concerned with personnal happiness and Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy-tall,handsome and rich man-is the stuff of wish -fulfilment.If you want to know more about the story,you must read this book&quot;Pride and Prejudcie&quot; as soon as possible.Because it is really a wonderful fiction and a romantic love story.hope you enjoy this nice book.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Well, I first read Pride and Prejudice while in 10th grade and I fell in love with the book and its characters. I finished it in about 2 days while the rest of my class were reading the required amount each day. Lol, I became very ahead of my class for this book.The book is just so universal. It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time. Which is why I related to it, I could see what happened in the book could very likely happen in my time(and I wouldn't mind it happening to me, ;).)Also, I like the strength of Elizabeth's character. She is smart and witty and has a mind of her own. She doesn't allow her mother to pressure her into anything she doesn't want.I highly recommend this book, so go out and read it today,...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is one of the best writing of Jane Austen's.The title aptly says in a few words what the wholestory was about. Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa? It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways. They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was probably one of the first novels I read during this time period. The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is. For the reasons already stated here by others and many more I love this book! I have read it a good 10 times and I never seem to tire of it. Through a stroke of genius that is purely her, Jane Austen has created timeless characters that manage to capture your heart. The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Wonderful writing, great characterisation, and themes that aren't so outdated as you might expect. The book is difficult to plod through, but once you get used to the intricate writing and you look past the rather uninteresting plot, you'll be surprised when you really start enjoying yourself.Pride and Prejudice is a classic in its own right!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice turned out to be a well involved tale of drama and romance. At first the book runs slowly, sometimes getting off the point and losing interest, but in a whole, when you finish reading the last page, you know you've read something great. The book truly tells a tale of pride and prejudice. Along with the many other stories involving other characters, the main interset is about two people- Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth along with her sister Jane and others are all finding their way into marriage, when two men Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come along. Mr. Darcy at first appearence is a crude proud man who does not involve himself in social confrantation, while Mr. Bingley comes to be a charming well wittted man. The story continues on with marriage proposals, refusals, and devious scandals. In Pride and Prejudice, many characters develop. Jane Austin creates their stories very well but sometimes as I was reading, I felt that there were too many people and I found it hard to keep up and get involved with it. But in a way, that was also the beauty of the story.So if you are intersted in this book, you have to be willing to be patient. But it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century. Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters. Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters. The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions. As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well. We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man. His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter. Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together. Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college. Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book. A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary. Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England. Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with. Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances.

I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it.

Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book...it is a look into the window of how people use to behave in such a comical fashion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Dearest Readers of the century first and twentyith,I prooffer my highest and most esteemed recommendation of this fine book. Be not intimidated by formal British writing style of nearly 200 years ago, the occasional serpentine sentence, and words not oft' seen since the SAT exams (if at all). You will be highly rewarded with a most engaging story, skilled character development, and above all, acerbic wit. I trust you will be as delighted as this reviewer to have the felicity of reading this book.Very truly yours...P.S. Any 21st century western female reading this book will likely be as relieved as I am that we no longer live in a society where property conveys automatically to men, and women are totally dependent on men for their support. It's easy to understand why one character married for money and security only, and why the protognist's mother was completely obssessed with marrying off her daughters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations.

Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book. I had never heard of the bed books before and I can't get used to the sideways printing. Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work. I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men. A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth. As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society. Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life. Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming. Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading. And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen. The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly. The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write. It's the perfect addition to any library!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin is a very interesting novel. It not only tells but also, shows what young women went though in the 18th century. Elizabeth Bennett faces many expirences that women go through today. From getting maried to dealing with friends, family, and men from a day to day basis. Elizabeth has seven sisters who are also going through the same expirences. She is closest to her oldest sister Jane. They seem to understand each other the best. The mother is the most interesting charatcter out of the whole novel because she wants the best for her daughters and tries to live their lives for all seven of them. Elizabeth does not let her mother do this and in the end her mother disowns her. This novel teaches what is worth in life and what is not.You should only do what is right for your self and on one else.This novel gives you hope that in any life you can become your own self and not be criticized for your own actions or how you think. This is a great novel and if you read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text. This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"P&P is a book I come back to every couple of years. I first met Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet when I was a young teen. I never tire of this book. For anyone who has only seen the movie, I urge you to read the book as well. Nobody writes like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons. For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today. The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life. Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published. Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today. By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years. The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago. This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written. Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand. In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be. Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read. At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks. This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I have read it many times. The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried. There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen. Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I won't presume to review Austen, so this review covers the quality of the Penguin release. Many of us have discovered that the \\"free\\" ebooks on Gutenburg and other sites frequently have such poor formatting that they are irritating to read. One can either re-edit the book to fix the problems, or just live with them and have an inferior and annoying reading experience.Penguin's P&P; is the closest ebook equivalent to the joy of reading a quality physical book--the text is perfectly formatted for the Kindle, it's been proofed, and the supplemental material is almost overwhelming. Detailed intros, useful hyperlinking and a wealth of information on Austen's times, including fashion, furniture, and food and drink, are included. It's truly an immersive experience.I believe this book will be seen as a turning point for ebooks: the point at which editorial and publishing quality became a significant purchase criterion. Early ebook adopters (myself included) were willing to spend hours cleaning up Gutenburg editions and formatting them for the device du jour. No longer. The ebook is moving past the early adopter stage and is making inroads into a market that expects quality editing, publishing, and supplemental materials. I'll definitely pay a reasonable amount for an ebook that I can just start reading, instead of tinkering with, and that provides a comfortable feeling of having gotten one's money's worth.Penguin has set the bar for ebook quality with this release. I urge anyone with a Kindle to get a copy--*this* is the ebook experience we've been wanting."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This particular book is delightfully illustrated. I have three P&P books and this is the most treasured of all. Not only the novel itself is wonderful to read, but also the illustrations are beautiful to look at.

You will agree when you open this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Okay, I admit it: I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV. But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had to read \\"Emma\\" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all. Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go). Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute. The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening. Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Wow! What else do you say after you read such an incredible book? Jane Austen's timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don't you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this intricately woven plot. Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the prize). This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament back then. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all, you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. However, don't stop after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them all. (It won't take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there weren't more) Jane Austen's work is incredible; the only fault I find is that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it won't be a chore to read it again, more like opening a treasure chest."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"No need to review the book itself. What I want to address are the hyper linked notes and footnotes.One of the big criticisms of other books on the Kindle is that it was very hard to access notes and footnotes. It was so much trouble, that most people did not even bother.Penguin has figured it out! They have hyperlinked the notes and the footnotes, so that you can get right to them with your Kindle scroll wheel, and not lose your place in the book.More publishers need to do the same!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version is far and away the weakest."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you- are over 20s- want to have a girlfriend- can't understand womenthen you must read this book.Also it is free for a while. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read this book.

I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story. If you want to read a love story, read this book. If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up. I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"But I'm going to read it now and find out--have just in fact borrowed the book itself this minute from me local library where Pat, a woman as it turns out and a reference librarian to boot, procured a paperback edition from the stacks and placed it right beside me here at the computer which I have to use now in the library coz I don't yet have a box of rocks installed back in the hut. I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. That little flick still strikes all the right notes for me. And so happily on to P&P."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks. This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments.

I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language.

I knew the story really well, from all the movies, etc. But I really enjoyed reading it, especially for as cheap as it is on amazon!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"[...]Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has got to have one of the best male characters of all time, Mr. Darcy. I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story. There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters. Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice. It makes it even more touching to read knowing that Jane Austin, the author, faced a similar \\"socially forbidden\\" love without quite the happy ending found in this epic.Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or \`properly in love,' or, \\"\`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book. It's great! Beautifully written. I downloaded it to my kindle. It has quickly become a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a complete masterpiece. I was very disappointed at myself for not reading it sooner. I will recommend this book to anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this at-least once."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book. Reading it after I saw the movie helped me make a mental movie of what is going on as I read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children's one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can't seem to put it down. I'm also planning to read Jane Austen's other novels as well."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin. Why? First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago. Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short. (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...) Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know. Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman. At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy. Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief. There's no way this couple could ever get together, right? :)Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more. So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books. Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy. I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read. Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore. Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.Recently, I did just that. I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it! (Far more than I thought that I would!) Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time. Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature. She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme master of her craft. In her characterizations, plotting, and language she is the model of exactness and efficiency. There simply is no gratuitous business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal fantasy. Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit, each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot; Where lesser writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the description of a raised eyebrow."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it's still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for your money.If you're reading for a class or for independent study, you can't go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives. This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those secondary sources you'll need for your research paper.If you're just reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It's a well-edited version that's appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on Austen's writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it's boring or difficult to understand). In my opinion the Penguin Classics edition is definitely the best bet for your money."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"im not a native english speaker..and i found the writing very tender very subtle and funny i just loved to read some antique english without all the idioms that are used nowadays..i can see why austen is still a very preferred reading at all ages!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read it for the first time when I was 16, and I've read it at least once every year since...

A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues. Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The Collins classics version is outstanding. It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major.

Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date.

An incorrectly formatted book of this nature should not be on the Amazon store at all!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane is prejudiced and Mr. Darcy is prideful, or is it Jane is prideful and Mr. Darcy prejudiced, or do they both have a bit of pride and prejudice, which lends itself to a delightful novel filled with social boundaries, romance, disappointment, and comedy.The movie inspired me to read this novel for the first time. However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie. You will not be disappointed. The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style. Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down. Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham. Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story.

Was I ever wrong!While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P; is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another. A century or two will not diminish this romance!At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia. Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go. It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one. Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his. Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating. Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family. Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy. The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P; to end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is timeless and never grows old.

I was not disappointed.The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be. I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again. I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating. I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players.

Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife.\\" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction. Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot.

It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\". These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story.

You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is.

Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels.

The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Great service! The purchase was exactly what I ordered and I received it in a timely manner.

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a really good story, it has been revised, so I was a little disappointed by that.

The art of which the author incorporated the economical push on relationships was done very well!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"As I find with most \\"classics\\" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Adopted the thrift edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to reduce the textbook expenses for a college-level literature class.

Even if you don't need tp wear glasses I think they could be larger to make the reader comfortable."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The first time I read Pride and Prejudice I was in seventh grade and I found it difficult to read and of little interest; so when I picked it up again as a senior in high school and discovered its brilliance it came as quite a surprise. I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Oh! Can I even say enough about this delightfully wonderful book? I won't give any of the plot away. But, I will say that the tension and the passion between the characters is so strong that it comes through the pages, transcends time and you can relate to it precisely today as readers could a hundred or so years ago. The humor and wit is British, of course, and most of the sentencing isn't used any more; therefore it might be a difficult read for some. I admit I had some hard times getting through it. But it was well worth the effort! And now I read it once a year just so I can relive the pleasure. A good read for anyone. And much advised by me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved this book because it really grabbed my attention from the beginning. It also kept me away from the fridge for a good while so I skipped out on a lot of fatty snacks. I lost five pounds reading this book. Never mind &quot;The South Beach Diet&quot;. Read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the best books I've ever read. The intricate style Jane Austen used to write this love story made it so the reader was sucked into it in every turn of the page. The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do. Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense. The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen. This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8. In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose. In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books. This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class. To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families. In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous. The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior. What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute. Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back. All she did was listen and let the birds chirp. Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked. Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty. This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time. This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met. As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced. If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't, or give your book to someone you like or appreciate."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance). What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference. For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure. The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world. (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty Miss Bingley) which I like. Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics. They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits. I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well. Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others. In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth. In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her. He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin. This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life. (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort. As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times. The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is the work of a scholar. Granted, it is expensive. But compared to other editions of Pride and Prejudice that imply scholarly expertise, this edition is a scholarly work. And Rogers credits his sources, too! Kudos to Professor Rogers!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.Splendid conclusion!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I always resisted reading this book. I thought that the old, female bounding type society was something I never wanted to relive. However, I came to truly love Elizabeth.This was another 'home book club' pick of my daughters and I, and we also enjoyed it. We loved the language, which is so well spoken and hilarious (Elizabeth). She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.Now to why we only gave 4 stars.

If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Beautiful clothbound edition. It is well made and will last a long time.

I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\" There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress.Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more.

Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words.

I admit the language is a little hard to get used to at first, but once you get in a rhythm, it's fabulous. The romance is classic and probably forms the basis for a lot of the modern romances today. The hate you / love you interaction between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy is captivating.

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: \\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" and the MORE important truth: \\"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers \\"cheated\\" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've read this book a million times.

I loved how dialogue based this novel is."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now.

The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period.

It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right.

Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly. But that only fixes that instance. Fresh downloads from Amazon will still have this problem, at least until it is fixed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Haven't read it all so I can't really say if I like it or love it.

The funniest parts were when Mr. Darcy said he would consider Elizabeth a beauty as soon as he would consider her mother a wit. Not that her mother is totally stupid or anything. They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does. He is one of the most likable or I should say 'agreeable' characters in the book.

Austen has spun an very romantic love story with this one, but it is much more than that. Her social commentary is biting and true, even for today's standards. Her dialogue, though that of over 100 years ago, still sounds true and real. The plot keeps you reading so you forget that this is a classic, and just enjoy it for the story and the beauty of the language.

She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, &quot;Who's going to come courting me today?&quot; But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was assigned this book for my AP Literature class and the grunts and groans running through the room were audible. A comedy of manners at first seemed like it would be no comedy at all. From what others had told me, Jane Austen had always been lumped with that group of 19th century authors to avoid at all costs.I couldn't have been more wrong. Jane Austen is delightfully humorous and the sarcastic humor that underlies the characters of Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett rounds out the book and the characters themselves. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennett is an intelligent young woman stuck in the early 19th century. And while she is resigned to fitting the role of young women at the time, she is also able to see the silliness by which other girls govern their lives, and though she does nothing to warrant it, the reader automatically places her above the others. She contains all the elements of a charming protagonist as she is honest, intelligent and witty all at the same time.I loved Mr. Darcy, as well, on his first appearance. Admittedly he was haughty and conceited but from first sight Elizabth begins to chip away at his pride, though she frequently refuses to give him so much as a word. Reading the back cover I thought this was going to be a typical romance story, but it wasn't that either. Despite many other 'romances', the one the reader really wants to see is held off time and time again, and by the last few pages it feels like it may never come about.This is definitely worth reading and is above the ruin that college discussions will often cause."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It was with wonderful anticipation that I sat down with Jane Austen's seminal work, Pride and Prejudice. I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class.

How could I have let 19 years of my life pass by without reading this classic and constantly-alluded to novel? Yes, I delayed reading it for far too long, but it did not disappoint my anticipated expectations.In the opening chapters of the novel I was *gasp* - bored with the plot and characters. I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married. She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers. Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care. We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand. But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction. Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward. Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\" Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding. We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin. Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush. We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters. Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was assigned to me at my University.

We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Thus, I'll continue.Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family. The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister. She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.Darcy: He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction. His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister. He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other. In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends. They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister. Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions. And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.I realize that I could never give the story justice. It's classic for a reason. Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to. It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of \\"Jane\\" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version.

I guess you get what you pay for, right?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had to read this for school, but I actually turned out liking it.

In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest. It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot; And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits. In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius. Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel. To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax. Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people. It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny. Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up. There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog.

I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication.

I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion?

I've always liked Jane Austen's style, and I'm much interested in books during this period. This novel is a perfect example about feminine frivolity and Victorian ways of mind. It's also epidemizes the importance of humbleness.All the characters plainly suggest that the highest standard a woman had in during the early 1800's was being a rich man's wife.

Now, I am a college English major and after reading hunderds of books, I can safley say that this is still among my favorites. It is a classic story and an easy read in my mind, at least. The charcters of Lizzy and Darcy are among my favorite in all of literature.But after reading all the reviews on this site, I have became convinced that this is a book that does not belong in American High Schools. I had some of my friends read it in High School and they all loved it. I can only assume that we went to a batter HS or something, as every other bad review on this site (in fact, almost all the classic book reviews) it from some poor High School student who has never read a book over 200 pages in their life, doesn't know anything about literature ( I was laughing out loud at the \\"facts\\" presented in some of the 1 star reviews) and is just upset that they have to take time away from being spoon-fed things to pick up a book and think. It distresses me that we have become such a culture that we chide cultured books like this for not having sex and then turn around and call it a \\"soap opera\\" (anyone who has ever seen a soap opera and then read this book knows that there is no comparison between the two--for one, no soap opera writer has Austen's wit, her intellegence, her perception of the human condition).So, to potential buyers--it is a light, comic work that you shouldn't have to think about (don't believe the negative reviews--there is nothing deep in this) and I'm sure you will enjoy it, if you have a respect for art and a bit of intellegence.

Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try. This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class. Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing. Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues. I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett. I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel. I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel. Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though. This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days. The characters are deep and well written. Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past. This book is a classic for a reason. I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.In Mr. Darcy&#65533;s defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen. Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor. The characters are quirky, at times satirical. However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own. Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle? Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security? These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other. It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman. They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor; Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life. But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her. Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest. What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee. We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence. Jane Austen's brillaince shines through on every page.Having been my first Jane Austen novel, I am most delighted to have read such fine quality of the English Language.Not only was this book captivating , but it also has relevant issues present in todays modern society! This has definitely been the best book I've ever read and the movie brings to life Jane Austen's best ever 'Pride and Prejudice'"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read. The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.I liked this book a lot. It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:PThe book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it. This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing. She is a most excellent authoress. I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that I couldn't enjoy them."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i love this book!i read it first in 5th grade[though it was hard to understand!] then in 6th, 3 times in 7th and 4-5 times in 8th.i m like obsessed with this book!i also loved the film version, and i watched all the 3 versions.jane austen is indeed a great author. the way she portrays her characters is really creative, and u can just imagine what they look like, their personality, etc. i simply enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book in my sophomore English class. For me, it was a perfect introduction to the Classics. The language is similar to books such as Anna Karenina and the like, but there is an element of humor that even us twentieth century dimwits can relate to. Sometimes subtle, and sometimes not, Jane Austen keeps us on our toes with her eighteenth-century characters that somehow manage to be hip. No matter who you are, you will find yourself rooting for one or another of the characters as they struggle for something ... if not hapiness, then an extremely desirable position in life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis.

The book is about a twenty-one year old girl struggling with three stupid sisters and an arrogant mother, with only her father and elder sister as her true friends.

The version published by Public Domain Books (ASIN: B000JMLFLW) as an ebook is a formatting mess, however. Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of \\"Mr.,\\" for example."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, \`It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. \`Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of \`Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's \`Abominable', Mr. Collins' \`Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions \`content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"...This book is a romance, and I liked it.My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!I loved it, in fact.

It has the wonderful dialogue and character development. AND it's funny! A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read.

The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile.

Enjoy !!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class. Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one. I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this! I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing. After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed. My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.I had to read this book because it is a classic. However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I must admit that when I finally finished reading Pride and Prejudice I wish I hadn't finished. This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life. This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked. I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy. I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own. I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice. If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story. I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher. I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway. The book drew me in adn I could not put it down. The characters are all so charming. Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character. She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite. She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own. This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet. Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child. Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town. Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy. This is waht kept me interested in the book. The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it. Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book! I read it first when I was 11, and hated it. I thought the language was stuffy and the plot contrived. But then I read it again when I was 15, and it has quickly become my favorite book. I reread it every few months. However, those who don't enjoy a fast-paced plotline, beware: the action is slow. Just make it through the first hundred pages and you'll gobble up the rest. For guy readers, I can only say that this is one of my father's favorite books; whether he is abnormal or just romantic I don't know, but anyhow this is such a good book that it should be required reading! Also, for anyone who did not like the slow action in the book, you must see the BBC movie with Jennifer Elhe and Colin Firth. I promise you'll love the book after seeing it (not to mention Colin Firth). Thanks for reading my review; now go read P&amp;P!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Last Fall I saw a A&amp;E version of P&amp;P. I enjoyed the movie. If I had not seen the movie I probably would not have finished the book. The problem with this is that one can not develop their own picture or opinion on the characters.What I liked the most was the amount of wit displayed between the characters interaction. It is a true book about people. It is funny, charming and romantic. It really opened my eyes to society in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book finally. I had seen the movie and the play.

The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Great read.

I'm liked the end.of the story where she said they deserved"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue. Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a wonderful book with a wonderful theme that is a good lesson for everyone to learn. I loved all of the characters and even if I didn't love their actions, I loved the artful description of them. Though in the beginning I really did not like Mr. Darcy, by the end he was one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth. The ending was great and I was very satisfied with it. It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part. Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book. I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking. Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again. I challenge someone to tire of it! If you are looking for a classic, witty and all around fun book, this is it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read this book only very recently. It is truly an excellent piece of literature. It is a story of appearance and reality. The author, Jane Austen, uses extensive and challenging vocabulary. The words flow off the pages. Sometimes, I read the same passage three or four times to fully understand what it was trying to convey. The main character, Mr. Darcy, is extremely proud. He is selfish and rude, until he meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet. But, Miss Bennet is far below his social standing. It is interesting to see how the characters change in the book over time. If you want a challenge, have some time, and love good literature, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read this book only very recently.

Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit. Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome. Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen. Amazing that it took me this long to discover her."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I first started this book I thought I would find a novel with alot of old time english and bore. But as I started to read this classic I found that it was quite an interesting story.Pride and predjudice, I think,is a wonderful story that tells the reader that they should learn to know a person before they make assumptions about them.The way that Jane Austen sews romance with mystery and bewilderment makes it so that I would gladly reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind.

The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger.

The plot is very simply the story of five un-wed sisters and their very normal life at trying to get engaged. That's all there is to it. Why, then do we find this work so intoxicatingly enchanting? It is because of Austen's brilliant way with words...her descriptions of her witty heroine and handsome hero.If you like this book, I highly recommend reading Emma by Jane Austen and my other fave-- Jane Eyre. :) I give this book six stars!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride & Prejudice is a classic.

Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it!

I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. I would definitely recomend it!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Never before have I read a book as Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice. Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, truly shows what great books are made of. The novel revolves around a distressed mother desperately trying to marry her daughters off before her husband dies. As a result, some hilaroius mishaps and misunderstandings occur, turning the novel into a humorous love story. Its conclusion will leave you smiling for days. A great book for anyone interested in love and all its follies!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's novel, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was a great novel written as a portrayal of what life was like in the eighteenth century in England. This amusing tale revolves around an embarassing couple, named the Bennets and their five daughters. The Bennets, were what I would consider to be one of the most disfunctional families in all of history. The book starts way back in time when women could do nothing but to marry well, and as one can see having five daughters was more a curse, than a blessing.In the beginning Mrs. Bennet starts off by telling her daughters to marry well. At the same time, a wealthy man moves close to Netherfield, the house that they live in. The oldest of the five daughters, Jane, falls in love with this man, whose name later turns out to be Charles Bingley. Charles falls in love with Jane, depite her family's strange ways. Mr. Bingley and his friend Darcy talk often of the Bennet sisters, and later Mr. Darcy falls in love with one of them... the oldest Elizabeth, but she unfortunately turns him down, even though she later begins to have some other feelings for him. Lydia, the youngest daughter elopes with a man named Mr. Wickham and the family is very upset about this action. Jane and Mr. Bingley are getting closer but his younger sister Caroline tries to break them apart.Jane Austen's novel reflects many ways of life, including both the good and the bad times, all while in the search for happiness. This novel's story almost reminds me of another classic called, Little Women, which surprisingly enough was not written by Austen, because it has the same type of story line."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I first read &quot;P&amp;P&quot; when i was very young and i enjoyed it but didnt understand much other than Lizzie Bennett was adorable. but i recently read it again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story. what's amazing is that even thought the book was written in Regency England the characters seem so recognizable: the pompous sycophant Collins, the overbearing mom Mrs. Bennett, the dishonest charmer Wickham, and of course, the sometimes self-righteous, sometimes sharp-tongued, but always lovable Lizzie, who's just my favorite. Now that i have a boyfriend i can understand the relationship between lizzie and darcy much better: unlike today's soap operas, where people jump into bed within minutes of meeting, Austen recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Lizzie Bennett."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.Bravo Jane Austen!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the first classic I've ever read and I really must credit Jane Austen for her wit. That's what got me sitting through the whole plot!The story is clear from the first chapter: Mrs. Bennet is trying for get her daughters married before her husband dies because since all five of her children are female, they won't get to inherit any of their father's money. Smart and sharp Elizabeth is the heroine in this book, and has a thing for judging people at a first meeting. It is not surprising that she developes an immediate annoyace for the arrogant Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy's friend falls madly in love with Elizabeth's sister Jane, who is astonishingly beautiful and shy.It's actually pretty boring to sit through the parties and dances, but there are some characters to keep us alive. Mrs. Bennet is one of the most comical characters ever; I can picture every one of her expressions when she is freaking out about her poor nerves. Lydia is flirtacious to the point of silliness. Mr. Collin's proposal to Elizabeth is so absurd,the seriousness of his stupidness and love for Lady Catherine de Bourgh is absolutely funny. Jane Austen has made her characters so lively and significant, you think you know them.Aside the fact that I've got a problem with Mr. Darcy being so rich and handsome (if I remember correctly), I liked this book. There are several turning points in this story, such as the letter that uncovers the charming officer into a man exploiting girls for money, and Elizabeth's sister eloping. I know Pride and Prejudice is incredibly old-fashioned, but that can't be helped. Try reading it at least."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading this book, my eyes have been opened to not only outward character but inner personality. Truly no other book has ever acheived international acclaim for so long. The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days. Finally we have found a woman Shakespeare!!!A must read, for every literate."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status. I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading. It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot. I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it. I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot. I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together! I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter. Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book. My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading! The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book. Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction. This love story will touch you to the core. I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more. I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school. I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley. And then there are these other members of Elizabeth's family-Kitty, Lydia, Mary &amp; her mother, who are all silly &amp; superficial. Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love. When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself. Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on. This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The novel of which I spent many a night, studiously reading, was a true masterpiece. The irony and satire with which Austen displayed the seventeenth-century society was beautifully mastered. The humor was impressive and understandable to the common reader. The relations, especially between Darcy and Lizzy kept the reader guessing about how their relationship would turn out. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred. It's quintessential Jane Austen.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my first Jane Austen novel. It did not dissapoint!!

And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well. They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel. as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else. This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time. As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters. One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet. His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel. Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society, were timeless trials that all women go through.The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters. The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination. As the reader enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" over the summer.

I did not notice any errors in the text.

I always did well in English class, but I never deeply loved literature until we read this book. I read far beyond the assigned pages in class because I loved Jane Austen's writing, her characters, and her witty lines. I often found myself smiling and occasionally laughing while reading the book. This book had such a profound influence on my life that I'm now an English major in college. After reading this I sought out other books in the same style like the Bronte sisters. Over the years, I've basically forced all of my friends and poor boyfriends to read this book so I could talk about it with them.

Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story.

I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked!

For some audio books, the narrator is boring and drones on and on. Or, they put to much dynamism into their read-aloud, making their story seems over dramatic and almost comical if it wasn't so disappointing. This was not the case for this product. The female narrator reads all of the character's dialogue, but in a way that is easy to listen to. She doesn't overemphasize, nor is she monotone.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built.

I often play the CDs while I am driving and the time flies. Susannah York's animated reading of Jane Austen's novel includes voicing the lines of the various characters. Even though I have seen the 2005 movie and the 1995 TV miniseries, I feel I have a much better understanding of the various plot points after listening to this audio version.

I like it because it really is a book about the folly of being judgemental.Elizabeth Bennett observes her sisters as being a flighty and air headed. Yet they all seem to find husbands and happiness before her. All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy. In fairness, he deserves the harsh judgement, no one calls Elizabeth Bennett plain, no matter how rich he is!It is written in high prose style, but don't be put off by it. Pride and Prejudice is a beautifully written book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS BOOK BEING A CLASSIC.

It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is, of course, a timeless classic. Beautifully written. I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten \\"Popular Highlights\\" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.

Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book!

In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira.

I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy.

I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was a really good book, although there was some confusing description at some points.

This book is enthralling because I am able to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.Although this is a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is charming and i love when the author describe the old houses with appletrees, wild flowers and all that stuff.

As a highschool student, I had to read this in my leisure time, b/c it is a lightweight classic. It has so many great characters. Subtle hints of sarcasm, and the stereotypical attitude of some characters, give the story a comical twinge. However, if you do decide to read this for a class, I personally think the story is most interesting as far as plot and drama goes, and unless the class is bent on feminist views, I found it hard to extract any valued literary elements."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I don't understand how anyone could call it boring. Granted, the people in the books talk a little much and sometimes I'm just like 'Get on with it' but I've sort of learned to skim those parts. This book is a comedy making fun of the English society in the early 1800s. It's making the womens'(woman's?) quest for a good future into a vicious man-hunt and it's hilarious. I agree that there was not enough written out dialogue. I really would've liked the scene with Elizabeth and Darcy played out a little more. But it's a GREAT!!! GREAT!! WONDERFUL!! book.

It should be, considering it has been a classic for so many years--it was written in 1813! But some people are pushed away by classics for just being &quot;classics&quot;--don't be pushed away from this! I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot; It was my favorite episode. I decided to read it after finishing &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and aching for another great book. This is it! It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things. It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English.

Well, for anyone who is considering reading the book, I full-heartily recomend it to you. I previously just finished the book, and Jane Austen did a fabulous job captivating my attention and suspicions whether Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever truly get together. The latter is prejudiced against the handsome and &quot;supposively&quot; haughty Mr. Darcy, so until she realizes the truth does her opinion alter. Jane Austen adds humor to the story and created well-balanced characters which arouse much interest with the reader. An exceptionally written and intriguing story which anyone who has never read should."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep. I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however. It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment. There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine. There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence. Austen gets so much right: she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules. You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is. She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right. She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick. She is very witty but never casual. She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart. I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life: maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society.

The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience. I recommend to all women, and all sensitive men. Also, women who come from families with all sisters will have a strong nostalgic reation (I sure did.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austin is the first author that I have ever read all of her books and this is the first one that I read. I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I know it's a &#34;classic&#34;, but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters.

It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story. It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is not your ordainary 19th century novel. It is so much more.

Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is.

This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story. Each one has their own distinct personality which is part of what makes this book such a classic. Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\" No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudice was revealed.Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Fast and quick delivery.

It's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an account of society in the early nineteenth century. Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully endearing novel that is bound to touch women of every age."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thought it was absolutely amazing!

The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status. Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away. However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him. In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him. In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly. Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified. Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten. This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace. Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change. Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character? Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. I was the first novel of Jane's that I've read and I could not put it down. The suspence and humor of this book makes it great.... you must read it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted. It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I first found this I thought that it was the soundtrack to the 1996 A&amp;E version of Pride and Prejudice.

I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S.

The character of Elizabeth and Dracy are brought out beautifully. The vivid range of emotions of all the characters are a pleasure to read they involuntary invoke reponse from the reader"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults. Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence. From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality. Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming. The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more. My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations. I felt myself laughing and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable. I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time. I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can be said of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading. The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light. Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family. Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning. Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well. Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so. This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it. Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous. Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet. I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it. It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life. It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read. It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more.

Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read. I first read it in high school and can not get enough of it. I love the characters and storyline. It is amazing the way she writes. I love watching Elizabeth and wishing she was a 90's woman who could tell Darcy what she really thinks without worrying about the do's and don't's of her time. I live for the ending when Darcy calls her his most dearest Elizabeth. Romantics this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This work is just wonderful and once you've read it, you can't forget it. Elizabeth seems so close to us, women, and Darcy so cute that their story makes everyone sensitive dream. With Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre, P&amp;P remains the treasure of Victorian Literature.Just read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"As a fan of other types of literature (Stephen King and Steinbeck, for instance) I can't begin to express the way I devoured this book! Not only did I find the character development incredible, but I also enjoyed how Austen brought in other themes such as extreme embarrassment caused by relatives (haven't we ALL been there...)the ability to laugh at oneself, the empathy for a family member that has been wronged and regret of a decision. I liked this book so much that I went out and rented the A&amp;E production and liked that so much I bought it. This is one story I will revisit again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I saw the 1995 tv series before I read this book, and I think that was good. Although the book is better than the series, I don't know if I'd fully understand the sarcasm and irony in the description of the characters. I despise Mr. Collins, but I also find him very amusing. And I admire Elizabeth for her honesty to herself and to others. Despite the fact that it might seem trivial at first, Jane Austen wrote a truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"P&amp;P is one of my favourite books.The attention given to minor details and the portrayal of both Lizzy and Mr.Darcy is very endearing.I loved the witty remarks and the satire in the descriptions.I think Austen's command of the english language is enviable.Each sentence has it's own significance and there is no line in the book I would have omitted. I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages. I am still living in the glorious days of Pemberley and Netherfield!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice so many times that by now I should have the book memorized. But, I don't. Instead, I cringe every time Elizabeth Bennet refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal and sit in suspense as I near the part where I think he should propose again. What if this time, they don't meet by chance as they ought? Or what if Mr. Darcy decides not to propose again? What if Elizabeth doesn't realize how wonderful I know he is? Jane Austen is the only author who captures my imagination so vividly every reading; I love her for it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this story! The characters are so consistent and so very realstic, it's amazing. You can't help but admire them, not only for their realism, but for who they were, and especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, whose opinions changed so very much, and how they came to accept each other. Not only is the main plot excellent, but secondary characters such as the droll Mr. Collins and the imperious Lady Catherine are real gems. This whole novel is well worth taking the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've read this book. I keep it permanently on my nightshelf and will often just read a few pages whenever I feel overwhelmed by uncivilised people (like after my evening commute sometimes...). It's a tonic against stupidity. I also recommend the A&amp;E video production. So well cast &amp; produced you are able to focus on the story &amp; not be distracted by production issues (e.g. &quot;THAT's different from the book...&quot;). My ultimate test for the relevance of a story is how many lines I plagiarize from it to use in normal conversation, and this story has some classics. My favorite is &quot;I am most seriously displeased.&quot;My husband has a new cliche: &quot;what's better than one wedding at the end of a jane austen story? TWO weddings at the end of a jane austen story.&quot; as another reviewer noted, it's not the destination that delights, it's the journey along the way. these characters will keep you in good company and refresh your optimism in the potential of the human race."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After the movie adaptations of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;, I always wanted to try reading one of her books.

I suggest you not to read any reviews here at all, for they will spoil the elements of surprise.OH, how much I wish I can love like them!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written novel by Jane Austen. When i first began to read it, i thought i'd instantly hate it. i'm not a big fan of romance novels, but i decided to give this book a try. I was delightfully suprized with the vivid language and great dialogue which Austen used, and the novel kept my interest better than i had ever expected. from the famous opening lines, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;, to the wedding at the end, this was a great book. At some points, i got confused py a paragraph, or even chapter, and i had to re-read it carefully so i could fully understand the authors point, but other than that, i could comprehend the book easily. It is the first romantic book that has ever kept my attention, and i hope this will inspire me to try other books that i would otherwise walk right by without giving it a thought. The book did a very good job of developing the characters, as well. By the end of the book, i felt i had a good grasp on who's personalities Jane Austen wanted to emphasize, and what each character's roll in the plot was. Overall, i feel this was an excellent book, and i would reccomend it to enyone who loves to read, even if you're not a reguar reader of novels such as this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a wonderful piece of literature. I have never read a truly great book until this. I have loved many books that I have read, but this book is beyond compare. As soon as I began reading, I became engrossed in it. I finished this book so fast it felt like the book was only 100 pages. I t was such quick read that I read approximately 250 pages in one weekend; I couldn't put it down. I strongly urge everyone to read this book, whatever the age. I am only in ninth grade and even now I'm able to understand its literary value. Although I can speak highly of the novel, there are some things that I can criticize. The most complicated aspect of the book was the language. At some points I had to go back and reread a passage to fully understand it. It is true that the language is beautiful, but frankly, I find it confusing. If you are not up to the challenge of figuring out the meaning of some different words, do not read this book The only other aspect of the novel that at times seemed irksome, was the long passages in which there was little dialogue. These passages sometimes contained Elizabeth's thoughts and observations, but it was the parts other than these that bothered me. The long descriptions of the fields and rooms bored me. This was unnecessary because it did not advance the plot or carry a large amount of importance. When a new plot line suddenly came into existence, this would be weaved in. In moments of suspense I just skimmed through these parts because they were not entirely related to the plot. My favorite plot line was the development and change of people and their feelings, especially love. This novel genuinely showed me how humans' feelings towards one another change, along with their judgments and prejudices. Throughout the novel the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy profoundly changed in enjoyable ways. Additionally, these changes describe the title, which I found most appropriate. When we first met Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy he was presented as aloof, cold, and full of abominable pride. As the story progresses we see a profound change in his character, which commences when he professes his love for Elizabeth. After this, we begin to see the real, improved Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story Elizabeth even says this about him, \\" Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.\\" By overcoming his pride he leads Elizabeth to make a few changes of her own. Elizabeth is the character that I feel made the most significant changes throughout the story. I feel this way because she altered two major things in her life. The first, which I feel led to the second, is when Elizabeth realized her prejudice and surpassed it. She does not find this out about herself until wonderful Mr. Darcy places a white envelope in her hands. After reading what was inside the envelope she describes herself as, \\" blind, partial, prejudice, absurd.\\" The second thing that changed about her was her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. Over several months her feelings for Mr. Darcy grow fonder each time they meet, until she realizes her overwhelming love for him This is a classic love story, which I believe deserves much attention. In one word, this story is enchanting. The story of the Bennet girls will be one I will treasure forever. Finally, I will never forget the way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy came together and overcame, their pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is not only an epitome of classic literature, it is actually interesting. I bet if they made a poll, the people who read this book would be happier in life than most. I love this book so much.

I enjoyed and hated the running arounds of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted them to fall madly in love (finally) and everytime that I thought it was going to happen something got in the way.

Once you begin to turn the pages you just can't stop! I've read it five times and I still read with the same number of heartbeats(which must be like 1000 per minute!) Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books in the world. I just love the story of five sisters and their foolish and funny mother who thinks about nothing but marrying her daughters. Mr Darcy ,who marries Elizabeth, is my all time favorite male novel charachter. His passionate love for Elizabeth and his incredibly romantic nobleness will make him a favourite with female readers.There are people who consider the book boring , but if it is because of the Victorian English I think it just makes the book more classic and valuable."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"First of all, let me start out by saying, I love this book! I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable. Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive. The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored.

I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school. While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them. And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations. Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart. She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative. Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters. At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy. Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot. As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other. The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read. Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot; Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it. Or love it and hate it at the same time.In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Blinded by beauty, Mr. Bennett married his lightheaded Mrs., and ever since has been skewering her with his wit--with beauty faded, she remains lightheaded and his target. Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man. Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth. More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite. We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her. She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham. The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes. I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is a classic, and it is not by accident.

A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a wonderful classic of English literature.

So basically, don't pay attention to these people. :) It took me a while to get through Pride and Prejudice for an AP English project. I agree with other reviewers that it was extremely well written.

It just continous with the same things before for another 100 pages. Although you expect an end you aren't really interested in it. When you finishes the book you just have fogotten what you've read at the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The common comment on this book, seems to be people's love for the ... &quot;love&quot; story. Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p; and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed. The main conflict was worthless to begin with. Perhaps its just my tastes, seeing that every other reviewer gave this book 5 stars, I might as well, for the book's sake, give this book 2 stars.One word for you: Redundant!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I recently read Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, for a project in my AP English Class. I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have to agree -- Pride and Prejudice is a wee bit, well -- BORING.I don't know what it is. Maybe I just didn't get it -- but that's not like me at all. I don't find classic in general very hard to understand. I've read plenty of classics and both loved and understood them.No, it's not that I didn't understand, it's just that the story takes so long to kick off. It begins with our shero Elizabeth and her pathetic clan of sisters who struggle to appease society by appearing either beautiful, accomplished, well-connected or all three.As most main characters do, Elizabeth stands out from her sisters. She doesn't attempt to be pretty or accomplished and could care less about impressing any man. Her main concerns are caring for her family and remaining witty, independent, and free. She further scandalizes the neighborhood with this rebellious nature by -- gasp! -- walking a few miles in the rain and mud to care for her sick sister! The nerve!And meanwhile, the famous Mr. Darcy seems if anything cold, distant, and rude. He has a slight interest in Elizabeth, but that seems to be all. For this reason I was slightly shocked when I saw the commercials for the movie version of this book -- why, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were kissing!I must have read more than half the novel and they didn't so much as shake hands! I finally gave up and moved on to more interesting works of fiction -- but, hey, if you like and understand this novel, then good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us would like to get back to the more admirable Miss Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen\`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have to say that I like this book so far.I have never actually read Pride and Prejudice before but i have seen the movie many times.

I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since.

So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives. Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency. We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice. We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book. Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London. Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams. Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns). Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions. Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there? Don't be too quick to pass judgment.Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels. Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers. Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined. From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others. Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book. It's such a good read. You will absolutely love the characters, I guarantee it. Elizabeth is such a refreshing heroine, not simpery or weak or stupid but smart and funny and all that stuff. The book itself is hilarious. The funniest scene is the one where Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth. It's priceless. Anyway, if you've read Emma and hated it, DO NOT let that keep you from reading this, because they are totally different and this one is worlds better. I highly highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Pride and Prejudice.

I've read the book 7 times and cant get enough of it.The BBC adaptation of the book was brilliant Jennifer Ehle was the perfect Elizabeth and Colin Firth was the perfect Mr Darcy, both were exactly how I'd imagined the characters to be like.

In the BBC version of the novel, the adorable Colin Firth plays Darct to a tee. He was exactly the way I imagined him to be.

Superb reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The core character in this novel is Elizabeth, an attractive and intelligent 20 year-old and the second daughter (out of five) of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. . Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy. Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\". I could not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level. It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies. This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Not my type of book. I read it all tho. But would not purchase it or a similiar one again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I did not read the book. I want this book off my kindle. I am getting very angry. very angry."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In the book Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen the story circles around the whole idea of marriage, and reputation. Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot.

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye. I really feel that this book is not pleasurable to read, though it may benefit you to read it so that you can learn to find the good and bad pionts of a book and compare it to other literature like it or during that time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Everybody talks about the book.

It's so incredibly boring and stupid!!! It was without a doubt one of the most torturous reading experiences for me. Now, I can appreciate great pieces of classic literature (e.g. Moby Dick, Red Badge of Courage, Gullivers Travels), but this assuredly does not merit to fall within that catagory. It is friviolous and devoid of any real substance. No plot whatsoever. Essentially, it concerns a bunch of smart-aleck, stuck-up self-righteous phonies who try to outdo each other with their sarcastic and smart-aleck remarks. Give me a break, all of you who supposedly like this dull, monotonous, shallow book!! It is utterly beyond my comprehension how in the world this garbage is considered one of the great books of world literature. It is simply a 19th century British version of the Jerry Springer show."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"this book is for three kinds of people:1. people who think what so-called \\"classics\\" are all good. Of course, why would such book be called a classic if it isn't good?2. People who are really really old and are adapted to the cultural and period ideas3. people who like fairy-tale-like romantic storiesThat being said, I'm fair to not give this book a one-star. You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits. Sounds selfish huh? Well.All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned playsI can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right. This is pretty much what I tell most people who are biased over \\"classics\\": classics may have that time-less fancy feeling with their wording, but story-wise, they are pretty silly and outdated."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"An email solicitation acknowledged me as an International Amazon customer, and invited me to download the Kindle Reader, which I did.However when I tried to download the titles I was advised that they were not available to me in Africa.Amazon knows I am in Africa because my email address and customer details describe my location as being in Africa.So much for not discriminating against the people who live in Africa!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book would be perfect for a coffee table. No one would ever with to talk about it. When I read it in high school I thought it to be the most boring book I ever read. I didn't care about all the people trying to be married, etc. I just found this book to be an upper class soap opera. Anyone who likes upper class, sappy, drawn out scenes of lovers trying to get each others attention can read this book and be enthralled. For the rest of us, I would recommend you read a modern romance novel. ALL modern romance novels would be better than this, even if written by William Shatner."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I tried to read it, but I couldn't. I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal.

Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing.

It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read. Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book. Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention. The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done. Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book. It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen. Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter. The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book. I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult. Its topics are very relatable to both age groups."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers. What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained. My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley. She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written. It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor. I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses. I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up. It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever. That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind.

I was completely sucked in!From the first paragraph about the \\"obvious\\" intentions of a bachelor and his wishes to marry, to the ending underplayed scenes between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, this book is an utter delight from the get-go. Lizzy is by far the best female protagonist I have ever read about. I can relate to her on nearly every level and was thoroughly engrossed in the story.When you begin having dreams of being a character in a book, you know that the book has taken you to a new level.

Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Books i dont think ever get better than this. I recently saw the movie that came out in november and i immeditaly fell in love with the story. I love how this book shows a true romance story. In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it. However the words that are used can be quite hard to understand sometimes without having been exposed to words ,and phrases that are said differently, before. Over all it has become one of my favorite books and Jane Austen did a exceptionally good job at writing this."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of the all time best love stories about a young, feisty women in the 18th century, coping with everything from a mother bent on marriage to a seemingly snotty neighbor's friend.Elizabeth is the second oldest of five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, living in England during the 1800s. And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple yearsOverall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile. It truly is a great and classic love story so I would encourage everyone to show their support to Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy by reading this enchanting book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you love reading about ballroom dances, castles, romance, and classic British humor, than Pride and Prejudice is the book for you. This 19th century novel has everything you want. It is filled with romance, passion, and drama, with just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in. Elizabeth Bennet's fiery personality captures your attention and holds it. Also, the mystery of Mr. Darcy's' true intentions of romance is held up in the air as you whip through the pages of this captivating read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. New York: The New American Library Inc., 1961. 332 pages.Pride and Prejudice is the story of The Bennet family. With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other. Mr. Darcy however slowly starts to fall for Elizabeth and tries to woo her indirectly. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful heart warming story about a journey of love. This book is recommended for anyone who likes to read a good romantic seventeenth century novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the first novel I read by by Jane Austen couple of years back while doing my graduation. And this novel made me an ultimate fan of Jane Austen's writing. Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.Highly recommended! :-)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"the book font size is perfect -- was my only unwritten concerns before receiving the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was so pleased when I received this book.

No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon. There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written. The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me. I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents. Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation. There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've been reading Pride and Prejudice on my iPhone through my Kindle for iPhone app...I purchased the book as well but found it easier to read in small increments that the Kindle provides.

Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book.

All the characters have an appeal that's makes you appreciate the way they fit into the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"As much as this book revolves around three of the four daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of those characters revolve around Mr. Darcy - whose personality and character matures and unfolds before you.Neither poor nor rich, the Bennets cannot establish great wealth and comforts for their children - and Mrs. Bennet's hard opinionated character further deprives the lovely lasses of possibilities for advancement. But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh. And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years. Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes. In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more. And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\" We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\" \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"We are wrongly told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart. But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion. Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue. Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently presented. Few plays can match such work."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It seriously does not get any better than this! This book unfolds slowly allowing you to fall in love with the characters and get a feel that world and time. An amazing love story, it leaves you wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love Jane Austen all around, but most especially Pride & Prejudice. If I can't find anything else to read, I pick up P & P. Austen is so very clever, and the multifaceted storyline never gets old."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful. It is the best love story ever. It truly teaches us that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. A definate must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, \\"[takes] delight in anything ridiculous.\\" Since the moment I read that infamous line: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged......\\" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale \\"First Impressions\\", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \\"bewitched body and soul\\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before. The first reading, in high school, was a little rough. Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often). The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\". Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's, Pride and Prejudice, is an intriguing, nerve riveting structure pieced together with utmost meticulousness. Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic. First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving. Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them. Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of. To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy. Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people. Jefferson Davis was just the opposite. When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents. Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances. Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined. Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed. You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money. But it's a loving kind of fun. She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better. We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them. It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers. You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.The Bennets have a challenge: They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate. With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt. Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest. One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley. At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy. Darcy \\"soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year.\\" But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return. Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives. Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death. He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married. With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet. In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits. First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes. Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment. Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death. That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting. Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth. But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow. They are like oil and water.Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley. But no such luck.Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake. In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again? Will Elizabeth find happiness? Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off? You'll just have to read the book to find out. But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.Enjoy a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\" They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception. Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this. Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time. Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom. Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P; (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic. Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about. Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income. A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett. In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman. To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction. Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot. The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel. The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter. The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character. The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects. It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said. Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is available for free on the kindle (Pride and Prejudice) or cheaper by other publishers:Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Paperback Classics)orPride and Prejudice (Oxford World's Classics)orFavorite Jane Austen Novels: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion.It is a great book, but there are other editions that would save you money. I have no idea as to why it is called a 1st edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Sometimes people make assumptions about others without really knowing the person. Almost every character in the book Pride and Prejudice has some type of prejudice towards someone else whether it is money, pride, or jealousy. Elizabeth made the assumption that Mr. Darcy was stuck-up, but he was really just shy and uncomfortable with social events. Elizabeth also thought Mr.Wickham was nice and truthful, but he really was a poor, gambling liar. Mr. Darcy thought that Jane didn't really like Mr. Bingley, but she just doesn't show her feelings very well. Both of Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine were both against the Bennet family because they were \\"lower class.\\" Some of the prejudices faded, and others grew through out the book. This book is full of pride, prejudice, and love. The theme in this book is really not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth. On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In pride and Prejudice my favorite chapter was seven because I thought it was hilarious how Mrs. Bennet wanted to send Jane to Mr. Bingley's house in order for her to get closer to him, even though it was raining and she had to go alone on the horse. I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters. It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters. For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I liked the characters and also the plot. My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three. This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister. This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her. I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages. Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties. Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers. The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties. Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts. Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story. Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters. I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter. I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school. The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel. The main characters portray the meaning of the title.

Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different, yet so similar. Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth. Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people. She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their first impression. But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II. I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions. Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other. Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice. This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice.One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character.

The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen. Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits. This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters. This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart. A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet. Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination. In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew. I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel. Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place. Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story. Their sarcastic wit made me laugh. Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice. The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat. Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love. As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime. I cannot wait to read it a second time!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

On the inside cover it suggested not to miss \`Pride and Prejudice' and \`Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the \`Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet.

This has all right to be called an alltime classic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it.

A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon. Thank you Amazon! This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.OK. So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon. So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle. It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration. Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :( I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book. If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book. And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper. I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813 in three volumes, the customary presentation of a novel in the early 19th Century. Penguin Press has provided Kindle owners with a wonderful enhanced version of the novel preserving the three volume format without attempting to standardize or modernize the text.The Penguin book is presented by Juliette Wells, Enhanced E-book Features Editor. It is edited with an introduction and informative notes by Vivien Jones. The result is a very readable yet scholarly treatment of the novel, with a biography of Jane Austen, 19th Century reviews of the book, descriptions of how to make tea and Jane Austen's eating habits, and much more.The last time I read Pride and Prejudice was in 1966 in an English literature class in college. I challenged the professor's choice of reading material as completely irrelevant given the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement and protests on my college campus, San Francisco State. It was a pleasure to reread the book with the wisdom of age supplemented by the excellent notes throughout the three volumes. Kindle owners can, with a spin of the wheel and a click, read explanations of the semantics of the vocabulary used by Austen, consider content interpretations, view illustrations of fashion, learn historical dance steps, and see period architecture.The focus of the production, of course, is the novel with its themes of first impressions, pride, vanity, seduction, feminism, prejudice, sexism, fatal attraction, society, intellectual domination, morality, etiquette, marriage, heritability, class structure, the family as a purposeful unit, and personal happiness. I highlighted many passages and notes to read again and enjoy. One example is from Volume 1 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, \\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\\" Another example of my highlights is from Volume 2 when Elizabeth states, \\"The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.\\" And here is an example of an explanatory note I highlighted from Volume 3, \\"e3. Elizabeth's determination here matches her effort throughout the novel to pursue what she considers to be her own happiness; compare her response to Mr. Collin's proposal of marriage in chapter 19.\\" The novel, notes, and other features allow the reader to experience the historical context of the first edition.Before reading Pride and Prejudice, I reread James Joyce's Ulysses on my Kindle with Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated paperback book as a guide. It would have been a better reading experience to have this excellent source integrated with the novel. Penguin's enhanced e-books with built in reference features will be excellent for new publications of classic novels. I learned a great deal more about Austen's novel in the convenient Kindle format than I did 42 years ago in college. Hopefully, I'll be able to add many enhanced Penguin classics to my Kindle Library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming.

It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist? I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive. Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Elizabeth is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Austen respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Austen was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop. I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting. But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Like all the other jane austen books i loved this one just as much. jane austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more.elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy intertwined into their own fixed judgements and opinions make this book not just a must read for its witty satire and humour but for its indepth understanding of true love. eliza,prejudiced ....Darcy, too caught up with his high society unfold their true character gradually making you enthralled and wanting more.mr. collins the cousin, catheran de bourgh his patron bring out the best in subtle humour.mr. and mrs. bennet, both of them a class apart...their uniquely opposite personalities creating sparks. the four sisters: genuine, bingely:awesome...the story i leave for you to unravel. you'll love it to the best of your ability.trust me; you're caught. you won't be able to get your hands off it. its the work of a great woman and a great writer, a true genius who to me is just as equivalent to shakespeare. but then thats just me.a book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love. YOU WON'T REGRET IT."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight. I didn't get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early '80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I've learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The themes of Austen's works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen's writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not one word about the greater world. I doubt that the word &quot;London&quot; appears in any of them except briefly in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;; they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that's part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don't know, and I think it doesn't matter - but there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen's works, of which I believe &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most accessible."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I enjoyed this classic totally.

I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today). I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility. I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E; with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have. The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard. The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy. It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution. When you enjoy something you don't want it to end. Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another. Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character. Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning. I grew disgusted. The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable. I am only half way thru the first book, however.The Annotated Pride and PrejudiceJane Austen: The World of Her NovelsMr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice ContinuesAn Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England. The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family. Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters. Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his. Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy. Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead. Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story. To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten. Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all. He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him. It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book. Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\" Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot. This classic novel was definitely not on my \`must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking. After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one. Especially during football season! I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage. However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years! Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty. And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover. Isn't evolution great?Don't make the same mistake I did. I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride. My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years. Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero. None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen's classics.Must read for all who love to read.."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybeThe Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;Great book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I never thought I'd have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice. It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death. Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well. The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town. The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area. At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society. It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn't in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love. In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile. Bingley's personality is a perfect complement to Jane's. He's friendly, generous, somewhat nave and looks up to Darcy. Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her. Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say \\"yes\\" to his marriage proposal. To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him: His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart. Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane. This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as \\"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\" She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each. For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people's personalities and they're like. Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a \\"good face,\\" but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book.

The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books).

This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased.

It is a lovely read that is worthy of being deemed a classic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have just finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the second time, and I liked it even more the second time around. (I daresay I might like it even more on a third or fourth reading.) Contrary to some of the reviews I've been reading, it's not just about five shallow young women trying to find husbands with the help of their annoying mother. Sure, some of the young women get married by the end, and the romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is very diverting, but that's not the whole point of the story. For the most part, it deals with the observations of the author, as well as those of Elizabeth and, on a smaller scale, Mr. Bennet. There is social commentary on the ideas of class that many people of that era held so dearly, and the way some of them behaved to get the results they desired, regardless of whom they hurt. Pride and Prejudice also pokes fun at human frailty and absurdity, which, I believe, crosses the boundaries of time. I found myself laughing out loud at some points at the behavior of the minor characters and how some of the major characters reacted to it. Most importantly, there is a lesson to be learned: how a good person can overcome his or her first impressions, his or her pride and prejudice, and get to know the real heart and soul of the person. As some other reviewers have said, the enjoyment of this novel is in the journey, not the ultimate ending.I think those who called it boring more likely found the slightly antiquated and verbose language a bit too difficult to follow. I will admit I was a bit daunted by it at the beginning, but once I got into the flow of the novel, I realized it wasn't that hard. One thing that really helped me get into the novel (which I highly recommend) was watching the excellent 1995 A&amp;E/BBC adaptation before reading it. By doing that, I knew what was going to happen and could pay more attention to the inner workings of the novel, the commentary. As I read, I found myself really enjoying the language (rather than hoping for a translator to appear) and wishing I could argue as eloquently as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy seemed to do.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a sharp, acerbic commentary on the absurdity of human nature, and I wish those who gave it one or two stars would give it another try."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"_Pride and Prejudice_ is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, one of my favorite heroines(I think that every strong heroine since must be based on her in some way), and Mr. Darcy, one of my favorite heroes(I've been in love with him since I first read the book). There are misunderstandings and scandals and very irksome supporting characters that you just want to strangle, but it's a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My measure of a superb novel is the ability to read it many times and be able to find something new or to see characters and occurences from a different perspective. This novel never disapoints. With each reading, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot have become more complex, funnier, and also sadder. Jane has become more than just a sweet girl pining for a lost love. Her passivity and inability to express her emotions seem a subtle warning to those of us who may share Jane's foibles. Elizabeth seems more self-conscious, more aware of her times, a woman's place, and the class system within which she must operate. Against this background she appears braver and wittier, her observations more trenchant. It would be hard to find a character as pompous and awful as Mr. Collins, yet he also elicits one's sympathy. And Mr. Darcy is wonderful in his rudeness and his smoldering desire. His haughty proposal to Elizabeth and her stinging reply are still hurtful. His subsequent letter is the opening gambit to the breaking down of Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice. These characters are so real and their emotions so true that the 150-plus years that separate us quickly disappear."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thought this book was great. Not only is Elizabeth a strong main character, but the supporting characters make the book very enjoyable. They are so funny; especially the mother. I couldn't put it down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I must confess up front that I am a sucker of love stories. As such, Pride and Prejudice had me hook, line, and sinker from the beginning, turning page after page to find out if Elizabeth, the heroine, would find happiness in the end.A female friend of mine recommended the book to me (as did my girlfriend) with the caveat that most guys she knew complained that &quot;nothing happened&quot; in it. Needless to say, if you're looking for action and intrigue, look elsewhere. There is some little intrigue in Pride and Prejudice, but the heroine(s) play a strictly passive role. All the excitement in the novel stems from the suspense of the Bennet sisters' romances.Another minor caveat: I was initially slightly distracted by Austen's style of writing, which sometimes seems a bit distant from the action of the narrative (at least to someone more accustomed to more modern works).However, I feel that this hardly detracts from what recommends Pride and Prejudice the most (and what all love stories require): interesting characters to whom the reader can become emotionally attached and believable obstacles to their deserved happiness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a true English masterpiece. Not only is it magical,funny and sensitive. Austen also manages to entice you into her world. She creates the most perfect hero in Mr Darcy, a man willing to do anything to be with the woman he loves, even if it means having to stand Mrs Bennet as his mother-in-law. With Elizabeth, Austen manages to create a heroine who could easily be envied in both the nineteeth and twentieth just for her wit, intelligence and her honesty. Do not judge this book before reading it as a girly, old and an out dated piece that your English teacher rambles on about. It really does make you realise that there was life so long ago, and people have not really changed that much."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read.

A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This novel took me completely by surprise. I had seen the movies &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and I decided to give this one a chance. It is by far, one of the best romance novels I've ever read. It is old-style romance, and yet the language and the feelings of Elizabeth Bennet truly capture every essence of what a woman feels when encountered with different situations. Although we see everything mostly through the eyes of Lizzy, a person cannot help to admire Jane Austen's ability to let your imagination be transported, momentarily, to a world where human beings are not so evil after all, and love is worth more than what is portrayed today in the media. Although the movie is very accurate, I would strongly encourage everyone to read this novel. If it is, indeed, Jane Austen's best work, it is absolutely worth every penny. Let yourself be absorbed into this magnificent story of all-time, and don't be surprised if by the end of it you feel like reading it all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Read this, and then re-read this. You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published. If you're a bit obsessive, you may even become an Austenite, seeking P&P rewrites, continuations, movies derived from it, etc. My faves of these are Bridget Jones's Diary (the first book and movie), The Bar Sinister (book continuation), and Lost in Austen (movie). There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Believe it or not, I had never actually read Pride and Prejudice, though I have been an English and Drama teacher for over a decade. This book not only gave me the full text, but the little \\"insights\\" in the margin were interesting and often inspired my interest even more into the works of Austen. I think this would be a great book for everyone - those who have never read it and those who are on their hundredth reading. Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I would have liked to have met Jane Austen, and I think she would find it entertaining that her books have lasted as long as they did.I won't review the book itself, but rather, the Kindle version of it. The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is an incredibly talented author and although I do love her other books, I do believe that Pride and Prejudice is her best work. I am one of those individuals who thoroughly enjoys reading great literature from around the world but to be completely honest, I had never read this book until after the new movie was released a couple years ago. After falling in love with the film, I went out immediately to purchase the novel and upon completion, Jane Austen \\"bewitched me body and soul\\" (as Mr. Darcy would say).Elizabeth Bennett remains to be one of the most complex, interesting, and relatable characters I have ever read. She encompasses all the alluring qualities a respectable lady was supposed to possess from that time era but additionally, many rebellious attributes that links her personality and inner battle with personal feelings vs. societal conventions, to modern day. She knows the place of women in the community- how they should talk, interact in society, her social standing, especially in relation to men, however, she also struggles with ideologies of romance and being her own individual- speaking her mind, voicing her opinions- no matter if it is Lady Catherine or her best friend Charlotte, as well as denying reputable marriage proposals for the hope of finding true love.Pride and Prejudice is not just an enrapturing love story but really transports you into a time period that is much different from today's world. It gives you insight into a completely different lifestyle, exposes the flaws and obsessions of a culture, and most importantly, it is all done so from a revolutionary point of view- the perspective of a woman who doesn't necessarily agree with the rules of societal acceptability.It is a great book and I whole-heartedly recommend reading it. And it only gets better each time you read it. I guarantee you too will fall in love with all the characters of Pride and Prejudice. If Lizzy or Mr. Darcy don't satisfy your need for a personal connection, I'm sure you can identify with the many other colorful characters- the deceiving, selfish, yet undeniably charming Mr. Wickham, the benevolent and kind spirited Jane Bennett, the frivolous Lydia Bennett, or even the middle child Mary Bennett, who even though is most accomplish, often goes unnoticed and under appreciated. There is something for everyone is this amazing story!Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I wanted a cheap book at a great price, and this product delivered. It has an attractive cover, sturdy binding, and easy to read font. Perfect for a student copy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I could read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" over and over again, and this edition is perfect for doing so. It is beautiful and simple, with no extra content-excepting a short biography of the author-a detail that makes it better for carrying around with you than bulkier annotated versions. The ribbon bookmark is pretty and useful, and the print, surprisingly, is large enough to be read easily. The only fault I could find with this edition were a few minor typos; nothing of importance, and easily forgotten while caught up in the completely perfect story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Not someone properly suited for such a task, I can tell you that. What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'. I have always wanted to read some of the classics but have never up until now dug up the courage to actually do so. I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ? I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right. 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read. The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!). Romance mixed with a little bit of drama and Austen's most descriptive prose made it impossible for me to put this book down. Now I see why 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' is on so many people's favorites list because now it is most certainly on mine."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I can imagine that Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy) is Jane Austen herself, couldn't you?Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. She deserves much praise. With extraordinary insight into feelings and actions of characters. She does a good job of making each character distinct and well defined. The Bantam Classic edition of all of the classics is much better then the Barnes and Noble version.You must read this book even if it's but only for once (even thought there may be a possibility of you may not liking it) to give credit to what I consider a historic acknowledgement to a female writer.

The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection.

Mrs.Bennet has five daughters and is hoping that Mr.Bingley will fall in love and marry one of them.Mr.Bingley and her eldest daughter the beautiful sweet Jane seem to strike up an attachment.When Bingley's best friend Mr.Darcy,a proud gentlemen and Mrs.Bennet's second oldest daughter a playful witty girl named Eliazbeth(the main character)meet lets just say Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the most disagreeable man she has ever meet.Including some of Austen's most memorable characters:Mrs.Bennet and her husband Mr.Bennet(the father of dry wit)make one of the funniest,unhappily married couples in history,and Mr.Collins(one of the suitors)is the model of everything a girl doesn't want in a guy.I love Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy.They have some of the most bewitching conversations and never has Austen's ear for dialogue been better then in her second novel.I was charmed by Pride and Prejudice and hope you will be too."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world.

The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have always wanted to read the classics but never took the time. Having a Kindle has allowed me to read a LOT more than I used to, I carry it everywhere.

I dove into the book like I have never read before and cannot express in words the joy I felt when I was finished. It is by far the most wonderful book I have ever read and do not know how I have lived 47 years without having read it.There will NEVER be an author born the likes of Jane Austen. Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great.

Also,I prefer the A & E adaptation of the book(Double DVD). The version with KEIRA KNIGHTLY is o.K, but the former adaptation has actors that are more creditable as their characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm sure there are a multitude reviews on the actual story of P&P;, to which, I'm sure, I can add very little. I will, therefore, just say that this is one of my favorite books. I read it several times a year. This is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written.I mostly wish to comment on this particular edition of the book (Robert Frederick Ltd.). I just bought it, today, at the local used book store. I already have another copy and decided that an illustrated edition would be a nice addition to my book collection.The hardback book is of fair quality. I'm not sure if this book originally came with a dust jacket or not, but this one doesn't have one. There is a picture of a man and woman, dressed in Regency period clothing, walking on a wooded path. I'm sure, if there is a dust jacket, the picture is probably the same.The spine is a bright pink color and the title on the cover is surrounded by a bright pink oval.Inside, the pages are made of good quality paper. There are black and white illustrations. They are well drawn. There is a picture placed above every chapter heading, either of a scene from the previous chapter or the forthcoming one. There are also pictures placed randomly throughout the book.I would say this book would make an excellent first copy for a young girl."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Austen book. I was even slightly dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because it didn't come close to Pride and Prejudice. The well developed characters and plot and emotions of P&amp;P (as Austen refered to it)soar above her other novels. Although I did enjoy Emma and Northanger Abby quite well.However, I have read the Jane Austen Book Club, a new book, and I would just like to NOT recommened that book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen has started to write this truly accurate novel before she reached the age of twenty-one. It is remarkable the way she brought off the mercenary and ignorance of the people-a common criticism of the 18th century.I can assure that those who have a taste for the classic and the romantic are going to have such a pleasant reading as I had.What I've found most interesting was the constant presence of an utterly charming, engaging and fast 'war of wits' among characters.It certainly has a great theme and we can still see its content applied in todays world. Pride and Prejudice was elegantly-written by Jane Austen and I can say that it was very worth it as well as inspiring to me reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed. This is not the case - every sentence has a hard return - a large space or gap between it and the next sentence. It is quite annoying to read and I will be tossing it off my kindle and going with another version. My first kindle disappointment."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is precious to say the least. I'm reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as if it's hot off the press in 19th Century England. It's easy to read as the words are not too small but your eyes still have to adjust a little at first. It has a lovely pink pattern all over the book, which makes it gorgeous, simply gorgeous. It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It took some adjusting to get used to the 19th Century writing style - authors were much more subtle then (and there were different societal norms). Once I did, I was richly rewarded with this tale of mistaken intentions. For those of you on the edge, take the time to appreciate the style, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I hesitate to assign such titles but this is my favorite book of all time. Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society. Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth. The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour. Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was supposed to read this in high school. Didn't happen.Then I was supposed to read it in college. Again, didn't happen.It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right? Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?Everything, it turns out. And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses. It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short. And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\" Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them. Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been. We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud? Where have we been prejudicial? Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us. We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is. I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room. And it has everything to do with the here and now.(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book? I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen. Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"From ordering on the Web, to delivery your work was perfect.

Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written; I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety.

I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Truly one of the best stories of all time.

Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic!

I'm not especially surprised, and to the males, don't blame yourselves if you can't penetrate Jane Austen (it is undoubtedly more appealing to the female mind), although I must vouch for P&amp;P and pity those who pass over this excellent novel. The whole charm of the story lies in the high vocabulary which Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy and the rest employ, and the wonderful language creates a rapid succession of wit, romance, and observation on human absurdity, in style. ~~~~ It's hard to understand how people can find this book dull, for the very first chapter rolls out a lively discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice only gets better as you go on; I admit to once finishing the novel and promptly rereading it one day later. Also to smiling for one week straight, for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. ~~~~ Please don't come to Jane Austen only to criticize her subject matter-- every author has a style and a realm of experience which make their books unique. If you think the young ladies' endless pursuits of wealthy marriages to be old-fashioned and petty, they are! But Jane Austen crafts the novel with a skill and wit that lets the novel at once both expose how ludicrous that English society was and yet create lively and very human characters you have to love; and therein lies its charm. Pride and Prejudice is a lovely combination of sly humor, exasperation, and romance that make it one of my favorites. I hope it will be one of yours too-- don't give up on Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before you even know them! And understand Jane Austen for the talented authoress she is, whether you think her settings and period portrayals deplorably dull, pathetically petty, or (I hope!) cleverly charming. ~~~~ I think that most people, when they read P&amp;P, either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is an excellent book!
