The writing style was a little weird to get used to at first but once I adapted it was a very fast read. I'm usually a bit of a slow reader but I finished this book in under a day. I greatly enjoyed reading it.The main spoiler was way too simple and is easily figured out in the first 100 pages (I had a feeling at first but figured it out for sure during the breakfast scene). But that did not take away from the quality of the book in any way as I had only figured out the general idea and none of the details.The ending is my only complaint. It was too open, too loose, too... unclosed. There needs to be more closure. An afterward set a month later or something, showing how people are doing and what they're doing. As it is I am left floundering, alone and trying to figure out how the book was supposed to end. Because there is no ending. Maybe the last chapter got dropped from publishing and no one noticed? I don't know. I just know I'd have given this book a higher rating and recommendation if there'd been a real ending where I'm told what happens next. Instead of just leaving off where they do."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"For those looking for thrills, chills, and a traditional haunting, this story is for you. James Herbert is one of my favorite authors of this genre, right along with John Harwood and Peter Straub. This is among his best works and one that I was sorry to see end. I was drawn into the story and glued to the pages, reading this one in one sitting. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"This is most definately one of my favourite books by James Herbert. The story is elegant in setting and prose, and the characters are ghostly and enchanting as the story unfolds. What I love so much about this book is the beauty it projects that degrades into shocking horror. It's beautifully done and you find yourself enchanted and then shocked to the core as the story is unveiled.James Herbert at his very best, a must read if you like horror, thrillers or haunting ghost stories!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Don't know why exactly this book rates in the top 100 scariest. Yes, it's well written. But, it's predictable, and not all that scary. Maybe when it was written in the '80s it was more of an original idea...."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"James Herbert,one of the masters of horror has written a book so scary it will make you noticeevery little sound at night when you turn of the light and try to go to sleep.Very crepy for sure"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Haunted had me hooked on every word and gave appropriate chills to keep me reading. Although some of the twists were hinted to hard which gave the reader time to figure out some of the story and hence, diminish the chill-factor. But none the less, great read!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I purchased this book because I was in the mood for a good ghost story. I was not disappointed. At one point when I was reading the book, and it was a cold and blustery night outside, the telephone rang and I jumped through the ceiling! Recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good scare."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I loved it BUT it gave me quite a few scary moments. Especially the pond scenes, and the last scene of the book with Mr. Ash was also chilling.An isolated english rural house is the setting for the psychic investigator from the Psychical Research Institute, David Ash, to unravel the claim that an old ghost is haunting the current inhabitants. David is a high skeptical paranormal consultant who does investigations trying to prove the ghosts are not real. Boy is he in for a shock!!!!!!!I have listened on audio to NOBODY TRUE by James Herbert and I gave it a 5 star. Even though HAUNTED is a small book 223 pages it is worth every bit of a read, it really grabs you in more ways than one!!!!!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"\\"Haunted\\" is an easy, enjoyable read - I read it in less than a day. I ordered the book after being disappointed with the 1995 movie, which I felt was a good story, but not well-developed and inconsistent on several plot points. The book does not disappoint. The story is logical and consistent throughout, and does not leaving you wondering why the characters do what they did instead of something simpler.The story concerns a man, a skeptic, who investigates reports of paranormal activity for a reputable research institute. He, himself, is haunted by memories of the childhood death of his sister - giving a double meaning to the title. He is investigating reports of a ghost haunting a large, remote house in rural England. Some readers have been troubled by the fact that the investigator is willing to believe in some paranormal phenomena but not others; I did not find this a problem.This was my first James Herbert novel, and I will probably be reading more. Recommended."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Haunted is a different type of James Herbert book as there is no violence and very little gore. Although I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed some of his other books such as \\"Rats\\" or \\"The Fog\\" I still thought this book was enjoyable as it built up a lot of mystery and suspense and parts of it had me gripped.Because the book is only 240 pages it is a quite read and so Herbert successfully manages to keep the suspence through the story and althought I thought some of the plot twists were a little predictable, this is still a good book which i enjoyed.I would recomend this book to anyone who is a fan of James Herbert or of haunted house stories."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"great twist at the end had no idea or suspected the story to be this good or turn at the ending"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"'Haunted' is another of James Herbert's more 'concise' thrillers, along the lines of 'The Rats' and 'The Magic Cottage'. Despite its relative brevity, the action tends to drag in places for the first two-thirds of the book. In fact, most of the main plot until around chapter 20 is just exposition for the 'shocking revelation' about the true nature of the Mariell family and their home, Edbrook. The trouble is, this information isn't exactly a huge shock if you pay any sort of attention to the earlier chapters...or if you've seen 'The Sixth Sense', or even read 'The Magic Cottage'! In spite of this flaw, the aftermath really saves the day here.The opening chunk of the story seems remarkably quiet and uneventful for a Herbert tale. The most interesting parts are actually digressions from the main plot, shown as flashback sequences from the viewpoints of Ash's two colleagues, Kate and Edith. Both sequences are entertaining,and insightful about Ash as a character, but they seem to point out the lack of action in the main story.As mentioned before, there is very little humor or 'comic relief' in 'Haunted'. This is something of a departure for Herbert, as he always includes some (usually dark) joke to lighten the tension at some point.The one attempt at jokeiness falls flat, as Herbert inserts a long-winded filling-station attendant into one of those scenes where a major character 'just wants some information'...and the guy doesn't shut up for about two pages, spewing a non-stop monologue of 'Northern English-accented' rural speak! This, and a similar 'stream of conciousness' moment involving the discredited fortune teller(speaking in 'the voices of the dead'), are moments that take away more from the story than they add to it, as they seem to be there more for Herbert's amusement than the reader's benefit.What really saves 'Haunted'(and earns the book another couple of stars) is the last half of the story. As we learn more about the respectives pasts of both David and the Mariells, the tension begins to accelerate, and we're left with a satisfyingly scary read, as well as a hint of things to come in Ash's next appearance, in 'The Ghosts of Sleath'.A book for patient fans of the author and the genre. Patience will be rewarded!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"The hero, David Ash's stubborn adherence to skepticism in the face of ghosts that set him on fire and try to drown him is rather touching. What will it take to make him believe in the supernatural? In one unintentionally funny flashback, which seems to be completely unrelated to the main story, Ash attends a fake s&eacute;ance and jumps up to denounce the medium. He claims she is not really communicating with the dead, she is reading the minds of the living. She is a telepath.He believes in paranormal powers, just not ghosts.This book has the energy and many of the scenes from an old Hammer B-grade horror movie. If you enjoy those movies as much as I do, you'd be disappointed if, after a slow pan to an open casket, the corpse's eyes didn't pop open; if the hero didn't discover the family mausoleum and hear something scratching inside a tomb; if he didn't descend into the cellar and get bitten, bopped on the head, or set on fire. \\"Haunted\\" will live up to your wildest expectations in this regard.A bit of this lunatic energy is drained away when the author hops from viewpoint to viewpoint like a grasshopper on a hot sidewalk. I would have preferred Herbert to have stuck to the third-person, David Ash POV, unlikeable though I found this hero. He drank too much, smoked too much, didn't seem to care for anyone other than himself, and had absolutely no sense of humor. He evoked so little sympathy in me that I was inclined to speculate on what new horror would prey on him, even while he was making a pathetically feeble attempt to ward off the current ghastly apparition.Read this book if you're a Hammer film aficionado. It is fast-paced, very creepy, and you don't really have to care what happens to any of the characters."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"This is a spooky, well-written haunted house novel, a gothic ghost story that is a wonderfully atmospheric. The author is Britain's premier writer of horror stories. Having read many of his other books and been thoroughly satisfied, this one is no exception. Those with an interest in haunted house stories will find this one most entertaining and enjoyable.David Ash, a man with a skeleton in his closet, is a professional investigator of psychic phenomena with a penchant for debunking so-called supernatural occurrences. After receiving an intriguing and pleading letter from a Mrs. Webb about ghostly apparitions at Edbrook, the rural manor home in which she resides, David goes to Edbrook, only to be met by the Mariell clan, consisting of Christina, and her brothers, Robert and Simon. It turns out that Mrs. Webb, in addition to being their aunt, is also their old nanny, whom they all still call Nanny Tess. She is clearly terrified of something that is going on in at Edbrook, and the Mariells all seem to be humoring her.The Mariell siblings, at first, appear to be somewhat eccentric, but later seem to be more than just a little twisted, as it soon becomes apparent that all is not right in that household. There definitely are things that go bump in the night, and the ghostly apparition of a young girl seems to glide about the house and grounds. Moreover, Nanny Tess always appears to be in a state of acute, though restrained, terror.As a romance heats up between David and Christina, however, David appears to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the household. Too late, he realizes the nature of the evil within this isolated, rural manor house. In the end, it takes the force of something beyond the grave to save him from an almost unimaginable horror.Those who enjoy this book will also enjoy the wonderful film of the same name adapted from this book. It is an excellent adaptation with a stellar cast. It stars Aidan Quin as David Ash, Kate Beckinsale as Christina Mariell, Anthony Andrews as Robert Mariell, Alex Lowe as Simon Mariell, and Ann Massey as Nanny Tess. This wonderful haunted house story transitions beautifully to film. It is as spooky as the book."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"One of the most frightening books I have ever read! Herbert's best, unparalleled by any he has written before or since. The movie was a poor imitation - read the book. It will stay with you long after you are done."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"One of the few &quot;ghost stories&quot; that I have read and actually liked, this book is even better than the Ghosts of Sleath, which was a wonderful book in it's own right. David Ash is a master debunker of &quot;ghosts&quot; but in Haunted, he's confronted with the real thing. Has one of the most gripping endings in recent memory."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"its a great book with many unpleasent surprises which make you chilly and surprised....it feels as if your inside the book, playing the character, butscared to find out what going on on the next page. awsome book!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Another example of James Herbert's excellent grasp of horror. This time the ending is perfect - simply gruesome and horrifying without the excessive gore. There is also a great twist in storyline. Cool bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I rented the movie &quot;Haunted&quot; on a whim and was scared out of my wits. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book on which it had been based. It was truly excellent. I would love to read more by this man, but so much is out of print!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"An excellent book. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Never overly verbose."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Honestly, I dont read much books in my spare time. I have read The Da Vinci Code and I am now reading The Exorcist. I read Haunted last Halloween and found it very interesting with a complex plot and simple characters. Some strange things occur in this book that give a slight chill to the spine but not in any sence scary, just creepy. Haunted is very easy to read, keeping you to read on until the end. Its concept, interesting story and surprising twists make this book a good read, especially its horrific ending. I would give this book 4 stars if it wasn't too boring in places.Just a good read and nothing more."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"David Ash is a paranormal investigator haunted by the childhood death of his sister, he finds escape at the bottom of a bottle. David is sent to debunk the claims of a haunting at the estate of the mysterious Mariell family. While there he is forced to confront his own demons while battling malevolent manifestations in the home. This character also appears in Herbert's \\"Ghosts of Sleath.\\"Well if you've seen \\"The Sixth Sense\\" or \\"The Others,\\" (Not Herbert's \\"Others) you pretty much know what's coming by the first few pages. Unfortunately, the element of surprise is the entire foundation of the book, it's what the suspense is building to. With that gone, there are no engaging characters, no sense of atmosphere, nothing to really hold the interest. Worst yet, when David falls in love it annoyed me, as there seemed no basis for it except to up the stakes for the \\"surprise\\" ending."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Please don't waste your time and/or money on this truly awful book. It's plagiarism at it's worst. Think for a moment to every mystery/horror story you have ever read and enjoyed. Now imagine the dung heap that could be created if someone took bits and pieces of those stories and cobbled them all together - Badly!The writing is poor and the cohesiveness is non-existent, in fact it distinctly feels like the author changed his mind several times throughout the story before he gave up and just ended it. And then it somehow got published without the services of an editor.If you are like me and you like your storylines to make sense, pass on this one. In fact maybe pass on this author all together."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I'm not sure which I like best, this or the Magic Cottage. Probably joint first of Herbert's novels. Haunted is one of those rare ghost stories where the ending completely catches you by surpise. Like the film, Sixth Sense.Without giving it away, this isolated english rural house is the setting for the erstwhile reporter, David Ash, to unravel an old, old ghost who is claimed to be haunting the current inhabitants. Simplistically told, well drawn, I dare anyone to guess what's really going on.Oh, and there was a film made of this with Anthony Andrews a while back whose screenplay is as good as this original ghost story. I recommend watching it as well"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I got this book at a book fair for a buck so I got my money's worth of chills out of it and then some. I don't know what that other reader is complaining about The Others and Sixth Sense for as this book was written way before those movies ever came out!! If anything they copied him. I loved it and it gave me quite a few scary moments. Especially the pond scenes, and the last scene of the book with Mr. Ash was also chilling. So I do recommend this book to anyone who likes eerie little stories of things that go bump in the night, or the day as the case may be."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"James Herbert's Haunted is a surprisingly complex ghost story that, while considerably more low key than his notorious, and quite gruesome, rat novels, does deliver the required chills as well as a mystery with a secret that will haunt long after the book has concluded. The lead character, David Ash, appears again in The Ghosts of Sleath, a sort of sequel to this. Recommened not only to Herbert fans, but to ghost story addicts everywhere."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"In Haunted, we're introduced to David Ash who is a psychic investigator for the Psychical Research Institute. He was simply given an assignment, by Kate, to go to Edbrook (which is a house) and investigate the alleged haunting thats taking place there. David is a different character for his job, because he doesn't believe in ghosts and the paranormal - but, boy, is he in for a rude awakening. . .I was baffled by James Herbert's writing on this book. Every chapter ends off with something compelling, daring you to read further. I am an avid horror reader and even though I thought I knew everything there is to know about hauntings, here comes Mr Herbert with this well-written book and what makes it even more unique is the fact that there is a sequel to this book, called The Ghosts of Sleath(which is even better than this one). I'll advise everyone to read this book first, because it reveals some 'knowledge' about David's past that comes in handy in The Ghosts of Sleath.What are you waiting for, start reading it now!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"What would happen if only one person travelled to Shirley Jackson's &quot;Hill House&quot;, and what if this house actually contained ghosts? Author James Herbert explores this question in terrifying detail. Our protagonist is David Ash, a highly skeptical paranormal consultant, who investigates a haunted house in a forgotten corner of contemporary England. Having come from a Jamesian/Lovecraftian horror background I certainly rate this as one of the top five modern-day ghost stories I've read, unfortunately its occasional predictability and the sense that the ghosts were not very mysterious keeps it from being my top pick. I was more spooked by the house than the ghosts."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"After watching the movie, Haunted on IFC, I was determined to purchase the book. Needless to say, the movie is a bit different from the book, but I was not disappointed. James Herbert has truly mastered his craft and I look forward to becoming more familiar with his work. My recommendation, do NOT watch the movie before reading the book. Otherwise, you will be left wondering if you overlooked a few chapters."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Haunted is the first James Herbert book I ever read, and I was hooked immediately. Like all of James Herbert's books, Haunted manages to thoroughly &quot;blow you away&quot; in the last few pages without killing all the good characters to do it. I always get cold chills at the surprise endings of James Herbert's books, and this is, in my opinion, his best. The movie is great, but read the book first, then read The Ghosts of Sleath (it's a sequal)."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"Not being a book critic, I rate books on how well they keep me entertained. This was the first book that I have read by James Herbert and I thought it was fantastic. If you love haunted houses and things that go bump in the night, then this is the book for you. I look forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"This is the last time I am going to read a book with a Stephen King reccomendation on the cover. After the tedious The Ruins, I thought I'd give Haunted a try. I more or less enjoyed Herbert's Sepulchre, though the twist ending was apparent about half way through the story. It didn't take nearly that long to figure this one out. There are so many things that don't work in this book it's hard to know where to start, but probably the most egregious is the pointless b-plotline that is too obviously padding inserted into a too short book. The attempted twists and turns, the cliche characterization, the back story, are all laid on so thick that this reads more like a story from the pulps of the 1930s rather than a modern novel. The main character stumbles about, noting all kinds of strange phenomena and clues without ever getting a hint of what is obvious from the first moment he steps into Edbrook. I'll give Herbert another chance or two, but I am not optimistic."},{"Title":"Haunted","review":"I hate being the lone disenter, but while this book had some good points, it certainly wasn't great. The main character wasn't very sympathetic, the premise struck me as odd (a para-normal investigator who doesn't believe in &quot;ghosts&quot; but does believe in appartitions....what?), the relationships were underdeveloped, and the conclusion was so heavily hinted at I figured most of it out shortly after the arrival to the haunted house. I won't discuss the ending, but it also left me puzzeled, as no reason was given as to why a specific character hated the main character SO much.All in all, good atmosphere, some spooky situations, but disjointed story."},{"Title":"Gateway to Guitar Improvisation: A Guitarist's Guide to the Revolutionary \\"Fourth Note\\" Principle (Guitar Instruction)","review":"This book is hard to get hold of. It would probably be most useful as a teaching tool in the hands of a good teacher. I can't say that it has yet improved my playing, though maybe it has.It's purpose is to teach us to play freely while moving towards goal notes. It contrasts with, but also supplements and maybe comprehends, those methods that teach you to 'know where every note is', as for example the marvellous 'Jazz Guitar Structures' by Andrew Green.Where most texts like Mr. Green's demand great intellectual development (I guess that's intellect called for, certainly a powerful acuity), by forcing you to always know precisely where you are in relation to the underlying chord, Mr DeCaprio's book helps you find your way to solid notes (examples starting with the 3rd and 7th), so that you can move carelessly in reaching those notes, and thus let your hands 'find their own way'.I find 'Gateway' a guide to something very similar to good conversation... you've got to know the point you want to make, then just let your mouth take you there. If you planned everything you intended to say, you would be dull (unless you're a gifted actor); good conversation requires freshness of speech; you've got to suprise and gratify yourself if you expect to please anyone else.I don't mean at all to suggest that Mr. Green's method (or any other method that requires the development of a great knowledge of where you are on the fretboard) will not lead to the same freedom; but that there is something natural in Mr DeCarpio's method that is almost aggravating in it's simple demand: end up somewhere right.I can sometimes play movingly, but most times I intersperse terrible notes that cause me to lose my way. This book says: know someplace good to land, and then get there (with a metronome, in exactly four notes, for training), and if you keep doing that you will find expressive and personal (and, effectively, errorless) ways to get there.I'd add something that Jon Herrington (touring again with Steely Dan) said on his web site: listen with open ears and play with an open heart.Gateway will help you get there; but it is mysterious."},{"Title":"Gateway to Guitar Improvisation: A Guitarist's Guide to the Revolutionary \\"Fourth Note\\" Principle (Guitar Instruction)","review":"Tony has a unique approach that flies in the face of conventional paint by numbers approaches. This method is not for beginners, but for those who have a firm grasp of the basics of jazz guitar, it is a revelation.It gets you out of playing stale shapes, and relying on chord/scale approaches. Thinking in these 4 note chunks with target and focus notes to connect them, gives you all the ammunition needed to truly improvise rather than regurgitating a collection of licks and runs.This book requires an understanding of the intro chapter to get a clear idea of the lines and exercises to come. It reminds me of the density of Ted Greene's Chord Chemistry, except for single line playing. It is organized by chord type, and once you have the concept of what Tony is doing, there is enough here to last for years. I highly recommend it for the player who has been at it a while and is in a rut with their single line stuff."},{"Title":"Gateway to Guitar Improvisation: A Guitarist's Guide to the Revolutionary \\"Fourth Note\\" Principle (Guitar Instruction)","review":"Well, basically we're talking about a book focused on creating melodic connections between bars and chords in a given progression. It works (very well) but you will need to supply with your analysis... a little bit mechanic.. you're supposed to play exercises again and again and magic will happen...it will but, be prepared to work hard...Highly recommended for advanced players."},{"Title":"Diary of My Travels in America","review":"Louis-Philippe writes about his journey through the United States. He notes the changes in how people lived while traveling from Philadelphia to Bardstown, Kentucky. His descriptions of the cities and the rural areas provide the reader with a rich description of what it was like to travel through the wilderness in 1797. There is an exquisite description of his visit to George Washington at Mount Vernon. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in early United States history."},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"Knable writes from the real, down-to-earth perspective that connects with every guy desiring personal purity starting right now. An amazingly challenging book that gives men the right perspective on tough issues we deal with, and teaches us to love and respect women as our sisters.Every man should read this - and women would gain plenty of insight from it as well!"},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"I know that this book is for guys, but I read Sex and the Single Guy for the following reasons:1. I want to know what's going on guys' heads2. I want to know how I can better protect my brothers in Christ3. This book doesn't just deal with sexual sin, but gives guidelines for conquering sinful thoughts, protecting yourself from temptation, and surrendering yourself whole heartedly to God.Godly, single perspectives on sexuality are rare; rarer still is a guy who will face the fact that even Christian men have problems with pornography, lust, etc., and declare boldly that as followers of Christ, Christian men need to conquer this and truly be different from the world.Joe is sensitive and honest, baring his heart publicly and encouraging other single guys to join him in a war against sinful sexuality. Using the perspectives of guys and girls, and the often painful stories of both, Joe presents a powerful and convicting book.Do I recommend this book to girls as well as to guys? Absolutely! It's not often that a Christian girl can read a book for men and come away feeling valued and hopeful that there truly are men who desire purity in their guy/girl relationships."},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"I know Joe Knable as a sincere, passionate friend. In his goal to be God-glorifying, he delivers Biblical answers to the spiritual dilemma I have faced for years in my own life. Joe points out that my flesh has already declared war on me, and he has challenged me in just the first few chapters to, once-and-for-all, declare war on my flesh. If you struggle with lust, it's time to join Joe Knable in declaring war! Paul urged Timothy to \\"flee youthful lusts,\\" and Joe points us to the Biblical solution with utterly convicting honesty."},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"So I want to say this is an amazing book. And hard to find in a christian book store. I think it's somewhat of an unknown. Before this book I had been exposed to the stupid logic of the Man in the Mirror series of books which is nothing more than \\"How to bounce your eyes\\" and other sin management formulas. Joseph actually pokes fun of these books, but what's amazing is how God has used someone of his age at his time of writing this.This book is powerful and filled with scripture. The only thing I think it's missing is a reformed position on salvation. Other than that, this book tackles the spiritual aspect of sexual sin and how to battle sexual temptation. I am now married today, but this book helped me get out of being a christian in name only who was still sleeping with girls and masturbating to pornography. This book more than any other equipped me to battle sin and WAGE WAR against my flesh. With biblical truths and scripture, not formulas for sin management.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK to every young single guy I come across.I'd like to know what happened to Joseph Knable as I have noticed his website is down and nothing shows up on google.Either way, if you're a single christian guy, BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"I am in a guys' group that read and discussed this book. The themes of our group are purity and how to live life as a man of God. This was the first book we studied, and we could not have picked a better choice. Joseph Knable is honest and blunt. As I read this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"I could have written this!\\" Growing up, I thought I was the only one going through these struggles with lust. I am in my 30's, and it wasn't really until I read this book that I found out that most guys, even Christian guys, have had these same struggles I have had.Mr. Knable will challenge you to break the mold of modern-day manhood, and weed out your life of the things that cause you to fall. That is why I say in the title, if you don't want to be challenged, then do not read this book. I would recommend ALL guys read this book, but especially if you are single. This was a huge help in my life, and the life of the guys in the group. It was kind of a ground-breaker, if you will."},{"Title":"Sex and the Single Guy","review":"This is an excellent resource for teens and college age young men seeking to overcome their personal, private struggles with sexual purity. Though the author is young and relatively new, he obviously speeks from the heat of battle and has an accurate grasp on biblical truth. This book is also one of the most honest and candid expositions on the topic of masturbation I've ever read. You'll find no sugar-coating here, or any attempts at offering a watered-down, psychologically permissive (worldly) view of sex and male sexuality.Though you will have to weed through small portions of contemporary thought every great now and again (relating to music standards and other things that comprise what is \\"generally acceptable\\" in the \\"self-sensative\\" church at large today), it by no means overrides the emphasis of the book, nor does it affect the presentation of biblical truth as it relates to purity.This is a good read for youth workers and young men seeking to get the victory over their all-too-easily besetting sins."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"No one should download this version to their Kindle because it is a complete mess.

In the late 19th century, a news writer, Jacob Riis investigated and exposed the slums of New York City. In his book, How the Other Half Lives, author Jacob Riis explores New York City's underclass. Furthermore, the graphic portrayal of the worst that life offers begins and ends with a shocking tour of the slums of New York City.Consequently, before starting on a journey through the slums of the Lower East Side of New York City, Riis reminds the reader of the cold, hard truth; the poor will always be with us (Intro-xi). However, the express intention of the author is to reveal the horrendous living conditions of the poor to public attention. The journey begins with visits to tenements. Multi-story, poorly constructed buildings crowd lots. Ethnic groups, with their idiosyncratic characteristics, specifically the Jews, Italians, Irish, Bohemians, Blacks, and Chinese, exist in the squalid, intensely overcrowded, disease ridden, poorly ventilated firetraps. Examples of the living conditions include statistics citing the world's greatest concentration of humans per square mile, an alarming death rate among young children, and the frequent deaths of men and specifically women and children in fires, where there is little chance for escape.Additionally, further trepidations are evident in the lives of the masses of humanity. In the street and alleys of the Bend, the tramps; the skulks of the slums, unclean beasts of dishonest idleness, certify their presence as the dregs of society (46). Moral depravity becomes evident as opium is constantly abused, the evils of rum disenfranchise the slum dweller, and stale beer dives appeal to the prurient interests of the frugally immoral.In addition, the color line in New York City is highlighted by the prejudice of landlords as they bilk the black man out of his hard earned wages. Furthermore, the criminality perpetrated by the gangs infects the slum with fear and lawlessness. Other crimes tear at the heart, specifically, the heinous starving to death of babies. Also, women are disadvantaged at a young age for their propensity to work for the family. They walk a fine line between the rigors of work and the temptations of selling their very body for gain. In all, the journey through the desolation of the slums is not for the faint of heart.At the close of the book, Riis offers his assessment of steps performed to alleviate the problems in the slums. These include tentative solutions involving the wealthy classes, the landlords, and the tenants. Living conditions must be improved, despite the apathy of the wealthy classes, the exorbitant greed of the landlords or the lack of resolve and interest by the tenants. Some improvements have been made, however significant strides need accomplished. The words of Riis literally plead for a call to action and progress, the reform of a city beset with human degradation and suffering.Moreover, How the Other Half Lives, fulfills the purposes of the author. It brings to the light of the public eye, an awareness of life in the slums. By means of his vigilant journey through lives of the poor and forgotten, the stories of thousands are revealed. Additionally, the book achieved a supplementary purpose. It's achievements of muckraking, caused the book to be a forerunner of investigative journalism. Furthermore, the intent of the book is not only to expose the degradation of the slums, but to provide an impetus to appropriate action. The author excelled in touching both the heart and soul of the reader.Furthermore, Jacob Riis, in How the Other Half Lives, transmits a message of Social Reformation. This message seeks relief for the disparaging poor of the slums. Additionally, the book illustrates the disparity of value systems and a defeated spirit of self consciousness. In an 1897 paper, John Dewey, states \\"education is a regulation of a process of coming to share in the social consciousness: and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of reconstruction\\" (Dewey, 1897). The people of the slums: men, women, and children needed the advantages of educational opportunities. Jacob Riis documents the misery of the slums of New York City. Coincidentally, the poor, along with drug dealers, crack whores, the homeless, and gangs still live in the crowded slums of New York City. How do we raise the social consciousness and provide educational initiatives for the slum dwellers of today?Subsequently, the book is a must read for all manners of people. The eye opening, jaw dropping revelations of the New York City slums provoke both anguish and compassion. Yes, as we students sit sipping our second cup of cappuccino, relaxing upon a plush couch, watching our big screen television, we may enjoy reading How the Other Half Lives.ReferencesDewey, J.

That's part of it's 'charm.'The problem, though, is this specific edition--many images are left out, and the images really make the book; after all, Jacob Riis was one of the first muckraking photojournalists... wouldn't you want to see those pictures? They add incredible depth to the story. Luckily I had to read this for a class, and didn't mind it, but... for someone reading it for personal purposes, spend the few extra dollars for an edition with photographs. It is SO worth it."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"As others have noted, this book was the beginning of photojournalism, and remains an accurate but depressing look into the lives of poor New Yorkers in the early part of the 20th century.This book never fails to amaze me.

Riis gives the reader a front row view of life in the tenements of New York City at the end of the 19th century. Please consider the time period in which Riis wrote his book to put the ethnic, racial, class, and gender biases inherent in his work into the proper historical context. Personally, I found this offensive, but I aimed to not condemn the messenger without hearing the message first.Riis tells the story of millions of lives marked by never-ending hard labor, lack of adequate nourishment and housing, violence, abuse, addiction, and disease. Many of these people living in the tenements were first-generation immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy. The push/pull of migration to the United States ends in the New York tenements in a million shattered dreams. Rather than finding the land of opportunity, immigrants were exploited for their cheap labor.Despite Riis' biases as a journalist and observer, he was motivated by charity and goodwill to investigate the living conditions of the poor and expose the harsh reality to the world. By doing so, Riis intended to bring about social change. The reality of his expose is heart wrenching more than a century after its writing. Riis main thesis is an argument for changing the living conditions of the poor. He calls for improved housing and renovated neighborhoods as a means to improve the lives of the tenement dwellers. However, Riis does not directly make a call for educating the poor, but his writing brings the salient absence of education to bear and he does make note of attempts by church groups to educate the poor.Down in the Tenth Ward on Ludlow Street, Riis meets Polish and Russian Jews who manufacture clothing is sweltering, cramped tenements that serve both as home and factory to its inhabitants. In the chapter, entitled The Sweaters of Jewtown, an entire family works eighteen hours a day, in unhealthy, dangerous conditions to produce 1,440 pairs of knickerbockers for a mere $8.40 a week. Sweaters are to clothing manufacturing what slumlords are to housing. These migrants are exploited in many ways. The sweater gets a shocking low price for production because the workers, who rarely speak English, must underbid unions and other immigrant workers just to have work. The landlord, sometimes also the sweater, takes the exploitation one step further down toward hell and charges the highest rent he can, and requires the workers to purchase raw materials and tools. This is textbook exploitation of the disadvantaged. After all that, workers barely earn enough money to keep starvation at bay. The working and living conditions for families who are supported by the work of women fair far worse than families who have a male head of household due to the grotesque inequity in pay between males and females.Riis' story of the family living on Mott Street was far too common and representative of Riis' overall description of life in the tenements. The Mott Street family was worse off than the Jewish family he met on Ludlow Street mostly because they could not work. Without social welfare programs and medical care, they had no alternative but to suffer through their cruel fate. The doctor had been called because the baby was gravely ill. The diagnosis was \\"improper nourishment\\" (Riis, p. 126). In other words, the baby was dying from starvation. The father could no longer work because his hands were deformed from lead poisoning and because the family did not have medical care, an infectious eye condition had nearly blinded the children and the mother.If one is not moved by an ethical responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the poor and work to eradicate poverty, the Mott Street family demonstrates that poverty kills and is contagious; therefore, poverty is a public health issue. In a Jewish community, Riis notes that: \\"Typhus fever and small-pox are bread here, and help solve the question what to do with him.\\" (Riis, p. 85) This statement could be viewed as a rather anti-Semitic notion, but what Riis is really saying is that poverty is a matter of public health and infectious diseases pose a serious health threat. These two examples show how Riis wanted to shock the nation with the truth.While middle class boys were off to school, children in the tenements lived a hard life. Riis also tells us how poor children were exploited and abused. The story of \\"Edward Mulhearn, fourteen years old, had run away from his home in Jersey City\\" (Riis, p. 68) was not an isolated case. Edward was \\"employed\\" by a hustler who forced him to beg for money. To insure that Edward would solicit the most sympathy, thus bring in more money, he was burned with a hot iron and then acid was poured into the open wound.An entire essay could be written on the conditions of women and girls living in the tenements, but there is not time for that here. Let it suffice to say that females were at the very bottom of the social hierarchy and made the perfect victims. So were African Americans. Despite Riis' obvious racism and gender biases, he seems to have a special affinity and genuine fondness for women and African Americans. Riis recognized that the working skills that African Americans had used in the South became obsolete once they migrated to Northern urban areas and that employable skills were needed to promote the advancement of Blacks in society. He blamed bigotry and lack of education for their place in society. Riis recognizes that African Americans needed new job skills in order to gain employment. Today, call that workforce development and community education. At a time when African Americas were the receivers of a lot of racial animosity in the urbanized North, Riis points the finger at those who put the Black man and woman out of work by taking over his and her jobs and preventing entry into other jobs. \\"Even the colored barber is rapidly getting to be a thing of the past.\\" (Riis, p. 114)In the chapter entitled \\"The Street Arab,\\" Riis demonstrates the non-formal education that homeless boys received from the Children's Aid Society. The boys were allowed to help themselves and as long as they followed the rules, they could stay at the Society lodging house. This \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" attitude is evident in the largess bestowed on the street boys. A boy could be outfitted with a black boot kit to work the city streets shining shoes, but the boy has to purchase his trade tools on an installment plan. There were not any formal trades open to these poor kids or to their parents. The tenements of New York needed one of Franklin's free libraries and Junto organizations, but they first would need to be fed and taught to read and write.What ever formal or non-formal education the Society was able to offer these boys was contingent on first convincing the boys that their charity was not a \\"Sunday-school racket,\\" which is a reference to the missionary attempts to teach people to read to better serve God. This long-standing Protestant tradition was the hallmark of early American educational movements and the theoretical basis for literacy. The debate between the religious and secular virtues of education was an inheritance from Colonial times. Riis, like Benjamin Franklin over a century earlier, thought education was important to civil society, rather than a means to glorify God. Walter Isaacson notes in his masterful autobiography Benjamin Franklin: An American Life that the...\\"Great Awakeners sought to recommit America to the anguished spirituality Puritanism, whereas Franklin sought to bring it into an Enlightenment era that exalted tolerance, individual merit, civic virtue, good deeds, and rationality. (Isaacson, p. 109)Riis recognizes the futility in trying to convert people who are starving, homeless, and suffering when he writes: \\"How shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man?\\" (Riis, p.198) Riis calls for civil reformation that involves fair play in everything from controlled housing prices, opening trades and unions to the marginalized, ethical business practices, and laws that promote equal opportunities.Riis shows us that poverty and lack of education go hand in hand: it's a reciprocal process and one influences the other. This book was a hard read for me on several levels, but it is a lesson in compassion and a salient reminder of how lucky most of us truly are. Riis book show us that education was at a crisis stage in the urban U.S. in the late 19th century, and something had to give, or the nation would not survive in a changing world. I am grateful to of had the opportunity to read this book, and I would recommend it for reading to anyone interested in issues of race, class, and gender. Riis' book is a dark window into what life in an American city can be like when education is not an option. This book is of utmost importance to the social historian, child advocate, and social worker."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"This book is a MUST for everybody who is interested in New York City and its history!It is the perfect preparation before a tour of the tenement museum!Read it!"},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"If you read this you'll be done and what's really sad the same game is going on today.

It makes it really difficult to read, and this is already a dry book. Look for a different version if you don't want to get frustrated by a poorly made book."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"In How the Other Half Lives (originally published in 1890), Jacob Riis gives an astounding account of 19th century life in the tenements of New York City, where poverty, filth, disease, alcoholism, theft, and darkness prevail. Through his writing, statistics, and photography, Riis draws attention to unthinkable living conditions ignored too long by those better off than the tenants occupying New York's slums.In Luc Sante's introduction to the book, he summarizes Riis' view as, \\"the poor were victims rather than makers of their fate\\" (Riis, 1997). How this rings true as one reads through the pages. Riis gives the reader a better understanding of why generations of tenement occupants are trapped in a rut of constant strife and struggle, without education or means to rise above. The dense immigrant population of New York's tenements led to a very limited and low-paying job market, typically that of sweatshop labor. With the problems of the tenements came saloons, gangs, thieves, orphaned babies and other societal issues. The conditions of the tenements expanded the divide between New York's classes of citizens.Many of New York City's poor worked from dusk till midnight daily, only to earn starving wages which barely allowed them to feed and clothe their families or pay overpriced rent to wealthy landlords. Their circumstances did not afford them time for learning, particularly the English language. Without learning, financial savings, or often a job, these impoverished families could not escape the tenement properties and their resulting miserable way of life. Riis describes it best as \\"the poor are what the tenements have made them\\" (Riis, 1997).Riis provides several proven recommendations for improving New York's poverty situation caused by the tenements such as remodeling or building new tenements and instituting \\"fair play between landlord and tenant\\" (1997). He cites a few examples of landlords who reformed their properties and worked collaboratively with their tenants to successfully improve their lives.Riis' answer to the problems of the tenements is \\"all a matter of education,\\" education of landlords, of tenant families, of the public and elite, and of politicians (1997). In a more uplifting chapter, Riis describes a successful rescue program through the Children's Aid Society which instilled self-help and effectively educated young, troubled boys, the \\"Street Arabs.\\" Many of these young boys (and girls in other Children's Aid Society programs) learned trades and skills that would help them overcome the entrapping cycle of poverty.By writing this book, Riis played a major role in his plight for education about and of the tenements. According to Sante's introduction, Riis was successful in changing the status and structure of the tenements through publication of How the Other Half Lives. Riis concludes, \\"I know of but one bridge that will carry us over safe, a bridge founded upon justice and built of human hearts (1997).\\"Although this book was written during the industrialization period in the late 1890's to address issues faced by victims of New York's tenements, much of it is still applicable to the cycle of poverty still prevalent in America today, in the 21st century. As Riis believed, education plays an important part of breaking this cycle and closing the gap between the rich and poor. Benjamin Franklin, writing a century before Riis' time that education should not be a privilege only for the elite, would have agreed with his value of education as a resolution for tenement poverty (Isaacson, 2003).This book opened my eyes to just how cyclical poverty is. It can be a downward spiral for many generations. Any one interested in having a better understanding of poverty, especially of immigrants or the uneducated, should read How the Other Half Lives. I have a greater appreciation for the opportunities and fortune many of us have. Riis has inspired me to further my contributions toward education. In support of Franklin and Riis' values of education, I think the opportunity of education should be available for all to help break this cycle. I think Riis is right...until the bridge of justice built of human hearts he speaks of is fully constructed, situations of poverty will continue.ReferencesIsaacson, W. (2003).

This book serves as a Historical context of the conditions of early American immigrants. Riis is a perfect candidate to write this novel because he knows what it is like to be an immigrant, and live in poverty. Riis was the third of Fifteen children and emigrated to the U.S. in 1870. According to his biography on http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAriis.htmRiis \\"was often forced to spend the night in police station lodging houses.\\" due to lack of money. It was not until three years later that Riis found work inside a news bureau.Prehaps because Riis was able to escape proverty, he was easy to critic those that give up with out putting up a fight. Riis clearly blames the slum tenement problem on both the rich and the poor through his harsh racial comments. The rich oppresses the immigrants through high rents to prevent them from moving up in the social ladder while most of the poor do no make an effort to learn English and other skills to survive in America.This is a good book to have but it's not a very relaxing book to read. Most of the pictures are not very high quality, considering the time period it was taken, but it really does not do justice to that era. I also find Riis's writing style very dull and lengthy. (I guess some call that poetic)."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"I'm in agreement with other reviewers on the terrible quality of this edition!

I really do want to read this book, but it won't be this edition."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s. He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart. Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \\"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \\"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \\"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\\"How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem. \\"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \\"education\\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \\"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\\" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity. \\"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards, Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City\`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"I needed to buy this book for school, and decided to get the kindle edition because it was cheaper.

First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid. \\"To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them\\" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities. \\"As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business.\\" (Riis, p. 21) Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well.The next theme to emerge was that of work. In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women \\"kept house\\" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys. \\"The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows.\\" (Riis, p. 49) Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people. \\"Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job. They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their \`hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed. If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent. The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits.\\" (Riis, p 94)Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements. \\"Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death.\\" (Riis, p. xvii) People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate. The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader. And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today. It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity. Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down. \\"The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements., In many ways, as in the \`College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives.\\" (Riis, p. 207) Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless. \\"The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers. It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme.\\" (Riis, p. 205)Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section. Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements. The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work. Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house. \\"Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights. Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work.\\" (Riis, p. 105) But how did people in this situation become educated to work? \\"The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements. Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered. In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him. Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him. Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals. Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways.\\" (Riis, p. 136)Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader. In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place. Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response. Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told. For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy. The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements. \\"Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own.\\" (Riis, p. xiii)I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people. He very much accomplished his purpose. By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this. Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination. The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended. The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving.The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world. The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults. I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need. When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action. I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard. This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Yes, the stories in this book are depressing. Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so. And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions. Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"How did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers (and great-great, I suppose) survive immigration and the slums? What was life like on the Lower East Side of New York? For those of us whose family has only been in the US for a few generations, this is a must-read. Whether Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese or Polish, German, Russian, hordes of refugees ended up in New York on the promise of a better life.Reading Riis' book reads like the newspaper in some ways; entrepreneurs lured poor people from Eastern Europe and contracted out their labor in sweat shops in the US. Sound familiar? But what is not so familiar are the living conditions in the tenements, dark, unventilated cages in blocks of buildings that rented for a surprising high rent to people who died by the thousands in the unsanitary conditions. Farm animals had it better. Why was rent so high? Supply and demand. Cheaper rent was to be had in Brooklyn and the outlying (as yet unincorporated) boroughs, but the WORK was in Manhattan, where you could get by as a tailor, a seamstress, a peddler or in some illegitimate activity.The conditions will make you cry; the story of foundling babies (abandoned newborns) is astonishing. A cradle was put outside a Catholic Church and instead of a baby each night, racks of babies appeared. The Church had to establish foundling hospitals run by nuns, who persuaded the unwed or impoverished mothers to nurse the baby they gave up, plus another baby (women can usually nurse two, though these malnourished women must have been hard-pressed.) The child mortality rate, especially in the \\"back tenements\\" or buildings built on to the back of others (dark and airless) was incredible.I wish the plates in the book were of better quality; Riis took many photographs, but the reproduction here is poor and they are hard to see. I recommend that if you are interested in this subject from seeing \\"The Gangs of New York\\" or for genealogical reasons, that you visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself. Even cleaned up and no longer packed with unwashed people, they are heart-rending."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"This edition of How the Other Half Lives is astoundingly bad.

And this new genre, like the first movies and radio programs, fascinated its audience. Riis' sharp essays are matched only by his sharp eye for photography. I don't know which made more of an impact on me: the text or the pictures of unspeakable misery. But I think it's a safe bet to say that Riis' contemporaries were fixated more on the photographs. (After all, Riis turned to photography AFTER his published essays seemed to have little effect.) In any event, the result, then as now, is a provocative, compassionate, and angry work that exposed to the middle and upper classes of his time the effects of their indifference, at best, or the effects of their roles as slumlords and sweatshop owners, at worst.The only jarring aspect of the book is Riis' use of ethnic stereotyping. He makes several not-nice remarks about Jews, Chinamen, Italians, etc. However, we must not impose our early 21st Century values on a late 19th Century man. These types of remarks were commonplace back in the pre-politically correct times. In any event, Riis' overall intention was to help these people get out of their horrid conditions and not to slur their heritages.One last note, Luc Sante's introduction is brilliant and serves the book very well.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a Novel"},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"This is an extremely important work that is often difficult to find at local libraries.

He used his writing and photography to publicize the lifestyles of the lower classes in New York City in the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. In How the Other Half Lives, Riis described the inherent injustices and terrible living conditions of New York City tenements. He exposed the public to the evils of tenement life, portraying New York City living conditions of the lower classes for what they truly were. He successfully accomplished his goal of attracting attention to a dire situation.Riis wrote How the Other Half Lives to evoke sympathy to awaken the masses to the poverty in their backyards. Through his writings and photographs Riis knew people would become aware and respond to the living conditions in New York slums. Tenements were large buildings that overflowed with families living under miserable conditions. People representing many different nationalities lived in New York City tenements, and the population of immigrants grew incredibly during this time of emigration. It quickly became the most heterogeneous city in the country, and the different Europeans lived together under terrible conditions. Some immigrant groups of the same nationality lived in small separate communities together. Most settled on the East Side of New York, where the New York aristocracy had lived. The contrast between the days when the aristocracy lived on the East Side and when the immigrants moved there is quite apparent.Jacob Riis stated, &quot;Homes had ceased to be sufficiently separate, decent, and desirable to afford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and family.&quot; Tenements were overcrowded, dark, and unsanitary. Riis felt nobody should live in these conditions, and he called people to recognize the horrors of immigrant life. The homes of these immigrants were described in this way, &quot;Large rooms were partitioned into several smaller ones, without regard to light or ventilation, the rate of rent being lower in proportion to space or height from the street; and they soon became filled from cellar to garret with a class of tenantry living from hand to mouth, loose in morals, improvident in habits, degraded, and squalid as beggary itself.&quot; One of Riis's photographs, &quot;In Poverty Gap, West Twenty-Fourth Street An English Coal Heaver's Home&quot; depicts a typical poor immigrant family who obviously had very little materially and lived in a dilapidated tenement. The family seems very hardened in emotion, as if they are not even real. The combination of poignant quotes and photographs such as these led people to challenge the status quo.One of Riis's major tasks was to distinguish the difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; of New York City by comparing the immigrants with the few rich. There was very little social mobility for tenement immigrants, who made up the majority of the population. He appealed to the consciousness of the rich by saying, &quot;As business increased, and the city grew with rapid strides, the necessities of the poor became the opportunity of their wealthier neighbors.&quot; This points out the exploitation of immigrants by the wealthy class that Riis felt existed. No matter how hard they worked, there seemed to be no way out for the immigrants. &quot;Knee Pants at Forty-Five Cents a Dozen - a Ludlow Street Sweater's Shop&quot; is a photograph that shows an entire family working diligently in their confined tenement. This illustrates that there was no hope for immigrant families; they kept working but reaped no benefits. Riis blamed the tenement living conditions for the crimes and unethical behavior he saw among the immigrants. He blamed their poor standard of living for the abundance of crime and other abuses in immigrant neighborhoods. &quot;A Downtown Morgue&quot; presents us with drinking, one of the vices of the immigrants, but implies that they had nothing to encourage them to stay away from it. The photograph also reinforces the poverty and hopelessness, suggesting the immigrants had nothing to live for so they wasted their lives away on alcohol. Riis took a special interest in children because he saw them as innocent people who had become so jaded by their surroundings that they became criminals. &quot;Prayer Time in the Nursery, Five Points House of Industry&quot; portrays young children praying, probably indicating Riis's dream that all children would be set on the right path and stay there throughout their lives.A major criticism to Riis's work is that he was prejudiced and writing from a biased point of view. Riis reflected the view of the upper classes toward the immigrants and poorer classes, and readers can pick up on this through the biases in his work. He could not fully understand the plight of the people he studied because he was not one of them. Riis used terms that were crude and unflattering to the nationalities of those whom he was describing. He describes the &quot;Chinaman&quot; in the following way, &quot;Ages of senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship, have left him without the essential qualities for appreciating the gentle teachings of a faith whose motive and unselfish spirit are alike beyond his grasp.&quot; He also referred to the Chinese as a &quot;terrible menace to society&quot; because of their marijuana smoking. Riis wrote that &quot;lower class&quot; Italians were foreign, different, and therefore separate from others. Other examples of vivid language Riis used were, &quot;the tramps, peddlers, hags, rude swains, and the really pretty girls.&quot; Since he was an outsider due to his class, he could not possibly relate to the people he was describing."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"\\"The business of housing the poor, if it is to amount to anything, must be business, as it was business with our fathers to put them where they are. As charity, pastime, or fad, it will miserably fail, always and everywhere\\" (p. 201). Jacob A. Riis, in his book, How the Other Half Lives, vividly describes the human condition of the tenements of New York during the late 1800's. The author provides not only a physical description of the tenement buildings but delves deeper into the people who live there and why they don't leave the pits of filth and despair.Jacob Riis, presents a compelling account of the intricate business of managing the slums of New York and maintaining the status quo among the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to America to seek a new and prosperous life. After arriving they found they were trapped in a life of high rents and low wages with little hope for improvement of their circumstances. What little help was available seemed to be in the form of charity that couldn't sustain the prideful immigrants desire to succeed in this country.The reader is taken on a tour of the slums and introduced to the groups of immigrants nationality by nationality and given a full account of the author's stereotypical ideas about their good and bad points. Of the Italian Riis says he only spends time indoors when it's raining or he is sick. When the sun shines the entire population seeks the streets carrying on all facets of life (p. 47). He further says the Italian is a born gambler (p 44) and learns slowly, if at all (p. 42) so that his job of working the ash carts is simply suited for him. On the positive side Riis says the Italian is as honest as he is hot-headed (p. 45).The Chinese are a stealth and secretive group with all activities going on behind closed doors (p75). They are also attributed with stealing the women of the white man and leading them into the grip of opium giving them up only to the Charity Hospital or the Potter's Field (p76). On the positive side the Chinese are noted for their scrupulous neatness (p 78).The Bohemians are an honest group but rumored as being anarchists. They are fond of beer and will live at the highest means available thus they have nothing saved for a rainy day (105). He is caught in a tough position of working for poor wages and facing rising rents with no way out. For if he rebels against low wages and high rent he loses his home and job; the two are connected as cigar making takes place in the home utilizing supplies provided by the landlords.To the Jews money is their God and they work in the tenements crowding the area of Ludlow Street more densely than the crowding of Old London (p 83). They are suited to baking as bread is cheap and their love of money and the saving of it is suited to eating bread. They are also known for their work in the clothing industry. Of the Blacks, Riis stereotypes them as cleaner and better tenants but none-the-less they pay higher rents for no one else will live in a tenement after the black man has. While much of the reading is based on the stereotypes formed by the author it still provides a vivid picture of the human condition including the live's of tramps in stale beer dives and the thugs who cause fear and trouble in the streets. Both tramps and toughs profess that the world owes them a living (p64). The author also relates the degree to which the upper class try to distort the reality of life in the tenements, classifying starvation as \\"improper nourishment\\". In one case starvation led one poor man to thoughts of murdering his own children. In his madness he had only one conscious thought: that the town should not take the children. \\"Better that I take care of them myself ,\\" he repeated to himself as he ground the axe to an edge.(p 127).Due to this book, Riis was able to draw public attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City, and to insist on reform. The reforms he recommended were largely undertaken, although it was a very gradual process (p. ix). This may be partially attributed to political factors relating to the fact that political contests were won in the areas with the fully packed lodging houses (p 71). With this writing Riis does not allow the world to forget easily, what it does not like to remember (p196)."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Riis's work is an amazing picture of life in the New York slums. While the text in itself is quite interesting, the photos are perhaps the most gripping aspect of the book. To see the tiny, crowded rooms populated by unreal numbers of people and the eyes of hungry children that stare out of the picture and are still imploring a century later is a powerful experience; Riis's book allows one to get very close to the misery these people felt. This book is not for the soft-hearted, as it is a very grim depection of life, such as it was for these immigrants."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Jacob Riis' first and most influential book, How the Other Half Lives details the lives of the impoverished of New York City's slums at the end of the 19th century. His expose was highly influential and brought about a number of reforms within the City, yet the tome is filled with almost comical stereotypes and prejudices about the various races and cultures found within the domain of the tenements, sidestreets and alleyways that the poor called, for lack of a better word, home. Despite this massive shortcoming (a sign of the times Riis lived in), Other Half is an engaging read and showcases the severe plight too many endured during this period in history, moreso than the most depressingly dour of Dickensian prose."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Few books in American history have had the social impact that Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives had. Riis spent years crawling through the slums of New York's Lower East Side in the later half of the nineteenth-century, always with a local guide sympathetic to his cause. He hoped, through the evolving technological advances of photography and his published, emotional plea, to rouse the well-to-do citizens of New York into helping the millions of poor and impoverished, native and immigrant alike, which continued to swell the city's population. In order for them to have had the chance of becoming productive American citizens, they must first have been given the opportunity at a fair start, which the abject state of the tenement buildings were unable to provide.The first problem was the tenement itself. Usually a building, four to six stories high, intended for the occupancy of just a few families, soon had over a hundred people packed into every nook that could fill a human body. Most interior rooms never saw the light of day. Fresh air was a rare commodity, leaving most residents to breathe the same stale air day and night. The maze of tight, blind passageways created to fit each family made it impossible for firemen to reach helpless victims trapped on the upper floors, compounded by the fact that most fire escapes were blocked with residents' furniture, trapping more even still. Overall, the filth of the structures proved most offensive to the senses. One such building was so dubbed the \\"Dirty Spoon\\" because the grime on the walls had effectively made it fire proof (Riis 30). Rear tenements, built in empty courts behind the street buildings, were usually worse, little more than dilapidated hovels cut off from light by the surrounding structures.Despite this vision of abject poverty, and indeed starvation was prevalent, many in the tenements were not what would have been considered poor. Some, in fact, earned a decently living for the era. So why didn't they move? The real question to be asked is, to where would they move? Tenement houses were the norm in New York, each as good (or lousy) as the next. Additionally, the rents paid by most of these residents (especially blacks) were very high, often amounting to more than a week's wage. Only the abundantly wealthy could afford better, while the middle and lower classes were left to the stink of places like \\"The Bend\\" on Mulberry Street, which Riis considers the heart of slum depravity.Predictably, these conditions bred all types of criminal activity. Faced with constant hunger and only the streets to call home, many resorted to gang violence or controlled substance dependency. Children, who sometimes never saw beyond their squalid block, with a family that could not provide for their basic needs, soon created gangs of their own, making their way as they could. Other children toiled with their families in the sweatshops, for which the tenements were the main housing. Perhaps the most regrettable victims of the tenements were the infants, who were regularly victims of abandonment, left on wealthy doorsteps with vain hopes by desperate parents, or given up to \\"Baby-farms\\" where they were left to starve to death (Riis 148). These conditions Riis blames squarely on tenements: \\"The product is our own\\" (Riis 171).However, all hope was not lost to Riis. Already airshafts had been implemented in new building designs to allow ventilation (to what effect can be debated) and new windows punched into walls, so that \\"air and sunlight\\" could \\"have a legal claim\\" (Riis 211). Rear tenements, too, were quickly disappearing. He felt that by writing How the Other Half Lives, the wealthy and influential of the city would come to the aid (Riis 131). In this respect he was correct, when through his book he found an ally in Theodore Roosevelt, who began implementing many of the suggestions that Riis proposed. He urged people to look beyond the building facades (which were admittedly nice on some buildings) to the teeming filth that they masked (Riis 209). Perhaps the most intimidating argument for his more fortunate peers was the possibility of spreading disease, for to him public sentiment had \\"slumbered peacefully until... a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door\\" (Riis 212). He called for laws to be imposed against the current tenement conditions, for the buildings to be renovated or new \\"model tenements\\" built in their place (Riis 223). Likewise, tenants should have received the quality accommodations their high rents were entitling them to. Riis endorsed the park system (City-Beautiful influence?) as a way of relieving crime in congested districts, for reasons such as this elegant observation: \\"I have seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than a policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle appeal\\" (Riis 138). Children, Riis felt, were the \\"key\\" to rescuing the city from poverty and corruption (Riis 143).The other contribution for which Riis has been immortalized, and no doubt thanked repeatedly by modern historians, is the treasure trove of photos he took while on his outings, one hundred of which are found in the Dover edition. (His original publication did not include the photos for technological reasons). The impact of the strikingly bleak images caught on film far outweighs any of the emotional condemnations he wrote. The reader, thankfully, is also treated to many of the stories behind these images, adding yet another dimension, such as the young paupers on page 157 who claimed that they \\"Didn't live nowhere.\\" Another, probably unintentional, effective element to the photos is the pained grimace on many faces (like the \\"Street Arab\\" on page 152), as though they are writhing in agony from hunger, although it is no doubt just a reaction from the camera's blinding flash in dark quarters. The street dwellers and criminals, even those presumably embarrassed by their situations, seem willing to have their pictures taken. Perhaps it is the only such opportunity many had.Despite Riis's commendable crusading and fight for the underprivileged, he was still in many ways a man of his time. The modern reader cannot help but be struck by the prejudices running through his commentary. The groups that receive the most of the brunt are the Italians and Polish Jews. The Chinese also pay a price for their differences, and Riis tells us that his \\"senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship\\" have made nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused\\" (Riis 77) and speaks of opium addiction as a form of white slavery (Riis 80). At least he commends them for being clean. Surprisingly, however, he looks fondly on African-Americans (along with Bohemians), who he treats with sympathetic respect. He sees their hardships, and the causes (ironically), that \\"the blame is born by prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" under those circumstances. That after only twenty-five years of freedom, he \\"may be seen to advance much farther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, with fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned fellow-citizens\\" (Riis 119). When he wished, it seems, Riis was quite able to see beyond differences.Riis, through How the Other Half Lives, awakened a society that had once turned a blind eye to the hardships prevalent in the tenements. He showed them effectively that the struggle was not theirs alone, but that its reach was felt for many miles in ways not readily apparent. His photographic images, forever capturing the lowest moments in people's lives, begged for intervention. Whatever Riis's shortcomings, future generations in New York and cities around the country would be better off because of what he did, and benefit from the experiences of those who did not live long enough to see those changes occur. Unfortunately, the images in Riis's work are still a common sight in many developing countries, making his century-old ideas of relevant, present power."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"I used this book along with another Riis book for a U.S. History project at school.

The evidence that supports that conclusion is embedded in his book, now a classic of muck-raking and a key player in the history of social reform in America. The fascinating thing was the reformers were fought tooth and nail not only by the slum landlords but by the poor themselves. That is just one of many items that make this story compelling reading, especially in view of the official facts and figures displayed and the pictures that go with those facts and figures. Wow! 27 people living in a room with two beds. 28,000 babies abandoned to the Sisters of Charity crib in one year. Massive deaths of children from, of all things, measles. The most common diagnosis made by the Summer Doctors (a corps of physicians from the New York City Department of Health) was \\"improper nourishment\\", none other than our malnutrition, but translated to that place and time meaning starvation. And yet milk was 2 cents a quart, a meal of soup, meat stew, bread, vegetables, and a stein of beer cost 13 cents. Add a cigar and another beer and it's 15 cents. Hence, the poor could have survived on minimal amounts of money, which, unfortunately, they did not have. The past is a different country said LP Hartley. He was right. They did things differently there. A word of caution: Riis in his zeal does protest too much. Some of the pictures are doctored to look worse than the reality. Many pictures are posed and probably paid for. Look at the one on the cover. The boy on the left is awake and smirking. The ash on his right shoulder has been sprinkled there for effect. The boy in the middle is not sleeping either as it is impossible to sleep with your head balanced on your fist like that. Why would he do that anyway when he could rest his head normally like the rest of us? He is posed and in that position so that Riis can get all three boys in the picture. Another example of hyperbole: On page 54 we are told that the child's temperature is 115 F. That is medically impossible as human enzymes and cellular energy systems stop working at 110. By the time a temperature reaches 110, the patient is dead, has to be dead. 115 is possible if and only if they are on fire or heated by a source outside their body and then they still would be dead. As has been pointed out many times, Riis displays remarkable personal and cultural prejudices. His main fault is over generalization based on the assumption that every Jew is alike, every Irishman the same. Not every Italian is a gambler. Nor is every Irishman a drunk. Some Chinese do not smoke opium and at least some Jews are not misers. Because a person is not Christian doesn't automatically make them immoral as Riis would have us believe. Yes, the author has many faults. But most of them in this historical context are trivial. The results of his work are not trivial and speak for themselves: massive reform of wages, hours of work, living conditions, sanitation, social and personal hygiene, Public Health, and most importantly, public supervision of private greed and public modification of private greed by law."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Although this book, How the Other Half Lives, was originally published in 1890 the images created still haunt the reader today because we sense that much has not changed in the last one hundred years.The author, Jacob Riis was born in 1849 in Denmark, the third of fifteen children. His family was poor, but respectable. (Riis, xiv) For economic reasons, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States. Quickly running out of money, he was forced to take odd jobs, sleep in doorways and accept handouts for food. Eventually finding employment as a journalist, Riis developed his own style of writing. He violated traditional newspaper style by \\"inserting editorial commentary into his stories.\\" (Riis, xvi) This style became known as muckraking.In his writings, Riis focused on issues of housing reform. He found that merely describing the conditions with words was not convincing enough, so he began to use photography. In the Introduction to the book, Luc Sante reports that Riis' \\"flash awoke sleepers and momentarily blinded drinkers and workers and nursing mothers, pinning them in their surroundings and shocking them into submission to the lens.\\" (Riis, xvii)As an immigrant, Riis knew first hand what it was like to live in poverty. When he was younger, out of money and unable to find steady employment, he often spent the night in police station lodging houses to escape from the cold. This book explores the living conditions of the American immigrant in the tenements of New York City. Riis' writing is full of the sights and sounds of the forgotten or ignored people living in the Lower East Side.This writing is unique in that it takes you directly into the tenements. The reader's skin crawls from the thought of the filth, the nose wrinkles from the imagined smells and the feeling of darkness hangs like a cloud from the first page until the last. Rather than providing us with a list of impersonal statistics, Riis gives us a glimpse into the lives of human beings. The reader experiences the sights and sounds of even the most austere little room shared by what seems like multitudes of people. The pictures verify the human condition that Riis describes.Riis writes as if he were talking to the reader as they were walking down the streets and alleys of the tenements. \\"Take a look into this Roosevelt Street alley; just about one step wide, with a five-story house on one side that gets its air and light - God help us for pitiful mockery! - from this slit between the walls,\\" he writes. (Riis, 35)Throughout the book Riis mentions the lack of sunlight, lack of clean air and filth that are part of the everyday lives of those living in the tenements. But, \\"when the sun shines the entire population seeks the street, carrying on its household work, its bargaining, its lovemaking on street or sidewalk, or idling there when it has nothing better to do.\\" (Riis, 47) Unfortunately these rays of sunshine are not often found in Riis' description of life in the tenements.Riis blames the tenement problem on both the rich and the poor. He writes \\"...the vilest and worst tenement property to be found anywhere, stood associated...with the name of an honored family, one of the \`oldest and best', rich in possessions and in influence.\\" (Riis, 53) The rich oppressed the immigrants through high rents, preventing them from climbing the social ladder.But Riis also blames the poor for their plight. He was troubled by the fact that many did not make an effort to learn English and other skills necessary in America. Riis attempts to hold these immigrants to the standards he held for himself. He believed that it was important for immigrants to engage in business and to assimilate into their new surroundings. Riis did not appreciate immigrants who insisted on holding onto their traditional language and culture.Riis walks the reader through the different sections of the tenement, describing the various ethnic groups with his unique editorial commentary: the Italians, Chinese, Jews, Bohemians, Blacks and Arabs. The descriptions are not what the reader would consider politically correct in this day and age. According to Riis he is being candid and reporting what he observes, but these comments are no longer acceptable, regardless of the intent.Riis also describes the plight of children. According to him, many of the children have been put out on the streets by their families who are no longer able to support them. Riis takes the readers into the ten-cent lodging houses where the children often sleep and are introduced to a life of crime, prostitution and drugs as they fall victim to those ready to take advantage of their lack of funds and family support.This book was written and published to garner public support. It accomplished the goal. According to Luc Sante, in his introduction, Riis' book had an immediate impact and reform was undertaken to improve the conditions of the poor in New York City. How the Other Half Lives was instrumental in shining the light on the tenements so that the upper and middle class could no longer ignore the plight of the poor and pretend they did not exist. The book also brought to light the effects the tenement and sweatshop owners were having on these oppressed people.As Riis takes the reader on this journey, which covers a period of time, he tells the readers of the changes that are being made. He mentions the parks that have been built, buildings that have been torn down and replaced by new buildings that have better designs, and the enactment of child-labor laws. Specifically, during the time of Riis' writing the airshaft was introduced into the design of the tenement. This allowed for air to circulate in the buildings, lowering the spread of disease. Through this book the reader actually senses the evolution of the tenement.One can't help but wonder that if Riis were walking the streets of New York City or another major city in America today, if he wouldn't be just as discouraged with what he would still find to write about and photograph. Unfortunately even the sweatshop is still a deplorable condition for immigrants one hundred years later. Fortunately, we still have journalists who are concerned enough to shed light on these conditions and continue to bring the plight of the poor and homeless to the attention of the middle and upper class, lest they be forgotten again."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Riis was before all else a photojournalist, and this his major body of work. As such, the fact that there even exist editions which do not contain quality reproductions of the photos astounds me. This edition only contains a few, and they are small, pixelated, two-tone reproductions. The Dover edition is the one to get."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"This book hooked me and tranported me to another time. I was at turns horrfied and amazed at how life was lived then. I love history, especially social history and this book delves into the \\"other half\\" that is usually sorely neglected.

Although, as Luc Sante states in his introduction, Riis' sole purpose for writing this book is to \\"call attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City and insist on reform\\" (p ix), Riis also presents another underlying theme by unequivocally proving that the more people isolate themselves from the rest of the world, the better chance there is for gross victimization of those less fortunate: simplistically speaking, the rich get richer; the poor get poorer; the wider the gap grows in between (dispersion of our so-called middle class.)Riis' talent lies in his use of poetically descriptive language, saturated with metaphor and alliteration, alongside contrasting factual accounts of harsh reality. The reader is mesmerized by the rhythmic sound of lines such as \\"Down near the Battery the West Side emerald would be soiled by a dirty stain, spreading rapidly like a splash of ink on a sheet of blotting paper\\" (p 25), but then shocked by the stark conditions of tenement life as given in the form of personal stories, photographs, legislation, statistics, and blueprints. Riis writes about the windowless, airless rooms and the unbelievably filthy crowded living conditions. He recounts stories of bitter violence toward children and between the races, as well as degradation and oppression among women, the old, and the infirm. The reader is sickened with wretched stories of infanticide and mortality rates among the children.Riis unapologetically interjects his novel with stereotypical remarks and his own bigoted opinions of the people inhabiting the various ethnically divided \\"wards.\\" Some of his include those such as \\"between the dull gray of the Jew, his favorite color, and the Italian red, would be seen squeezed in on the map a sharp streak of yellow, marking the narrow boundaries of Chinatown\\" (p 24), and \\"poverty, abuse, and injustice alike the negro accepts with imperturbable cheerfulness...He loves fine clothes and good living a good deal more than he does a bank account\\" (p 117).Through the obviously prejudicial film that covers Riis' novel from beginning to end, the reader is able to perceive a sense of his true passion of wanting to make a positive difference in society. His previous stereotypical remarks about African Americans are somewhat softened when he later comments on the injustice towards them:\\"...when the account is made up between the races, it shall be claimed that he falls short of the result to be expected from twenty-five years of freedom, it may be well to turn to the other side of the ledger and see how much of the blame is borne by the prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" (p 119).Riis is an example of a pioneer whose work, sacrifice, and commitment have shaped our country and our world. By educating the public through his journalistic indictments, he provided the catalyst for the ensuing slow process of reform. What places Riis on a higher level than others who have written expos&eacute;s is the fact that he not only provided what he thought to be the main causes for the deplorable situation of tenement life, but also provided an outline of a well thought out plan for improvement that included detailed legislation, floor plans for remodeling, and sound economical postulations. Luc Sante states that Riis does not \\"inquire very deeply into the causes of the conditions he describes\\" (p xi), but one can logically infer very plainly many individual causes and effects that ultimately affect the whole, such as greed, gross lack of education of a whole segment of society, a government and society who chose not to care (or may have felt it did not have the time or resource to care,) growth of nation that was infinitely more vast than expected, depression, oppression, and inertia (on both ends of the class spectrum.)Riis' book is not only a ghost from the past, but also a ghost from the present that haunts our country and our world today. One can still see economically imbalanced conditions that contribute to the growing lower class. Insightful remarks made over one hundred years ago make one disgusted to realize that seemingly little has been learned:\\"Nothing is now better understood than that the rescue of the children is the key to the problem of city poverty, as presented for our solution to-day; that a character may be formed where to reform it would be a hopeless task\\" (p 139).This book should be read for the beauty of the prose, the horror of the content, and the insight to be gained from both. Riis succeeds in showing the reader that our world is a unit existing of one: indeed one world. Riis presents an inarguably complete and comprehensive exposition of \\"how the other half lives.\\""},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob Riis, with Introduction by Luc Sante, is a book that paints a picture of tenement neighborhoods in New York City in 1890. Riis, himself an immigrant, made his living as a journalist. It is his gift of words that brings the slums to life, and transports the reader to the very spot that he describes. Riis was the first to include photographs to vividly capture what his words portray. His writing and photographs were forerunners to investigative reporting and documentaries. Sante referred to Riis' agenda as being restricted to the mundane because he wanted immediate achievable results that would better the lives of the other half. Although his plans were simple; proper housing, sanitary conditions, parks, and schools; they were considered revolutionary. When he left the newspaper business in 1901 he became a lecturer speaking on this topic of reform that was so dear to his heart. He made headway and convinced influential people such as Theodore Roosevelt to join his cause.I think Riis was extremely successful in his mission to make people aware of the conditions in the tenements. Since this book was reprinted in 1997 and the introduction was added at that time, I think it would have increased the value of the book to include a section that briefly described the current condition of the tenements in today's light, and review, with a timeline, the reforms achieved since 1890. It would be interesting because Sante says \\"It [the book] haunts us because so much of it remains true\\" (p.xiii). This book created reforms, but if after 116 years, much of it is still true, we must be missing something. Then again, perhaps not, since Riis says the poor will always be with us, and we can never get rid of either the pauper or the tenement (p.xi).Riis was a firm believer that education alone could make \\"the other half's\\" lives better, but he also knew their need to work long hours to have a roof over their head and food to eat made the chance of education a far flung dream (pp.95, 105, 111, 136). Without the ability to speak English they are unable to change careers. Another solution he had was to focus on the children as a way to reduce city poverty (p.139). Riis preached that besides charitable donations there needed to be people willing to step into action (pp.145, 213).I think the book was well written and is very descriptive. At times I thought his words tended to be racial, blunt, and opinionated, but that was his true style, even in his journalistic works (p.xvi). Even though I didn't like to read the racist words, I believe he accurately presented the views of the slums. Just as Walter Isaacson fills his readers with awe at the accomplishments of Ben Franklin in his book Ben Franklin, An American Life, Riis fills us with an ache for the immigrants coming to America to make a better life for themselves and finding it hard to do. I think anyone interested in history or the life of an immigrant would find this an informative book. It isn't one I would find on an educational reading list in terms of contributions to education, but it does give insight into living conditions in the late nineteenth century and gives a plug for a connection between education (or lack of) and living conditions within the largest city in America."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"Like books by Steinbeck, How the other half lives is a eye opening expose of life for the have-nots in the late 19th century. The progression through the different areas of NYC shows that there were a lot more poorer people in the city than I thought. Riis is thorough and pulls no punches in showing how the other half true lives."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"How the Other Half Lives, Jacob A. RiisThis book is a \\"classic\\", most people have heard about it but few have read it. [The word \\"tenement\\" is a legal term for property holdings, usually housing that is not owner-occupied.] Riis was a newspaper reporter, this book was first published in 1890 to document housing in New York city. Riis came from Denmark at age 21. Arriving in NY he first worked as a carpenter, later he became a police reporter for newspapers. He walked down Mulberry Street in the early mornings. Slum housing was the result of \\"public neglect and private greed\\". [The big landowners of New York controlled politics since the 18th century.] Riis believed that education was most important for new immigrants. This book lacks the photographs that illustrated the original book. Riis' \`Introduction' says slum housing causes criminals. They are also a source of epidemics. Was this distress caused by drunkenness? The slums generated a 40% yearly return on the investment!The rapid expansion of NY after the War of 1812 saw the rise of rear houses, tenant-houses built to house the maximum number of people in the smallest area (Chapter 1). The threat of cholera led to a \\"Tenement-House Act\\" in 1867 (Chapter 2). Rooms had to have windows for light and air. Most tenement dwellers were immigrants (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes \\"The Down-Town Back Alleys\\" where large houses were subdivided into tiny rooms. Riis describes the living conditions. Chapter 5 tells about the Italians in New York. Chapter 6 tells about \\"The Bend\\" of Mulberry Street near the Five Points, the heart of the slum district. These vile properties are owned by \\"an honored family\\". Chapter 7 tells of a police raid on stale-beer dives (unpasteurized beer). Chapter 8 describes the cheap lodging-houses \\"nurseries of crime\\". Riis describes Chinatown in Chapter 9. Some houses are opium dens with \\"white slaves\\". The Chinaman is \\"as clean as a cat\\".Chapter 10 describes the Hebrew quarter, the most densely populated neighborhood. Most of the ready-made clothes sold in the big stores are sewn here. Chapter 11 tells of the \\"sweaters\\", the middleman or subcontractor, who hires people in the tenements for unregulated labor. They work hard and save to send for their families. Chapter 12 describes the Bohemian cigar-makers who live in tenements owned by their employers. Chapter 13 discusses the \\"Color Line\\", the segregated areas where Negroes are allowed to live at higher prices. Tenement houses do not have a locked front door (Chapter 14). A respectable tenement neighborhood has few saloons. Flowers improve tenements, so too small parks. The heat of July and August create hardship and death for children. Newer buildings with proper sanitation had lower mortality rates. Death from starvation was common. Poverty created madness. Chapter 15 describes \\"The Problem of the Children\\" and what needs to be done to save them.The abandoned children put in the Foundling Asylum do not last long (Chapter 16). The Sisters of Charity have a good record. Worst of all are the \\"baby farms\\". Chapter 17 tells of the \\"Street Arabs\\", homeless boys who live on the street due to poverty at home. The Children's Aid Society provide good housing and character. Trade schools educate the older boys. There are about ten saloons to every church (Chapter 18). Gangs are endemic to New York (Chapter 19). They can terrorize a neighborhood. People walking the street could be robbed, such as a stranger asking for directions. Their \\"social clubs\\" often use blackmail. Chapter 20 tells of the oppression experienced by working girls in NY from low wages. Chapter 21 is about \\"Pauperism\\", families and individuals who applied for relief. Riis suggested setting up a labor bureau to match workers to jobs. Chapter 22 tells about the \\"Wrecks\\" in the workhouse, the almshouse (some are old people abandoned by their children), and the lunatic asylum. The worst tenements do not look bad; they are not old enough (Chapter 23). Chapter 24 tells what has been done to solve tenement-house problems. Chapter 25 lists what can be done with modern tenement-houses. Riis suggested tax rebates or licensing to regulate tenements."},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"The overall presentation of the book is fine. I use it as a teaching tool ...

At the same time he drags out all of the tired stereotypes of the day about the different ethnic groups then living in the city (mostly: Jewish, Irish and Italian).Riis' upper-class lifestyle and upbringing are apparent throughout the book, and some of the passages would offend many of our sensibilities today, but the general point of the book is what's important here. The upper-class lives in comfortable ignorance while a significant number of Americans have to wonder where their next meal is coming from and what they'd do should they, god forbid, fall ill.A good book if you're looking for a more modern perspective on this problem is Barbra Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed.\\""},{"Title":"How the Other Half Lives","review":"I had to chose a book to read for my AP History Class, and I thouhgt this book would be very interesting; and it was.

John Moore is definitely gifted in the area of characterization, and one gets to know Ezra and his family and friends very intimately as the plot unfolds. Ezra Riley is REAL and the events that happen in his life are REAL. To enhance the intrigue even more, Moore weaves the natural and the supernatural together with great skill throughout the novel.On subsequent readings (and you WILL read this more than once) the reader begins to see the &quot;message&quot; behind the prose. John Moore preaches through his characters, exposing the gutsy, secrets that dwell in people's hearts; Jubal, Lillie Foster, and Ezra himself are mirrors to be looked into deeply. Once the reader looks he/she will say, &quot;OH that is me!&quot; or &quot;Oh that is what has been happening to me!&quot; My promise to you, the readers, is this. You will be riveted!"},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"In, The Breaking of Ezra Riley we find what is usually surprisingly lacking in contemporary Christian fiction. Reality!John L. Moore paints the life of a prodigal son, only in this tale Ezra's father isn't waiting with open arms, he's dead, and his mother is an overprotective chain smoker looking for a way to fill the void that the death of her tyrannical abusive husband has left not to mention someone to manage the rundown cattle ranch that was his legacy. She turns to Ezra, her only surviving son, who at this point in his life is woefully unfit for the job.Despite his lack of qualifications Ezra takes the job, and the man that left Montana a renegade, hippy poet clad in sandles returns, this time sporting K-mart cowboy boots and a chip on his shoulder the size of the Montana sky. He has something to prove. However, he doesn't manage to prove anything more than that he's not much better than the father he disdains. While seeking to prove that he's the better man, he finds out something that both terrifies and intrigues him. He's more his father's son than he'd hoped.His wife joins him with their infant son, and here enters my one nit. Every character in this book is a well rounded, real person except Ezra's wife. Her sugar sweetness could've been counter-balanced with a little PMS or something. She's a Christian, and tries to share her faith without smothering Ezra or driving him away, but in the end the very sweetness I found slightly distasteful manages to annoy Ezra too. She is everything to him that no one else has provided. A mirror that gives him his real reflection, but doesn't shatter as his self image has done. He just can't accept her assesment of himself. Surely he must be worse than that if he's a Riley boy? Just look at his father and his six uncles!The book takes the reader on a journey filled with excellent characterization, and sub-plots that are entertaining without detracting from the real story. We watch sadly as Ezra manages to alienate or destroy everything and everyone he touches, and the approval he's seeking isn't obtained, especially by the reader. With the skill of a wordsmith John L. Moore has managed something very tricky. He's made the reader feel almost disdain towards the main character without destroying the vital link. While reading the book I felt as if Ezra needed a thump on the head, but I also cared for his plight. I wanted him to overcome the curse that seemed to plague him, and find hope for the future.I won't ruin the ending, but suffice it to say it isn't dissapointing, and yet it also isn't the typical salvation/everything is rosy despite our faults ending that has marked so much Christian fiction. The prodigal son makes it home, but will he accept the open arms of his Father? We encounter grief and real life tradgedy with none of the soothing balm we've seen in all the other books.Any readers in search of characters that you could swear showed up at your family reunion, and dialogue that brings to mind a conversation you had with your wife/sibling/friend/parent will enjoy this book. It's outlining hope depsite the disasters we create for ourselves and the skeletons of our past and family, but it don't come easy. These characters might not be your family, but it's one that will be easily recognizable thanks to the superb writing skill of John L. Moore. I look forward to reading more from this author.--Karma Wilson"},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"This was given to me as a gift, and I really didn't know what I'd think of it. I've never been one for Cowboy books, I've never once read Louis L'amour. So to be quite honest, I really didn't care if this was a read that I'd put down half way through. Well, after the first chapter I found myself looking at my wife saying, \\"Ya know, this isn't half bad.\\" That was kind of an understatement, it was awesome!So you REALLY want to read about Montana? You want to read about horses, possibly learn about what ranch life is all about? Are you ready for this? Is this the adventure you're looking for? You'll find out. Ezra Riley is the man who comes back home to stay after his daddy's funeral. His daddy is Johnny Riley, and everybody knows ole' Johnny. One tough sonuvagun that Johnny. Ezra has his Uncle Sam and Solomon still alive in these parts of Montana, and they still speak their mind when the time comes. Steven Curtis Chapman wrote a song called \\"The Great Adventure\\" and it starts out with him singing in excitement, \\"Saddle up your horses!!!\\" If you read this men, or anybody for that matter, saddle up, and hold on tight!One of the key themes in this is \\"Don't quit the critter.\\" Now, living in New York, I think I even get the simple meaning of such a honky-tonk phrase. Is it that simple? Yep, and it packs quite a punch. It isn't as graceful as say, fly fishing, but it separates the men from the boys, so to speak. This wasn't an easy read at times.

He loves the land and the work, but his personality is being stifled. Through a series of events, he returns to his childhood home and memories, forced to face his fears and inadequecies.Moore writes with depth and feeling, slowly dragging you into the story, slowly twisting your heart into a knot. When he finally lets go on the last page, he doesn't do so flippantly or tritely--like many Christian novelists--he does so with tough and tender appreciation for his reader, his protaganist, and for the God that Ezra Riley's been fighting throughout.This book will set in your thoughts with all the warmth and poignancy of the setting Montana sun."},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"Having been fascinated by John's earlier book, &quot;Take the Reins,&quot; I was somewhat prepared for &quot;The Breaking of Ezra Riley.&quot; However, no one is ever really prepared for life.

John ties his novel with his own past--his relationship with his parents and his struggle for individuation. His leaving home to find his own life and his struggle through the late 60'early 70's youth culture was all part of the bigger picture of his breaking.

Watch out, the breaking could also be for you."},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley has been my favorite novel for a number of years now. It has something that most \\"Christian\\" fiction lacks, even though I do enjoy a lot of Christian fiction. It is real, honest, and raw. I found myself relating with the main character and his struggles throughout the book. I think the message of this book speaks to men especially, most men who have grown up in the last century. You can't read this book and not sympathize with the main character and all he goes through to come face to face with his father and the truth about himself. If you have never known the love of a Father I highly recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"I have had the pleasure of corresponding with John L. Moore and purchasing other books from him. He is a very genuine man. Some of the out of print books available in limited numbers by the author. I highly recommend this fabulous book. While not a fast reader, I was able to complete the saga of Exra Riley in a matter of a few days. One does not wish to put the book down and I often would tell myself ,&quot;just one more chapter.&quot; This novel hit me in the right time and place and has me aching for wild spaces. It has been an encouragement as well, especially for all of us who feel that we don't measure up in some way."},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"I just got this book from my girlfreind and I wasn't that excited when i got it. A christian novel is a very strange thing for me.Besides that, I live in Miles City, I work at \\"The Fort\\", and by other peoples dubbing I am a cowboy, not that I really think so. The book was a great read. I flew through this book in about 12 hours and I thought it was a great book. He brought in the discriptions of the area and the thoughts of this community great. I also liked his use of spiritualilty without making it a fire and brimstone chrisian novel. I almost didn't know that John Moore was that kind of author until later. I think I would have passes on reading this if he woulden't have drawn me in with the opening of the story, talking about the straind relationship of a young man living with a hard headed father on a ranch, which i have experienced and I can say he is very accurate to the experience.GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"When handed this book I thought I'd never read it because of its length, subject matter, and title but ended up thoroughly enjoying it. John L Moore wrote this book using the most descriptive yet, strangely enough, concise language I have read in years. He writes this completely utilizing the English language for all it is worth. I couldn't wait to reach the end of this story and yet was disappointed when the book was over.The only true disappointment to this book was that it ended and I could not find another book by this wonderful author. Read &quot;The Breaking of Ezra Riley&quot; and enjoy the ride it takes you on."},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was my first introduction to the writing of John Moore. After reading the breaking of Ezra Riley, the next books in the series, Leaving the Land, and Limits of Mercy are great reading. These books contain Spiritual depth, adventure, and have no raunchy stuff thrown in.Jerry DeYoung"},{"Title":"The Breaking of Ezra Riley","review":"John writes from vast experiences of life coupled with uncanny insights into the human spirit and soul. Because his work is so connected to life, we are deeply drawn into the characters and the plot knowing fully well that we are all players on the stage of life. A master at fiction that is so real to the human experience we readily indentify with the struggles and hardship,defeat and victory of the characters; and in the end John masterfully leaves us with hope. A word of caution. You may lose some sleep if you ever start to read this work. It is nearly impossible to put down."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"At the core of this book is a great story about Harry Morgan. Despite his racism and misogyny, he is, much like Hemingway himself, ultimately a sympathetic character. We want him to succeed given the force of his will and the odds against him. Also, despite his tough talk, and sometimes equally tough deeds, Morgan wants to do well for his family and wants to help out the dispossessed.Unfortunately, Hemingway felt the need to write a novel rather than a short story, and the story suffers in the process. He experiments with shifting points of view and interior monologues -- almost like he wants to show the world he can beat Joyce and Faulkner at their own game. Worse still, he shifts the story away from Morgan to a collection of \\"haves\\" who are not sufficiently developed, believable, or sympathetic. Again, one gets the sense that Hemingway is experimenting with another writer's style (in this case Fitzgerald), but does not quite bring it off.The one passage I remember from reading the book over 30 years ago is the epiphany experienced by Morgan's wife when he sees Harry ride away -- capturing both the strength and the hopelessness of Harry's character. This passage is one of the best Hemingway ever wrote. It and the basic story of Morgan make the book worthwhile.It is ironic that this book received so much criticism. It is much better than the \\"Old Man and the Sea\\", for which Hemingway won awards. The theme of individual's struggle against forces much larger than himself is much better told in this book than in Hemingway's later work."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I re-read this book after some 40 years and found it more \\"topical\\" today than when I read it the first time. So many themes literally tumble out of today's headlines. There is the American-Cuban relationship, engendered by proximity, and of course economics, before America erected its economic version of the \\"Berlin Wall\\" against Cuba. There is the subject denoted by the title, the \\"haves\\" and \\"the have nots,\\" with the emphasis on the later. There is an incisive vignette on one of the \\"haves,\\" who had managed to steal from many of his fellow \\"haves,\\" a la Madoff, driving some to suicide. There is a sexual predator of a wife who \\"collects\\" writers. There are veterans who have fought in America's foreign wars, misused and mistreated by their own government. There is illegal immigration, and why it was more contained in the \`30's, due to the stiffer penalties. The central character is Harry Morgan, a hard-luck, but ethical fisherman, trying to scrap a living during the Depression, who is ripped off by an inept, but economically \\"successful\\" \\"have\\", which commenced Morgan's decent into crime and guns. Yet a topic which could fall out of today's websites as a \\"post-mortem,\\" literal and figurative, on another mass killing by an economically marginal figure - some, but not all, driven to despair by one of the \\"Sun King\\" \\"haves.\\" And then there is the wildly speculative, but an item for consideration concerning the organizational membership of the two Presidential candidates in the 2004 election: \\"the type of man who is tapped for Bones is rarely also tapped for bed; but with a lovely girl like Frances intention counts as much as performance.\\"Other reviewers have evaluated the novel as not up to Hemingway's other works, even making the point that supposedly he said, and meant so, himself. They also criticized the shifts in narration, the supposed \\"Faulknerian rambles,\\" the shallow portraits of the \\"haves,\\" and a supposed \\"cut and paste\\" nature of combining some short stories and vignettes. All of the above \\"worked\\" well for me. The novel is primarily about Harry Morgan, inarticulate as many are of his economic class, but admirably portrayed by Hemingway through his actions. The portrait of his wife, Marie, a woman who \\"stood by her man,\\" is succinct and successful; almost certainly the most insightful portrait of a woman in any in Hemingway's works. Often the rich are vapid and shallow, and so Hemingway's description is accurate. The woman in the bar scene, accompanied by her husband, deserves Morgan's contempt and reaction. And the novel is another view of a \\"Margaritaville,\\" or at least one version of same, Key West, Florida, where Hemingway is still fondly remembered.The novel has withstood the test of time, and can be read, or read again with greater appreciation today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This paperback is a very handsome edition of the work. It took me several goes to read this novel all the way through and I was frustrated and puzzled by it until I learned that the first two sections were originally published as short stories, and then I realized that the difficult third section, the largest of the three, might be another sequence of short stories, so that the book would then work as a sequence of short stories collectively making up a novel. I haven't tried reading it that way yet, but the problem with the book as it is presented is that the narrative keeps switching around in the third section and so does the character thread, and it feels difficult to hang on. However the writing and its evocation of the setting is superb and this is a book I shall keep. It flopped with the critics but it has a lot of great Hemingway in it."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I've got to agree with Papa on this one, this is definitely not Hemingway's best work. This novel is actually two short stories and one novella, with the main character Harry Morgan (a smuggler and fisherman going between Cuba and the Florida Keys) linking the three together. The short stories were written well before the rest of the text, then tied together to make a single novel. The first two \`sections' (short stories) are fine adventure-type tales about the shady characters of pre-WWII Cuba. The novella starts off as an adventure tale as well in the same vein, but evolves into an introspective story about the value of life, the things the people hold valuable, and what it means to lose them. The latter half of the novella has very little to do with the first half or the other two short sections. I got the impression that EH changed his mind about what he wanted to do with this novel halfway through writing it, but instead of editing the first half for consistency, he just gave up. This makes the overall tale disjointed and puzzling. There are definitely some glimmers of Hemingway at his best in this novel (e.g. the chapter in which Morgan faces the bank robbers on his boat, or the last chapter about what people hold valuable and loss), but EH would have been better served to write to separate, complete tales about each of the threads. I would agree with one of the other reviewer's comments that if this is EH's worst, it is still better than most author's best, but I think that some of the glowing reviews are grossly overstated. This is a flawed work by a great writer in my view, not on the same planet as \`For Whom the Bell Tolls' and other EH greats. This is also one of the few cases in which the movie is better than the book."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I am someone who came late to appreciating the literary genius of Hemingway, perhaps because like many in my generation I viewed his literary aura as overly slanted towards man's macho nature.The story revolves around the doings of a rather shady ex-cop engaged in smuggling in and around Cuba and the southern Keys. Beneath his corrupt veneer, however, rests a loving family man seeking to support an adoring wife and three young daughters. Unfortunately for our protagonist, a band of Cuban Coast Guard officials catch up with him during one of his intrigues, resulting in him being shot and eventually having one of his arms amputated. In the face of bankruptcy, will he find economic salvation in that one last great heist?This review is but a speck of what could be said in interpreting this fine piece of art. Above all else, upon reading \\"To Have and Have Not\\" I found someone, in Hemingway, who could instill an incredible sense of drama with a ringing clarity of purpose in his tersely woven prose."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"The first half of this book was easy for me to follow, but when other characters started getting introduced I started getting confused.I want to read the book again to get a better grasp on themes. I saw some clear character comparisons between marriages and individuals, jobs, races, and end results. I'd like to read it again and document things as I notice them.

This books does an excellent job of pulling you into the very distinct lifestyles of the poverty-stricken sailors, their hungry families, and the radical Cubans being smuggled, fighting for a new way of life. An absolute masterpiece that will turn your thoughts to Highway 1, heading for Mallory Square."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This book is incredibly written. I have read all of Hemingways work and have found this book to be the most exicing. It may be a little rough but I think that is how he wanted it. Parts of this book refer to Hemingway's own thoughts own sucide and after reading you will have a lot better grasp of why he did kill himself. You can not call yourself a true Hemingway fan unless you have read this book!"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"&quot;To Have &amp; Have Not&quot; is a story that chronicles how different the daily lives of the very rich &amp; the very poor can be, yet how these lives can end in the same tragic way. Hemingway proves that he is the King of writing his character's own thoughts, especially by using rythm. I believe you can actually tell when Hemingway was drunk when writing this. Read this one next."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I love Ernest Hemingway and am strangely finding myself on a path to reading everything the man ever wrote. I picked this book not only because of the author but also because of its connection to the movie of the same title. Well, a warning to those who might do the same: there is very little outside of the title and the first section that compares between the book and movie!In this novel, Hemingway seems a bit lost, a bit muddled. It seemed to me that what he had was more of a short story that he somehow needed to flesh out into a novel. And it doesn't quite work. Oh, there are scenes in the book that are very well written, yes. The opening scene alone is great! And other action scenes throughout the novel are also very well put together. Hemingway also does quite well with characters in this one. Harry Morgan - our protagonist - is easily envisioned (and so easily encapsulated as Bogie!). The diaglog is well done and very typical Hemingway. However, there is so much extra in this novel, that I wasn't quite sure exactly what was going on or even where the story was taking place. And the entire of chapter 24 - all 20 pages - is completely unnecessary!I found the later half of this book easier to read than the first half (though, I wish I had had the sense to skip chapter 24!). There were more action scenes and it just seemed to flow. While this certainly isn't as well written as some of Hemingway's other novels, it is certainly better than others. Well, at least to a fan of Papa!I would not recommend this book if one has never read Hemingway before. He has much finer works. But if one is a fan who feels they need to read everything Hemingway has written, you probably won't find this a total waste of time."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"The book is an action-packed thriller that has bootlegging, aiding illegal immigrants, and assisting foreign revolutionaries in a bank robbery. Harry Morgan, a middle age owner and a captain of a boat, living in peace time Florida, is faster moving than either Robert Jordan of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" or Frederick Henry of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", both young military commanders in a war zone. Being less of a positive hero, Harry can be more colorful. The supporting cast is no less vibrant, and even the patchwork of new characters introduced at the end of the novel feels of a piece, if a bit schematic.The novel is a quick read. The combination of simple language sporting an occasional twist, rapidly unfolding plot and memorable characters makes it an easily enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is the story of Harry Morgan, a fisherman forced to turn to smuggling when his business goes bad. It is, as all of Hemingway's work, beautifully written in stark prose, but the story itself rambles a bit and follows some tangents as it winds toward its conclusion.The story reads somewhat as a story of a man's struggle to survive amid dire circumstances, but also as a contrast between the problems of the rich and the problems of the poor. Hemingway devotes several pages to brief glimpses of the lives of several wealthy tourists and their \\"problems,\\" most likely as a means of pointing out their empty, materialistic existences, and comparing that to the poor on the island who scrape to provide themselves with the basic needs of life.Morgan is a typical Hemingway character; a fairly average individual forced into difficult and ultimately dooming circumstances. The story itself seems somewhat distracted and unfocused, but the writing is classic Hemingway; stark and ultimately tragic as events unfold to determine the course of people's lives."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"An excellent book with some of the most complex and interesting character deveopments I have ever read. If you like Hemingway you will love this book. Even if you normally don't care for Hemingway, you will more than likely appreciate this work. I think that it is one of his best. A wonderful must read for all."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"The first thing I thought upon finishing this novel was, wow, I'm glad that's over. What a gritty and dismal story! Poor Harry Morgan and his bad choices. He gets gypped by a rich wannabe fisherman, and is suddenly in need of some cash. What does he do? He gets himself an illegal job, takes advantage of the situation, shocks the heck out of me, and it's all down hill from there. The N word was used quite a bit here, too, which was another shocking point. I suppose that has something to do with the era this book was written in, but shocked me nonetheless. I'm thinking maybe Mr. Hemingway was a crude and unsavory man. Could just be his writing, I don't know. I don't remember watching the movie based on this book, but I believe that it is quite different. So, if you like gritty, hardcore, manly books, you may like this one. It is interesting enough until the last few chapters, which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2. The description mentions something about a love affair. Not sure where that was supposed to have taken place. I just remember lots of violence and trash talking."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I love Hemingway. I just like the way he writes. Some people say that he is sexist. I never seen it. All in all though, this was a good book."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"What a sad story. I enjoyed the book very much but felt so horribly for the main character Harry Morgan. In Harry Morgan we have a seemingly noble man. Who starts the book as a hard working Fishing Charter Captain. Through a series of unfortunate events Harry loses his work as a fishing boat captain. And goes headlong into the life of a smuggler.Harry seemingly detests this life in the beginning of the narrative, but is somewhat forced into doing it.It is amazing to see Harry, a man bound by duty to a life he doesn't want to lead, go down the dark dark path of destruction. The most amazing factor is how Harry appears to lose all his sense of ethics in a heartbeat.Hemingway discusses one of his favorite themes, duty of man. Harry has the duty of providing for his wife and daughters and will do whatever it takes to provide for them.Hemingways narrative reads like a series of flashbacks. Each time we see Harry he is in a new place in his decent to the abyss. He gets lower and lower each time. It all reads with a strong sense of predestination. It almost seems Harry is destined to walk this path... even though he wouldn't have chosen it initially. He didn't want to go in this direction. But he finds himself there and will do what he needs to do.Harry seems so full of integrity at the beginning then begins to do all he can to make this lifestyle work no matter the end result. He seems driven to provide no matter what he has to do. It is almost a Machiavellian story. You have to feel for Harry and his wife. But Harry makes his choices and lives with them.Read this book. It seems to be one of the darker Hemingway novels but it deifinitely satisfies! A great stroy and a sad story."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Its a story of a fisherman sort of like Old Man and the Sea but this novel has a different twist to it, the main character broke and has to find a way to make a deal with another boatsman to survive"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This book reminded me of a horrid ride that you couldn't get off. At first it was fun, then gradually, you just want to puke. It's the story of a weak protagonist who spends the book carrying out a pathetic vendetta against authority in general. I was extremely disappointed with this novel since I usually love Hemingway's work. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to read about the same recurring incident over and over."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is an interesting but seriously flawed novel written by Hemingway well after he had achieved critical success for his earlier novels, A Farewell to Arms and The Sun Also Rises. It is a fascinating novel in another way though, in that it shows the beginning of a dramatic change in the author's style, which would ultimately manifest itself completely in the magnificent For Whom the Bell Tolls, which came several years later.The first part of this novel is about Harry Morgan, a Florida Keys resident, scraping by as first a charter boat owner, then a smuggler, and then eventually much worse. For some odd reason, Hemingway chose to write this with differing viewpoints. Part of his story is written in the first person by Harry, part of it is written in the first person by an acquaintance, and part of it is written in the third person. Why he did this, I do not know. It doesn't make any sense thematically or for any other reason.About half way through the book switches gears, and suddenly Harry's story is interspersed with the stories of several wealthy people who come to the Keys to vacation in their expensive yachts. These stories are interesting and written with Hemingway's typically terrific ear for dialogue. Their problems are alcoholism, infidelity, and aging, and it dawns on us that this is the theme: the have-nots of Harry's world have more basic problems, such as getting enough food into the bellies of their children.But even this doesn't work so well. Despite the fact that Harry lives in what can be a rather cruel world, he himself seems a little more vicious than is absolutely required, and it is difficult to sympathize with him. Here is one of his final howls, spoken in delirium: \\"One man alone ain't got . . . no matter how a man alone ain't got no bloody &amp;%#@&amp;%&amp; chance.\\" Yes, the poor depression-era man crushed by overwhelming and indifferent forces he can't understand. This is a theme which had been done both before and during Have Not, has been done since, will continue to be done, and is, frankly, a little tiresome.To me the most fascinating aspect of the novel is that we see a change beginning to emerge in Hemingway's style. Along with the brilliant descriptive language and dialogue, we begin to see in Have Not an increase in interior monologues, which are fascinating, dramatic, and add greatly to both his characters' and the novel's depth. It is a trend which would continue."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"According to my thoughts and feelings, I truely believe that this book was really interesting, but yet sort of confusing. I had rated this book 3 stars because that the story was boring and confusing, although I still like the book. The book was about a man Harry Morgan, who at the beginning did not want to deal with the deal that the other yachtsmen had done with him. Harry was a boatman, and if he had done the deal, he would get a thousand dollars+, but he didn't want to risk it all. It was for his family."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is definitely not one of Hemingway's better novels.

It's dull, nothing happens. There's no plot, no character. Watch the Bogart film--it's got nothing to do with the book, that's why the movie is so good"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was written during the Great Depression when there was also much revolutionary activity in Cuba.The book is not very similar to the Bogart movie with the same title. The protagonist, however, is named Harry Morgan and as in the film Harry is a fishing boat captain. His wife is named Marie which is the same name as that of the Lauren Bacall character in the movie. The plot of the book is very different and the mood throughout is dark and sombre - except for a few humorous interludes while Harry is drinking in a bar with wealthy tourists.Hemingway begins the story using the first person before switching to the third person after five chapters. The effect of this technique causes some confusion but it does add an extra dimension to both Harry and the plot.As a protagonist Harry is courageous but not very likeable. He at times appears to be just a desparate man who does not mind killing in order to make a decent living for his family.TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT never rises to the level of Hemingway's more successful novels but it is still worth reading as an example of the author's writing during his early years in Cuba."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"If you want your Caribbean thriller, look no further than right here. Hemingway's descriptions of life in the Florida Keys and along the Gulf Stream will raise the sweat on your brow. If written today, this novel would be broadsided with charges of political incorrectness; precisely one of the reasons that it is so refreshing to read. The dialogue is vital and lively, the master's economy of style shines here as in most of his other works. And, it is the story of a man and woman's life in a difficult time in these United States, the Depression. The rich are rich and the poor, well, they're real poor. The characters are richly drawn, and pull the reader into the chain of events of the story. The first chapter sets the pace of the novel and the reader is gripped by the throat and pulled along into Cuba long before Fidel and Key West at a time when a gay parade on Duval Street would have resulted in bloodshed. Pour a cold beer, sit back in your Morris chair, and get set to cross the Straits of Florida."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is a character study of a failure - Harry Morgan. He is a poor man in Key West and Cuba who cannot figure out how to make a living, so he turns to murder, thievery and smuggling. While most see Morgan as an essentially good man forced into evil, from the first segment he makes stupid decisions, and never shows much goodness. Bigoted and mean, he is the least sympathetic character in the collected works. But that's not why the book is bad - It is disjointed - with several points of view, all caring about different things. The book only moves when Morgan is having adventures. The rest is empty. From a big Hemingway fan, I voice disappointment."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I read this book the first time on my first trip to Rome, Italy in 1977.

Racist labelings apart, the prose is quite gripping up to that point. Then the protagonist Cap'n Harry Morgan gets forgotten and some drunk and not very interesting characters squabble in the bar and in the bedroom, who really have very little to do with the plot, except to justify the title (these are the Have's). Harry Morgan is basically a good, hard-livin' guy who likes to drink and fish (like Hemingway), but it's as though the author ran out of steam with him. A deeper plot, with less time gaps and jumping about between characters might have made this a much better novel, but you'll find trademark H. understatement and great descriptions of the sea, especially of a marlin jumping out of the water."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Book was not is as good of shape as advertized.

I think you have to experience a little more of life to appreciate Ernest Hemingway.This is the story of Harry Morgan, a fishing boat captain who has to work hard and really struggle to support his wife, Marie and their two daughters. The story begins with Harry being hired by a rich man on vacation. The man wants to catch some big fish. When the large fish begin to bite, the man ignores Harry's instructions and loses a lot of expensive fishing equipment. The man owes Harry quite a bit of money for the days of boat use and the lost equipment.

Those who have reviewed it poorly have missed the point."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Typical of 1930's Hemingway, To Have and Have Not is a frustrating novel, equal parts exhilaration and disappointment. The main story involves the tragic life of Harry Morgan who shuttles back and forth between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba, taking odd-jobs so that he can support his family. No job is too dirty or too dangerous for Harry, and he quickly gets caught up in smuggling, kidnapping, and anything else that will make him decent money. Harry's sections of the novel are violent and grim, full of double-crosses and bloody shoot-outs. It may be a little bit shallow for Hemingway's talent, but all the action and adventure make for a fascinating read. Rounding out the story of Harry's exploits is the beautifully drawn character of Marie Morgan, his devoted wife. Nowhere else in Hemingway's fiction will you find a female character so lovingly rendered.Unfortunately, this rousing tale gets derailed about halfway through the novel by an abstract social commentary artlessly forced into the text. Describing the lives of a number of well-off residents and visitors of Key West, Hemingway spends several interminable chapters contrasting the ennui and shenanigans of the wealthy yacht-owners and writers with the down-to-earth goodness of characters like Harry Morgan. Hemingway pokes fun at the sexual intrigues and pointless drama of the wealthy, while glorifying the ernestness and devotion of the Morgans and their peers. It is a simple and banal observation, completely overblown and out of place, and it almost ruins the entire novel.But the book concludes with Marie's painful inner monologue, written in Faulknerian stream-of-consciousness, and a tender description of the boats and the water around the Keys, causing the reader to forget all that drivel that has passed before and reflect on the beauty and danger of the world that Hemingway has created.To Have and Have Not would have been stunning as a novella about Harry Morgan with maybe a few minor asides about the idiocy of the wealthy (which Hemingway shows perfectly in an early incident where Harry tries to teach a clueless vacationer how to fish). Or it might even have worked as a long novel (around the size of For Whom the Bell Tolls), exploring the climates of Key West and Havana in vast detail. But as it stands, the novel Hemingway wrote is too disjointed and confused to qualify as a classic (though still worth reading for fans of the author)."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Although I think it is one of his worst books (along with \\"Across the River and into the Trees\\"), it is still a good book. But I think you have to be comfortable with Hemingway's style before you can appreciate it properly. I would recommend \\"The Sun also Rises\\" or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" if you haven't read his stuff before. \\"To Have and Have Not\\" seems a bit unpolished at times but I would recommend it to any Hemingway fan."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is a book that you can dislike or even hate at one period of your life, love in another. It is a book that may be called either inherently flawed or grandly experimental. Hemingway himself came to dislike it, and one wonders if he ever considered it very worthy. But decades after it was published, it keeps oddly getting back on its feet like its spooky anti-hero Harry Morgan, finding a public, and claiming a life and hard-fought little space of its own.These are really 3 long stories, rather violently jammed together, without even unity of narrative voice. Its manner of telling is thus as jarring as its distrurbing story which puts an amoral killer at the center, not without admirable brute animal characteristics. Gulf coast rum-runner Harry is essentially a vehicle for Hemingway to lay the violent side of life in the great depression era bare to the bone. Its dreamy boozed out delirium at times works like a drug, quite convincingly recreating its 1930s dockside setting and people in all their awful glory. If erratic in it its conception as a book, the devil is in the details. Hemingway was still relatively young and strong and packed a lot of wallup. The book actually reminds one a lot of Soviet realism, but without the preposterous commie propaganda about the glory of the people tagged on. Here, no excuses are either given or asked for.In short sum, it's a slice of life, and its artistic hat trick is an apparent and almost intentional artlessness. For Hemingway afficionados it is indispensible; others may bypass it, though in doing so they will unfortunately miss a bitter piece of Americana not really adequately available elsewhere. Next to Harry Morgan's world, the depravity witnessed by Huck Finn going down the big river looks like a choir boy's tale."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Widely accepted as Hemingway's worst novel (stated by Hemingway himself), this novel still makes other authors' best works pale in comparison. Harry Morgan is one of the most intriguing characters Hemingway has come up with.I disagree quite a bit with a previous reviewer who characterizes Harry as a cold, abrasive, and uncaring person even for his family. I think what Hemingway is successfully conveying with Harry's character is the hardships of the times. Harry is an ex-cop, a position that generally holds some moral and ethical standing, turned fisherman turned rum/illegal alien/bandit runner. Harry is driven by his paternal and machismo inclination to provide for his family. He murders for his beloved Marie and his three daughters - not because he is particularly murderous or is greedy with an acute thirst for money. The final chapter about Marie encapsulates the beauty of the Morgans' life. They had everything, regardless of material wealth because Harry always provided for his family. Juxtapose this life with the lives described in 2 or 3 chapters before the end of the extremely wealthy people who own the yachts and we can see exactly what the title of this book means. Some people have, and some people have not. The rich people whose lives are closely examined in this novel are miserable. And though Harry loses an arm and eventually more than that he still is the one who Has in the theme \\"To Have and Have Not.\\"This novel, though somewhat disjointed and difficult to organize in your mind, is a beautiful criticism of what many people think is the key to happiness: abundance of wealth. Thinking back, the disjointedness is what makes this novel so beautiful and sensical. The chapter examining all the different characters in their yachts is one of the most intelligent and wonderful criticisms of the upper class I have ever read, anywhere. You will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I read this because I liked the Bogart movie. The movie used the very beginning of the book then goes on to follow a completely different story line. The book is darker and more violent than the &quot;feel-good&quot; themed movie. The novel centers around Harry Morgan, a charter boat captain who does some bad things to make ends meet in 1930's Cuba and Key West. It appears that the book may have started out as a short story that was fleshed out into a novel-length work. The copyright page indicates publication in a magazine in 1934, three years before the book's publication date. This may explain the confusing change in narrators that other reviewers have mentioned. It also seems to me that the have versus have-not theme has been tacked on to contrast the lives of rich holiday-makers in Key West to the lives of struggling Key West natives. The parts dealing with the wealthy aren't particulary interesting or believable. I suspect they were added to give a simple action story more social consciousness. This fault is more than made up for by the scenes with Harry Morgan. He is a tough man of action who wont stop at killing if necessary. It makes for an exciting read; I read it through in one night. I must diasagree with those critics that feel this novel is one of Hemingway's worst."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Depending on whether you count The Torrents of Spring or The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway published five, six, or seven novels. I suppose one of them had to be the worst. To Have and Have Not was Hemingway's choice. Given the excellence of all his novels, that corresponds approximately to noting that Beethoven's second Rasumovsky quartet is the worst of the three in the set.This is a truly great novel, spare and economical, packing the most thought, action, and meaning into the fewest words and revealing the inner lives of Harry Morgan and other residents of Key West, from the dregs of society to its affluent froth. I've read it twice, and the second reading has impressed me even more than the first."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I was inspired to read my first Hemingway novel by my upcoming trip to Key West, FL. Since the Hemingway House is on the &quot;must-see&quot; list for Key West tourists, I thought I should familiarize myself with the work of this renowned author. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; particularly caught my eye when I saw that it is the story of Harry Morgan, a man who is forced by economic circumstances and family obligations into smuggling contraband between Key West and Cuba. I wasn't disappointed!This is an amazing story about a many who does what is necessary for the well-being of his family. SURVIVAL is a main theme throughout this novel - Harry Morgan does what is necessary for his family's survival; Marie Morgan also learns to survive when she loses her lover and provider. There is also a vivid contrast made between the &quot;Haves&quot; and &quot;Have Nots&quot; when Hemingway discusses how the wealthy yachtsmen are unable to overcome their petty financial troubles while the struggling and often impoverished Conchs of Key West seem to endure against all odds.Reading this story has whet my appetite for more Hemingway and I am looking forward to spending time with some of his six-toed cats in Key West :-)!"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is the first book I have read where I think my age impacts my ability to appreciate it's depth. I read it when I was 23 and immediately could not relate to the main character at all, on any level. Being a huge fan of Hemingway's writing otherwise, this will be a book I look forward to coming back to in twenty years or so. I'm glad for that, because somedays I worry that I'll read all his books too fast and be left with nothing of his to read for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Well, if you are expecting a parallel to the Bogart movie, you are looking in the wrong place. This book is an examination of the human character, and how the human spirit can become warped in extreme circumstances. At once a commentary and a warning, I found the harshness of the story a contrast to blind optimism. Worth the read."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Considered by most literary critics to be one of his weaker novels, including 'To Have and Have Not' director Howard Hawkes who once bet Hemingway that he could make a good film from what he considered one of Hemingways worst books which he did starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While the film adaptation of Hemingways' novel was a critical and box office success, it was anything but true to the actual novel and many liberties were taken in creating the final product; a rah-rah patriotic WWII flick starring the greatest actor in Hollywood. So, make sure that you differentiate between Hemingway and Hollywood when it comes to 'To Have and Have Not' at least in this case(His other novels were better adapted to film, most notably 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' and 'A Farewell To Arms.). The novel my not be Hemingways greatest work, but it is still a very entertaining story nevertheless. Written during his years in Key West, this like all of Hemingway's work draws on his own real life experiences which was transformed into the story of Harry Morgan a man who after falling on hard times is forced to be a rumrunner between Cuba and the Keys. In the movie Harry Morgan hunts Nazi U-boats, while not in the book Hemingway himself actually did do this aboard his boat Pilar while living in Cuba during WWII. A great and entertaining short novel that is classic Hemingway all the way."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I've always been a fan of Hemingway's The Sun also Rises and a Farewell to Arms. I wanted to read another of his books, and since I loved the Bogart and Bacall movie I purchased this despite the typical literary review that calls To Have and Have Not his worst novel. This book is great!! It's gritty, realistic, and the characters are consistent in their characterizations and actions throughout. The bar dialogue, Harry's actions as he delves into crime, they're all dead on. The plot-line really comes together with the juxtaposition of the rich and the poor (I dare you to not be disgusted by the &quot;vital&quot; concerns of the wealthy in the last few chapters). Hemingway's depiction of Harry's suffering wife is perhaps the *ONLY* completely believable female representation I have *EVER* read. This book is macho, poignantly sad, exciting, and full of heart wrenching loneliness throughout."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To Have And Have Not is too fragmentary to be Hemingway's best novel. It's divided into three episodes, which I think were written at completely different times, so Hemingway's objectives might have changed halfway through. The first episode was meant to stand on its own merits as a short story, but Hemingway liked it so much he came back to it later and added two more. That said, it's certainly a fine novel - gripping, moving and very well-written at every step of the way. It revolves around Harry Morgan, an honest man turned into a smuggler by necessity. In the context of the whole novel, the first episode serves mainly to establish his person and show what sort of man he is - his reluctance to get into illegal activities, his strength, his survival instinct and the cruelty that it sometimes results in, and his human qualities. This reads like a self-contained short story with no real point other than an action-filled scenario. The second and shortest episode is the weakest part of the novel - it's a cross-section of a day in Morgan's life after he already takes up smuggling. It certainly shows the risks he has to take, but doesn't serve to do much other than explain a certain point in the third episode.The third episode, where the real meat of the story is, is the best. It shows the further developments and the conclusion of Morgan's criminal career. It is also where the book's title comes in - here we see the contrast between those who have and those who have not. This comparison makes it easier to understand by contrast just how inevitably Morgan was driven to the life he now leads. Though Hemingway could have treated this issue by simply depicting the rich people as bad and Harry as good, he instead develops the story with tremendous emotional complexity - in a chapter dedicated to the former, Hemingway gets inside the heads of many well-off Americans and shows you their thoughts and fears. You might end up sympathizing with them more than with Harry, even though their glaring weaknesses are relentlessly brought to light. They are shown to be just as much victims of circumstances as Harry Morgan - while this does not exonerate them of their foibles, just like it doesn't exonerate him of his crimes, it makes all of them easier to understand. Nor does Hemingway paint the Marxist rebels that Morgan agrees to transport to Cuba in black and white - some are ruthless mercenaries, but some genuinely seek to make the world better, and others are just there by chance. The tragedy of the book is that all these people, who with a few exceptions really weren't bad sorts, were driven by much more powerful forces against one another, and all ended badly. Here we have Harry Morgan, a strong and intelligent man who really didn't want anything other than to have enough to subsist for him and his family, and he ends up hopelessly alone up against both the law and the lawless. His last monologue, where he ruefully summarizes his life, is one of Hemingway's finest moments.Here I must add, as an afternote, that this book conclusively proves that those people who like to claim that Hemingway's treatment of women is somehow \\"sexist\\" or \\"disrespectful,\\" or that his female characters are \\"stereotypical\\" or \\"weak,\\" have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Harry Morgan's wife doesn't have a large role in the book, but there is one crucial scene that revolves solely around her. In it, she shows titanical inner strength; she is possibly the strongest character in the novel, stronger than Harry. Yes, her role in life is \\"stereotypical,\\" but that is due to the _realism_ of the story - in those days, in those parts of the world, that was the way things were, and that's that. It is undeniable that Hemingway treats her with great respect, admiration and fairness. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Rough. Hard. Dirty. Physical. Tough. And also lyrical, simple, emotional, indelible. All characteristics of Hemingway's writing, all present in this book. A simple story of Harry Morgan, sometime fisherman forced into smuggling and illegal immigration just to feed his family, a man who spirals down the slippery road of 'the end justifying the means' till there is nothing left but survive at any cost.The story is told as three separate time-segments in Harry's life, which forces a certain disjointedness to the tale. But it also allows Hemingway to illuminate Harry's story with different segments of the Cuban and Key West societies at different times with changing social conditions. There are many character vignettes, people captured sometimes in only a few paragraphs, people who are desperate, silly, egotistical, idealistic, cynical, worn-out, greedy, dissolute, resigned, driven, and just coping. Albert, a man doing relief work for less than subsistence wages, is one of the clearest and most poignant images, hiring on as mate to Henry even though he knows the voyage is supremely dangerous. Within this short portrait of this man, we see not only the extremes that desperation will drive a man to, but also Hemingway's commentary on social/political organizations and economic structures that give rise to such desperation. This was quite typical of Hemingway, as he never beat his reader's over the head with his political philosophy, but showed the underpinnings of his reasoning through the circumstances of his characters.Throughout this work, there is the sense that there is more here than what the words on the page delineate, a theme of people from all walks of life and all economic circumstances who are caught in the implacability of fate. All of these people have their own dreams, their own methods of dealing with the vagaries of life, and each is limned by the ultimate depression of life limited to only a short span.Morgan's wife, though relegated to only a small part on these pages, shines through as one of the most engaging and durable people here, supportive of her husband's dreams, willing to forgo anything more than minimal material wealth, able to put aside her husband's foibles, and having the inner strength to continue when all her world collapses around her. The contrast between her and many of the other characters here is striking, a fine illustration of what really comprises the 'haves' and the 'have nots'.This book is not as powerful as For Whom the Bell Tolls, mainly due to its fragmented story structure and lack of any clear objective for its main characters, but is still a fine book with many nuances hiding within its simple story. This is not a book for those who like happy, uplifting stories, but it does much to illuminate both the best and the worst of humanity's fight with the curse of living and the insurmountable wall of dying.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Masterworks like For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Sun Also Rises overshadow To Have And Have Not, but you should not overlook it. The novel is mainly about Harry Morgan, a depression-era fishing boat captain who has run out of luck. The book also has several of the trademark Hemingway stories within the story. Rather than a novel, I like to think of this as a bunch of short stories held together by one greater theme. When your reading, you feel as though Hemingway has let you in on a secret, and he is showing you his private world of Key West and Havana in the 1930's. I also believe that this book is the link between his early success from The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms to his later triumphs of For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Old Man And The Sea. Because of its high action and the constant sense of adventure, I would recommend this quick read to the first time Hemingway reader. This book is the perfect primer for For Whom The Bell Tolls. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of Hemingways other great works. Had another author written this, it would be a better known book for sure. Excellant book and a must read!"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Hemingway once said &quot;A man can be destroyed, but not defeated... a man can be defeated, but not destroyed&quot;To Have and Have not is primarily a story about the destruction of a man... one of the 'have nots' (the conchs) of Key West. The central character, Harry Morgan, constantly struggles throughout the book defying the law, even killing those who stand in his way just trying to make a living. Hemingway peels back the skin of this entire society and shows the reader what lies beneath. This is the classic Hemingway tale of the central character encountering malevolent circumstances and fighting them one by one to the bitter end. I love this book! I wish the movie version had actually been about this book, instead of what it turned out to be. A &quot;Howard Hawks&quot; film with an &quot;Ernest Hemingway&quot; title.Maybe the critics don't consider this to be his finest novel... but I've read most of his work now and I think its the best one in the bunch."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I understand this book was written as a contractual necessity, and it feels cobbled together by Hemingway. The first two portions seem straightforward, and qualify as good short stories about Harry Morgan, a down-at-heels boat-owner in the Florida Keys. The third seems destined to follow along a similar path, and then Hemingway throws in everything but the kitchen sink (like the cliche? It belongs in this section of the book) as Harry becomes a minor character in a hackneyed social-realist critique of just about EVERYHTING: communism, capitalism, alcoholism, any ism you can think of. New characters are introduced and forgotten every few pages. Hemingway cleaned out his junk drawer and stuck it here.So: completists please read. Otherwise, stick with Hemingway's short stories. Or better yet, read some Hammett."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is an excellent Hemingway! Action packed from the opening, it is a real adventure story, filled with fight, fury and fishing.Harry Morgan is led into a desperate situation by a customer who doesn't pay up after a long fishing expidition in Harrys boat. This results in Harrys involvement in the smuggling trade between Cuba and the Florida Keys. He transforms into a uncaring, brusque and to-the-point man who only wants to reap the monetary benefits to support his wife and daughters.As the story unfolds, we witness Harrys involvment in various smuggles that lead to him losing an arm and to his eventual demise. Along the way we are introduced to a series of characters; some involved with Harry and some not, delving briefly into their personal stories, angsts and relashionships.The way the book was written was reflective of the times, where lower class races were called derogatory names and performed menial, servantry tasks. Hemingways usual use of descriptively simple language paints glorious pictures of the events that transpire. A great chapter is the one involving the vets getting drunk and fighting in the local bar. It depicts a manic scene of uncertainty for any fellow in the bar willing to pick a fight. Hemingways brilliance comes through further as he takes an aside from the main story (the main character returning home) to focus on the lives and situations of the people aboard the fancy yachts moored to the local pier. It shows the great divide between those the story has told about and those unknown floating in their impressive vessels.&quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is a story about surviving love and loss; about being a man and about fishing. I thought it was great and had moments of satire and grisly noir to go along with the adventurous plight of Harry Morgan. This book would be excellent for those new to Hemingway and a treat for those more familiar with his style and brilliance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"After publishing back-to-back two of the most celebrated American novels ever, Ernest Hemingway waited eight years before his next. For that alone, \\"To Have And Have Not\\" could not help but be a disappointment, a judgment that lingers today. Is it merited?Ex-cop turned charter-fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan is having a run of bad luck. Thanks to the ineptitude of his latest customer, Morgan loses his expensive fishing tackle off the coast of Cuba. The customer then skips without paying for his two-week charter. Down to forty cents, Morgan must scramble to provide for his wife and three daughters in Key West, even if it means breaking the law a little. Or a lot. Morgan's bad luck is just beginning.Published in 1937, \\"To Have And Have Not\\" starts out reading like an Elmore Leonard novel before its time, in the conversational voice of the opening narrative and the long sections of crisp dialogue which follow. Other than the narrative's casual racism, there's nothing wrong with the first part of the book. Hemingway gets to a lot of action quickly, including a gun battle four pages in and a couple of savage marlin fights which show off his economical writing style to good effect.If there's a problem with the first half of the book, actually two Hemingway short stories he stuck together and added a novella to form this novel, it's with the character of Morgan, an unsympathetic guy who carries a lot of issues but no backstory to help us understand him. He's simply dislikable and dangerous, becoming more so as the story progresses.\\"You don't care what happens to a man,\\" Morgan is told at one point by a gun-shot companion. \\"You ain't hardly human.\\"This might have worked if Hemingway kept the story on its pulp-fiction track. Instead, he goes for creative dissonance, widening the lens of his story to encompass multiple story arcs and contrasting Morgan's tale with unrelated ones featuring other Key West characters, jaded rich folk and poor World War I vets struggling to extract some pleasure and value from their variously blasted lives.Hemingway seems to be making a contemporary point about the income gap, hence the title, but never ties it into Morgan's individual story beyond that he needs money and is struggling to earn it. Morgan is an offstage non-presence in the novel's two longest chapters, featuring a long parade of here-and-gone characters. Hemingway's lingering descriptions of each, along with some uncharacteristically long run-on sentences, suggest a misguided attempt at channeling William Faulkner rather than working in his own singular style.Yet there are good things to say about \\"To Have And Have Not\\", like Hemingway's finding inspiration from the ocean, describing the smell of sea grape and the sight of passing ships hauling cargo across the horizon: \\"Brother, don't let anybody tell you there isn't plenty of water between Havana and Key West.\\" It's a locale Hemingway returned to in two later novels, \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" and \\"Islands In The Stream\\", and you get a feeling for why he liked it so.Also good reading is some of the barroom dialogue, though Hemingway like many alcoholics doesn't know when to quit and keeps it coming for too long, until you feel like you are going to have the speaker's hangover the next morning.Hemingway was too great a writer to write a worthless book. \\"To Have And Have Not\\" is not a must-have by any means, but it has its moments."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This book belongs up there with Hemingway's better known books, The Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. Papa unapologetically presents characters who do bad things. Some people have cited the racial slurs and the crimes the characters commit as problematic, but Hemingway displays these things without condoning them. He isn't writing what is good and bad. He is writing what happens. These things happen. People hate. people kill. People become desperate. Hemingway is at heart a reporter and he has crafted a tremendous story and a great book."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"SummaryHarry Morgan is a policeman-turned-fisherman down on his luck like so many others in the Depression-struck Florida Keys. To make ends meet, Harry begins engaging in increasingly dangerous illegal activities in the waters between the Keys and Cuba.The book opens on Harry and several Cuban revolutionaries who want to pay Harry an exorbitant fee to transport them to the United States. Harry refuses, preferring to use his boat for legal activities, and as the revolutionaries leave, they are gunned down in the street.However, after being tricked by a customer who charters the boat for three weeks and then vanishes without settling his account, Harry agrees to smuggle Chinese immigrants from Cuba to the mainland. Next, Harry begins running alcohol between the two countries, and a confrontation with Cuban customs lost Harry his arm and his boat. Undeterred, he signs to the next scheme he runs across: stealing a boat and ferrying Cubans involved in a bank robbery back to their homeland.As he descends ever-deeper into desperation, Harry meets old friends and new faces. He has little patience for those who have not remained as resilient to the times as himself, and he has no patience for outsiders. Tensions mount between this hardscrabble jack-of-all-trades and several tourists who frequent his local bars.One pair of tourists take special prominence in the book: Arthur, an unexceptional writer, and his beautiful, unhappy wife. When Arthur comes home one day after sleeping with yet another woman, his wife decides to leave him for another man, an alcoholic who has been seen sloshing around the bars as well.Meanwhile, you are given a peek into the intimate details of Harry's relationship with his wife, Marie. The quiet desperation with which they cling to each other is meant as a justification for Harry's illegal maritime activity. Unfortunately, Harry does not return home after his trip with the Cuban bank-robbers, and Marie becomes yet another Depression-era woman left wringing her apron in desperation and rage.AnalysisI'll be the first to admit that I have a bit of a Hemingway obsession. One of my literary goals is to read all of his books, and I'm not too far from the finish line. However, To Have and Have Not is my least favorite Hemingway book so far. Though Hemingway attempts to dissect grand social issues, such as troubled economic times and the relationship that exists between husband and wife, the entangled sub-plots and the erratic activities of the characters serve to distract from whatever statement Hemingway is trying to make.The unexpected changes in viewpoints are disorienting, and the stories of other characters either stop abruptly or trail off seemingly without resolution. Harry remains the driving force of the novel, if there is one, even when the narrative meanders through the viewpoints of those who interact with him. Though his motivations inspire pity, his actions encourage judgment. Ultimately, I felt indifference toward him.One aspect of the novel that I did enjoy, however, was the marine setting. I liked the descriptions of Harry's boat and the protective feelings that he felt for her. However, if you want good writing by Hemingway about the nautical life, read The Old Man and the Sea. In fact, skip this book and read Old Man anyway."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I ordered this book for my grandson for Christmas. It came on time and in perfect condition. Would definetely order again from this seller"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a big Hemingway fan.I remember a college professor saying that Fitzgerald would agonize over every word of his novels. He would be terribly angered that Hemingway would grab a bottle of whiskey, walk up to his writer's garrett and whip out a novel.My impression after reading this Heminngway work is that he did just that - grabbed a bottle of whiskey and whipped out a novel. The parts of the books are headed as seasons in Harry Morgan's life and much of the book that is devoted to him is okay. He is Florida Keys boat owner trying to get by with money-making trips - both legal and illegal - between Florida and Cuba. However, especially near the end, there are other characters brought in who have absolutely no relation to the book. The impression the reader gets is that these characters and their descriptioons were sitting on Hemingway's desk and he threw them in as filler. Most annoying were a series of character descriptions of people on yachts in a yacht club when the Coast Guard was towing in a boat - completely useless to the book. A freshman in college may cite them as some examples of class disparity, but I think that is giving too much credit.Unless you are completely enamored by Hemingway, I'd skip this one. Frankly, if it weren't by Hemingway I doubt it would have ever been reprinted - if printed at all."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Harry Morgan is a poorly developed charcter. It is difficult to really sympethize with him. He has financial problems but doesn't just turn to smuggling, but murder. Reading a book without being able to sympethize with any character can be tedious. Hemingway may have been trying to show what happens to a man when society pushes him into poverty. The problem is that Morgan has no virtue at any point. Probably Hemingway's worst character."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. He must have been drunk when he wrote it. I find it very choppy and inane. The characters and plots are started and never developed. Incidents begin in the middle of an event and end abruptly. I gave it one star only because I couldn't go lower. A total waste of money."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"The theme of this book seems to be \\"life sucks and then you die.\\" Seriously, it is hard to believe that Ernest Hemingway who is considered one of the great writers of the 20th century wrote it.The novel begins with chapters about a charter boat captain who is down on his luck. He becomes involved in more and more criminal behavior to make money for his family after one of his customers skips out on the bill.The novel then takes a detour through a number of vignettes about brittle, rich sops who hang out at a bar and on yachts and are mostly miserable. Some fight scenes with war veterans also happen in the bar.Then the novel lurches back to the sea captain's ignoble fate at the end, kind of like getting seasick on a small boat.Woven throughout are lots of racial slurs spoken mostly by the sea captain, Harry Morgan.This book was written during the Great Depression and interestingly mentions suicide several times so perhaps Hemingway was depressed when he wrote it. He did end his own life many years later.All in all it was not worth the time I spent reading it after picking it up at the Hemingway House on Key West. Don't read this if you are in a bad mood as it will make you feel even worse.I am giving this three stars with respect to the fact that Mr. Hemingway wrote it. Otherwise I would give it one star."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Although &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is Ernest Hemingway's minor novel and supposedly one of his worst, I feel that it is one of his best. I found this book much more exciting than any of his other novels, and it is filled with excitement and adventure. It is an easy story to relate with."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Hemmingway called this his \\"worst novel,\\" and while authors aren't always their own best critics, sometimes they are. Yes this book is Hemmingway. Yes, it has flashes of brilliance. It also has many of his favorite themes: the Gulf of Mexico, tough-talking self-contained men. Bars. Boats. But there's not much to it.There are two problems. One is the loose-knit plot. Just to give one example: There is a maxim in drama that if you're going to show a gun (or a knife, or whatever) in the first act, you'd better use it in the third. This book opens with Harry Morgan witnessing a gunfight involving a bunch of Cubans who blame him for betraying them and threaten to get him eventually. Morgan eventually has plenty of trouble with Cubans...but they're not the same Cubans, and the threat goes nowhere. I kept waiting for them to come back, but apparently they were just window dressing. Which goes for much of the story. As a period piece on the way people behaved in Depression-era Key West bars (where most of it is set) it has some interest, but as a coherent story, it's seriously lacking.That would be a minor problem if Morgan were more interesting. The story shows how he, a former cop, is drawn into a string of illegal activities because he sees no other way to keep his beloved boat and support his family. As it progresses, he gets angrier and more bitter, and the story could have worked as the tale of a man beaten down by the Depression and seduced by the lure of making better money than he could on New Deal public-works projects. But from the start, Morgan is utterly immoral. Within 20 or 30 pages, he's contemplating murder, including the murder of a friend who gets in the way. There's no tragic story here of a good man who loses his way, because Morgan is a stone killer at the start of the book-and gets progressively worse.Bottom line: if you liked Bogie in the movie, you aren't going to like the protagonist of this book. So, unless you're really interested in watching how Hemmingway developed over the course of his career, give this book a pass. That said, if you do want to read the book, this is a handsomely done edition."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is the kind of book that you can barely believe was penned by Ernest Hemingway. This literary giant wrote many a beautiful thing in his day and no matter what terrible things he may have written between his several masterpieces the triumph of his genius cannot be erased. But this book comes as close as any will.To Have and Have Not was Hemingway's most ambitious literary endeavor by a long-shot. And he fails spectacularly. It's a story about a smuggler and his family in Key West, which attempts to dissect the socio-economic injustices of Depression-era United States. This is no easy subject for certain, and his legacy would have been the better for not having attempting the feat. And yet, there is something admirable in Hemingway's attempt even if it does make for a miserable read.The story is disjointed in terms of both time and structure. It's more a sequence of vignettes that fail to add up to a whole with a string of dead-end tangents around every page. When Hemingway broaches the greater social issues of the \`haves and have-nots' as the title suggests, there's little point or connection to the plot. The examination is superficial, boring, and in the end sheds very light on the real issues. On top of that, it might just be the most extensive collection of awful metaphors ever published. Hardly a paragraph goes by without a clunker of a metaphor jumping off the page to stab the reader in his or her brain.The most interesting parts of the story are the colorful scenes at various Key West watering holes, which Hemingway paints to perfection. These are no doubt well-researched, first-hand accounts of the Key West bar scene and its many colorful characters, but they serve no real purpose in the story other than to offer a break from the tired language of the rest of the book.Worst of all, it's impossible to like any of the characters. It's almost as if Hemingway went out of his way to make his characters unappealing. And his attempts to add dimension to these figures simply gives the reader more reasons not to like them.When Hemingway is at his best, he is king. When he's at his worst, his writing makes L. Ron Hubbard look like Shakespeare. And after reading To Have and Have Not, even a TV Guide will look like breathtaking literature. In short, To Have and Have Not read this book, I'd much rather have not.If you do give it a read, try and forget about it quickly. Dwell instead on A Farewell to Arms or The Sun Also Rises . This is the Hemingway that we know and love."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I found this book extremely confusing to follow the main character is Harry Morgan but I could never tell who the &quot;I&quot; was in the following chapter.

We did nor expect such a quick shipment."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"\\"To Have and Have Not\\" by Ernest Hemingway is a typically sharp and stylistic character drama set in depression era Key West and Havana, Cuba. Hemingway's books usually have a signature of authenticity that is the true mark of an original writer. I have read four or five of Hemingway's best novels and the most distinguishing aspect is the dry, sparsely written prose that cuts right to the heart of character. There is no fanciful allusion or elaborate language that defined some of the writers that came in the generation before Hemingway, such as Edith Wharton or Henry James. As they often dealt with the upper strata of society, there exists a slight literary pretension in some of the pre-modernist prose that matches the late Victorian era aristocrats and their social values.As America entered the modern era, society began to change with Teddy Roosevelt's \\"trust busting\\", labor unionizing, civil rights issues and the question of immigration all calling established societal values into question. After reading a bit about Roosevelt, Hemingway's early life seems very much inspired by the president who took the Oval office shortly after his birth in 1899. The virility of Roosevelt is matched by Hemingway's experiences throughout the first half of the 20th century, especially his love of the outdoors and the thrill of big game hunting. In the case of \\"To Have and Have Not,\\" it was Hemingway's love of the Gulf stream waters around the Florida Keys and Cuba that inspired this 1937 publication, specifically the years he spent as a seaman, exploring every inch of the waters, but also the people and the unstable and sometimes dangerous world that linked Cuba to the United States.With the Prohibition era, liquor and the ingredients necessary for its creation were smuggled into Florida; the mob connections that developed in the area grew and grew until prominent underworld leaders such as Meyer Lansky had invested large sums of their money into Havana, making it into the playground and vacation destination of America's elite. This era was a little after the period in which Hemingway wrote \\"To Have and Have not\\", yet the foundations for the corrupt mob backed state of Cuba and the transit pathways between American coasts and \\"offshore\\" financial interests were very much alive in the 30's, thanks in large part to the smuggling business.Hemingway was a well-known figure in these circles; he had gained fame with his writing in the mid to late 20's with \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"Farewell to Arms\\". He had access to the Cuban and American communities on which this story is based. In that light this book, like all good fiction, is drawn from real life events and people, only the names and details are rearranged to create a more fluid and original story line.The principal character is Harry Morgan, an ex-Miami Police Officer (though this is only mentioned once in the whole book) runs into some bad financial luck in the small business of chartering his fishing boat to wealthy American's on holiday. He becomes deeper and deeper involved into the nefarious smuggling networks between Havana and Key West; so much so that by the end of the book he is unrecognizable from the man painted in the first few pages. While he is the main vehicle on which the story is built, Hemingway includes other character sketches, such as a pair of quarreling spouses who are in in the Keys to write, a bar full of drunken and violent WWI vets (of the famous \\"Lost Generation\\") and various \\"shady\\" individuals, looking to subvert the law and make a quick buck. The reader is never sure of who they are or what they represent, because Morgan is a free lancer; he is not under a criminal organization with \\"bosses\\" above him.This book is definately an example of how Hemingway became so successful and also how a large part of this success was his access to people and places that were considered important at the time. Hemingway is no genius with his prose; yet his style is considered one of the definitive forces of modernist writing. The real strength of his work was the way he mirrored his life with his prose. He was considered such a denizen of his era that he moved in many circles throughout his life. He hobnobbed with mobsters and politicians, generals and revolutionaries, yet always maintained his autonomy and an independent sense of \\"manhood.\\"On Monday, the 28th of May, HBO is showing an original movie titled \\"Hemingway and Gellhorn\\" about Ernest's 3rd marriage and the courtship that took place during the Spanish Civil War. This should be great; after reading this book and also his brother's memoir/bio of Ernest, I kept thinking how suitable his stories are for the big screen. It is no wonder that most of his major books were made into movies during the early years of Hollywood. Though some of these won Academy awards, I still find that pre 1960 films are usually so rigid in their standards that real character exploration is put aside in favor of a mass produced \\"faade\\" that is meant to impart old fashioned values to the viewer, rather than really telling the truth. I watched \\"The Sun also Rises\\" with Tyrone Power, but found it somewhat ridiculous that he was cast as the Ernest character, who was in his early 20's at the time, while Power is pushing 50 (though Rock Hudson's characterization in \\"Farewell to Arms\\" was much better). Hemingway's stories defined what it meant to be manly in the 20th century. As that century fades into the past, his stories really depict how the world changed as the result of two world wars (both of which he witnessed) and the unrest of the Cold War. \\"To Have and Have Not\\" was far ahead of its time in pointing to Cuba with a cautionary tone, as it would become the place where World War III nearly started, with the Missile Crisis in 1962."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Length:: 2:46 Mins\\"To Have and Have Not\\" was released in a troublesome time in Ernest Hemingway's life, when he was looking to make some money because he was low on it.Now I didn't know this upon my first reading, but apparently having reconsidered the work himself to be garbage in that he more or less just wrote it for the money.I walked into this thinking it might be another Hemingway classic now and you can understand my surprise when I'm used to such classics as \\"For Whom The Bells Tolls\\" and \\"The Old Man & The Sea\\", I was expecting something of the same caliber. He's one of the best to ever have written in American literature, so you can understand my disappointment as halfway through, I still felt like there was nothing really going on and there wasn't a good story structure to base things around and in the overall excitement, flow was just missing.I later learned that \\"To Have and Have Not\\" is a longer form of what was originally just a short story. And perhaps that can explain why it doesn't seem like the structure of the novel is completely there.I would give this one three stars and it's just barely three stars. I think it makes up to three stars because there's still Hemingway here - that writing style that you know and love from either when you were taught in high school or for your own passionate reading of the author is here. It's intact but the storyline and the ability of the story to grip you as a reader it's just not as strong and not as overall important of a novel in Hemingway's work as all of his other stuff.I'd stay away from it unless you're a huge fan of his other stuff. If not, look for some of his other significant stuff first, especially something short like \\"The Old Man & The Sea,\\" which is one of my favorites.BookReviewersClub (.com) Reviewer - Dean Goranites"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I went through a long period of not much liking Hemingway. I read For Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to Arms back in school, and while I could appreciate a lot of Hemingway's craftsmanship in them, I couldn't enjoy them. I couldn't get over their dryness, even if there was intelligence behind it. Then, however, I decided on a whim to readThe Sun Also Risesand give him another chance. It worked. I loved it (still do) and read my way through some of Hemingway's other works, especiallyThe Old Man and The Seaand a lot of the short stories, and found a lot to like, a lot of moments in which the intelligence equaled the humanity in the stories, and where the direct style matched the toughness of the characters and stories. I would count myself a Hemingway fan now.Finally, I got around to reading To Have and Have Not a couple of weeks ago, and unfortunately, I had rather a mixed reaction to the novel. It's, first of all, a rather disjunctive piece, broken up into three parts that, and while they mainly follow the same chief character and similar subject matter, are rather different, to my ear, in tone and style. I've read that To Have and Have Not is comprised of originally separate pieces, and it certainly reads that way.The first part, in which Harry Morgan is trying to make good but is driven by circumstance to do something terrible is the strongest part of the book. Alone, I think it's about as strong as anything else Hemingway ever wrote; it's extremely well-paced and contains subtle and well-drawn characterizations. Harry is noble, but tragic, and it's easy to feel for him.The rest of the book carries on the themes of that opening story. Harry is married to Marrie (a sympathetic character) and wants to do well by his family, but poverty keeps driving Harry in deeper, making him increasingly desperate and angry and forcing him to lose his caution. He goes on determinedly but makes tremendous mistakes and ends up losing more than his arm.The final two thirds of To Have and Have Not strike me as somewhat too one-noted. Things are bad and get worse and worse. No doubt this marks Hemingway at his grimmest. It seemed to me that things are so overwhelmingly bad in this novel that it's difficult to muster more than a little pity for anyone in it. The disjunction of the three parts was a little disconcerting to me, as well, especially since I thought the book began so strong. Some of the (wealthy and vain) side characters who make cameos in the book, though their actions served well as a foil to highlight the social criticisms of the novel, mostly feel intrusive, and their stories seemed incomplete.So, I wouldn't label To Have and Have Not as a total failure. It has its good and bad moments. I doubt, though, that it is one of Hemingway's works that I will ever revisit again."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Many people classify this novel as a \\"minor\\" Ernest Hemingway novel, but after reading it,I have come to appreciate this book more and more. We spent a day in Key West as part of a cruise and my wife purchased this work at the Hemingway House. After she finished, I read it more to see how the author treated the people of Key West in the book since we had been there nd learned of the Conch Republic secession from the United States in the 1970s.This book features Harry Morgan, one of the \\"conches\\" in Key West, who ekes out a living operating a fishing boat out of Key West and Cuba in 1937. Times are hard for harry and when he gets stiffed by his charter, he is faced with the economic necessity of performing some illegal activities with his boat (activities to he is not a stranger).On the surface, the \\"have nots\\" are the poor \\"conches\\" of Key West who are battling to lift themselves out of the depression and are willing to commit illegal activity to feed their families.That is the surface plot. Yet underneath, there is a series of disparate characters who demonstrate that, despite their high level of social and economic status, have aspects of their lives in which they \\"have not\\". These vignettes are vividly displayed, as the master must have intended."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"\`To Have and Have Not' follows Harry Morgan, one of Hemingway's harshest heroes, as he tries to earn a living from his boat between Key West and Cuba. He gets involved in a variety of exploits, from people trafficking and liquor smuggling, to aiding escapees from a bank robbery. He acts and lives in as hard a way as he has to, to survive the dangers these events put him in. This is one of Hemingway's better novels, with great descriptions of Cuba and Key West and has a story that moves at a steady and inescapable pace, except for the last 50 pages where the story drifts a touch and rambles in that way Hemingway books tend to do. You get great examples of his writing style, with terse, short sentences that evoke the era and events and shows how effective he could be when he was at his peak. The main character may not be the most likeable, but this book still manages to keep you turning the pages until you reach the inevitable conclusion. Well worth a try if you've enjoyed some of his other books.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Like so many readers, I'm familiar with the entertaining film of the same title that took quite a lot of liberties with the characters and plot that Hemingway developed. (And by the way, William Faulkner wrote the screenplay for the movie!) I assumed the book would be similar to the movie -- and it's not.The Harry Morgan in the film is a hero, a sort of amoral hero in some sense, but definitely someone who is working on behalf of the greater good. The Harry Morgan of the book is a true anti-hero, one of the seminal anti-heroes in literature. But I loved the book nonetheless. It's a powerful book, full of death and failure and frustration, as well as the classic Hemingway machismo.The book is a series of stories about life in the Florida Keys and Cuba during a period when the Great Depression had torpedoed opportunities for many Americans, and life was becoming unliveable in corrupt, violence Cuba. The main character, Harry Morgan, is able to move between those worlds, and carve out an existence. Quite literally, he moves between the two countries as a boat captain. He offers fishing charters in the Gulf, and, when the Depression kills the charter trade, he is willing to run guns, liquor, and illegal immigrants from Cuban to the States. Anything for money.All of of his life begins in bars, where he seems to spend most of his time. He cuts deals, catches up on the news, and drinks endlessly. He just goes from one event to another, with little thought of the future or a grander plan. Sadly, his bravery -- of which there's a great deal -- has no greater purpose. He's amoral, but also fearless.Through a series of vignettes, we see the key moments in Morgan's life. In the first vignette, Morgan escapes a political hit that results in deaths of three men seeking to escape Cuba. Then he gets stiffed on nearly $1,000 for a fishing charter, and so he accepts an offer to smuggle a dozen Chinese men into Florida. But he double-crosses the dealmaker. In the next vignette, we see Morgan at the tail end of a liquor run that has gone horribly, violently bad; ultimately, he loses his arm. Then, in the last extended vignette, we see Morgan taking yet another chance because he's in dire need of money, when he agrees to take political operatives back to Cuba, against his better judgment. This goes horribly wrong, too.Through these stories, we get a deep character sketch of a man we want to like and admire, but who I find ultimately to be distateful. Morgan breaks the law over and over again. He's mean to friends and people who are loyal to him. He antagonizes strangers, just to show that he can't be pushed around. You want to think he's the Humphrey Bogart character in the movie -- a fearless man who breaks the law in order to serve a higher good -- but in the novel, Morgan isn't serving a higher good, except perhaps in the sense of being the little guy against \\"the man.\\" That's what makes Harry Morgan an anti-hero, and that is one of the great achievements of this book. It should be said that Morgan loves his wife, a former prostitute with whom he's had three daughters. Morgan just wants his little piece of life, but he only knows how to get it in the world he inhabits of bars, boats, broads.The book also does a wonderful job of sketching the side characters -- the rummies who seek small jobs from Morgan, the political schemers who are fomenting revolution in Cuba, the rich folk and intellectuals who come down from New York for a frolic in the Florida Keys. It also shows the understated way that the bartenders and workers of a place like the Keys set up the atmosphere for the casual visitor, and the contempt with which the workers hold most of the visitors. It's not a pretty sight.The book is over 50 years old, but it has the power to shock. The comments about sex between Morgan and his wife are blunt and more than a little \\"dirty.\\" Morgan also calls Blacks and Chinese people by less-enlightened terms, and he shows contempt for the folks living in Cuba. As I said, he's not likeable, dignified, or noble -- despite his obvious skills as a boat captain and his great bravery.Conclusion. It's definitely worth reading if you want to inhabit a tough world of down-and-out people. Hemingway builds a romantic world while not making it pretty, safe, or even fun. It's gritty, dirty, dangerous -- and you wish you had the cojones to live there, too."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is not one of Hemingway's masterpieces but it is a solid novel.The story is basically a sea adventure story involving an owner of a small boat named Harry Morgan who specializes in giving tours to wealthy people but delivers contraband on the side to make ends meet.

Few things in life are as wonderful as a Hemmingway novel. The way he writes, the language, is poetic and full of life and he can make the most boring of subjects keep your attention and beg for more. To Have And Have Not is not one of his more famous works, but it is very satisfying indeed."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This short novel was written when Hemingway was living in Key West and paying regular visits to Cuba, before moving, lock, stock, and barrel, to Havana in 1939. The author was a keen deep-sea fisherman himself, who craved a laid-back tropical lifestyle between bouts of high adventure. To Have And Have Not draws heavily on his intimate knowledge of early nineteen-thirties life in the Florida Keys, the north coast of Cuba, the Gulf Stream in between, the fishing boats that worked those waters, and the men who owned and manned them.This was the time of the Great Depression. Harry Morgan has been bilked of his dues for a fishing charter out of Havana. Broke, he turns to smuggling - with its inevitable risks - in order to support his family while the author treats the reader to a simply told, suspenseful, and sometimes poignant morality tale. A tale with a rich share of characters ranging from down-and-out &quot;rummies&quot;, Cuban revolutionaries, bar-owners, customs men, and an inevitably crooked lawyer, to the wealthy owners of luxury steam-yachts.Interestingly if a little quirkily structured, the book is divided into three parts. The first is told in the first person, most of the remainder in the third. To Have And Have Not should be viewed as a product - as well as a story - of its time, particulary in respect of terminology that would be seen today as highly racist and derogatory. Not &quot;Papa's&quot; best work, but most assuredly a yarn that held this reader's attention throughout."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Harry Morgan, the antihero of Hemingway's \\"To Have and Have Not,\\" is a former cop from Miami who now works on the other side of the law. He owns a small yacht and charters fishing trips for vacationers, alternating between Havana and Key West, where he lives with his wife Marie and their three daughters. When times get tough, as they often do during the Great Depression, he supplements his income by running liquor and aliens between Cuba and Florida. For the remainder of his short life, he endures danger, violence, and great bodily sacrifice in his rather simpleminded pursuit of the next big score.Early in the novel we see exactly what kind of operator Morgan is when he cheats and murders a Chinese businessman who has hired him to transport some immigrants. His motive is nothing more complicated than that he needs the money and doesn't value human life very highly, especially not a stranger's. He has little use for people who can't directly help him make money; it's not surprising that he has few friends, these being Eddy the drunk and Albert the sad sack who's digging ditches on a relief project. He is cold (but not abusive) even to his family and apparently doesn't care much whether they live or die even though he feels a vague obligation to provide for them.Hemingway contrasts the impoverished Morgans with the more affluent tourists in Key West, most of whom do not interact personally with Morgan. The most notable subplot is the troubled marriage of the writer Richard Gordon, who is working on a novel about a labor strike, and his vixenish wife Helen; but their purpose in the novel is unclear except possibly to portray random marital discord. All these characters, from the surly, discontented Morgan to the wealthy residents with their facades of prosperity and happiness, have one thing have in common--they are people to whom an enormous amount of liquor is an anesthetic with which to numb their miseries.That Morgan is an unlikeable man is not the problem with \\"To Have and Have Not\\"; he's little more than what he seems--just a guy on a boat getting into trouble and drinking away his aimless, empty life. Hemingway lived in Key West in the 1930s, and it can be assumed that he was inspired by the shady characters he might have seen on the docks, so I can appreciate where he was going with this novel; but it has only half a heart. His minimalist, descriptively sparse prose and punchy dialogue work best when his characters have desires and passions deeper and more complex than money, as they do in his better novels (\\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\") and short stories. Like Hemingway's better heroes, Morgan is an adventurer, but his tragedy is that he lives only for the payoff."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"After having lived in the Keys for eight years, I picked up \\"TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT\\" again and realized Harry Morgan lives! And, he's got lots of relatives. Ernest Hemmingway is often touted as Key West's most famous son, but he wasn't born there and he didn't stay there all that long. I think he stayed long enough to realize that if he stayed any longer he would have become Harry Morgan, fate included. There's a mixture of opinion regarding this novel collection. Even the author himself came to disdain it. However, if anything, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is too good, too real for comfort.There is an oft-quoted phrase, \\"Keys Disease,\\" that is used in the Keys to describe a variety of sensual addictions from the love of the eternally warm weather to sport fishing and reef diving to alcoholism and drug abuse. But, what Hemmingway has captured in this dark, desperate work of fiction is the real Keys Disease, an alien, otherworldly, situational ethos that is born of the intimate embrace of Thanatos. To truly live in paradise, one has to be dead and dead men like Harry Morgan are unconcerned about morality or life or fate, least of all their own. The warm, shallow Florida Bay, that lies so placidly behind these tiny coral islands, conceals the evidence of a thousand Harry Morgans; unholy traffic in human life, robberies gone awry, drug deals that ended in death, murders and suicides. You know the Keys Disease has got you when you can accept it all, smile and say, \\"Just another beautiful day in the fabulous Florida Keys.\\" I think Papa got it."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Just the name Hemingway conjures up images of writing that will leave a reader astounded by its brilliance. Sadly, my first Hemingway novel, left me a little flat. \\"To have and have not\\" is a somewhat disjointed account of a scallywag named Harry Morgan. Harry owns a charter ship based in Cuba and, is also not averse to running Cubans between Key West and Cuba.That's pretty much the premise for the book. There's a lot of conversational prose that flows over many pages of which the outcome doesn't seem to be ... anything? Morgan doesn't mince his words and, due to this, we never get to know him well enough to root for him. There's little, if any, internal dialogue where can get inside his head and figure him out. In some ways, this book is two or three short stories bound together.Towards the end of the book, I got a sense of Hemingway's brilliance as he takes us inside a number of boats docked in a small port of Cuba. Here he glows as he paints a picture of the people's lives and how they ended up at the point they are now. He uses words so well and, due to this chapter in particular, I'll delve deeper into Hemingway's work. Without this chapter I might have decided against further time spent reading Hemingway's work.\\"To have and Have Not\\", in summary, is a disjointed, tepid and tired tale about a man we know as little about by the end as we did at the beginning.

Hemingway inserts chapters and characters that all strongly underline the titled theme; 'To Have and Have Not'The depression has caused political and social uncertainty; dishonesty seems to be the only thing that pays. Honest Albert Tracy is starving with his family as he works for lousy money on relief and what he can earn from Harry, but respects the law.The rich are rich because they're ruthless but are always one step away from having someone do to them what they have done to others, and the taxman is calling. In Cuba they want revolution but the replacements are every bit as brutal as the incumbants. This follows up-or underlines- Hemingway's theme in 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' where the internationalists are every bit as murderous and brutal as the fascists; what's in a name? Where is civilization?Hemingway strips humanity down to its most animal instincts of survival and poses the same questions as Steinbeck in 'Grapes of Wrath' all in 180 pages. A really brilliant book, a really brilliant writer."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Harry owns a boat and he hires himself out to sportsmen who want to catch big fish. He is cheated by a client and short of money. He agrees to run contraband. He goes home to his wife. She fears something will go wrong. They make love. She worries that Harry wants more than she can offer. He reassures her: she's a fine woman.The next day Harry goes on his trip. A young unsuccessful writer sits in a cafe and sees a fat old woman in a badly fitting dress running towards the docks; he imagines her to be late for work at a processing factory or some such thing and begins a short story based on her pathetic life. She is in fact Harry's wife. She just got a call from the police. The writer will never know of the passion she felt the night before. Or Harry's story.Easily one of Hemingway's most depressing books, this dark and complex story shows bad things happening to good people. Take it as a warning. Life requires courage, or as Hemingway described it, grace under pressure.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is a dark tale, chiefly about a tough working class guy named Harry Morgan. It takes place in Key West, Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico.Harry is tough and thinks he can beat the system, but we find out that he (like so many others) is just another loser. Hemingway contrasts Harry with some other losers, including Cubans, Chinese, Blacks, and a large assortment of Americans from several class and ethnic backgrounds.There are a few bright moments in the book between Harry and his wife Marie, as well as between Harry and his shipmates.Many of Hemingway's favorite themes are here -- what does it mean to be a tough man, an artist, a lover. Unlike some of his other works, his answers to these questions are mostly bleak and depressing.The 1944 movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is nothing like the book. If you've seen the movie be prepared for a big shock."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"To be honest there is nothing I can add to all the good things that people have said about this classic book by Hemingway who wrote it many years ago.If you like Hemingway and have not read this one yet you will not be disappointed.This book is not like the movie but i was not expecting that. I really liked the movie too with Humphrey Bogart and Walter Brennan. This book does not have the happy ending of the movie and it's main character did not fight Nazi's like the movie one did.Like with many of Hemingway's books he throws in many little tidbits of information that gives you insight into the people of that time period.All in all I highly recommend this book to all. I was happy to see that there were only a few errors in the Kindle version."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Nothing like the movie. More a series of vignettes in Harry Morgan's life. I was surprised I liked it because one of my pet peeves is if you are going to make a movie from the book, stay true to the book. Much more violent, less heroic than the movie. I have to admit that based on Hemingway's descriptions of certain characters that the actors were well chosen for the movie. I still liked the movie better."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I had read the first section of a three part story years ago in an anthology of Hemingway novels and short stories. The second and third parts are also centred on Harry Morgan, the luckless charter boat operator in the Florida Keys.It's a pretty gritty story, set in a time when America was mired in the Great Depression. Harry's hard-scrabble existence goes from bad to worse through the three episodes but through it all his wife remains steadfast by his side. Nothing sugar-coated in this tale and the writing is classic Hemingway."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"A well executed tale of struggle and ambition. Hemingway uses his mastery of character development to draw the reader into cheering for an unlikely hero in Harry. Don't look for happy endings but you'll certainly enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This book, which you can't help but feel is closely modeled on a period of Hemingway's own life, is most revealing in the portrayal of the lifestyles of the rich and unemcumbered of the mid-20th century. Based in France and Spain it follows a group of friends travelling to bull fights and idyllic fishing spots and explores the friendships and jealousies between the group.In my opinion, not as good as 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', but also a far different story and different type of novel.An easy, enjoyable read, but not Hemingway's greatest work."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Hemmingway writes in a way that makes for a page turner. There is an undercurrent throughout the story of the trials faced by people of all classes; rich and poor. Life is seen as a struggle to acquire money or about worrying about money with an occassional respite for short term pleasures."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Classic Hemmingway, Short read, great characters, a must for Cuba enthusiast and and rum runner wantabees. A snapshot of lives as only Hemmingway can do."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Vacationed in Key West and was inspired to read this book. I was reminded why I love Ernest Hemingway. A real joy."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Interesting to revisit this book after many years passing since I first read it. It's particularly interesting to read Hemingway's view of the Cuban revolution in the making, as well as getting a view of the violence in the background of those times when Cuba was a \\"playground\\" for some pretty unsavory types. Though it probably is one of Hemingway's worst, it still has its moments--thin characters and all. This is one of the few books where I'd say the movie was better. Bogart did it justice. Still...it's a damn good book by most anyone's standards."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"But this book is missing something. It has plenty of drama, interesting sidebars, but I think a lot of it was rambling and Hemmingway didn't know where he was going with it. Nevertheless, the tale of Harry Morgan's struggle to keep his family fed in corrupt Key West is interesting. The dialog is powerful, particular in the bar scenes. And Hemmingway's style of direct prose writing is entertaining. You will feel the pain of the characters in this difficult story."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This is a book often linked with a later one from the 1950s: Across The River and Into The Trees; mainly because many readers do not like either of these books.To Have and Have Not has always been an interesting read for me; having come upon it in the mid-1960's while still in college. It was not part of my assigned reading but my professor was so much against EH's Islands In The Stream that I sought out what some critics feel to be one of his lesser works. But as I say, not only have I always enjoyed reading this book, but feel EH knew both the area and the people very well.Though I am truly an EH fan I cannot say this is one of his best, because for me the writing is in many spots very uneven. Though the characters are true and real, for Hem took most from real life, they and the sadness of the depression years keep this one moving along. Part One is very good, very even, but when one starts Part Two it seems one has been dropped 'in medias res' and it takes some re-reading to get a clear line on the writer's direction. And the length of each 'part' can also be very uneven, too. The book deals with not only depressing times but tragic ones as well. Doesn't mirror Hemingway's personal life at this time for he was at a crest, especially with the books he turned out while living those Key West years.The book is completely different from the movie, which EH did not care for at all, and Eddie comes off worse in the book than in the movie. EH has Harry even considering killing Eddie at one point.In Harry Morgan EH has created a person both fictional and real: much of the character was based on Josie Russell the man who owned Sloppy Joe's, and one of few lasting Hemingway friends, their friendship lasted from 1932 till June of 1941 when Josie died during the time he and EH were on their annual fishing trip. EH took his death very hard. So with this novel you have much fiction intertwined with non-fiction.I would not suggest this book for readers just beginning his/her Hemingway reading, but once familiarity with EH has been established it will offer a reader good background for those early/mid 1930 years EH spent in Key West. For those of us with a couple shelves full of books by and about Hemingway, this is an essential read.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"This book tells about the story of a fisherman named Harry Morgan who has to do smuggling business to feed his family. The book does a good job of depicting many kinds of characters. All portrayling the negative aspects of a human being. Greed, violence, jealousy, and compeitition. From the naive \\"chink\\" Mr.Sing to the tragic Albert. The book brings out a lot in terms of people's lives during the Great Depression.However, the book was also hard to get into. The actions seem to go on intermittently, sometimes the book becomes fast paced while suddenly it jumps into a sluggish form. Some depictions from the book simply do not make any sense. The action jumps from Harry and suddenly turns to a writer named Richard Gordon and talks about how his wife left him to have sex with another guy. The book does a poor job of tying a beautiful, and somewhat touching story together. And instead it gets people to scratch their heads and wonder what is going on.However, all said and done, this book still remains valuable through its realistic depiction of a tough life from the perspective of Harry Morgan. Though not one of Hemingway's best works,(probably his worst) this book should still be read with serious thoughts."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"It's a common belief under critics that great writers have only about six really good novels in them. Because of his extensive journeys, Hemingway is the exception. Although he had one or two bad ones, this one is not of them.'To Have And Have Not' revolves around Harry Morgan, a broke fishing boat captian willing to sacrifice his life and family for a few greenbacks. His mission: to safely smuggle a couple of immigrants from Cuba to Florida without getting caught. I admit, this is not my favorite Hemingway novel, but, it's still very good. Naturally, when Hemingway is at sea, it must be good. It just makes you close your eyes and clench your teeth every time you hear the cry of a gunshot on the boat. Off course, there's more than just that. Harry Morgan is deeply thoughtful for a fishing captain, and the way the author moves back and forth in describing his scenes makes for brilliant reading. That's how good Hemingway can be. Especially with a bottle in the one hand. Enough said. Everybody knows Hemingway wrote genius. Why he still don't get taught enough at colleges and universities is mind-blowing. Academics say there are nothing to teach about Hemingway. I disagree."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"I found To Have and Have Not to be the roughest of the Hemingway's works that I have read to date. The narrative is choppy, and the reader never really gets into the protoganist's head the way we do in even his earliest works (&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;). The progress of the plot is uneven, and unlike his many works set in Europe, we do not develop a vivid image of either Havana or the Florida keys.If you are looking for an introduction to Hemingway, I strongly recommend reading one of his great works such as A Farewell to Arms or For Whom the Bell Tolls. If you are working your way through all of Hemingway's works, then of course this belongs on your list."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Hemingway is known for his simple, easy-to-read writing style, but everything he writes goes much deeper than the oceans he writes about. This book, as is common with his other books, tells about the struggles of trying to make it through life, and how one has to play with the hand he's given. Everyone has to put up with hardships in life, some more than others, but everyone has to learn how to deal with them because there's not much they can do to change their lives. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is a very realistic account of life. It will leave you contemplating about life in general, and make you realize many new things that you may not have thought about before. Though it wasn't given very good reviews by critics, and is not considered one of Hemingway's major novels, it is a book for the person out there who loves to find the significance in seemingly insignificant things put in there by an ingenius author."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Hemingway's genius as the greatest American writer of the century is evident from the first chapter. His action narrative skills are first rate, but get beneath that level and find his wonderful insight into the shallowness of the rich in contrast to the depth of the protaganist, a poor fisherman, and adventurer. And, if you think Hemingway is all machismo, read chapter 21 for its gut wrenching sensitivity from the female perspective. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"A word is warning is appropriate before going into the book. Most of the book speaks from the perspective of a person who uses highly prejorative terms about people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This use of the terms is consistent with the story, and advances the story, but will not be welcomed by some readers. I found this aspect of the book offensive and graded it down one star as a result. If the use of such terms is very offensive to you, I suggest you skip this book. It will cause you pain to confront this prejudice in undiluted form.This lesser-known novel by Hemingway looks at what the cost of false pride in status is. The book has some of the most eloquent statements of remorse that you will ever read, in the context of a love story about two happily married people.Be sure to understand that the novel is quite different from the movie. If you liked the movie, you may not like the novel. The book is much more complex and darker emotionally.Harry Morgan has his own fishing boat, and makes a living taking wealthy people fishing off Florida's Keys until the Depression knocks the skids out from under normal economic times.The book opens with Morgan in Havana turning down three Cubans who want him to smuggle them into the United States illegally for a very substantial sum. The negotiations are quickly followed by a hail of gunfire, and one of the Cubans is killed. Morgan is warned to keep his mouth shut by the survivors.Like most small businesspeople, he wants to provide for his family, be respected for his profession, and enjoy what he does. All of this is put at risk when he fails to collect from a wealthy customer who skips out on him. Morgan had avoided dunning Mr. Johnson, his customer, for the money, worried about upsetting the customer. That false pride in pretending that Morgan isn't concerned for the money is expensive. The result is temporary economic ruin. He's left in Havana without even enough money to refuel the boat to go back to the Florida Keys.Now, he has to scramble to do anything, and quickly takes on a job of illegally transporting Chinese. Survival comes before ethics now. In the process, Morgan tries to keep his morality intact as best he can, and does an immoral act to avoid doing a worse one.Soon, Morgan is taking other risks and routinely operating as a criminal. His ethical standards keep slipping in order to maintain financial appearances. This trade-off proves to be his undoing.In each case of economic hardship, Morgan has avoided taking other actions that would have solved his problem, at least temporarily. He owns his boat, so he could have sold it or borrowed against it. He owns his home, and could have sold it and rented. He could have rented other peoples' boats when he could get a charter. The government has subsistence work available for the unemployed, but he prefers to maintain his life style and appearances as though he has no problems. He also has tried to keep from getting caught in breaking the law, but that hasn't worked either.Morgan ends up taking on more than he can handle. He feels remorse as a result. He's tried to be too self-reliant, as a way to reduce his risk. That was the wrong route. Getting help was the right way to get the risk down.His wife, Marie, captures the challenge of the modern world this way, &quot;You just go dead inside and everything is easy. You just get dead like most people are most of the time.&quot; This suggests compromising your pride and principles to keep up appearances, which is what most people do.Hemingway makes good use of the &quot;haves,&quot; those who charter and own the yachts, to show that they have compromised with self respect. They have money, but they do not have honor and decency. Often, they lose other benefits that matter to them, such as the chance for close human connection.His &quot;have nots&quot; are crushed by the intent and the carelessness of the &quot;haves.&quot; The &quot;have nots&quot; are also undermined by their willingness to let the ends justify the means, and abuse of alcohol. Those weaknesses compromise them, and they are destroyed as a result.So the lesson is that you should uphold what is important to you (not appearances) and make the necessary compromises to guard the important (such as your family, your health, and your survival). The worse the conditions are, the more important this lesson is.After you finish contemplating what you would have done, I suggest you also think about where today we find similar compromises occuring because of prosperity. Where do we sacrifice what is important to have more prosperity or to appear to do so? I think Hemingway's tale still applies. How should you change, as a result?Get the right life for those you love and yourself!"},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"If, like me, your first experience with Hemingway's classic sea tale To Have or To Have Not was the steamy (for the times) Bogie/Bacall movie version where the main character, Captain Morgan, is the put upon object of the local French Resistance in World War II then this the original will surprise you. Actually the only similarity between the two works is the captain's name. That said, this tale is really about a gritty, hard-bitten, down at the heels sea-going man who will try everything to keep his family and himself above water (no pun intended). Starting out with a little illegal, just a little, activity he winds up.... well you can read the rest. Is this a major Hemingway production? I think not but it is also not the \`throwaway' that Hemingway in his lifetime considered it. Face it if you want to get an approximation of the life on the sea, the real sea, and the language of the waterfront Hemingway is one of your sources."},{"Title":"To Have and Have Not","review":"Following a trip to Havana in which I took in the villa and hotel rooms where Hemingway spent much of his time, I wanted to try this lesser known novel of his which begins with a typically terse but magnificent Hemingway description of tough guys in early morning Havana, operating before the ice wagons come to service the bars.This novel is a mixed bag. The dialogue is excellent, and the scenes where Harry and his wife's marital tension is explored are first rate and represent some of Hemingway's finest writing.The rest of the time it is largely a tale of hard men becoming undone. Which is a theme dealt with better in some of Hemingway's other writings anyway."},{"Title":"The Narnia Cookbook: Foods from C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia","review":"Having a 7-year old boy who loves The Chronicles of Narnia, this book really caught my eye. He has pored over it, and we have already made two of the recipes: Lucy's Roast Apples and Marmalade Roll. They both turned out very well, and were quite popular with the whole family.This book has approximately 68 recipes divided into categories such as Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea, Dinner, Dessert, and Drinks.In my opinion, the mark of a good cookbook is the percentage of recipes that one would actually make. In this cookbook, there is a high percentage of the recipes that I would try.Each recipe has a bit of commentary from Douglas Gresham, Lewis' stepson, and a quote from one of the books that lists the dish the recipe is for. The commentary is interesting and informative. There is also a foreward written by Gresham. At the end of the book are some menu ideas so that you can have a Narnian dinner party with your friends."},{"Title":"The Narnia Cookbook: Foods from C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia","review":"I LOVE the Chronicles of Narnia, even as a \\"grown-up\\".So I jumped at the chance to learn how to make foods described in the books.The book is supposedly aimed at kids. I will say though, that the taste of the foods is really more adult (or English). They taste great, don't get me wrong, but kids (unless they are really excited about the recipies being Narnian) will likely think them wierd. I made the Tea Cakes with Lemon Curd Filling for a friend's kid's Communion Party, and all the adults raved--but the kids wouldn't even go near them. (Incidentally, the Tea Cakes are DELICIOUS. A wonderful treat).A note of advice, you will need stuff like double boilers and parchment paper for some of the recipies. Plus you will have to make some trips to specialty food stores. However, most of the stuff is middling easy to make.Overall, this is a wonderful book. I am so glad I have it. The recipies are very tasty, and the book itself provides a wonderful cornicopia of foods and ideas that Americans are not very familiar with."},{"Title":"The Narnia Cookbook: Foods from C.S.

Obtaining the book was harder, but eventually my turn came to get it from the library. It's worth the wait. Ultimately, I don't know whether the recipe for Turkish Delight or Toffee was my favorite, they were both wonderful (as were many other recipies). Equally delightful were the color illustrations, excerpts from the book next to the appropriate recipe, and the bits of trivia (i.e. C.S. Lewis' favorite kind of tea). Any Narnia-lover will be enchanted. The author is quite willing (I asked him) so why won't Harper Collins reprint this book? I guess they think we aren't interested. I want to own this one!

But one can't help but feel the music of the language, preserved much like what one finds in Burns' poetry. The \\"songs\\" reveal the story and focus of historical Scotland --- the battles, the border skirmishes, the distrust of the English. They also depict the anguishes and joys of lords, lasses, ladies, and lairds in love, death, scandal, and betrayal. There is magic in the demons, devils,and elves, but delight throughout.If I were to change one thing, it would be to present the notes at the end as a preface to each of the respective ballads. The current publication appears to be directed towards those who are already familiar with its contents. The audience is far larger. It encompasses all those searching for an understanding of Scottish life and culture. It has been 200 years since my Scottish ancestors left its shores, but there is something in my genes that still sings with these ballads!"},{"Title":"Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices From the Grassroots","review":"Too often it's assumed that all environmentalists are white, class-privileged neo-hippies and that people of color are too busy with &quot;real&quot; issues. This book shows that activists of color are extremely dedicated to fighting pollutants in their community. This book stresses that a disproportionate number of communities of color have been targeted for toxic wastes sites, etc.; so it is not environmental classism, but specifically environmental racism. This book does a good job in showing how Blacks, Native Americans, and Latinos are equally engaged in fighting this tragedy. This book may be too simplistic for longtime activists. For non-scientists like myself, many of the chemical compounds mentioned and stuff like that went right over my head (figuratively, of course). Still, this helped me learn more on the topic and is a good starter book. I think this book can help bring progressives across color lines together."},{"Title":"Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices From the Grassroots","review":"Robert Bullard, whose work on environmental justice has really made \\"local\\" struggles for a cleaner environment much more visible in academic literature, along with Benjamin Chavis, Jr., a Church activist working to organize and support local struggles against environmental racism, have put together a very readable collection. Chavis and Bullard, open up a forum for other grassroots activists to participate in ongoing academic discussions of the environment and the detrimental effects of waste industries and environmental pollutants on minority and poor populations. CONFRONTING ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM is a nice collection of essays that incorporates the important voices of the individuals who are in the frontlines of change. The one thing I would have liked to see more of is accounts from a broader geographic region. However, if the edition is explicitly about the US (although it never says it is), it is indeed an insightful edition for all who are interested in environmental justice and grassroots social movements."},{"Title":"A Place to Be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling (Sociocultural, Political, and Historical Studies in Education)","review":"Teresa McCarty is an expert in this field and gives an ethnographically rich account of the school at Rough Rock.

At her funeral in 1982 an immense dollar sign stood beside her casket, and the characters in her books are always sketching the symbol in the air like early Christians sketching the sign of the cross.For all her hatred of religion, Rand managed to turn herself and her ideas into her own private church, and her intolerance of dissent rivaled that of the Ayatollah Khomeini. One story, about Murray Rothbard, shows how far she carried it and how seriously she took herself.Murray, one of the world's leading free market economists and libertarian thinkers, was a lifelong agnostic, but his wife, Joey, was and is a Christian. When they were younger, they had some truck with Rand and her circle of worshippers, but then the Great One found out about Joey's faith.Rand gave Joey six months to soak herself in Rand's own screeds against religion. If, at the end of that period, Joey abandoned her beliefs, she and Murray could sign up with the Source of All Truth Herself. If not, Murray would have to divorce Joey, or else they would be exiled to the outer dark. Murray, quite properly, told Rand to go take a flying jump up in the lake (or words to that effect). He kept his wife, and his wife kept her faith, and somehow they managed to live happily without the benefit of Ayn Rand's wisdom."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I'm delighted that what's left of Ayn Rand's teaching is slowly rotting away as people in general becomes more educated. No, and I mean no real economist takes her propagandistic writings seriously anymore, except as &quot;lightly read pulp sci-fi&quot; for confused teenagers. In her book, Capitalism, there is no empirics to support her views. The theoretical reasoning reveals a shocking ignorance of real economic theory. Basically this is a worthless piece of junk!"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Answer this question: If Rand endorses capitalism as an equal opportunity reward system for innovators &amp; industrialists, then someone explain inheritance to me. Great grandchildren of William R. Hearst are given a greater economic opportunity than the grandchildren of a mechanic, enabled by the STATE (the same state she blames for all problems) Rand never acknowledges this and her whole theory subsequently crumbles. Rand is popular with adolescents desperate to reconcile their confusion about self-interest and duties and &quot;Libertarian&quot; apologists looking for a theory to justify domination and exploitation. I find it fitting that a woman who praises capitalism as the &quot;unknown (unkown to whom?) ideal&quot; also goes to great lengths to explore rape fantasies in The Fountainhead.

She was an anti-philosopher, a propagandist, a cult leader, a demagogue, a self-appointed Messiah of 'Capatilism', an ill-educated and ill-read megalomaniac who knew little economics and even less philosophy. There were, and are, much more able defenders of 'capatilism' than she - and the hard fact is that people who misspell 'capitalism' are thereby indicating unfamiliarity with them (and thus insufficient competence in the field to review this book adequately).Neither their reviews nor those of the 'psychologisers' are to be trusted."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Consulting Ayn Rand about economics is like consulting Edgar Rice Burroughs about astronomy.

John Carter)."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The following remark opens Ayn Rand's essay \\"What Is Capitalism,\\" reprinted from THE OBJECTIVIST NEWSLETTER, Nov. & Dec., 1965, as the first chapter of CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL: \\"The disintegration of philosophy in the nineteenth century and its collapse in the twentieth have led to a similar, though much slower and less obvious process, in the course of modern science.\\" Yep, you got it: the end of civilization, courtesy of Ayn Rand.Now, get a load of this: 'Thus Europe's thinkers did not notice the fact that during the nineteenth century, the galley slaves had been replaced by the inventors of steamboats, and the village blacksmiths by the owners of blast furnaces, and they went on thinking in such terms (such contradictions in terms) as \\"wage slavery\\" or \\"the antisocial selfishness of industrialists who take so much from society without giving anything in return\\"---on the unchallenged axiom that wealth is an anonymous, social, tribal product.'Charitable critics might attribute such misrepresentation of history to mere ignorance. Sorry, no sale. Anybody with a ninth grade education in 1965 was equipped to see through the baloney Rand was purveying. \\"...Europe's thinkers did not notice...\\"? The industrial revolution of the 19th Century BEGAN in Europe, not in America. \\"...[W]age slavery...\\"? What does Rand even THINK she's talking about? At the time, America was still committed to the institution of LITERAL slavery. \\"...[I]ndustrialists who take...without giving...in return\\"? Read a history of the Gilded Age. For that matter, read a biography of Theodore Roosevelt to get a perspective on the treatment accorded their employees by 19th Century American industrialists.Now, here's a quotation from Michael Reagan, \\"Restructuring the Corporate System,\\" THE MANAGED ECONOMY (Oxford University Press, 1963): \\"One of the greatest myths of what passes for conservativism in America is the belief that, if government would just stop rocking the boat, the status quo of economic institutions and the economic system would be self-sustaining.\\"The \\"myth\\" of which Reagan speaks is black and white and Rand all over. If history has ANY lesson to teach us about capitalism, it's this: capitalism can't thrive without an enormous supply of cheap labor. 19th Century America's workforce fit the bill nicely: black slaves, women, children, immigrants. Of course, the American labor movement changed things a mite during the 20th Century. Once employers had to start PAYING their employees, cheap labor became scarcer, and capitalist wizards accordingly began outsourcing jobs to sweatshops in the Third World (\\"wage slaves,\\" \\"industrialists who take...without giving...in return,\\" anyone?). Naturally, Rand can't abide the idea of organized labor. Rand-World, after all, is a capitalist paradise in which industrialist big-shots have rights but workers don't (again: \\"wage slaves,\\" anyone?). Rand-World, of course, is a JUST world: everybody actually gets what he really deserves. So in Rand-World, what one is actually paid is precisely what one OUGHT to be paid. Hence, anybody in Rand-World who thinks he's UNDERpaid is just an evil piece of crap who ought to know that he'd be paid more if he were WORTH more---which he isn't, because he's just one more mediocre rank-and-file schmuck rather than a capitalist Uebermensch. And, yes, everybody who's not a reality-denying Altruist retard accepts Rand's take on things, because nobody who's not a reality-denying Altruist retard can fail to discern that his/her employer is an enlightened capitalist savant. Come on, now! Don't try telling anybody that YOUR employer isn't a dyed-in-the-wool genius, isn't an infallible dispenser of social, economic, and personal justice! Surely your employer pays YOU precisely what you deserve and treats YOU exactly as you should be treated, right?Ya gotta hand it to Rand: the lady has set the standard of megalomania for the entire world. Who else but Ayn Rand could blithely announce in 1965 the end of philosophy, science, and life as we know it for no reason more substantial than that none of them was subservient to the demands of her own cosmos-dwarfing ego? Like Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck, and Ann Coulter, Rand has the temerity to dictate political, economic, and social policy for the whole world, without ever having shouldered the responsibilities of political office or holding a position of executive leadership in any industry, without ever having had to negotiate with labor or anyone else. Never mind that what Rand knew about philosophy and science could be written in large block letters on the back of a postage stamp. Aristotle excepted, she damned every thinker with whom she disagreed about anything. Contradict her in any way, and you were consigned to the flames of perdition. You see, for Ayn Rand there ARE NO opaque epistemic contexts; consequently, there are no such things as honest mistakes, only willful \\"denials of reality.\\" Thus, according to Rand, you're never really wrong about anything---rather, you subscribe out of sheer perversity to views that you know perfectly well to be false.CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL splendidly exemplifies what almost certainly will be dubbed \\"Randyness\\" in the forthcoming psychiatric reference manual DSM-V. Randyness: the persistent delusion that one isn't nearly as stupid as one actually is; a degenerative psychopathology manifest in the professional excreta of Ayn Rand, Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck, and Ann Coulter, of Objectivists and other fanatics generally; characterized by incontinent messianic pronouncements accompanied by a complete disregard of any factor that might inhibit the patient's own grandiosity; a condition for which there is no known cure and for which the only treatment of demonstrated effectiveness is derisive marginalization in all theaters of life, public and private."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"thaks to that other reveiwer who said speling is'nt impotent, capatilism is the gratest sistem ever weather or not we spel it write. but he said second-handers was gonna be the tittle of the fountainhead, he is rong it was gonna be second hand lives.anyway we sure do got to form concepts, i think thats way more impotent then lerning to spel write. capatilism is teriffic and if you do'nt like this book you are a SECOND HANDED."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"With &quot;defenders&quot; of capitalism like Ayn Rand, who needs enemies.

And on what grounds are we to trust a favourable review written by someone who misspells this crucial word every time it appears?If one wishes to learn about capitalism, this is not the book to read. The positive reviews suggest to my own mind that the reviewers have simply not read any other pro-capitalism works.That hypothesis would at least explain the constant misspelling of the very word itself."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"'Capitalism', properly understood, is simply what results when people observe the Ten Utterances.The classical-liberal 'rights to life and property' are simply another way of describing the Torah's prohibitions on murder and theft: your 'right to property' is simply my obligation to refrain from thievery (in *all* its myriad forms!). The goals of both social harmony and 'economic efficiency' are promoted, not by socialists' attempts to redesign human society in conformity with their own corrupt visions, but by observance of the Divine precepts of *justice* - of which prosperity is a beneficent side effect.Unfortunately, Ayn Rand, in her deeply ambiguous relationship with Judaism, saw fit to retain only half the truth - and without G-d at that! She did not regard religion ('mysticism') as the proper foundation for an ethical society - and she therefore replaced the revelation of Sinai with her own secular perversion thereof.But as many 'modern' people are discovering, there is no justice apart from a religious foundation, because on any other foundation there is no reason to think justice is important. If you, my fellow human being, are not made in the image of G-d but are merely an assemblage of molecules thrown together by the happenstance of purely material 'evolution', then why should I respect your so-called 'rights'?And so it becomes clear that the latter six of the Ten Utterances depend firmly on the first four. The proper basis of 'capitalism' is in the rejection of idolatry - and 'Objectivism', being a form of idolatry itself, will not help with that task.'Capitalism' and Divine revelation stand or fall together. A world without G-d was the vision of Marx and Lenin, not of the great classical liberals."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I first read &quot;Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal&quot; as a high-school sophomore in 1969, a couple years after its initial publication.Back in the '60s, it was controversial simply to argue that capitalism was more economically efficient than socialism; to claim, as Rand did, that capitalism was morally superior to socialism was revolutionary.Times have changed. Nowadays it would require an invincible ignorance to believe that socialism can compete economically with capitalism. And to believe that socialism is morally superior to capitalism, now that everyone knows the truth about actually existing socialism in the former Soviet Union, would be morally depraved.Intellectually, the battle is over. Capitalism has won; socialism has lost. Capitalism is no longer an &quot;unknown&quot; ideal.Our new historical situation makes it possible to look more clearly at Ayn Rand's political writings.Rand was unquestionably right about the moral and economic superiority of capitalism.But was she also right about the political, cultural, and historical conditions required to create and preserve a free, capitalistic social order?Rand consistently argued that the motive force of history was ideas. Ultimately, it was intellectuals who control the course of human events.For example, in the second essay in this book, &quot;The Roots of War,&quot; Rand declares:&quot;Just as the destruction of capitalism and the rise of the totalitarian state were not caused by business or labor or any economic interest, but by the dominant statist ideology of the intellectuals -- so the resurgence of the doctrines of military conquest and armed crusades for political 'ideals' were the product of the same intellectuals' belief that 'the good' is to be achieved by force.&quot;In the same essay, she explains that it was not economic interest but rather collectivist intellectuals who pushed America into involvement in both World Wars. (True to her principles, Rand opposed the military draft and the American involvement in Vietnam.)However, Rand and her followers, by focusing on the contribution collectivists have made to militarism have tended to neglect the other side of the coin, the contribution militarism, war, and imperialism have made to advancing the power of government.As Randolph Bourne said, &quot;War is the health of the state.&quot; War provides an unparalleled opportunity for government to increase taxes, expand its control over the economy, suppress civil liberties, and pump up popular faith in the state.While intellectuals facilitated the destruction of Constitutional government in America during the twentieth century, the primary proximate cause of the growth of Big Government was the two World Wars and the Cold War.Rand failed to convey this lesson to her followers, most of whom have supported the current American imperial adventure in the Mideast.What then of Rand's basic analysis of the nature and purpose of government, laid out in two appendices, &quot;Man's Rights&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Government&quot;?Rand defines &quot;government&quot; as &quot;an institution that holds the exclusive power to _enforce_ certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.&quot; Note that government is defined abstractly as &quot;an institution,&quot; even though any actual government must consist of particular, concrete human beings.A couple pages later, Rand declares, &quot;A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control.&quot;Really?Given the historical record of war, militarism, imperialism, rape, pillaging, slavery, taxation, and mass murder in which governments have routinely engaged, is there any &quot;institution&quot; that is _less_ credible as a means of placing &quot;objective control&quot; over &quot;physical force&quot; than government?It would make as much sense to define the Mafia or street gangs as &quot;the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control&quot;!Even the officials of a minimal government, endowed only with a monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions, as Rand advocated, have already, by virtue of that very monopoly, been given powers not possessed by their fellow citizens.Rand argues for a written constitution &quot;as a means of limiting and restricting the power of government.&quot; But of course, it is government officials who will interpret the provisions of the constitution, and they will have both the power and every incentive to use their power so as to evade any restrictions embodied in the constitution.This is not idle speculation. Precisely this experiment was carried out in 1787 in Philadelphia. Two hundred years later, we know the result -- a massively rapacious, militaristic, and imperialistic government which imperils the civil liberties of the American people, buries us in taxes, and claims the right to invade and dominate any other country anywhere in the world.If Madison, Franklin, Washington et al. could not make Rand's program work, it is fair to dismiss her program of limited constitutional government as a Utopian fantasy.A better definition than Rand's would be &quot;a government is a bunch of guys that have managed to get themselves in a position where they can get away with things (bombing, taxation, etc.) that most people could never get away with.&quot; That accurately describes pretty much all governments in the real world (and subsumes Rand's definition of government as a privileged monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions as a special case -- since most ordinary people could not get away with seizing such a monopoly).Of course, any society does need some minimal consensus on how to deal with and generally avoid violent conflict. All human societies do in fact have various means for maintaining the peace, most of which have nothing to do with government. Ask yourself: how many times have you peacefully settled a serious disagreement with a friend, relative, or neighbor without involving the government at all?It is not in the nature of government to be successfully limited. Government has never existed to serve the governed. If we want a free, prosperous, and peaceful society, government must go.For more realistic, less Utopian views on government, I recommend Murray Rothbard's &quot;The Ethics of Liberty,&quot; H. Hoppe's &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed,&quot; and A. John Simmons' &quot;On the Edge of Anarchy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is one of Ayn's best works!

Those who are not sympathetic with laissez-faire will have an entirely different opinion of the book's worth, but that's always the case with partisan political tracts: they appeal only to those who already agree with the views propagated therein. If you agree with Rand's political ideals, this book will seem like manna from heaven. If you don't, you will regard it as jejune rubbish. That is the trouble with ideological political writing: it nearly always amounts to little more than preaching to the choir.As a propagandist, Rand had at least one thing going for her that separated her from pack: she had a \\"vision\\" of things, an ability to see political and social phenomenon in a larger than life frame of reference and to describe and project that vision in incisive and compelling terms. And while there is much in this vision that deserves scientific criticism, one aspect of it really ought to be better appreciated. I have in mind Rand's contention that it is a creative minority that is decisive to the success of the free market, rather than the \\"consumer sovereignty\\" preached by the Austrians. Mark Skousen has challenged Rand's vision of capitalism from the Austrian point of view. But Rand's vision, at least on this issue, comes closer to the facts.It is regrettable that Rand chose to integrate this largely correct vision with an over-romanticized view of business. Her contention that everything \\"bad\\" ever associated with capitalism is either not really bad or is caused by government interference in the market is simply not supported by the historical evidence, if for no other reason that business and politics have always been inextricably connected and that it is a veritable law of society for it to be this way."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Capitalism, by Ayn Rand, is a collection of 26 essays that discuss more than what the title would lead you to believe. Most articles were written by Rand, while a few were penned by others including a much younger Alan Greenspan. Rand opens the book with a chapter called \\"What is Capitalism.\\" Greenspan writes on antitrust law and gold. Economics is rarely exciting, but the authors manage to make in interesting.One editorial review posted on the Amazon.com page for Capitalism states that the book is, \\"An interesting relic of the past,\\" and goes on to call it an \\"outlandish piece of propaganda,\\" but this is actually a classic example of \\"Extremism or the Art of Smearing\\" as explained in Chapter 17. While the liberals at Amazon.com and the Library Journal might consider Rand an outlandish relic of the past, her books logically explains the philosophy and principles upon which our economic system rests. Because we have drifted away from our founding ideals and the government schools no longer teach United States history well, or economics at all, capitalism has become the forgotten ideal and younger generations must seek out their heritage in the books of Ayn Rand and others. That is why these books continue to sell well.Rand was no friend of Judeo-Christian values, but she strongly believed in many values that most Americans once shared, limited government, laissez-faire economics and property rights. If you want a better understanding why these principles made America great you should read this and her other works."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In this collection of essays, Rand shows why capitalism is under attack. Philosophically, the majority of people do not understand capitalism and think it is intrinsically bound with such uncomfortable notions as \\"selfishness.\\" Far from being a cruel ideology that somehow, imperceptibly, oppresses people with material prosperity, capitalism is the doorway away from tyranny, economic enslavement, and political oppression. I highly recommend this read to anyone with an open mind and of a philosophical bent."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand is one of recent history's most prominent defenders of the ideals - and as she would say, morality - of capitalism and the free market. For her it is not a question of wealth, but of individual rights that are protected only by a capitalist system and get trampled by socialism, communism and altuism. Rand's clear thinking is as important today as it has ever been in America's history. It seems the wealthier our country becomes, the harder it is to remember and retain the basis, and the nobility, of the system that brought us that wealth.Even within the reviews of this book there are cries against Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil, but for what? We are constantly fed the idea that they are bad, or malevolent entities, but how? Wal-Mart provides low-cost items to tens of millions of Americans and jobs to untold thousands and yet the story we hear is how the jobs aren't good enough or how local stores have been run out of business. Who is forcing people to take those jobs? Who stops shopping at the local stores when Wal-Mart comes to town? By what right are people owed something more by Wal-Mart? Exxon Mobil puts billions of dollars at risk searching for new energy reserves and for twenty years endured horrible energy prices set by the free market. Now that prices have risen, thery're evil? By what standard? The fact that I preferred $1 gasoline doesn't make the company who provides my gasoline bad.We need constant reminders of the good that business people and businesses do in our society without any charitable intent or giving. Through their very actions and existence, they form the base that allows the rest of our country to function. They cannot exist, however, without policies, freedoms and rights protected by the goverment. That is why Rand's work continues to be critical to our future.This book is intended as Rand's non-fiction compliment to the fictional \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" I don't believe you need to read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to get a lot from this book and this is certainly a less time-consuming option.Very highly recommended.

Talk to any socialist and nothing but dogmatic, demagogic, trumped up, scare mongering claptrap comes out. This book relies on logic to break every possible socialist argument into fragments. A socialist cannot take it for a second as when faced with logic, their argument falls to bits. Rand is wonderfully free of the demagogic mind control that we have gotten used to in our intellectuals. She cuts to the bone. She gets to the point. She hits the nail on the head...

It covers so much ground that it is difficult to list topics, but here goes; \\"There is no direction , no goal, no compass, no vision of the future, no intellectual element of leadership.

Since the introduction of controls necessitates and leads to further controls, it is an unstable, explosive mixture which, ultimately, has to repeal the controls or collapse into dictatorship. A mixed economy has no principles to define its policies, its goals, its laws - no principles to limit the power of its government. The ONLY principle of a mixed economy - which, necessarily, has to remain unnamed and unacknowledged - is that no one's interests are safe, everyone's interests are on a public auction block, and anything goes for anyone who can get away with it..... a mixed economy is rule by pressure groups.

Rand makes her case that the spontaneous natural economic order of free-markets is the only social system conducive to individual liberty and the natural rights. She shreds economic myths and fallacies with her sharp wit and reason. Rand also offers a scathing, yet logical critique of an interventionist state in the economy. Rand pokes reason in the face of her collectivist critics. Collectivist pursuit of economic and social equality has left hundreds of millions dead at hands of totalitarians in the past century. It's no wonder they loathe her every word. Some of her ideas stemming from her concepts of the \\"virtue of selfishness\\" and \\"rationale selfishness\\" are thought-provoking rebuttals to radical egalitarianism, but on the same token, her critique of \\"altruism\\" is rather shallow. The essays by younger Alan Greenspan in the 1960's alone are worth the price of admission. He offered a defense of sound money... yes a pure gold standard and other essays on anti-trust and consumer protectionism. Yet today, he is Fed Chief and head of the central bank, a statist institution which personifies an interventionist socialist state. Has he grown nave about economics with age? Or has he just sold out for power? You be the judge! Beyond this book, I cannot tolerate much if any of Rand's objectivist philosophy, particularly the atheism, materialism and relativism, which isn't overt in this book. Rand's philosophy holds to a materialism on par with Marx and in her zeal against collectivism, she espouses an individualism larger than life.

It is every bit as good as all the others, only it is a non-fiction book and so it is not quite as much fun reading as are Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.In this work, Rand shows how capatilism almost came in to full laisse faire existence in the 19th century, how that brief peoriod of the 19th century was the one and only time in the history of the world when men were able to improve their standard of living by such a tremendous amount, in such a short span of time; All as a result of capatilism, a free, unregulated economy and industry. Rand demonstrates how the liberal's efforts to regulate industry and the economy, both for the supposed &quot;good of society&quot; have since stifled the progress which, in the era of the 19th century, was only in its &quot;budding stages.&quot; Rand shows how the political interests of &quot;liberals&quot; have changed from the time of the new deal, when liberals still had ideas and values, to the present time when all liberals really want is to sieze control of all production, to the demise of not only those who are both producers and taxpayers, but of the supposed benificiaries of the liberals redistributive efforts. Rand demonstrates how not just liberal but altruistic agendas have been at work, through all of recorded history, in all societies of the world's past, attempting to stifle capatilism: (the only system in which man is rewarded for his individual production) by siezing control of the efforts of productive men, thorough regulations and taxation in worthless, grossly inefficent programs of redistribution of &quot;wealth.&quot; Rand lists and disects every common argument against capatilism which you will hear in every day life in the media, from politician, co-workers, and even in university classes. She demonstrates the internal fallacies and omissions within every such argument; This IS one are of the book which may prove to be very enlightning to even the most dedicated supporters of capatilism (of which, I am one). You will find interesting chapters on the interests of communists with regard to capatilism as well as (believe it or not) the interests of Catholics with regard to communism. And how, according to Rand, the Catholic religion formally stated, in the 1960's that it would prefer to see a reversion back to anti-capatilist times; something to the order of the Middle Ages.This is a great book!

WIth the rise of progressivism in the latter part of the 19th Century, our growth rate has been significantly moderated as more and more regulation has interfered with free markets (usually under the claim that the intervention is to &#34;fix&#34; a &#34;market failure&#34;).This book lays out the moral basis of free market capitalism. It further explains that we have never truly had capitalism under completely free markets -- there has always been some level of governmental intervention -- less in the early days of the industrial revolution, more later on, to near strangulation of free markets as we have today. (The U.S. economy is more properly described as a &#34;mixed&#34; economy -- a mixture of free markets and tightly regulated markets that usually distort investment and returns for political reasons.)There are many who disagree with Ayn Rand ... but, strangely, those who disagree often haven't read her actual books, but rather have read critics complaints about her work. This book is worth reading and it will show you how many critics have not &#34;gotten&#34; what she has said. Read it for yourself and make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Excellent book on lasse faire capitalism. This book shows that a truly free capitalist society has never existed. The USA came closest to a free society in our first 150 years. Once the progressives and liberal politicians begin to try to control the economy it has been on a downward spiral. She is very clear that a controlled economy eventually leads to serfdom and tyranny. We are witnessing this transformation now. When you take the time to read this book and see all the liberties that we have given up and the property rights that have been encroached upon by our government your will tremble with fear."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Love the book.It's even more applicable today, then when it was written.I appreciate that Greenspan is in it, and wonder what happened to him."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book changed the way I look at the world and influenced me to become an economist. Check out Alan Greenspan's article about the gold standard, funny considering he became chief of the fed."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Every citizen living in the United States should read this book. Capitalism is all about voluntary exchange and individual liberty. Ayn Rand makes the case in a highly readable and convincing way."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"These collection of essays are what the libertarian view of Capitalism should be and after you're done reading them, you should be well prepared to defend the importance of freedom. So many topics discussed from war, monopolies,gold and unions this book really does cover most of the topics that affect us Americans. What's interesting is the book is not new and reads as if it's quite dated but the truth is the truth no matter how old it gets. I love reading Rand's thoughts and this book, being nonfiction, is right down my alley."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of 26 articles written by Ayn Rand (20 articles total), Nathaniel Branden (2), Alan Greenspan (3) and Robert Hessen (1). The 26 count includes the two articles in the appendix by Ayn Rand: &quot;MAN'S RIGHTS&quot; and &quot;THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT&quot;. I do have one criticism of this book but I will save it until the end here. All 26 articles relate in one way or another to the theme that 100% Laissez-faire Capitalism is the best Political-Economic system for mankind and that this fact is unknown to most people in the World --including most people in the United States. The first 13 articles deal with the THEORY AND HISTORY of Capitalism along with the opening article being true to form Ayn Rand: she defines her terms right away. Here she does it by positing and then answering the question: &quot;WHAT IS CAPITALISM?&quot;. The next 12 articles deal with and destroy so many myths about capitalism that it is probably safe to say that anyone who reads this book will find at least 12 of their own myths about capitalism somewhere within the book. The next 11 articles (#14 through #24) deal with the CURRENT STATE of the United States in the mid 1960's and it is amazing how pertinent and informative these articles still are today. For example, for pertinence see article #20, &quot;THE NEW FASCISM: RULE BY CONSENSUS&quot;, and for the informative see and discover the correct definition of 'freedom' on the first page of the article titled &quot;CONSERVATISM: AN OBITUARY&quot;. There is simply too much good in this book to cover it all in one short review. It is a must read for anyone who is serious about politics and economics. Even if you disagree you will be compelled to think about your own position and attempt to solidify your thoughts about it after reading this book. The two ending (APPENDIX) articles speak for themselves and either alone is worth the price of the book. All the articles in the book were written and copyrighted in the 1960's and the book itself as collection of these articles was first published in 1967. Back then, and this is my only criticism, back then Capitalism WAS an Unknown Ideal, but today thanks to Ayn Rand and others, including the contributors to this book, Capitalism is now the KNOWN ideal, consequently the books title is not quite as accurate as it was when first published."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I was about to buy this book from Amazon.com, until I read the \\"Editorial Review.\\" Amazon[.com] put this on my 'reccomedations' page, as I'm a huge Ayn Rand fan - \\"an advocate of reason, egoism, and capitalism\\". Sadly, on that page was the first few lines of this review! Thank goodness that I *now* know that this book is a \\"relic of the past,\\" and an \\"outlandish piece of propaganda.\\" I think that Mark Pumphrey's assertion that the \\"author's overconfident sense of her own rightness and persistence at pressing her points with little respect for opposing views can quickly become more than a little annoying\\" applies more to that editorial review than to this book, a splendid collection of essays by Ayn Rand, Nathaniel Branden, Robert Hessen, and (the current U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman) Alan Greenspan. This book is more about the moral underpinings of capitalism, the only system in which we are free to choose how to labor, and how to exercise the fruits of that labor; than it is about the economics of capitalism, for which I would reccomend \\"Free to Choose\\" by Milton Friedman, or \\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\\" by Todd G. Buchholz - both available here."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand is not the only person who authored this books' essays. The works of Nathaniel Branden and Alan Greenspan both are worth the price. These two authors do not emphasize the &quot;moral&quot; aspect of capitalism but its bare bones practicalities. And as such nobody has ever been able to shoot their arguments down, on moral grounds or otherwise.In one essay, Branden dissects the criticisms of capitalism during the Industrial Revolution. He shows the relationship between the Industrial Revolution and the Population Explosion. More to the point he shows how Capitalism improved peoples' lives--by providing more sustenance for people to live on.Alan Greenspan's Essay &quot;Gold and Economic Freedom&quot; is a masterpiece frequently quoted elsewhere, but origionates with this book. If you want to know how the Fed kept inflation down throughout Greenspan's reign as Chairman, here's the essence of his philosophy and modus operandi in a few pages. Greenspan also in another essay explains how corrupt monopolies cannot exist--without the help of government.Rand herself, while sometimes going overboard on the &quot;Morality&quot; side, does make some very valid points in two essays in particular: &quot;The Roots of War&quot;, and &quot;Man's Rights.&quot; The theme of both is &quot;being generous with other people's fortunes.&quot; (If I had the ability to take all of your money, I will show you just how compassionate to the world I can be.)In &quot;Roots of War&quot; Rand explains that, outside of voluntary charity there are two ways to acquire something: take it, or swap something for it. Conquest or trade. There is no other option. Government is the agent of conquest, capitalism the agent of trade. She also shows the logical progression of each. In a conquest driven society, the pick pocket beats the honest man, but the robber beats the pick pocket, and the murderer beats the robber. Welfare states are not based on altruism but quite the opposite, and will eventually either collapse or look elsewhere for plunder. In a trade society, those who offer the best value win.In &quot;Man's Rights&quot; she goes over the same concepts as in the Roots of war but more on the individual's level. She also discusses how &quot;Rights&quot; have gone from claims you have on your own life to claims someone else has on your life, and its potential consequences.Finally, &quot;Extremism--or the Art of Smearing&quot;, is a powerful essay on how left-leaning collectivists smear their opponents. Change the names and you've got the exact same thing occuring today, but this essay was written in 1964! Goes to show that the fundamental tactics of collectivists have not changed in at least 35 years.All in all a very good book."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand's *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal* is a rare disccussion of the rudiments of capitalism, how it works, what its benefits are, why it is the only moral system. It is the only book I know of that demonstrates the virtues of capitalism and discusses the roots of such virtues: that wealth is the result of producitivity and that productivity is the result of correctly identifying reality by means of a consitent use of reason. The book also refutes the many attacks on capitalism and the many mistaken evaluations of it. Highly recommended.Sincerely,Sylvia Bokor"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In what is probably her best work of nonfiction, Ayn Rand sets out to provide a _moral_ basis for capitalism, a social/political order in which the human rights to life and property are respected and there are no (other) limitations on freedom of trade. That capitalism is today to some degree a _known_ ideal is in some measure due to the influence of Rand's ideas as represented in this volume.One of this book's great strengths is its inclusion of helpful essays by Nathaniel Branden, Robert Hessen, and Alan Greenspan. This is the _only_ volume of nonfiction published during her lifetime to include essays by anyone other than herself and Branden. It is also the only such book to include a bibliography of recommended reading. (Non-Objectivist works are listed with a caveat that the ideas contained therein may not be fully consonant with Rand's.)And they are more than helpful: their presence suggests _why_ this volume represents Rand's best work. That she was willing and able to include essays by, and references to, other writers surely indicates that she was confident enough in her own views to acknowledge her need for supplementation outside her own areas of strength.In my own view, Rand was a first-rate political thinker, a pretty good ethicist, a lousy epistemologist, and not a metaphysician at all to speak of. (In the latter three fields, she would have profited from closer attention to the writings of Brand Blanshard, whom she respected highly despite some disagreements. _The Letters of Ayn Rand_ indicates that he sent her a signed copy of _Reason And Goodness_ when it was published.) Her philosophy is at heart an attempt to ground her defense of capitalism in ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics, and it becomes gradually less successful the further she wanders from her strengths.But in political theory, she was on firm ground -- and she knew it. And in this collection of essays she is at her best, arguing that the only proper function of government is the protection of individual rights, that individual rights are the only kind there are, that apparent failures of the free market are actually failures of the _government_ to restrict itself to its proper role, and generally, that capitalism is the only economic system fully consonant with man's nature as a value-seeking agent who survives and thrives through the application of reason to reality.So if you plan to read one nonfiction work by Rand, this is the one to read. If she sparks your interest, then go on to read the flawed but helpful _Philosophy: Who Needs It_ and _The Virtue Of Selfishness_.Then stop, unless you're just morbidly curious. Her works in epistemology and aesthetics do not measure up to the standards set in these collections and are of interest largely for the chroniclers of the bizarre personality cult that grew up around her. To find out about _that_, read Jeff Walker's idiosyncratic but interesting _The Ayn Rand Cult_."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Along with \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt, this is the best introduction I know to the topic of Capitalism and economics. With all the baloney out there, this book will give you the essential moral perspective and help guide you in fighting the anti-Capitalism fallacies we are all bombarded with on a daily basis, in America and around the world. The Appendix with \\"Man's Rights\\" is essential reading for everyone. Ayn Rand clarifies the basis for rights and why only the system of laissez faire Capitalism respects the rights of the individual, by taking the initiation of force out of human relationships. I have only read portions of George Reisman's lengthier book \\"Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics\\" which was influenced by Ayn Rand's thinking, but what I read added further insight and solid evidence of the rightness of Capitalism for human life."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The only \\"outlandish piece of propaganda\\" about this book is the Library Journal's unabashed hit-piece pseudo-review of it on this website. The essence of capitalism is a political-economic system based on individual rights where all property is owned privately. If you wish to engage in thought about the authentic meaning of capitalism, read Ayn Rand's articles in this book, then if you decide to reject capitalism for statism, do so with the full knowledge of what capitalism is and be prepared to take the consequences for selling your soul."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Have you ever felt that there is something wrong with the world, but haven't been able to put your finger on exactly what it is? This book will do it for you. Ayn Rand, along with some interesting additions by Nathaniel Branden and Alan Greenspan, shows you how deep the rabbit hole really goes. This book is a collection of articles addressing the application of capitalism as a political system, or rather the lack of it, and consequently the inevitable demise of humanity due to the implementation of collectivist, anti-capitalist policies. By exploring different parts of society and the application of collectivist policies that govern us, Ayn Rand basically explains why collectivism (i.e. socialism) is the root to all evil.If you are looking for a book about Ayn Rand's ideas and philosophy of life, and are reluctant to engage in her lengthy, fictional novels like Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Although this book was written many years ago, it rings true for today's issues. The book is made up of multiple (25 or so) mini essays, each about 5-10 pages long.The book has a clear and logical philosophy that is consistent. Its' basic premise is that pure capitalism is the first and only moral system for man. This is because capitalism equals freedom which frees a man from coercive oppression, and that man can only create wealth and new ideas when free to use his mind. The book states that the US briefly came close to pure capitalism in the 1700 and 1800s, but is now heading to fascism, as the state leaves property in private ownership, but the state controls output and use of the private property.This book is the best I've read in several years, because it helped me unify my outlook on several fronts (political, economic, legal, social, etc) into one grand, consistent theory. I think this book will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike. Both are damned in this book by Rand, but I think the left, right, and center will recognize parts of Rand's philosophy that are dear to them too.Read it for yourself to see, the book is cheap."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"All right we all know that greedy Capitalists are the cause of all the problems everywhere. People are poor and have nothing to eat because some CEO wants another Million dollars. Honest, Hardworking people are driven to crime because of others greed.Ok think again. This book dispels all of the myths our public school education system and other liberal groups have put out for years. It also embraces Capitalism as not only the best economic model but also the only ethical one in existence.If you read this with an open mind there are many things you will take away from it. Some of the myths that will be dispelled are: Monopolies are always bad, Unions protect workers, War is good for business, and many more.This book is absolutely essential if you find yourself defending Capitalism from Communists, Socialists, Liberals, and other Statists that believe they are entitled to the fruits of labor of other people."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand's legacy is that of an intellectual giant, a force du monde, who riveting impassioned essays provoked thought to the West as Plato did in Ancient Greece. A black and white thinker, Rand wholly embraced her adopted country and its capitalist system. The greatest sin for Rand was for people to join a collective mind and be robbed for their ability to become a giant in their own right. Though the naive setiment lacks complexity of circumstance, Rand dared to challenge people to aim for the stars without apology."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The editor's Ellsworth Toohey (Fountainhead villain)type 'review' of the book should be completely ignored.This book is fantastic."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"A word of warning! Those who value emotion over reason should proceed with caution while reading this book. Guilt and envy will surely raise their ugly heads for those unwilling to admit and accept that they exist off the efforts of others."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Being a collection of essays written in the 1960s by Objectivist, novelist and non-academic philosopher Ayn Rand and certain of her like-minded associates (including Alan Greenspan, prior to his arrival at the Fed), this book reads in part as a reasoned exposition of the moral and philosophical foundations of an ideal capitalist society based on individual rights and freedom, and in part as an emotionally charged, pejorative criticism of modern society for being misguided, amoral and a-philosophical.Ever wonder what's behind the truly remarkable economic success of the U.S. over the past two centuries? Ms. Rand explains that the U.S. began as the &quot;first moral society in history,&quot; uniquely founded on a Constitution that explicitly places limitations on government while guaranteeing the rights of private individuals. According to her thinking, inherent in man's nature (metaphysics) is his faculty of reasoning (epistemology). Only through having the freedom (politics) to reason, judge, choose and act can man exercise his individual rights (ethics), including his economic rights to acquire property and trade it freely with others. The purpose of government (police, armed services and court system) in laissez faire capitalism is reduced to that of protector of individual rights.As the authors' analysis goes, it is no surprise that the individual rights and freedom on which capitalism is based vaulted the U.S. economy ahead of all others in the world during the 19th and 20th centuries. However, as advocates of pure laissez faire capitalism instead of today's mixed economy (i.e., laissez faire capitalism mixed with government controls), the authors find themselves at odds with virtually everyone else--liberals, conservatives, altruists, collectivists, academic philosophers, pragmatists, logical positivists, the press, Berkeley activists, the Federal Reserve (note the irony of Greenspan as longstanding Fed Chairman), and the Pope. The authors even chide the business community for compromising capitalism by supporting antitrust legislation, the Sherman Act, in 1890.The authors' ideal society is an as-yet-unrealized world with no antitrust laws, no government intervention in the capital markets, neither tariffs nor subsidies, no compulsory education for children, no minimum wage laws, no inheritance tax, privatization of communication airwaves, no building codes, no FDA, no SEC, etc. Could such a world with moral law placed above society (&quot;No society is better than its philosophical foundation&quot;) reasonably lead, as the authors insist, to a higher standard of living, more prosperity and more fulfilling lives for all of us? If so, they've got quite a tantalizing proposition, at least in theory. . . ."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Many of us have been brought up on the idea that capitalism is a system which promotes the domination and exploitation of others by those in pursuit of personal gain. This is not capitalism, it is gangsterism. Capitalism is a philosophy which promotes the right of the free individual to trade with other free individuals without hindrance from the state.To criticise this book in a negative way is difficult, since neither I nor anybody else has lived in a society based on capitalism. But I have lived in a capitalistic society within the bounds of the United Kingdom. My observation is that the parts of the United Kingdom that tend more towards capitalism are more successful and prosperous than those parts that are not: the southeast of England being the greatest exemplar. Taking a step further, the United States of America with its greater capitalistic tendencies, is demonstrably more successful and prosperous than the United Kingdom.The clarity of the book is helped by the many examples provided by Ayn Rand and her contributors. Some of these are a bit historical for today&#65533;s readers, and the piece on what a patent applies to has been superseded by the recent allowing of patents for discoveries relating to human and animal gene sequences. A few examples from recent and ongoing state activity would be as follows:Cuba is regarded by the IMF as the best example of a third world country doing comparatively well by first world standards. But Cuba doesn&#65533;t have to be a third world country. Cuba has the human resources to compete perfectly well with the first world if the state were not in total control, as the enterprising Cubans who moved elsewhere have demonstrated.Zimbabwe has been reduced to a state of hopelessness and starvation because of gangsterism promoted by the state. Even more developed countries like India and Pakistan are borderline cases because their states choose to fritter away in excess of a hundred million dollars a year fighting each over Kashmir, instead of promoting a way for their people to take part in capitalism, and so improve their circumstances. The Palestinian situation is another example where the lack of a capitalist philosophy is creating so much trouble, its leadership preferring to loot and mooch, and gallivant in luxury around the world instead of staying at home and sorting things out.Where I come from, the economy is totally dependant on handouts from the British Government. This mean that anyone with sense and enterprise has to leave the province because the sources of start-up capital are too busy mooching from the gravy-train of government handouts and other sources of handouts from Europe and the United States ( the international fund for Ireland and the peace process dividend to name two ). And the so called Celtic-Tiger isn&#65533;t too far behind.In England the travelling public and commerce are benefiting from the fiasco that was the piece-meal privatisation of the rail system. This mess has come home to roost with a vengeance, and all because the private operators were being relentlessly interfered with and have ended up as the whipping boy for the state, which should have kept its hands off and let the competitive process do its work. The only good thing, so far, is that Steven Byers, the current transport secretary, got his butt kicked by the City.Not content with that the education system is to be partially privatised and interfered with. So again, the private part will take the fall for the state.And the Millennium Dome, what a mess that was. All they would have to have done was leave it be and run the thing as a leisure attraction under its in-place management for a couple more years. After all, the whole site has lain empty for that long, at a cost of a million pounds a month. But then the sate can afford to waste that kind of money, since its not theirs.Capitalism, as defined in this book, would seem to offer a better way forward than what is currently draining the life blood from the more civilised parts of the world."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Why didn't I read this in high school? Probably because I went to a government school. It is such a shame that so many people in the US know virtually nothing about capitalism and why it is the ONLY moral basis for a government.In school I was taught that FDR was the savior of the United States in the 30's. If you want to know what REALLY happened to cause the Great Depression read this book (hint: the government did it!).The fact that our government *allows* capitalism to exist in any form is the only reason we have such a high standard of living in the US. Read this book and you'll begin to see how much better off we'd be with Laissez-Faire capitalism.*sigh*"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"For those who have not given Atlas Shrugged a shot, perhaps intimidated by its girth, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal seems to summarize its best points. While I don't consider myself a true objectivist--I am one of the mixed up individuals who CAN advocate 100% lasse-faire free market policy and yet entertain the idea of a realm &quot;beyond the grave&quot;--Capitalism spends its time advocating (mostly) the areas where objective concepts can work. Ayn demonstrates the roots of war, persecution of big business, child labor, copyrights, leftist student rebellion, and &quot;extremism&quot;. Also, ironic commentary by the market &quot;bubble popper&quot; himself, Alan Greenspan, show how much a man can change in 30 years, as he blasts antitrust laws and the abolition of the gold standard. All in all, this collection of ideas will really make one realize exactly why Tom Daschle can persuade 1/2 the American public that the rich are getting more tax returns than they deserve in thirty seconds (Lexus and Muffler). Logic and reason cannot win without the facts--our society doesn't have time for the facts. The Keyensian socialism that is running rampant in government economics and university economic departments MUST be aware that their policies are simply illogical &quot;band-aid on broken leg&quot; policy--it is an ideological philosophy that is shared among them. All in poverty is better than wealth discrepency. One quote shown throughout this our history (and this book) is simply &quot;At the cost of WHOM?&quot;. Keep that in mind when watching both our lefties and righties and their great new programs offerred (clips for 30 seconds) on your local news."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is the best of Rand's non-fiction. In addition, it contains two articles by Alan Greenspan. Most strangely, in &quot;Gold and Economic Freedom&quot;, he argues that the federal reserve is unnecessary, immoral, founded on a misunderstanding of economics, distructive to freedom and wealth, exists primarily to support chronic deficit spending and the welfare state, and was the cause of the great depression. That's right, our current Fed Head!"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"After taking an Intro to Business class in college and having learned only about communism and socialism and that capitalism was the root to all evil, I started to question a lot of things. If the US is founded on capitalism, does that mean that the US is the root of all evil? Of course the answer is no!If you're interested in learning some of the facts about what capitalism is and should be, this is the book you want to pick up. This book should be required reading in college business, law, and all government classes. Ayn Rand covers all aspects of capitalism in a very organized, logical way. This book is very easy to understand and is clearly and concisely written. It is a must have if you want to pick up anything about capitalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is a great followup read to Atlas Shrugged!

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Since I am a trained economist I dislike garbage written by charlatans who doesn't have a clue about social scientific methods. This is far from the worst I have seen but nevertheless has little merit in showing the virtues of capitalism.Take an introductory course in Economics instead!!! Another thing that bothers me are the cult-like properties of Objectivism. In Rand's books her followers find justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is supposedly derived from &quot;reason&quot;. In the real world however there is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that &quot;altruism&quot;, i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method. And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Rand is easily my favorite 20th century thinker. However, as time has passed, I've grown slowly disattached from her theories, called Objectivism. Re-reading her works, such as Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, has the effect of focusing one's thinking, removing some of the unnecessary complications that have piled up since one last picked up one of Rand's books.This is not to say everything in Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal is true, or that it is even well said. Rand was a good non-fiction writer, but by no means the best essayist of the twentieth century. If you're looking for non-fiction rhetorical style, look elsewhere. She writes clearly, and the writers strongly, cutting out most of the graft and unnecessary details, with the benefit of presenting a philosophy with simple principles, easily understood by the most casual reader. Still, the brilliance of Rand best shines through in her fiction. Read The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged to get a sense of why people, instead of simply respecting her, are devoted to her.If you're new to Rand, I recommend reading her non-fiction first, and to read Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal first among the non-fiction. If you like it or dislike it, you'll be ready to move on to Rand's fiction with a better ability to question the themes she argues in her works."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"\\"Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his mind,his life,his work and its products- or is he the property of the tribe(the state,the society,the collective) that may dispose of him in any way it pleases,that may dictate his convictions,prescribe the course of his life,control his work and expropriate his products?Does man have the Right to exist for his own sake-or is he born in bondage, as an indentured servant who must keep buying his life by serving the tribe but can never acquire it free and clear?\\"These are beautiful words that relate with me and my thinking and It is RATIONAL,the book is for rational People, A Must for Conservatives and Political Junkies.

MARCH 26, 1967,she then goes on to rant about how Barbaric the Church is and That St Augustine was Against people being their own and that St Thomas Aquinas was the only one she admires in some words.Sadly As A Catholic it bothered me(Not because it's true) and the fact that she was an Amoral or Immoral Atheist does not help her arguments in the last chapter.Despite this setback the book is an excellent defense and seething rebuttal to common myths and outright lies about Capitalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This volume by Rand and her allies at the time, Alan Greenspan, and Nathaniel Branden, is excellent. Rand's articles show how the only moral political and economic system is capitalism. Property rights, reason and rational thought are what has freed man from the shackles of mysticism, superstition, and religious tyranny. The best articles are Branden's \\"Alienation\\" in which he points out the fallacies of the anti modern ideals of Erich Fromm's \\" The Art of Loving\\". Fromm is exposed as an admirer of the Dark Ages and pines for the ideals of collectivism. Another great article is Rand's \\" The Roots of War\\" in which she condemns the Vietnam War and the draft. She rightly points out the futility of Vietnam and the slavery that the draft creates. She smashes the ideals of conservative collectivism in her article \\" Conservatism: An Obituary\\" by show the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of conservatism. She exposes the conservative worship of \\"tradition\\" and \\"order\\". She also ridicules the weak and sorry defenses that conservatives state for capitalism, and freedom.

Something about Force and Mind; Morality ending and the Gun beginning...I found this to be one of the more easily available non-fiction works from Rand, and the contributing writers are well known indeed.

While providing some very distinct insights into objectivist philosophy, Rand's more notable works (Fountainhead, Atlas, Anthem, etc.) paint the incredible picture of Objectivism in Action. In 'Capitalism' we find the true possiblities of an unadulterated free-market economy spelled out in none too technical text. Given an un-addled mind, and an active imagination, one can think these ideas through to fruition. But, through the fictional works, we can see the 'final product' of an objectivist outlook, and what it means to the future of mankind.Too often do we find examples of moral philosophy rotting between two covers, never to see the 'real' world. It is my fear that this is what has happened in this work. Too many have picked it up, read it, and said \\"To what end?\\" without proper answer. Some might say that most who read it would be lacking in the ability to see the application of these ideas. Perhaps it is that in today's world of fad morality, the impact can better be had through the use of the readers imagination and mind; Allowing them to convince themselves of the grand possibilities of the human spirit, by seeing it enacted within a fictional work."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"yes 2008 caused by clinton fannie freddy n barney not wall styes mass produced housing can be a realityyes we can forget oil and go atomic, hek we made 104 atomic stations in 70s yes we can do better and shoot waste into sunyes the democrats are wrong about everythingyes madcow n stewert are moronsyes unions had no hand in high living standardyes the robber barons never existed only men of abilityyes philosophy is the answerfun fun readwill nuke all the green crony ideas in your headyou will come to see how str8 marraige should endprositution should be legaland unregulated free market make poor rich quickly"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is a great fountain of ideas, good ideas, unfortunatelly so far from mainstream beliefs.... but so true and beatifull. Ayn Rand has a brillant mind to frame the real basis of capitalism and it morality, I strongly reccomend it"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In my view, Ayn Rand's popularity during her heyday had much less to do with the quality of her writing or her thinking than the fact that the demand for writing in support of capitalism and individual liberty was much greater than the supply. She was born in Russia and was 12 when Lenin became the Soviet dictator and her father lost her pharmacy. When she finally arrived in 1926, she stayed and got some work in Hollywood as an extra and a script reader. She wrote some scripts and published her famous novella \\"Anthem\\" in 1938. By mid century she published the best selling books \\"The Fountainhead\\" (1943), which became a movie with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal in 1949, and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" (1957). She attracted a great deal of attention from the public and gathered some talented disciples.This book is a collection of essays by Rand as well a few of her more compelling disciples such as Alan Greenspan (yes, that Alan Greenspan), Nathaniel Branden, and Robert Hessen. The focus of this book is on the morality of Capitalism and, in my view is a mixed bag. Of course, I think that of all of Rand's writing. She is a compelling polemicist when attacking collectivism and on the righteousness of economic freedom and political liberty. When she extends her thinking to matters such as religion, altruism, copyrights, and patents things get much weaker. In other words, she is compelling the first few steps in arguing for capitalism, but when trying to use her ideas to create a society she becomes to narrow in her views. Her \\"objectivism\\" and focus on self becomes a hammer she uses to hit everything else as if it were a nail.Rand is still influential and controversies still surround her life and thought. For many people, she is a phase they go through when first coming to understanding their rights as individuals and free economic beings. However, few stay with her thinking for a long period of time. Some do, but most do not. I don't think you can recognize the Alan Greenspan in these pages with the policies he espoused as Chairman of the Fed (regardless of how you regard his tenure).If you are interested in Rand's political writing, this is a decent read, but I advise you to bring more than a pinch of salt as you read it. While some of her writing is powerful and persuasive, make sure you consider its implications before you jump on her bandwagon.Personally, I much prefer the conservatism of William F. Buckley Jr., Russell Kirk, and Whittaker Chambers, to name just a Conservatives who did battle with her during her period of greatest fame. Do NOT let anyone try to hang her around your neck as a foundational conservative thinker. She is not. She considered herself her own school (and her claims to being the greatest philosopher of all time have only become more laughable as the decades pass) and is not part of the conservative mainstream in American political thought. Reagan came out of Kirk and Buckley much more than out of Rand.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The essence of this short book is to show that capitalism is the only social system consonant with man's nature as a rational being. Rand validates capitalism by showing that it is good in practice BECAUSE it is good in theory, i.e., the moral is the practical."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The argument of many reviews below -- that many of Rand's supporters accept all of her ideas like cults accept kool-aid -- is well taken. I have noticed that this is often the case. However, two points of note: (1) The fact that some individuals buy capitalism hook-line-and-sinker wihtout understanding it or giving fair thought to its objections is not, in itself, an argument against a free-market. (2) the same could also be said of those who -- knowingly or unknowingly -- advocate the welfare state.Although this book is not to be seen as the end-all in the capitalism-socialism debate, it does give sharp points to anyone wishing to defend capitalism. While incorporating some of the arguments presented here, I have soundly demonstrated short-comings in the political position of many of my sparring partners. Many of my opponents -- and Rand discusses this point in detail -- are totally unprepared for a confident, calm, and intelligent thinker prepared to debate laisssez-faire capitalism. Often, when a socialist's first wave of arguments are answered, there follows is a hasty retreat into moral relativism, the impotence of reason, and all other sorts of curious, slippery positions. The debate between capitalism and socialism is no where near as one-sided as many socialists wish to think."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book contains essays in defence of capitalism from a variety of writers, not only from Ayn Rand herself.This book was one of the first books I read in the field of philosophy, and especially in the field of political philosophy. I do admit that the arguments in the book may sound extremely convincing at a first glance, and they made me a confessing objectivist for approximately one year.That is, however, the most dangerous aspect of a book like this one. After I gained an interest in philosophy, much thanks to Ayn Rand, I started reading books by other philosophers and the more I read the more I realized the total emptiness and nonsense-character of Ayn Rand's philosophy. Her ethics, for example, say absolutely nothing except that you ought to behave in any manner you like, as long as you do not harm (by physical force) anyone's right to life and property. In other words, two completely contradicting actions in a given situation (for example saving the life of a drowning child contra not saving his/hers life) may both be argued for and defended with help of Ayn Rand's ethics.I do not intend to go into more depth in my critique here (I know the above argument regarding saving a child may be subject to a discussion since it is not waterproof in the form as it is presented above). The worst aspect of Ayn Rands philosophy is not her ethics however, but the most harmful aspect is the DOGMATISM it represents, and it's irrational faith in absolute truth.For readers interested in political philosophy, this book is definitely worth reading, but not because its greatness, but rather as a warning against fanaticism and dogmatism which are aspects intrinsically interwoven in Rand's philosophy. For those of you who believe in liberalism and the freedom of man I would recommend the books by Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek, two philosophers who differs significantly from Rands semi-intellectual dogmatism and who provides a much better defence of the free and open society."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Great book, but the cover is insulting. A pile of quarters? How does that represent Ayn Rand's message? The earlier edition had striking, gloriously stylized, inspiring art on the cover. This one has a plain, naturalistic pile of quarters to represent the vision of an idealist and a passionate romantic? If Ayn were alive, she'd read the publisher the riot act over this cover."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"PERIOD! Aristotle, Locke, Mill, Spencer, stand aside...this is it--the ultimate defense of freedom and REAL liberalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand espouses man's contribution to society, the value of his work. Rand is not a communist and believes redistribution of the wealth is a form of slavery............true that.When one works for oneself, it benefits all of society. Force a man to work for the \\"betterment of man\\" and it is slavery. I know I would my butt off to keep my family clothed and fed, but I am not going to kill myself to keep the guy down the street living large and not not working nearly as hard as I. Helloooooooooooooo.Free markets!The review by the Library Journal is Communist propaganda. Rand is brilliant."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The \\"Library Journal\\" review really captures this book's defects. Let me state from the outset that I believe capitalism is the best of all economic systems, but that doesn't mean I close my eyes to its deficiencies, of which there are plenty. Rand merely totes the capitalist party line without any critical eye to some of its inherent problems. Even master-capitalists Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek are not blinded by their fondness for capitalism the way that Rand is. Capitalism, and its concomitant minimal governmental intrusion, are to be commended, but in the way that critically evaluates both its virtues and vices, and Worldcom is just the most recent case of its vices. At least Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek recognize its vices, and, while acknowledging them, still demonstrate why capitalism is the superior system -- giving copious reasons and examples of why this is true. They also detail the vices of its antagonist, socialism, in a way that seems to elude Rand. Read these other important writers for a thorough examination of capitalism, not Rand's dogmatist's appeal based on hyper-rationality."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is truly a terrific book if you want to learn more about what capitalism really is.

Implicit in our logic, says this somebody, is the view that if we could just spell everything correctly, we'd be able to handle anything and everything that came our way. We obviously neglect the &quot;conceptual&quot; level of consciousness.Has this reviewer actually _read_ any Ayn Rand? On Rand's view of concept-formation, all of our concepts are built up from perception. Somebody who's too stupid to _perceive_ hasn't exactly gotten off to a great start.It's this reviewer himself (or herself?) who is actually using bad logic. Correct spelling may be a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one, for clear thinking. We supporters of Good Spelling Habits don't confuse necessary and sufficient conditions: your mental life may not be completely in order even if you're a good speller, but it's undoubtedly a shambles if you can't even spell the title and central key word of a book you _just read_.By the way, this isn't a great book but it's not bad. (Among other things, Rand was a _fine_ speller.) So I give it two stars."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"...but this book does a terrible job of expressing it.This compilation of essays, including contributions by young (read: pre-Fed) Alan Greenspan, supposedly extols the virtues of capitalism. Unfortunately, this ain't what Capitalism is about.I am a very strong believer that democracy, coupled with capitalism and a free market economy, is the most stable platform yet devised for economic growth and equitable distribution of wealth. Francis Fukiyama's well known book The End of History and the Last Man is repetitive and verbose, but it does a good job of developing this idea. Capitalism works.Unfortunately, in this book Rand takes positive, solid concepts like free markets and trade and takes them to a lunatic fringe extreme that turns them into nutty anti-government caricatures.The most disturbing, perhaps, are the essays written forty years ago by Alan Greenspan, who is now chairman of the Federal Reserve' arguably the most powerful man in the United States of America. In an article entitled 'The Assault on Integrity' he argues (correctly) that reputation is an important competitive advantage for corporations, and that they will act responsibly in order to protect this competitive advantage. He then takes this simple concept and extends it to the unsupportable conclusion that regulation by government entities in *any* fashion is unnecessary.Oh what a difference a few decades makes; as the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Greenspan has now grown up to be the most powerful regulator in the world. We also know, of course, that the views which he espoused in the Integrity essay are pure nonsense. Left to their own devices for-profit corporations will often choose short term gains even if by doing so they take the risk of damaging their long term reputation. Corporate management reports to the shareholder, and the shareholder is focused on quarter-to-quarter performance. If a drug company can release a new product, or an oil giant can initiate a new project, they'll do so if they think it will boost the stock price. If the product turns out to be faulty, or an oil spill results ' well they'll cross that bridge when they come to it.The situation becomes even more problematic when you consider the fact that the shareholders - the true owners of any corporation - don't actually run the business. Day to day operations are entrusted to a cadre of professional managers. Greenspan's thesis states that any entity will do \\"the right thing\\" because of a natural desire to maintain their reputation, but this theory obviously falls apart when the owners aren't truly calling the shots. Obviously Ken Lay (Enron) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) weren't worried too much about running their respective companies' reputations into the ground; they were too busy enriching themselves at society's expense. Even Jack Welch, GE's highly regarded CEO and Wall Street's icon of managerial responsibility, has suffered some unflattering attention as of late. Yes, society needs to establish some rules, and make these guys follow them.Okay, okay: hindsight is 20/20 and yes it is easy to debunk old theories as wrong based on new information. Greenspan did not have a crystal ball forty years ago, and to his credit he's changed his tune. Indeed we could all stand to learn a thing or two from Alan; old theories need to be reevaluated, and when events prove them wrong they need to be discarded.Capitalism and free trade are both concepts that are positive for society. Unfortunately, this book is awful - full of outdated and incorrect ideas. If you want a book which gives a rational treatment of the many virtues of capitalism, Rand is an author to avoid. I can only hope that if/when Greenspan looks back at these essays that he contributed back in the early sixties that he gets a shudder of embarrassment. Ayn Rand has a fiercely loyal following and I know that this review won't make me any new friends, but capitalism and free markets are good concepts that get a bad treatment in this book. Bad economics. Bad science. Bad philosophy. Rand's devout might enjoy it, but readers simply looking for a balanced treatment of capitalism will want to skip this one."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is a great way to get a better understanding of the moral and practical virtues of capitalism while on the move."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In a well organised sequence of essays Ayn Rand and contributors shake the misconceptions that still prevail about what capitalism is and what it does. Simply put it means the removal of force from human relations (whether by mugger or government) so that people deal with one another based upon reason and free association. Sound good? It is, unless you want control over other people, or access to things they make!Being free to think and act (not forcing others) means owning the produce of that thinking and acting, ie property. Without the right to the product of your thinking and acting why think and act? What happens inder those conditions is well demonstrated by the impoverished communist nations like Cuba.Rand analyses each topic with the same insight and logic, debunking myths and exposing fraudulent ideologies - its a fascinating journey, often challenging.Definately a must have for anyone interested in liberty, in politics and in how some nations became rich, whilst others did not."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Perhaps one of the most powerful defenses of capitalism yet written, this book explodes most criticism of it. In a series of well-written essays (including some by now-Fed chairman Alan Greenspan) it is demonstrated that almost all of capitalism's flaws are actually the result of statist manipulations. My primary reason for rating it only as an &quot;8&quot; is that some of the cultural references have become a bit obscure over the past thirty years. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The essays in this book differ from those in many of Rand's other works because of its accessibility. Although many Objectivists will tell you to start elsewhere, I find that this book has many great arguments for capitalism that the lay man will understand, so START HERE FOR AYN RAND'S NON-FICTION.Another remarkable feature of the book is its historical perspective. I was hesitant, at first, to get this book because the articles are written from the late forties to late sixties, however, the timeless quality of the articles really shine through. They are so well put together that they stand the test of time. Contributing author Alan Greenspan was the longest sitting chairman of the Fed, so that alone is enough to understand the importance that this book has for current and past economic policy in the United States.Unlike many other essay collections, this book has a great progression of essays. You can read this book from start to finish, always adding onto the ground established by \\"What is Capitalism\\" until the entire picture opens up before you."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book contains an excellent collection of essays on the political branch of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and is appropriate for anyone seeking to obtain a deeper understanding of her political philosophy beyond reading her novels. A few of my favorite essays contained within include:* What is Capitalism? -- Ayn Rand's delineation of Capitalism as a political system where individuals live according to the Trader Principle and have a minimal, but central government to prevent the initiation of physical force and fraud.* Antitrust -- Alan Greenspan's excellent essay that attacks Antitrust legislation as subjective, harmful and immoral.* Gold and Economic Freedom -- Alan Greenspan's essay on the need for objective currency. In particular, he suggests a return to a 100% gold standard.* Patents and Copyrights -- Ayn Rand's views on the necessity and morality of intellectual property rights.* Theory and Practice -- Ayn Rand's views on the invalidity of the \\"Mind-Body Dichotomy\\", which is also known as the \\"Theory-Practice Dichotomy\\" or the \\"Thought-Action Dichotomy\\".* The Wreckage of the Consensus -- Ayn Rand's views on the debacle that was the war in Vietnam. In my opinion, reading this essay really suggests how she would view the current war in Iraq.* Man's Rights -- in this essay, Ayn Rand discusses what individual rights are and where they come from. Specifically, she argues that rights come from the nature of man (not from divine origin, society or law) and what they mean in practice.* The Nature of Government -- this essay contains Ayn Rand's view on government's as an agency of force, how the only proper purpose for a government is to safeguard the rights of men, how the only legitimate functions of government are those necessary to preserve individual rights (i.e., police force, army and a court system) and the necessity for a strong, central government to serve as a final arbiter on the use of retaliatory force. This last point is in stark contrast to various anarcho-capitalists such as David Friedman and Murray Rothbard."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"After communist regime after communist regime has collapsed around the world, while the capitalistic countries have prospered and been there to assist the victims of communism time and time again, how many people really understand WHY? That understanding is a matter of life and death, and this book explains it and why."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I find it strange that a reviewer would post that \\"Capitalism is Wrong\\" while typing it on a computer and sending it across an Internet to a website that is built on the back of that \\"evil\\" word. Do you see the contradiction?Those that actually read the book would have grasped the essential statement she made which was that she was not primarily an advocate of Capitalism, but of reason. Capitalism was just the natural conclusion.In any case, the collection of essays presented here are an excellent example of historical evidence as well as philosophical reasoning behind the idea that Capitalism is the only moral political system in existence.That may shock many potential buyers of the book, but Rand et al present a series of compelling arguments backed up with historical evidence that spans the nation's history to prove their point: Never, not once in America's history, did free enterprise capitalism ever cause ANY of the economic problems that have plagued this country. From the railroads, to the child labor laws, to antitrust regulations...all were caused by Government regulation and interference in the free market. It is a conclusion that one must read and study to believe."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Ayn Rand has a refreshingly frank, &quot;tell it like it is&quot; style of writing. I can understand that it may seem a little &quot;preachy&quot; to some, but you cannot deny the logic and intelligence of her ideas. All it requires is for people to think long and hard about it. An example of the logic: If you leave people to do whatever they want to do, whether it is working to make a profit or helping others, or both, they will do it better through personal choice than through coercion. You can see it in microcosm with the way individuals intereact with each other - whether it be trade or any other type of interaction. If it ever appears otherwise, that means there are other factors involved. Economics and politics have been popularly portrayed as much more complex than they really are, to confuse people and to keep people ignorant. I recommend this book to anyone, for expressing the simplicity of these areas of knowledge."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Having been a fan of Ayn Rand since reading Atlas Shrugged, I eagerly dove into this volume. In a word---OUTSTANDING.

It may not only change your thinking, but also change your life."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"For the longest time I was against Capitalism. I had it all wrong. This book opened my eyes. I thought it was based on greed, but now I know it is based on competition. Now I see that this is what our forefathers were going for, and now I can understand why. But our Capitalist country has been taken away from us, bit by bit, starting with Roosevelt's New Deal. We voted for all the wrong things, and our representatives never stopped to explain to us that we were wrong. They liked the power. Now we have given them the power to be fascists. I just wish Ayn had written a book to teach us how to take back the mess we've made for ourselves. Sigh."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"The first thing you should know before buying this book is that it is a book of philosophy, not an economic treatise. In a nutshell, Rand defends Capitalism as the most moral system because it is the only one that fully respects property rights. Without property rights, no other rights are possible, and most of our economic and social problems stem from violations of individual and property rights.Most of the criticisms of this book overlook the fundamental theme. It is very possible you may not care for the way Rand presents her arguments, or dislike certain terms she uses. But if you don't like the salesman's presentation, don't blame the merchandise.Rand's views were highly influenced by the Austrian School of thought in economics, so if it is an economic treatise you're looking for, I suggest you start with the writings of Ludwig Von Mises, F.A. Hayek, or Murray Rothbard."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal is one of the most fascinating publications I have ever read. In it, Rand affirmed a strong belief in self-improvement through rational thinking and to place a higher priority on reasoning ability as opposed to having oneself guided by mere whims or emotions that have no foundational bases supporting them.It is quite noble how Rand tried to enforce the theme that for one to live life fully, every action must have a guided reason as much as possible. Living according to the dictates of others or being a mere reactionary to what happens on a day-to-day basis reduces one to a form that is less than an accomplished human being with defined clarity and purpose.From various angles, Rand attacked the philosophies and institutions, both secular and religious, that have espoused doctrines that are, in nature, altruistic. Frequently, she would cite that for a people to be free, the rights of the individual must be of primary importance, not those of the group or collective that the concerned person happens to belong to.From having read this book, as well as Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness, I can understand how one could be wary of those who might give speeches, formal or informal, whose main idea or motive (whether it has the best of intentions) centralizes the concept of where one is to be a part of \\"something that is bigger than myself\\". Rand intermittently argued from a personal, yet universal, perspective that for a philosophy to guide man's existence and to strengthen a nation, as a whole, it must keep the right of the individual intact and that any idea that subordinates the individual to a group is dangerous, locally and encyclically.Throughout, Rand stated that from the slightest suppression of individual rights has spawned problems hampering the ability of a society to function. Among the stated are political pull, mob rule, anarchy, political tyrrany, all of which essentially leave no room for anyone to act or communicate in a free manner.Perhaps, most importantly, Rand hypothesized how self-destructive it would be to forgo any attempt to establish an unwavering, meaningful philosophy, especially in cases where reason and emotion are mutually exclusive. Anything less would be compromise, leaving the individual somewhat unhappy, at best, or under the influence of physical and psychological abuse, at worst. A thorough analysis of this work of Rand might make one ponder the role that politics and religion should have in his/her life.Overall, this is a book that will make you think. At the introduction, Rand stated that in order to know better the philosophical foundations of Objectivist Ethics in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, one should read The Virtue of Selfishness first, which I agree. If anyone wonders what could possibly follow up to Capitalism, I would recommend Return of the Primitive, which takes on not only altruism but also pinpoints on the causes, effects and patterns of nihilism, which Rand complained was being touted through the contemporary philosophy classes that introduced students to the ideas created and inspired by the writings of Immanuel Kant.In terms of how one might be positively influenced by this book, I would say that reason, as Rand described it, can be a most powerful tool in creating a win-win situation for everyone who achieves, not just self. One word of warning: Rand, through her words, even two decades after her demise, can leave an indelible mark upon minds that can still be molded. I would recommend that you should take the power of reason and of logical thinking seriously, but do not let it get confused with what could lead to taking yourself too seriously."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"While it's hardly arguable that capitalism is an economic system capable of generating immense wealth, not many people have tried defending capitalism from a moral viewpoint. That is exactly why they have not succeeded in showing that capitalism actually is the only system that protects the rights of man as well as allowing him to rise as high as he wishes and his abilities allow him.And then there is &quot;Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal&quot; - a collection of essays on many different subjects, all defending capitalism not only because it's a wealth-generating system, but first and foremost because it is moral. There are even a few essays written by Alan Greenspan before he - seemingly - rejected his ideals and became head of the Federal Reserve.A great book, and a constant source of inspiration."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"There are a million books defended the morality of socialismbut Rand is virtually alone in defending capitalism as a moral system(rather than just as an economic system). Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal is thus critically important and a must read for any serious student of political economy."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"For nascent Objectivists or libertarians, this work is undoubtedly the best single introduction to what's really important about capitalism. Not only does Rand et al dispell widely held myths and misconceptions about the workings of the free-market in theory and throughout history, but they also present a relentless moral case for freedom. There is no garbage about &quot;the common good,&quot; or &quot;the greatest benefit to the greatest number,&quot; but rather, a consistent appeal to the right of each human being to his life, liberty, and property. Moreover, not only is the case made from the simple standpoint of natural rights, but also from the more controversial framework of ethicial egoism, or, to put it more clearly, rational selfishness. Nevertheless, some of Rand's ideas concerning the actual framework of a free society are a bit off the mark, such as her scheme for financing government through a lottery or her aversion to violent civil resistance. Regardless of this, the work is solid, and I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Read this book.My whole life i had questions i couldn't answer. Why did god create me and give me a free will for the sole purpose of forcing me to subjugate my will to his? How can they draft some one into a war and still pretend to uphold 'the right to life'? How come my parents should pay taxes to pay for a highschool drop out's unemployment? Why should education be paid for by everyone when my parents had 5 kids but there are some people who didn't have any? If there are people who are good at earning money with money, and there are people who can only waste it, then why tax the people who are good at making it and give it to the ones who will waste it? Why can't money stay with the person who made it in the first place?As i grew up... these questions still bothered me. I started reading philosophy... I started with Nietzche and Satre and even opened Kant a few times. They all said that truth was unknowable and that reason has no place in reality. Nietzche wasn't a very happy fellow. He told me to do what i want and that it was the right thing to do just because i wanted to. None of this particularly appealed to me or seemed right. Nietzche was fun to read.. but only because I would imagine playing drinking games with him..Then i read my first book by Ayn rand. She never expected you to accept anything on faith or on her good name. Every premise that she introduces starts at its base axiom then extends into the upper foliage of her brilliant philosophy. Nothing is added as a legacy to older thought or on faith or as some cloudy vague notion of spirituality or 'humanity'.Pointed in the right direction, i saw the answers to my questions.I understand that there are those who refuse to function on a logical level. (I wonder how these people hope to contribute anything but trivia to our culture. Feelings never built a bridge or even churned butter.) This book is not for them.If you fancy yourself a rational mind, this book is for you. This is one of her more eloquent and poingant works. This a good place to begin reading Rand.

After 2,000 years of it, I think this claim is unfair.The same with capitalism. Rand idealizes it without an ounce of compassion for its robber-baron tendencies, let alone the slightest historical awareness that wherever unrestrained capitalism operates, people starve.The idea, or rather justification, is that islands of selfishness will balance each other out economically. Sure. Aside from the minor matter of monopolization and globalization, two examples of the very wealthy realizing that working together makes for still more wealth, when did compacts of distrust ever improve anything, let alone our relationships with one another?To blame the liberals and existentialists and socialists and Kantians for capitalism's limitations is a bit like blaming Mister Rogers for the fact that dangerous toys get taken off the market before they can turn a profit.We need to be appraised of the wonders of capitalism about as much as the &quot;virtue of selfishness.&quot; All of us see it operating every day, and usually to the complete disadvantage of the populations of people it marginalizes in the name of progress, good boundaries, and philosophical enlightenment."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"See Dr. John Robbins' Without a Prayer: Ayn Rand and the Close of Her System for a scholarly rebuttal to Objectivism."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I truly hope that this book is widely read by the general public. I say this in the sense that I wish Mein Kamph would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"It was horrible, the book was beaten up, and it was advertised for a total of '6' books, and I only received one. >:-("},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Are you people insane?

I have a very high standard of living because of it.

Do you really think that letting people do whatever they like no matter how extreme is really the answer to establishing some kind of just and stable world conducive to creativity, never mind the utopia Rand drones about? How, for example, is unbridled capitalism supposed to deal with environmental issues? Take a trip to some crappy Third World country and take a deep breath and right away you'll learn what it's like not to have regulations on pollution. But don't drink the water! And how is the marketplace supposed to handle new pharmaceuticals, etc? simply wait for people to start dying off and let the marketplace punish the snake oil salesmen by simply letting them go out of business because nobody will buy their thalidomide anymore?

Every fiber of my Catholic educated body told me that it was wrong. However, I was away from the Church, and the arguments seemed to make sense. As I progressed through my graduate program I discovered that libertarian ideas are highly attractive. This book became a hand book for me in every public policy class I took.From here I read Milton Friedman, Tom Sowell, and other free market luminaries. I was much more comfortable with Friedman and Sowell than Rand, but I was very taken with objectivism nonetheless. I had discovered a sure fire way to get A's on public policy papers. Plug EVERY issue into a simple formula:The argument is simply this: the government has a monopoly on the use of force; therefore the government is exceedingly dangerous. Free-markets operate without coercion. The end.This argument runs through this entire book, regardless of who the wrote the article in question.Now, several years out of graduate school, a father and a church goer, I am shocked at how gullible I was. Rand, an atheist, elevates the market to where only God ought reside. What results is a perverse ideology where \\"the common good\\" is a concept to be mocked. Rand's ideas are nothing new. They are recycled and economically presented social darwinism.Thus, Rand becomes part and parcel with the culture of death. In her thought abortion is a positive good as it allows a woman to pursue her goals in the marketplace without the encumbrance of family and children. Family loyalty, even love, are all superfluous in her hyper-individualistic vision. The older I get, the more I realize that the challenge for the true conservative today is to articulate why one believes that the market is the best way to pursue the common good. Justice is not an outmoded concept, and part of justice is recognizing that each and every person (regardless of their merit) has a right to dignity as a child of God.In the end Rand's vision as articulated in this collection of essays easily leads to the commodification of the human person. I am still a conservative. I still \\"like\\" the market. However, the market exists to be of use to human persons. Human persons do not exist to serve the market. Increasingly we are losing sight of this, and Rand is one of the intellectual founders of a strand of conservatism that is dangerously misguided and simplistic.All of this of course has much to do with what is happening in the Republican party right now. Currently, many in the party are disenchanted with social conservatism. \\"Abandon the stand on life issues and gay marriage etc.\\" they argue. Thus, we can focus on what really matters: free enterprise.The problem with this is simple. Real conservatives who have an understanding of natural law will not sit back and be silent while a bunch of hoity toity academics try to get us to turn our back on values that are objectively true, given the fact that every human being is a unique and created child of God. The fight for the heart and soul of the conservative movement continues..."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"A great compilation of essays on why Capitalism is the only economic system that truly allows people to be free to innovate and prosper as they choose. One of the best essays in this book was written by Alan Greenspan in 1966 where he reveals why the \\"welfare statists'\\" wanted to throw America off of the gold standard. He explains on page 107 that it is a \\"shabby secret\\" of repeatedly giving the American people \\"deficit spending as a hidden scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard.\\" Thus, money can be printed out of thin air to accomplish their intentions.One must wonder who corrupted Mr. Greenspan between 1966 and 1987 (when he became Federal Reserve Chairman)."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In her earlier works, such as The Fountainhead, Rand wrote of a certain type of person, or personality type, which she named &quot;second-handers.&quot; In fact, &quot;second-handers was, for a while, to be the very title of her book &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot; Although you will not find much on the subject of second-handers within the covers of Capitalism: the unknown ideal, you will, if you are an &quot;objectively&quot; minded individual, find plenty in the form of CONCEPTS in whatever you read. Rand distinguishes between the objectively minded individual and the second-handers by distinguishing between their respective cognitive approaches to their perceptions: The second-handers are concrete-bound; they exist in a perceptual world; they perceive images, shapes and sounds, they feel what others have decided is good or bad, right or wrong and they follow along never forming an OBJECTIVE opinion of their own, hence the name second-handers. They make much of perceptions (such as the spelling or misspelling of a word) without ever going beyond, that is: integrating their perceptions in to a concept and using in an attempt at problem solving. They are stuck at the perceptual level. Indeed, to them a misspelling of a word is a Great Big Deal: that is as far as their journey takes them; The conceptual meaning of a word isn't important to a second-hander, only the perceptual part matters, for that is the EXTENT of their understanding, Why, if you don't have that spelling correct, you must not know what you are doing! Implicit in the second-hander's &quot;logic&quot; is that if you could only spell everything correctly, keep all of your perceptual aspects in line, why you would, armed with such accomplishments, be able to surmount any and every problem that could come your way! As Rand makes clear in all of her writings, including Capatilism: the unknown ideal, (sic) the key to man reaching his goal, that is his individual happiness or individuality, is using his mind, in a very logical manner in solving the problems which befront him in his pursuit. The only way such obstacles, as one perceives in one's daily life, can be surmounted, is through CONCEPT FORMATION: the integration of one's perceptions in to a concept: a tool useful, to the reality of one's problems to serve as a means to a solution. This can be anything from a simple cause and effect relationship all the way to high level abstract mathematical reasoning. In any case it involves going beyond the obvious, beyond the immediately perceptive. It involves NOT being stuck at the perceptive level."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I really enjoyed this book by Ayn Rand, a genius of our time."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Take Atlas Shrugged, and make it non-fiction.

But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives. I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy. Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Rand claims the only reason to have a government is to protect \\"individual rights,\\" but nowhere in her writings does she show these rights exist in any form other than her own thoughts and rants.In Objectivist epistemology, things exist in reality (the physical world) or in the mind: as abstractions, emotions, precepts, etc. So then, these rights must be thoughts or they must be matter.These rights aren't matter, they are not made of tissue, of cells or DNA. Ask any doctor or biologist where the \\"rights\\" are located in humans. Ask them if they know of any \\"rights gland\\" that exists. They will laugh in your face.We can easily see that these rights are not part of our physical nature, they are not made of cells or atoms, so then, they must be thoughts.If they are thoughts, and if man is born with a \\"blank slate\\" as Rand says, then how could a newborn have rights, if he has no \\"rights concept\\" or no thoughts about \\"rights\\" at birth?That's easy: The newborn's rights come from Rand's thoughts, and these rights are subjective. Rand thinks about the newborn's \\"rights,\\" and then the baby has them. Notice that this is not only subjective, but also collectivist in nature: In Rand's world the baby's nature is created by the thoughts of another human. Rand believes the baby has \\"rights,\\" and then \\"poof,\\" the rights are created.How much do these rights weight? Where are they located? What color are they? Rand has absolutely no evidence that these rights exist, they are fantasy.Imagine a newborn baby in a world where all other humans have perished in some accident. Suppose a super genius space alien from another plantet gives the baby a medical exam with a super machine and super tecnology, etc. Will he find rights in there? Of course not. Why? because they are not there.The fact is these \\"rights\\" make no sense when thinking about the solitary baby, because Rand's view of rights demands another person (an objectivist) \\"thinking\\" about them for the warm emotioal feeling to develop, for the rights to be created.Based on these facts, Rand's arguments for capitalism are absurd. Get you ideas for freedom from Ludwig von Mises or Thomas Jefferson. Rand's idea of rights is subjective and collectivist in nature.

Instead of defending Capitalism on economic grounds (its ability to increase the standard of living of the masses, for example) she defended it on moral grounds. Man is a rational animal who is rightly concerned with his self-interest. Capitalism is the system of government necessitated by the nature of man.CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL is a collection of essays mostly by Rand (but with some by Alan Greenspan, Nathaniel Branden & Robert Hessen) which were originally published in the 1960's. Rand's essays share the virtues and shortcomings of most of her work. The writing is clear and exciting, but some of the argumentation is overblown. Her standard approach is to take a doctrine that she doesn't believe in (religion, for example), caricature it, and then draw all sorts of inferences about what a person must believe to hold such a doctrine. So her recreation of what Christianity or Conservatism is has little to with what most of its advocates believe.Although Rand's philosophy and her defense of Capitalism is problematic, there is a good deal of interesting social commentary in this book. I particularly like \\"Extremism, or the Art of Smearing.\\"Another excellent is essay is \\"The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus.\\" There is also a lot of dubious reasoning, which stems from the fact that Rand wasn't particularly well read in the areas she felt obliged to pontificate on. For example, she says that the era of peace from 1815 to 1914 was the result of Capitalism. A.J.P. Taylor (a socialist and not a religious believer from what I can tell), stated that it was the fruit of Christianity. She says that the founding fathers of the US wanted to create a totally new system of government, but the Declaration of Independence indicate that they sought conserve the existing system from English encroachments. Or, she states that businessman are the \\"persecuted minority\\" when in fact they benefit more than anyone from subsidies and various protectionist legislation.For defenses of Capitalism based on different approaches, the interested reader should consult the works of Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I heard about this book and Ayn Rand's work on \\"Free Markets With Dr. Mike Beitler,\\" an internet-radio show that promotes capitalism and individual rights.

This work even includes 3 essays by Alan Greenspan, apparantly before he became a parasitic bureacrat for the ill-concieved Fed (morally and economically). The book is split between Defining and chronicling Capitalism's roots and meaning, and between observations of the perversion and destruction of Capitalism circa mid '60's.

But other then that, this collection of essays shows how brilliant of a thinker and writer Ayn Rand was. How she is able to expose the moral fallacies behind the current altruistic/collectivist philosophy is amazing. She puts into words the many things I believe many of us feel inside but don't really know how to express in words, or have been conditioned to suppress by our culture and schooling.This is quite an educational piece of literature. All to often, free-market and freedom advocates fail to make the moral case. They make the mistake of defending freedom and Capitalism from an altruistic perspective- it is the best economic system for the common good. But this is a mistake, as Ayn Rand points out, while that fact is ture, it alone is secondary to the fact that Capitalism is the only political/economic system that is compatible with individual rights. That is its true moral virtue.The Amazon editorial review is a disgrace! It is not an objective review, but a personal ideological attack. The statements made in that review are baseless and no attempt is made to justify them. Amazon should be ashamed!"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"If for no other reason than that it includes three essays by fed chairman Alan Greenspan, this is an important, and sometimes even a thought-provoking work. True enough, the theories presented in this book will tell you a great deal more about the sentiments of their authors than they will about how politics works in the real world of fact, but that is true of nearly all books on politics.The main flaw in this book is that it is far too obssessed with proving what &quot;ought&quot; to be rather than with showing what actually is. Rand regarded politics as a mere extension of ethics. I would argue that this is a mistake. Politics is about power and the competition for social and political advantage. It is not about what &quot;ought to be.&quot;Rand regarded the theory of rights presented in this book as one of her great achievements. Perhaps on a purely theoretical level she is correct. But on a practical level, she is surely wrong. Theories of rights, when examined empirically, are merely speculative (and hence impotent) attempts to regulate the division of social advantage. In reality, however, no merely speculative theory of right can be found to regulate the division of social advantage: those individuals with the greater strength, intelligence, and shrewdness take the lion's share, regardless of what any moral philosopher might say. Nor is it clear how any theory of rights, even if it could be established logically, could be enforced in a real world dominated by vested interests and political sharks. It is for this reason that a great deal of what is presented by Rand and her colleagues in this book appears to me quite beside the point--a mere exercise in wishful thinking. The laissez-faire capitalism which Rand advocated is purely utopian. But it is not utopian for economic reasons, as leftists naively believe, but for political reasons: the corporation and politicians who run this country will never tolerate a system of laissez-faire (they are not about to give up their power)."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Rand points out the double standards of how it's called 'social gains' when workers push for higher wages, yet 'greed' when employers (who holding all the risk in their hands) want to increase profits. Like I said, if you are truly socialistic, you will not like this book."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Now let's see: Rand was wrong about government financing, and she was wrong to be averse to &quot;violent civil resistance&quot; -- arguing that government requires a territorial monopoly on the legal use of force, in direct conflict with the Second Amendment specifically and the logic of federalism generally. So if we put her view of government into practice, we'd have a totalitarian State that couldn't pay for itself out of voluntary contributions, and we'd have an unarmed citizenry that wasn't allowed to resist. So the State would do . . . what? And this is moral? On what planet? (Am I the only one who sees an &quot;Ominous Parallel&quot; here?)She also invoked &quot;rational selfishness&quot; as the moral basis of capitalism, leaving out any &quot;garbage&quot; about the &quot;common good.&quot; Now, that latter phrase ordinarily means the good literally common to all human beings (usually within a single society). In leaving out such &quot;garbage,&quot; Rand would appear to have left out a powerful argument for capitalism: that it serves our _genuine_ &quot;common good,&quot; by providing a society in which the rights of _each_ person are protected and respected. (Rand _did_ claim to have provided an &quot;egoistic&quot; foundation for those rights, but (a) it mostly isn't in this volume, and (b) it mostly isn't any good. I won't critique it here since it's in _The Virtue of Selfishness_.)As for &quot;rational selfishness&quot; as the moral foundation for capitalism: the free market provides economic checks and balances on _all_ behavior involving exchangeable goods -- including &quot;altruistic&quot; behavior like philanthropy and charitable contributions. As a moral foundation, &quot;rational altruism&quot; would have worked just as well. In fact the entire egoism/altruism dichotomy is beside the point; it's the &quot;rational&quot; part that's essential. (And I beg to doubt that Rand's understanding of &quot;rationality&quot; was adequate anyway.)Hmm. There doesn't seem to be all that much left of Rand's _moral_ case for capitalism.Nevertheless, as I've stated in my previous reviews, I still think this is her best book for quite other reasons, and she does do a fair job of cutting through some _other_ people's nonsense. Just be careful with her own."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"It is sometimes difficult in public to be objective about the ideas of Rand, for the reason that the hatred of her detractors and the devotion of her followers borders on the hysterical. It is best to contemplate her philosophy in private, and then communicate to those who perhaps are still open enough to consider sometimes very radical ideas. Rand's thinking on ethics is brilliant, and the best in the history of philosophy, but this book, summarizing her thoughts on the political ramifications of her ethics, is very flawed, and there are some very outlandish claims that are made if one views them from a scientific perspective.Economics is a difficult subject, and some might say not a science. But the financial interactions of humans can be studied scientifically, given the patience and the mathematical tools. Rand, and the other contributors of this book, do not do this anywhere in the articles. They are at best a loose, qualitative description of capitalist economics, and as such are not useful to those who really want to understand the dynamics of the capitalist economy. Rand calls capitalism \\"an unknown ideal\\" and laments the state of society (at that time), in that its not fairly represented in education or the popular media. The evidence she gives however is purely anecdotal, and she makes no attempt to cite empirical or historical studies. It is one thing to argue for the ethical foundations of capitalism, which she does so with incredible originality and skill. It is quite another to describe the inner workings of the economy and to prove causal connections between historical economic events.For example, Rand states in the first article 'What is Capitalism\\" that depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free market but by government interference into the economy. What evidence of this is there? Rand does not cite any empirical or historical data for this assertion, and even lacking such data, does not attempt even to construct a quantitative model that would lend some plausibility to her argument. In economic studies, mathematical modeling sometimes serves to shed light on a particular phenomenon when empirical data is lacking. Such a model can then be altered as the data is collected. Attempting to find the causes of depressions is a nontrivial affair, and something that economists and mathematicians have wrestled with for decades (if not centuries). Rand is very cavalier in her assertion here, and again, makes no attempt to prove it using a calm, rational, and scientific framework.In another article, written by her former collaborator, Nathaniel Brandon, and entitled 'Common Fallacies about Capitalism\\", he argues that free markets make monopolies impossible. His arguments utilize a sort of 'principal of arbitrage' (my words here), in that he argues that a monopoly that attempts to set prices will result in a competitor entering the field to take advantage of the high profits, thus closing the artificially high prices set by the monopoly. This is certainly plausible, but the time scales involved for the competitor may be too long to take advantage of the profitability. Getting into a highly technological business, such as chip manufacturing or drug discovery, may be too difficult and time-consuming for a competitor. And, Brandon still needs to justify his assertions with either an economic model or with an empirical study. He does not cite any historical evidence to support his claim.Capitalism as discussed in this book may not currently exist by the standards and definitions held by the authors of this book, and indeed one might believe that it has received an unfair and distorted hearing in academia and other circles. But human ingenuity has exploded in the last two decades, and shows no sign of abatement, despite the actions of the government and the existing tax structure. Perhaps maybe it is time to stop fixating on government inefficiencies and ineptitudes and continue to innovate. A society smart enough to invent and use genetic engineering, to create thinking machines, and to travel in space, will perhaps find dealing with the government mundane and rather trivial in the whole scheme of things, and perhaps not want to waste intellectual energy on tirades against government bureaucracies.One can only speculate what Rand would think of the dizzying pace of technological development in the 21st century, but I think it would be fair to say, judging by the utterances of the characters of her novels, she would forget her moral outrage, and would find life in the 21st century exhilirating..."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book is a great defense of Capitalism and an excellent introduction to what exactly Capitalism is and is not. Our current system of Corporatism/Fascism more closely resembles Socialism than Capitalism, and Rand makes it perfectly clear throughout this book. This is a must-read for anyone looking to equip themselves with the logic and ideas required to dismantle any altruistic argument on politics and economics."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"That's why it's her best: she knew her strengths and stuck to them, letting other people do the hard parts. She also had the sense to include a shortlist of recommended reading, which she had never done before and never did again.So we can forgive this book some of its antilibertarian, statist flaws: for example, her defense of &quot;big business&quot; as &quot;America's most persecuted minority&quot; (Murray Rothbard had a few chuckles over this); her thoroughly statist account of &quot;The Nature of Government&quot; and her oracular dismissal of anarchocapitalism; her undermining of the Second Amendment by declaring that government needs a monopoly on the power of coercion (the whole point of the federalist system is to _avoid_ such a monopoly, though perhaps Russian immigrants don't always grasp this point); her insistence that the American commonwealth was based on the (also statist) philosophy of Aristotle (when in fact it owed a great deal more to John Calvin, though Calvin himself might have been surprised to hear it).In fact, forget her own positive account altogether; her philosophy itself was almost uniformly rhetorical-polemical nonsense. But she had a fine knack for picking apart the arguments of some of the _opponents_ of capitalism, and there's quite a bit of that in this volume.And her bibliography will introduce you to Ludwig von Mises. For _that_, we can forgive her a lot."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"In an earlier review that scrolled off the page long ago, I suggested that this was Rand's best book because (a) she stuck largely to political theory and (b) had enough sense to get help with the hard parts. You can click to the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.Here I'll add that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.In the opening essay, on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of value that the free market serves.In the course of discussing this sort of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for everybody.If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up. Keep that in mind if you go on to read _The Virtue of Selfishness_."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This book is a set of essays, mostly by Ayn Rand.

Perhaps try For the New Intellectual as a nonfiction base, and Anthem if you perfer fiction. I found this book to be so incredibily powerful and important for many reasons. The theory of capitalism is laid out, given context using history relevence, and is compared to other modes of thinking, namely altruism. Rand makes fundamental arguements for the morality of capitalism in a philisophic sense, as well as making economic and governmental connections. She breaks apart altruism and its precipitation into government, ie. socialism/collectivism. The arguements made, and the thorough nature in which she makes them really made a connection with me and have had a huge impact on my political and philosophic views. There is really no better way of describing this book than by saying it is completely indispensible, especially for those entering adulthood, who are still forming themselves intellectually. This book sheds light on capitalism in a way that today is infrequently seen(unfortunately), and articulated by the best. You will not be disappointed here."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"This series of essays goes to great depth in studying the foundations of capitalism and its relationship to human freedom.

Today, capitalism is in &quot;fashion&quot;--yet, unfortunately people still don't fully grasp what it is, what it stands for, and what it requires to exist. Quoting Miss Rand:&quot;No politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so eloquently or has benefited mankind so greatly as capitalism -- and none has ever been attacked so savagely, viciously, and blindly. The flood of misinformation, misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood about capitalism is such that the young people of today have no idea (and virtually no way of discovering any idea) of its actual nature.&quot;...[I]t is capitalism's alleged champions who are responsible for the fact that capitalism is being destroyed without a hearing, without a trial, without any public knowledge of its principles, its nature, its history, or its moral meaning. It is being destroyed in the manner of a nightmare lynching -- as if a blind, despair-crazed mob were burning a straw man, not knowing that the grotesquely deformed bundle of straw is hiding the living body of the ideal.&quot;The method of capitalism's destruction rests on never letting the world discover what it is being destroyed -- on never allowing it to be identified within the hearing of the young.&quot;The purpose of this book is to identify it. [It] is addressed to the young -- in years or in spirit -- who are not afraid to know and are not ready to give up.&quot;&quot;What they have to discover, what all the efforts of capitalism's enemies are frantically aimed at hiding, is the fact that capitalism is not merely the &quot;practical&quot;, but the only moral system in history.&quot;Wow! Can this woman write or what!"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"For anyone interested in an economic case for capitalism, this is not the right book - Rand was a philosopher, not an economist (in spite of her sound understanding of economic theorems.) However, for anyone interested in a moral defence of the system and an understanding of its intellectual history and opponents, this is a vital piece of work. Rand includes essays on voluminous topics, such as the gold standard, distortions of what actually happened during the Industrial Revolution, the proper role of government (I disagree with her on this), and so on. It is essential to understand that Rand was not a corporate shill, nor did she approve of the status quo - to the contrary, she strongly opposed the notion of corporate welfare and the like, and believed in a free market economy. Unfortunately, her adulation of big business gave ample ammunition to her critics. She replicates her essay on the rights of individuals toward the end of the book, which is in itself an excellent read. Taken in conjunction with The Virtue of Selfishness, this work will spur the youthful mind into further inquiry on the philosophical origins and defences of laissez-faire."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"I first read Rand's &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness&quot; in a political philosophy class in college. The book made an impression on me unlike any other book I had read before and a few years after I graduated I decided to reread it. I then read &quot;Philosophy, who needs it&quot; and &quot;Capitalism, the unknown ideal.&quot; This set of books is an absolute must read for any thinking person. Be warned, however; if socialism or religion is so deeply ingrained in your mind that nothing can wash it away, you most likely will find yourself giving the book a one star, like many of the reviewers did on this site. If you live in the USA, read these books (especially &quot;Capitalism, the unknown ideal&quot;) to find out why you live in the only country ever founded on moral principles. If you live in a socialist (or worst, a Communist) country, read the books to get a better insight of your own government. Finally, as an European who grew up in Europe and came to the USA in his teenage years, I must say that, although I have always sensed and known the huge difference between the European and American mentality, it's Rand who describes it so very eloquently in the last chapter of &quot;Philosophy, who needs it&quot;."},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","review":"Essays on the value of Capitalism in a free society where men think and opine without fear of retribution from despots and, ideally, are shielded from them by a non-central and defensive infrastructure strong enough to do so.It is often incorrectly attributed to Rand, by her critics, that her unfettered, uncompromising belief of \\"autonomous man\\", as central to fulfillment in the individual life, is undermined by the defense of Capitalism when so many clear examples of corrupt, destructive behavior exist within that system. Whereas those same critics would argue this or that particular collective ideology is superior, what they do not acknowledge is that type of behavior DOES NOT represent Capitalism but the unethical and amoral actions of the individual(s). So, these critics are either ignorant of Rand's ideas or deliberately deceptive in their critique of her beliefs. I have yet to read or know of any advocacy from Ayn Rand's Objective epistimology which encourages or condones a purpose-driven life devoid of conscience from considering the simple difference between right and wrong...including the Capitalist system. Ideally, were ALL men to consider and execute the simple difference between right and wrong in their lives; Capitalism truly defines the ONLY financial system free men can live by as it enriches the creative and resourceful individual while beneficial to the \\"productive members\\" in the same free society. Here, the purpose of profit is easily understood. It rewards the unnatural practice of sacrifice by daring the individual with the lure of genuine success.Likewise....the dregs within a capitalistic society are neither provided or offered anything beyond their willingness to participate in a positive manner. As it should be. Those who \\"associate\\" or \\"equate\\" profit with greed in their indictment against Capitalism do so understanding they are wrong in their agenda driven analysis or are intellectually inept.There are some of Rand's epistimological teachings I am unable to absorb or, perhaps, just don't understand. I am no scholar yet believe with some writing a personal bias for certain things does exist outside of her Objectivist philosophy which inflects from the meaningful, enriched direction she sought for her fellow human being. Might I add a direction well-documented, supported and hopefully, timeless.

The book is based on the founding principals of America and an understanding that \\"America's abundance was not created by public sacrifices to the \`common good', but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes.\\"If you resent the fact that your life is your own responsibility and no one else's, then you will not like this book.

It is about the missing ideological link between human rights (individual rights) and economics. This book should be regarded as food for thought - claiming that only a free economy can be part of a free society. This is true by definition but Rand is simply one of the few non-technical minds that put it to paper without equations. (That government intervention is restricting our wealth and personal freedom has been proven infinite times before.) Another striking feature is the non-scientific assumption about man's selfish altruism. It was only decades later that her non-scientific assumptions were actually confirmed by the major biologists of our time. It is true that many of her arguments skip scientific explanations - but she is never dangerously far off from our biological and economic understanding of humans. A must read for every open mind.

This book is powerful, and Ayn Rand is not at all afraid to let us know what is wrong with America, and what would be better if capitalism were truly laissez-faire in America, rather than our giving it over to a mixed economy.The early articles are especially enlightening about the situation in the United States and how it evolved. She goes back to discussing the creation of the Federal Reserve and what was detrimental about it. She discusses the gold standard, and she takes on Franklin Roosevelt and how the Great Depression and his policies led us to becoming a mixed economy.The book also takes a lot of time pointing out why capitalism is superior to communism. While we now live after the Cold War--Rand lived during it and was herself a fugitive from the Soviet Union--the points about communism are still highly relevant, not just because communist countries remain but because communism has seeped into American culture in the form of collectivist thinking--the idea that the individual matters less than what is for the greater good. Ayn Rand gives many examples of this, such as taxpayers without children having to fund public education, and the United States providing assistance to other countries--Vietnam in her day--I'm sure she would be opposed to Iraq in ours. She suggests that our trying to raise up those other countries will only pull us down, and she blasts the idea that we must be charitable and look out for our brothers in other lands.More than any other writer of the twentieth century, Rand was not afraid to speak her mind. She takes on one of Pope Paul VI's encyclicals, she speaks out against the philosophy of Existentialism, and she explains how our culture's unwillingness to stand up for the American ideal and to have a clear philosophy about life has led to the confusion of the younger generations.Everyone will not agree with Ayn Rand on every point, but no one will go away from this book without being more knowledgable and a better thinker. Again! Why are her philosophies not given equal place in fields of study? Why are philosophy classes always ready to talk about Kant, Sartre and existentialism and not objectivism? If we ignore her voice of reason, we will be headed for a welfare, collectivist society ourselves--as she points out, we're already half-way there. Read this book!- Tyler R.

I often consider the cover art to be more tasteful, but that's merely my opinion. But it's a cold hard fact that in Japan almost all games come with beautifully printed FULL COLOR instruction manuals. Very high quality, very eye pleasing, filled with dazzling screen shots and artwork. Meanwhile in the US, most games come with dull black and white manuals. Nintendo is very good about splurging to give us color, but often the other companies penny-pinch with all but the most high-profile of titles. There is the occasionaly exception. Again, it's just a pet peeve. I don't sit and brood about this.I buy strategy guides for games that I really enjoy. When I really enjoy a game I become obsessed with it and I buy the soundtrack, the guide, the t-shirt, the Happy Meal etc. The reason I buy the guide is generally because I want to look at the pretty pictures. The pretty FULL COLOR pictures. Well, I finished GunValkyrie, and I really really really enjoyed it, so I bought the guide so I could look at pretty full color pictures. To my shock and dismay, I've found that the guide is printed in black and white. I've never heard of such a thing.To add insult to injury, the guide itself is bare-bones.

It starts with revolution in 1789 and ends with the disastrous events of August 1914....a revolution since it made the United States a global power and shaped the Twentieth Century. In the middle there is peace...well, relative peace.The Nineteenth Century is split into six sections - domestic politics, culture, society, economics, international politics and imperialism - and attempts to be an overview that will appeal to everyone. I found the sections on imperialism, politics &amp; economics the most interesting ... although the most readable sections of the book are the intro and finale written by the editor.The book contains a really great chronology of the main events during the period. The biblio leaves the reader with plenty of follow up leads. And the publishers also provide pretty detailed maps of Europe and the world at various points along the way.Faults-wise, there are a few. One, it's not really a blow-by-blow account of the main events. It's more of a big picture or thematic overview and the reader may be susceptible to attention fatigue unless gripped by a need to know.

This is fine, but the authors write with several assumptions. 1. There is the assumption that everyone will know what they are referring to when discussing particular topics. As a graduate student focusing on early modern Europe, I navigated the text somewhat with ease. However, this text is being used for undergraduate courses, and many students are considerably lost when reading this text. If you are an expert in, let us say, European economics from the 19th century until mid 20th century the book may be suitable. At times, the authors appear quite confusing and the use of specific stats is often overused and overbearing for the reader.2. As I alluded to earlier, this book is used for an undergraduate course. It should only be used for graduate courses where many of the students are either familiar with the topic or you are guaranteed to have several supplemental readings to assist you with this text.If you are just a person who loves or likes history and wants to read on this particular period--I would only suggest this book if:1.

Who doesn't? Millions have been charmed by the story of the naughty puppet that wanted to become a real boy. His adventures are hardly new, as Pinocchio is in turn carved by Geppetto, rebellious against his father, disobedient to the good fairy, victimized at the hands of the deceitful cat and fox, changed into a donkey, rescued with his father in the whale, and eventually becomes a Real Boy.But have you read the Original Pinocchio? Most people do not know that there are two versions of Pinocchio. One is the simplified version that Disney has given us, the version most people are familiar with. The other is The Real Thing, The Original. Along-side The Real Thing, the simplified Disney version is like Pinocchio the puppet - charming, but wooden and simple. The Real Thing, however, is like Pinocchio the real boy - charming, and full of life. This edition by Carlo Collodi is that Real Thing.Although story of Pinocchio is a tale known to nearly every speaking child, it was first written in Italian. Written by Carlo Lorenzini under the pseudonym Carlo Collodi, it dates back to 1883, when it was serialized in a newspaper and then published as a book with huge success. The 1892 English version was equally well received, but it was the 1940 Walt Disney cartoon that gave Pinocchio the legendary status it enjoys today. Only one problem: Disney took short cuts. Collodi's original story has a richness and charm unmatched by Disney. Collodi's Pinocchio is not about a loveable puppet, but about a bratty puppet who needs to learn an important moral lesson about responsibility. And it resonates with slapstick humour that even Disney cannot equal.Take the first paragraph: \\"There was once upon a time ... A king! My little readers will shout together. No, children, you make a mistake. Once upon a time there was a piece of wood.\\" Collodi goes on to relate how this piece of wood is first owned by a carpenter called Mr. Antonio Cherry. When his friend Mr. Geppetto comes to visit, the wood causes a great fight between the two friends by talking and calling Geppetto his hated nickname of Polendina. Geppetto is convinced it is Antonio who is doing the name-calling: \\"They seized one another's wigs, and even hit and bit and scratched each other. At the end of the fight Geppetto's yellow wig was in Mr Antonio's hands, and the carpenter's grey wig between Geppetto's teeth. \`Give me my wig!' said Mr Antonio. \`You give me mine, and let us make a peace treaty!' So the two little old men, each taking his own wig, shook hands, and promised to be good friends forever.\\" But moments later, the fighting and name calling resumes (\\"Blockhead!\\" \\"Donkey!\\" \\"Ugly monkey!\\". When peace is restored, with honours even, \\"they shook hands again, and vowed to be good friends for ever. Then Geppetto took the piece of wood and, thanking Mr Antonio, went limping home.\\" And so that's how Geppetto ends up with the wood that later became Pinocchio.This is just a small taste of the sparkling and rich humour that is largely absent from most contemporary renditions of this famous tale. Taking their cue from Disney, most modern stories have retained Collodi's story-line, but lost the delightful humour. The Original is darker in tone than the simplified version (assassins try to murder Pinocchio and leave him swinging from a tree, and Pinocchio's threatened punishment of death for failing to take his medicine is announced by the appearance of rabbit undertakers) , but also has a wealth more action, excitement, and humour. As long as you're only familiar with the simplified version of Pinocchio, you'll think of Pinocchio as a wooden and old story for little kids. But anyone who is familiar with The Real Thing, The Original by Carlo Collodi, knows that just like Pinocchio himself, the Real Pinocchio story is in the end no wooden puppet, but a living and breathing classic."},{"Title":"Pinocchio (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is not Disney's watered-down and water-logged *Pinocchio* -- this is the book that has the real stuff, and if children like the Disney movie, it's because they're getting a hint of the wonders of Collodi's book.First: my five year old insisted I read this book to him twice in a row. Yes, I left out the part where Pinocchio actually bites off the paw of a cat and spits it out, but my boy revelled (from the safe distance of bed and sippy cup in hand) in the assassins who pursue Pinocchio, try to kill him, and leave him swinging from a tree. The incidents in this book are highly evocative: a little girl announces that all the people in a house are dead (she included); rabbit undertakers appear when Pinocchio won't take his medicine; Pinocchio is almost fried as a fish (and drowned, and hanged, etc.). There's a talking cricket, but he's annoying and, happily, does *not* burst into song.Second: This book centers around dream-logic. The book makes mechanical gestures towards cause and effect, but it really works the way a child thinks and the way a child worries -- it reassures a child that not everything that happens is reasonable. Perhaps Collodi meant this book to be moralistic -- certainly there are lessons constantly to be learned. But that the least of this text: this is a story about a boy who can't quite be a boy because he's naughty and disobedient, and he finds it isn't easy *not* to be naughty. Grown-ups have all sorts of rules, and a lot of them don't make much sense. After all, we all come into this world not yet human, and we all struggle to figure out what is expected of us.The illustrations are are pleasing and plentiful, and I know it will only be a matter of time before my five year old asks for the story again. I'll be glad to read it. The worth of the tale is far greater than the worth of the simple (but good) morals it contains."},{"Title":"Pinocchio (Puffin Classics)","review":"One of the first things I noticed about this book was Pinocchio's awful behavior. He bites Gepetto's wig off and then gets Gepetto arrested. He even kills what appears to be the original Jimminy Cricket in Chapter 4. My goodness!After Gepetto gets back to feed and clothe the hungry Pinocchio, Pinocchio promises to be a good boy and go to school. Gepetto doesn't have much money, so he sells his own coat for Pinocchio to have a school book. In an act of poor judgement, Pinocchio trades the book to see a puppet show, and that's where the adventure begins.Pinoccho's fantastic journey is creative and fun, despite obvious continuity problems. Gepetto is the one that names Pinocchio, but every character in the book seems to magically know the puppet's name beforehand, without even having to ask. I don't understand. It's not like Pinocchio is famous or anything, unlike what the Disney film portrays.It should also be noted that Pinocchio can't read a poster, but is somehow able to read a gravestone, with no schooling whatsoever taking place between the two events.Do these continuity flaws distract from the literary merit of the tale? Absolutely not. We see little Pinocchio, with his clothes of paper and hat of bread, delving into (and soonafter repenting from) the same common misdeeds, not unlike the people Israel of the Old Testament. He is thrown in jail, forced to be a watchdog, turned into a donkey, and even hanged. A blue-haired fairy saves him over and over again, and eventually he becomes a real boy.One of my favorite things about the book is its discouragement of laziness. Pinocchio asks a guy pulling a cart for money, and the guy says, \\"I'll gladly give you money, if you help me pull this cart.\\" Pinocchio claims such a task is beneath him, so the man adds something along the lines of, \\"Why don't you eat a few slices of your pride to fix that hunger problem of yours.\\"This book is extremely creative and encourages a strong work ethic. I can see how it inspired such a famous film. I hate the cover though...the artwork is way too Disney-ized and doesn't match the illustrations in the book at all. Spend a few extra bucks to get a better cover, unless you're ultra-cheap (like me)."},{"Title":"Pinocchio (Puffin Classics)","review":"This edition of Puffin Classics portrays the true story of Pinocchio originally written in Italian. I've seen and skimmed other books in English before and none of them truly tell the original story of how it was written in Italian."},{"Title":"Pinocchio (Puffin Classics)","review":"This book is such a classic, the age-old story presented in a perfect-sized paperback was just what I wanted."},{"Title":"Pinocchio (Puffin Classics)","review":"No question about it that this story is enduring and popular because it speaks innocently into the heart of every human being. Clearly the puppet Pinocchio in here reflects the fate of a child or a person who obstinately takes only his own way and refuses to heed the advises of wisdom, but who would end up never without a sweet remorse. The theme is developed in an active and playful way and sometimes in a tedious way. Its plots are as tenacious as a rascal, too unwilling to explore other ways of presenting a lesson or an experience. The lines drawn between good and evil are too hard and fast, and can be overly childish and even disappointing compared with other classic children's stories. But of course this one written by Collodi (the original creator) is my favorite among other many versions that I had read or seen. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Always (Arabesque)","review":"Paternal and maternal love can be a deterring factor when parents are over-protective. Deirdre Savoy tells of a romance where the lovers must face obstacles set before them, that only a genuiune love could overcome. Michael and Jenny are perfect for each other, even in their teens. Savoy artistically flahses back allowing readers to truly appreciate and savor, the emotional and physical love that eventually unfolds for the two. Mature readers of romance can easily forgive the parents' whose interference almost ruins Jenny's and Michaels' &quot;happily ever after&quot;. All romantics will love this novel, with several romantic scenes that are descriptively beautiful."},{"Title":"Always (Arabesque)","review":"To Dee Savoy, you have done it again, by giving us another beautiful love story with Jenny Scanlon and Michael Thorne.I often times hear that these so-called romance novels are not realistic, they don't write about people who can be like us. Well, I beg to differ, because somewhere out there they do exist. Of course, our belief system is entirely developed from what one experiences in life.Well, Ms Savoy seems to have found a great story to tell us here with, &quot;Always&quot;. Fellow romance readers and those closet ones also, let me first recommend this book to you. WHY? Well, do you want to curl up with a easy-to-read book that purely illustrates how love has a way with you that brings you in a total circle? Well this has a hero and heroine who have know each other since teenager days, both their fathers are best friends. Jenny has always had a crush on Michael. We've been there sometime in our life, where we had the crush on the older guy we knew we could not have because of our age. Well, this book has all that but no good love story would not be exciting without a few twists of deception...RIGHT? Well the author has managed to give us the sparks of love, intimacy, test of friendship, lies and deceit, and interesting secondary characters like Nathan.I strongly recommend my fellow romance readers and yes, you closet ones too, to read, &quot;Always&quot;. Another reason I truly enjoyed this, is how the author let's us know how she got the basis for this story. That brought back memories to how our elders would tell us things about our future and we would laugh at them like they were crazy. But then when it happens, all we can do is smile and say WOW! how does she do that....Thanks Dee for another fantastic story....Looking forward to your next book..."},{"Title":"Always (Arabesque)","review":"What a great story!

Jenny could only love one man Michael which she nicknames Mickey.Always is a story about a love that was inevitable. Jenny always love Michael and ironically Michael figures out why he hadn't really been happy since he had to leave Jenny all those years ago. This story has family secrets and deception.

Border Country fits easily among much more recognized time-and-place classics like Tarjei Vesaas' Ice Palace and Yukio Mishima's Spring Snow.Analyzing a place and time and the people who lived there is never a proxy for being there with them. The power of Border Country is that the style and tone--pared down, local, and direct--is really of the time and place and so has the authentic power to transport you into the lives of Harry, Ellen, Matthew, and the others connected to the border country.If you're a deep thinker, you can dig many themes out of this novel--trying to return home, honoring labor, being part of a community with all its vagaries, finding a sense of place, and integrating who you've become with the place from which you came. If you're an academic, you can even dig much deeper in William's works, as he himself did, in the backwards evolution of our increasingly commercialized--and disassociated--culture.Or if you simply want to read and appreciate a beautiful story about real lives, Williams welcomes you to do that too."},{"Title":"Holy Bible on Compact Disc (King James Version)","review":"There are more than one CD version of Alexander Scourby but I think this one is the best. Why? The other CD collection I own is a &quot;box&quot; with each CD in an individual envelope. It's tedious to get to the CD you want! However, in this collection, you get a large binder with clear, plastic CD holder pages. Each page holds 4 CD's (2 per side). Getting the CD you want is easy as you turn to the page which has the CD you want.As to Scourby's reading, I've enjoyed this since I was a kid.

This is a super-helper for anyone who wants to know the Bible but does not like to read or is too tired or busy. There is also a difference between READING the Bible and hearing the Bible. You pick up nuances and details that you might miss when you're reading, and some of these are very significant!

This is especially the case if you can find a sale or get a good used set. Although the music might make the words slightly harder to hear in a few areas, Scourby's voice is pleasant to listen to and seems to draw you in more than the other readers I've heard. If you are listening for more than a few minutes, the music and dramatization help hold your attention. The other dramatized audio bible I've heard is the Zondervan one. It has many of the same strenghts as the Scourby versio, but to me the reader's voice does not seem to have the same magnetic quality that is present with Scourby."},{"Title":"Holy Bible on Compact Disc (King James Version)","review":"Scourby reads with life and expression, but without over-dramatizing or trying to get himself &quot;over&quot; instead of what he's reading. Just keep in mind that this is an older recording, and there are inconsistencies in volume/treble/bass. Please note that this varies from reading session to reading session, as differences will occasionally be observed on the same CD. In spite of this, the collection is still an excellent value.*** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***Personally, I think that this is a great way to jump into Biblical study, especially if you're the type who regularly finishes a paragraph, only to find yourself saying, &quot;What did I just read?&quot; Please note that I myself am new to the endeavor of trying to be more than a &quot;casual&quot; Christian, so I speak in that context and not as a person with significant experience in Biblical study or even Christian lifestyle. As someone who has been too unmotivated to go to church and/or read the text-in spite of knowing better-I think I have a fair understanding of the religious apathy that can result from \\"tomorrowism.\\" I'll do it tomorrow...I'll get it done next week...as soon as that thing at work is out of the way...etc.I think that once a person reads or hears or somehow learns enough of the Bible to really begin to receive the message as it is intended, that he or she will be automatically drawn to further study and/or involvement. Just remember that it's going to be alot to digest (even if you're just doing a once-over) so begin slowly and don't overdo it at first, lest you burn yourself out and end up back at square one. Also, approach it as a child and take it in anew, without any prior conceptions as to what the Bible is \\"really\\" about. On that note: put away the concordance or other topical directories that point to issue-based passages. These things might make you a better conservative, but limiting yourself to excerpts erodes the word of God and marginalizes your understanding of the Bible. This manner of verse cherry-picking without prior understanding will only make you more judgmental of others without giving you much of a foundation for self-improvement as a Christian.One of the best aspects of the Scourby audio Bible is that it's meant to be listened to in its entirety. Going from book-to-book or even chapter-to-chapter isn't a problem, but it's difficult to arbitrarily skim or passage-jump, which is probably best in the long haul. Even better, listening only takes passive attention, so you have further options as to when and how you hear. You know when you best absorb information and this gives you the capability to do so. Just make it a point to do it consistently and build a positive habit out of your activity."},{"Title":"Holy Bible on Compact Disc (King James Version)","review":"Alexander Scourby is great, but I had to send the item back several times due to extremely poor audio quality.

But if you like hip-hop, are interested in contract negotiations, behind-the-scenes coverage of hip-hop performances, the love between a man and a woman, ghost writing, or the effect hip-hop has on its fan base, please pick up A Hip Hop Story by Heru Ptah. If you don't want to read the whole book, just check out one of the strongest chapters in the whole novel, Chapter 32.Ptah has mastered the art of writing about critical events (i.e. war, politics, violence, etc.) in a conversational matter when no other writers so far have been able to do this without preaching. Even better, he does it through the eyes of two fictionalized hip-hop artists with totally different backgrounds, lifestyles, and philosophies. Flawless, the exceptional pretty boy who has a major talent for lyrics, is the infamous freestyle battler who beat Hannibal, the raunchier, in-your-face lyricist. After that freestyle, they have gone back and forth down the road to their future. They both share one dream though: to get to the top of hip-hop music.I won't lie to you. There were some spots where I wanted to pull out the violins. I used to say women made love sound corny, but this book proves that men do too. Ptah should've asked some women how it felt to lose their virginity cause the whole \\"wanting him deeper and deeper\\" deal was completely inaccurate.But anyway, the author made impressive points like the difference between an industry audience during a performance as opposed to a public audience. (If you saw the reaction to Lil' Jon &amp; the Ying Yang Twins on the Vibe Awards, you'll understand his point). He spoke on the sometimes-overprotective love between siblings. He spoke on the problems with holding onto friendships when a hip-hop career becomes successful. He even speaks on the power of words during battling sessions, adding along several freestyles of the fictional characters. Ptah even adds as much humor as he does realism in a part so surprising all I can say is read Book Five. Better yet, just read the whole book. It's worth the money."},{"Title":"A Hip-Hop Story","review":"&quot;A Hip Hop Story&quot; is the absolute best work of fiction focusing on hip hop out today. It is written in a beautiful, even poetic manner.

Don't get it twisted, this book is long, but you will want to follow it to the end to see what happens. As you read you'll find resemblances to Tupac and Biggie, God bless the dead. The book conveys thoughts either one of these great artists may have had when they were living. This is also a book for those that may not love hip hop, it gives an understanding of the culture. I commend Heru for writing such an intelligent and thought provoking work of fiction and would like to read more fiction from this author.

I did not have much knowledge of the hip-hop industry, but now I think I have a better understanding. I think however that the back cover of the novel is misleading, but in a good way. After reading this novel to just simply say it is a love story really does not capture how magnificient this story is. Micah to me is the most interesting character. I believe he is the Flawless Erika fell in love with. As flawless kept saying in repsonse to Micah &quot;this name&quot;, he never acknowledged him as a person when he was around or when Erika was explaining her love for him, I think his character was not meant for human existence but rather for a loving spirit that took on likeness to Flawless. I respect Hannibal the most, and I fell in love with Flawless. Truely an excellent book, much success in the future with the movie. Might I suggest DMX to play Hannibal's character?"},{"Title":"A Hip-Hop Story","review":"This book is amazing. I've never read anything like this before. It was beautifully written.

Heru must have got his inspiration from that &quot;incident&quot;. I have read it three times already.

I have been meaning to write a review but after seeing Heru on CNN doing his thing, I was convinced I souldn't put it off any longer. The book is an incredibly intelligent story about two rival rappers as they keep crossing paths. It's realistic to the point of being painful as it shows elements of Tupac, Biggie, Nas and Jay-Z.

The ensemble characters are suitably eccentric and at odds with each other. Aunt Leoni is a Miss Marple after my own heart, the more interesting because she participates in the mischief-making herself at one point. This is, of course, more of a romance than a mystery--romantic suspense, if you will--so I can appreciate that Eugenia and Jake maintain the center stage. The happier romance genre also explains, presumably, why a cat becomes a character (as a cupid) rather then merely a tool of atmosphere as I used one to describe: \\"It smells a bit of the cat.\\" Also, there is great jeopardy for the heroine, but there are no grisly scenes of demise. I confess, much as I enjoyed the book, that I would have cut the cat and whacked the governor. --Agatha C."},{"Title":"Illusions of Spring","review":"I really liked this book.

I love it when Governor Milton Barnes and Eugenia's Aunt Leoni face off at Eugenia's swearing in ceremony. I also like how the hero Jake is so real and human in his conflict between his love for Eugenia and his wish to join the governor's political team. Also, Chief of Staff Peter Walford is a real reptile with his cobra head and constant machinations with the media. Best of all, though, there's no gratuitous anthing anywhere. Just good, solid, literary writing. The one suggestive scene? Nothing explicit here, but lots to ponder ... A great springtime treat set in this season in the American Midwest."},{"Title":"Illusions of Spring","review":"Rarely is a political novel so amusing and absorbing. It's focused on a reunion romance to boot. The author clearly knows these characters. Their interdynamics ring crystal clear and true. Eugenia's home-town reception as a new political candidate is ironically hilarious. And the fun is well-tempered by riveting suspense. Who wants to subvert Eugenia's campaign? Her former fiance who has already betrayed her once? The chief of staff who's so media-savvy and at the center of everything? The rambunctious governor? What about her ornery aunt Leoni who is always pushing her own social agenda? This novel is a richly-served treat, well-conceived and well executed. And heck, after a spring that never really came, it was great to immerse into this Midwest springtime milieu, storms and all."},{"Title":"Illusions of Spring","review":"I am quite pleased to see my spirit finally alive again in a romance where words are enjoyed and couples are enjoined without any resort to unnecessarily explicit actions. My own heroines were in similarly genteel though unwealthy circumstances in which more powerful forces sought to overwhelm them. Marriage was always used as a tool of sorts to which the heroine was meant to submit but to which she did not succumb unless upon her own terms.My only complaint is the imposition of postmodern vehicles so that our heroine could not entreat the hero for help on a galloping steed thereby directly encountering the springtime elements. These storms while everyone is sheltered interiorly or even under ground are less effective to be sure. I do fully understand, however, that in such a wretched setting as the American Midwest, you would have to employ a springtime season to have any effective imclemency at all. ---JANE A."},{"Title":"Malingering and Deception in Adolescents: Assessing Credibility in Clinical and Forensic Settings","review":"This book is a must-have for mental health workers of adolescents.

The text provides information on understanding and classifying malingering and deception, interviewing techniques, psychological tests and approaches, professional, legal and ethical issues and applications for both clinical and forensic settings. The author provides an excellent presentation of the literature, presenting both the pros and cons of various methods for identifying deception and malingering in the adolescent client."},{"Title":"The Iliad: A Commentary: Volume 2, Books 5-8","review":"This six-volume commentary on the Iliad is fantastic and indispensable. The other reviewer, Markos, has completely missed the point; this is not a commentary intended for first-time readers of Homer (Cambridge Green and Yellow commentaries tend more in that direction) nor for those reading the epic in translation. Instead, it is an introduction to many topics of scholarly debate that surround the poem, keyed to the parts of the text where that information is most relevant.While I am disappointed that the book is not currently available on Amazon, it is a reference work and, as such, is probably mostly bought only by libraries. It is very well done, however, and should not be missed by any serious scholars of the Classics."},{"Title":"The Iliad: A Commentary: Volume 2, Books 5-8","review":"I was disappointed. A good commentary needs to be complete but cannot be too wordy. Get to the point and allow us to get back to reading the text. Kirk's commentary is obviously meant for people who read Homer in the Greek, but he does not devote enough attention to the Greek text. Instead he sort of rambles on about the plot, what he things speakers have in mind, stylistic considerations that are not clear. Here's an example. You tell me if (a) this helps you understand the Iliad any better (b) you even know what the heck Kirk is talking about (b) \\"Until now the speech has been undramatic and routinely cumulative in expression, with conventional verse-structure and moderate enjambment. The present graphic and hypothetical calculation, set out in a single long and progressively-enjambed sentence and brought to an epigrammatic climax in 128, noticeably elevates the style.\\" Okay. Difficult Greek cruxes are often ignored by Kirk. Older commentaries like Anthon's (published in 1847!) and Draper's marvelous recent book manage to be both more consise AND give you more helpful information. Unfortunatley, these books do not cover the entire Iliad. A good, complete, detailed modern commentary on the Iliad has yet to be written. This book certainly is not that."},{"Title":"Talking with Horses","review":"Not a bad book. He gets the point across about communicating with horses.

They both have strengths and they both have weaknesses. But it is a terrific spiritual journey reading good books from men on both sides of the argument! Unfortunately, much sensationalism and over-speculation accompanies far too many books by Dispensational authors. There is none of that with McClain. Parts One and Two are really good. I was especially blessed by his demonstration of other \\"time-gap\\" passages in Scripture (such as Isaiah 61:1-2 and Christ's quoting of it in Luke 4 where He stops short of reading the rest of the passage as it relates to His Second Coming not His First; therefore we have a time gap of almost 2,000 years that wouldn't be apparent from a straightforward reading of the Isaiah passage). Why, therefore, can't we have a time gap between Daniel's 69th and 70th week? McClain writes with a gracious attitude towards those of a different persuasion. This is a highly significant prophetic passage of Scripture, and I highly recommend McClain's treatment of it."},{"Title":"Daniel's prophecy of the 70 weeks","review":"If you are looking for a compact handbook of doctrine on Daniel's seventieth week to carry with you, this is the one. Its pages cover many key teachings from one of the most reliable teachers and editors of the New Scofield Reference Bible. I recommend this little help to any who are witnessing to someone or looking for help themselves on this area of prophecy."},{"Title":"Daniel's prophecy of the 70 weeks","review":"This pamphlet, written by the late Dr. Alva McClain and titled \\"Daniel's Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks,\\" was originally published in 1940 and is a good study concerning the prophetic future of Israel given to the Prophet Daniel. The study focuses primarily on an abundance of prophetic information in Daniel chapter 9. McClain's pamphlet describes key events in Daniel which will take place during Israel's seventieth week, the time of Jacob's trouble (Jeremiah 30:7). Dr. McClain was the president of Grace Theological Seminary for 25 years. His commentary on Romans and his books titled Law and Grace and Greatness of the Kingdom are also good reads.McClain divides his pamphlet into three parts. The first part is a relatively non-technical exposition of the first sixty-nine weeks of Daniel's prophecy about Israel. In doing so, he covers in some detail the Hebrew word for \\"weeks\\" and how the word, plus context and application determines its meaning. The reader needs to be aware at this point that in calculating the period of the sixty-nine weeks, a calculator would be helpful because, yes, there is some math involved! One reviewer evidently gave up the books at this point. He or she thought there was just too much \\"numerology.\\"In Part 2, McClain describes the two major conclusions--the \\"Continuous\\" and the \\"Gap\\" interpretations. His defense of the \\"Gap\\" interpretation (an interval of time between the end of the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks) is about as convincing an argument as I have read, especially considering its brevity. I especially appreciated his use of OT examples like Isaiah 61:1-2 and curiously a verse right in Daniel's prophecy that is often overlooked, but if studied carefully, does describe events that must occur beyond the sixty-ninth and before the seventieth weeks.In Part 3, McClain does a quick overview of his conclusions from parts one and two. Then he used the latter verses of Daniel chapter 9, the book of Revelation and Matthew chapter 24 to begin identifying the significant events that occur in the seventieth week, which according to McClain, match the seven-year period of the Tribulation. Up to this point, he had done an excellent job of citing and supporting his conclusions. Although in this section, some of his assertions lacked the defined support in the first two parts. Such as when he emphatically states that \\"the prince to come\\" will rise from an area in the old Roman Empire, yet he doesn't provide any justification. From that conclusion he simply begins referring to this person as the \\"Roman prince\\" throughout the rest of the pamphlet.He does this again when he confidently identifies in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, \\"For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way\\" the Spirit-dwelt Church as the \\"one\\" who is the restraining power. Again, McClain makes no attempt to explain or support this assertion. There are a few others in Part 3 that are not worth mentioning.Even though this is just a pamphlet, McClain adds a nice Appendix at the end with additional comment and cited references for Parts 1 and 2, and some historical information for Part 3. Since this book was written so long ago, the KJV is the primary text used, and the American Standard Version (ASV) (1901) is also used to bring a fuller, more modern translation. One thing I must also add is that McClain's pamphlet is not written with the spectacular flair and sensationalism that usual accompanies prophetic and last-days books. He also mentions by name those with whom he disagrees with the respect one would give a peer. Both of these were refreshing and make my recommendation for this pamphlet much easier to do. This pamphlet is highly recommended, regardless of your eschatology persuasion."},{"Title":"Daniel's prophecy of the 70 weeks","review":"This book is excellent and I am adding it to my personal library.

I am required to read them for seminary and while they don't put me to sleep or make me urp in my mouth, I probably wouldn't read this book if it weren't a requirement. There is a general lack of exegetical depth, however, McClain's views are more scriptural than some. He tends to spout off vague scripture references like machine gun fire rather than aiming carefully for accurate in depth exegesis. This is the kind of \\"proof-texting\\" that gives evangelicals a bad name. All the hard core dispensational types will love this book, I'm just not sure I agree 100% with his methods or his conclusions."},{"Title":"Proverbs: An Introduction and Commentary","review":"Billed as a commentary, this book is more a collection of verse-by-verse textual notes.

They should appeal to everyone except romantics who like happy endings. Kafka's is not the type in a Harlequin Romance. Still, is he really THAT great? Anyone who has had a mixup with the law, a gov't agency, who feels persecuted but can't figure how and where, and who likes earthbound sci-fi and old \\"Twilight Zone\\" shows will love this. No doubt Kafka has a sense of humor too, even if it seems a little too masochistic at times. The writing is darn good, probably better in the German. METAMORPHOSES seems a little too far out for me. But IN THE PENAL COLONY,and THE JUDGEMENT ARE ABSOLUTE MUST READS. You can pick other faves, and know you're reading the words of a genius, tormented father/victim and all. Also noteworthy is his death at 45 of TB...Anyway, I just got videos of the recent TRAIL and KAFKA so thought I'd share my thoughts..If you got this far, I thank you for reading this !!!

They are among the great works of literature.To describe a Kafka story is to describe something uncanny. It is to describe a transformation into an enigmatic world, where the precise material details of reality suggest other realities one vaguely senses and cannot really understand. It is the dwelling in a strange realm of anxiety and fear beyond the ordinary that can miraculously turn to a different direction entirely.I cannot really say what Kafka's stories are.I only know that whoever reads them will be in the presence of the uniquest of the unique in literature. For Kafka writing was prayer and these stories are invitations to prayer , not necessarily with him."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"I have never purchased a more poorly manufactured book in my entire life. The edges of the pages seem to have not been trimmed flush and protrude to random lengths which makes it very difficult to page through the book."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka, because of his difficult style, can make some assume him to be a bit overrated (which he is by english teachers who prefer him over an author like Herman Hesse, who says what Kafka does a bit more simply and beautifully.) But the truth is, Kafka does have his moments of brilliance, and despite the bad english translations of most of his works, there is still a lot one can learn from them. In the meantime, if you're not ready to dive into the difficulty, pick up a book such as Toilet: The Novel, which was written by an American, and thus does not suffer from the complexities and flaws of translation, and the book itself is a tribute to the literary works of Kafka, which makes it a great introduction to an even greater writer, or for a title a bit less literary pick up one of those introductory guides to Kafka. But then, these short stories too, are also a good introduction, just make sure you read them before you jump into Kafka's book 'The Castle'. Having said that, I hope I was of some help to you.Fare thee well."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"This is a mixed bag. Some of the pieces are fragments. Some are of questionable value. Some are gems. While it is possible to examine Kafka and his work from a psychoanalytic point of view, the point of engaging in such a puerile exercise eludes me. Such an approach is both shallow and unilluminating.Kafka's gems, such as &quot;The Metamorphosis,&quot; are of the highest literary merit. In connection with &quot;The Metamorphosis,&quot; I would recommend reading the corresponding lecture in Nabokov's &quot;Lectures on Literature.&quot; Not only is Gregor Samsa a human being in an insect body, his family might aptly be described as insects in human bodies.&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; is also interesting from a philosophical point of view as a piece of existentialist literature. There is certainly a sense of the absurd in this work. It may also lead us to question our sense of self-identity. To what extent is that connected to our body, to what extent connected to how others view us? As to the latter, recall that in Camus' &quot;The Stranger,&quot; Meursault only becomes self-reflective after the trial in which his impression on others is reflected back to him."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka. What a guy. Of the 27 reviews so far, only 1 (brothersjudddotcom) has dared to give less than 5 stars. He did a good job with his review, but I feel I need to add some as well to help balance all the stars Kafka is recieving here, and giving the review browser a diferent angle always helps.As can probably be expected, the short stories are a mixed bag. There are about a half dozen good ones, and there are a few absolutely terrible ones. &quot;The Burrow&quot; was particularly painful.That said; I did not come into the reading with much biographical knowledge about Kafka other than that in the introduction. Quickly, however, it became apparent that the poor guy is not comfortable with life. Death, suicide, starvation, a feeling of powerlessness; these things run common among the stories. Kafka does not even feel human! His characters inhabit dogs, cockroaches, mice, apes, and some large burrowing-type creature. The &quot;modern&quot; world alienates man, so-to-speak; it is unnatural. bah. Modern times are the best times to be alive! Man only counts his sorrows, doesn't he? Kafka sure counted alot of them...There was some humor, but not nearly enough to overcome the pessimism. My goodness, why bother getting up in the morning? The rotting apple in the posterior = the sin of homosexuality is an interesting idea; but I think it is more significant that Gregor Samsa actually starves to death. The running theme of admiration for starvation is disturbing. Combined with the &quot;Hunger Artist,&quot; dying because he &quot;couldn't find the food he liked&quot; and &quot;Investigations of a Dog,&quot; where a dog (Kafka) does not accept religious sustenance or practical, scientific sustenance; rather choosing to starve to death (another dog *forces* him to eat something); Starving oneself becomes a noble rejection of life and all its horrible complicated troubles. Freedom, horrible, horrible freedom is bemoaned in a similar way to how Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor puts it. Freedom, however, defines modern thought.Kafkaism. Kafkaesque. Here are a few for you:&quot;What help, then, do my colleagues find? What kind of attempts do they make to manage to go on living in spite of everything?&quot;&quot;I can only see decline everywhere&quot;&quot;the highest effort among us is voluntary fasting&quot; &quot;I was tortured by the fancy that I would never be able to eat again.&quot;&quot;It seemed to me I was seperated from all my fellows, not by a quite short stretch, by by an infinite distance&quot;&quot;I felt so weak and unhappy that I buried my face in the ground, I could not bear the strain of seeing around me the things of the earth.&quot;&quot;My heart hurt, for now it seemed impossible to escape from my suffering.&quot;&quot;...It cannot be made good, not ever.&quot; (the haunting conclusion to The Country Doctor, a masterpiece... but still laden with an unreasonable pessimism. We are utterly powerless, at the mercy of a violent world. So?)And my personal favorite:&quot;What are our lungs supposed to do?&quot; I shouted. Shouted: &quot;If they breath fast they suffocate themselves from inner poisons; if they breath slowly they suffocate from unbreathable air, from outraged things. But if they try to search for their own rythm they perish from the mere search.&quot;The most curious thing is that in the introduction it says that Kafka sometimes read his work aloud to his friends, and had to pause often to laugh uproariously. I laughed possibly twice while reading this, the humor has not aged well. I think the only reason you'd read this is so you can say &quot;I've read Kafka&quot; and puff out your chest.

First, the almost complete absence of ideas in his work. Second, how obvious it is that his work is fundamentally about either repressed or closeted homosexuality.First things first; reading these stories and comparing what's actually on the page to the central position that Kafka holds among critics in 20th Century literature, I couldn't help thinking of Chauncey Gardiner. He, of course, is the simple minded hero of Jerzy Kozinski's great book Being There. Having spent his whole life within the grounds of a mansion gardening and watching TV, he enters the world completely unprepared to interact with his fellow man. But the people he meets inflate his non sequitirs into faux profundities and he is soon advising the President of the United States. He is a blank slate upon which other people scribble and then interpret their own ideas as genius. In much the same way, Kafka wrote a series of completely autobiographical tales, and an unpleasant autobiography it is: grown men living at home with their parents; working menial jobs in huge bureaucracies; terrified of marriage; bullied by overbearing fathers; plagued by illness, nightmares and feelings of alienation from all around them except for one loving sister. This was Kafka's own life and these are the common threads that run throughout his work. But add them all together and what you get is a situation, not a set of ideas. Kafka endlessly rewrites the situation that he found himself in; noticeably absent are any thoughts about the origin, meaning or alternatives to this situation, other than killing off the character who finds himself stuck therein.Second, I guess the discussion of Kafka as a &quot;gay&quot; writer is fairly recent, but I'm not sure how else he can be read. The very lack of socio-political meanings in his work, the degree to which it is situation based, rather than driven by ideas, leaves you with only the elements of the situation to interpret and the point inexorably towards a conclusion that his heroes are isolated by their homosexuality. Just take Metamorphosis; here are the elements of the plot. A grown single man who still lives with his family wakes up one morning to find that he has become a bug. This leads to his being isolated from his shamefaced family. His father drives him out of a room by throwing apples at him. One lodges in his backside and rots there; the resulting infection kills him. Well c'mon; this just isn't even subtle. A family ashamed of their single son. He's a dung beetle for cripes sakes. The apple (sin) infects his posterior. I mean surely we've all got the picture by now. Why go on?All of which leaves us with an interesting question, does the fact that his stories may not have meant to him what they have come to mean to different schools of critics in some way diminish his stature as a literary figure? Or does the fact that his intensely personal story can be read in a universal manner to apply to (1) the Jewish experience, (2) the epoch of totalitarian regimes and (3) the dehumanizing age of bureaucracy in which we all live, actually demonstrate just how great a writer he was?I'm inclined towards the first view. I think that the situation that he reiterates in his work is so specific to him and has so little to say about the world most of us live in that it is hard to justify his lofty position in the literary pantheon. As I read, I found myself thinking, &quot;this author is a troubled boy&quot; more often than &quot;this is a troubling society he describes&quot;. In a perverse way, it seems likely that the best thing that ever happened to Kafka was the rise of totalitarian regimes in general and, specifically, their banning of his works. It is noteworthy that he died before the long dark night of Nazism and Communism descended on Europe. It is only retrospectively that his work came to be read as a gloss on these regimes. And had they simply ignored him, it's hard to believe that he would have come to be so closely associated with their machinations. Return him to the time and place that he wrote and take his work at face value and I think you're left, not with a writer whose work defines and illuminates the 20th Century (a la Orwell, with whom he is often unjustly paired), but with merely the mildly intriguing tales of an unwell man.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Hello All,I recently purchased this book in faith, though I was also frustrated by the lack of information in the book description.

Of course this is required reading for the Kafka enthusiast.A well thought-out forward by John Updike prepares you for your journey into the amazing and complex mind of Kafka. The book is divided into two sections, one for the longer stories and one for the shorter stories (most of which only take up a page or two).The stories themselves are great. &quot;The Metamorphisis&quot; is included, in which Gregor Samsa awakens to find himself in the form of a rather large insect! &quot;The Penal Colony&quot;, &quot;The Judgment&quot; and &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; are also included.There's certainly hasn't been an author since Kafka able to play upon the fears and emotions of the human mind, those thoughts playing in out head, when we realize that maybe some of this could happen to us.If you enjoy &quot;The Complete Stories&quot;, be sure to pick up &quot;Amerika&quot;, &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot;. These are Kafka's three novels and will complete your collection. All very much worth it!"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka has to be the one of the most influential writers of the century, not just for his ability to capture the alienation and unreality of much of modern life but because his vision, which is simultaneously totally bizarre and strangely moving, freed writers to try more and more daring ways of expressing themselves. After all, if one can write a moving story about a man who wakes one morning to discover that he has been turned into a huge cockroach, what can't the writer do?The impression left by these stories is all the more interesting when one realizes that Kafka wasn't a starving, drug or drink demented artist, but a minor clerk in a German insurance firm. A dull and orderly life. Of course, if you've ever worked for an insurance company Kafka's sense of unreality and alienation might seem natural.These are unique and wonderful concoctions. Anyone who wonders what 'Kafkaesque' really means should take a peek into his world. These stories are the best place to start. Then on to The Trial for the full, gruely experience. Wonderfully horrible."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka was perhaps the greatest writer ever to live and this volume shows it. Every story, even every sketch of an idea that Kafka wrote down comes filled with brilliant emotions and deep meaning conveyed through simple and serious language. Shakespeare has none of the lyrical abilities of Kafka, and Homer could only dream of equaling Kafka's mastery of plot. Kafka out-psychoanalyzed Freud, and wrote circles around Joyce. His stories seem modern even by today's standards, the things that haven't come true yet in his works I believe will eventually, while I don't believe him to be a prophet he certainly had a great understanding of humankind and knew where it was headed.&quot;A Country Doctor&quot; is in my opinion the greatest short story ever written, a dark dream sequence with all kinds of slimy worms writhing beneath the surreal surface plot, sticking out through the rotted boards that Kafka puts down to allow us to see what we're standing over. &quot;The Judgement,&quot; a purely perfect work of psychology, Kafka dipping deeper and hitting more nerves than in any of his other stories, giving us a picture of what it's like to be a genius controlled by a domineering, and a nonunderstanding father. And of course there are the smaller works from &quot;Meditations,&quot; little snippets of images that flash through the mind, a kind of literary whispering in the ear while sitting in the dark. &quot;The Burrow,&quot; another favorite, perhaps the most claustrophobic work of fiction ever conceived, the darkness of the tunnel affecting your mind for days.Read this book, in it the greatest treasure a writer ever gave us shines, a golden nugget, hidden deep within a dark pool that seems unswimable. Take the swim, and I garantee that you will find the nugget. Ignoring Kafka is like denying yourself the best there is."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Let me preface this very negative review with this: I love Kafka. He's a great author and the shortcomings of this book, this book in particular, are not his.That said, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Whatever archaic methods the publisher, Schocken, uses to bind its books is in desperate need of revitalization. Within 1 week of purchasing this book it was threatening to fall to pieces. Within 2 weeks it became 4 volumes--it yet threatens to break into a weekly series.If you enjoy breaking the binding on your paperbacks for easy reading beware, this book is poorly bound and breaking the binding, or even opening it much past 180 degrees, will cause the book to break asunder.Buy these stories, just don't buy them in this book. Look elsewhere even if you must buy 2 or 3 other books to get everything."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka's fiction occupies a strange, unique place in the canon. It is so deep as to invite a world of interpretation, yet so mysterious as to defy any attempts at interpreting it. I think it's brilliant just for its imagery -- who can forget the monstrous execution device of \\"In the Penal Colony,\\" or the description of the boy's festering wound in \\"A Country Doctor,\\" or the bouncing balls that torment the protagonist of \\"Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor,\\" or the dead, river-bound title character of \\"The Hunter Gracchus\\" who is lost in limbo between this world and the next, or the animalistic recluse of a man obsessed with defending his home from intruders, both real and imaginary, in \\"The Burrow\\"? Kafka's use of symbolism, especially his use of animals as symbols representing various types of human experience, is unparalleled; it's easy to see the enormous influence he had on writers as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor.But I don't feel Kafka's goal was to shock his readers or influence future generations of writers. He was just a 9-to-5 insurance guy with unique outlooks on life and the world and who developed an original, if occasionally grim and morbid, language for expressing them. If a writer's fiction is supposed to reflect his personality, then in Kafka's case we get a distinct picture of a man who struggled every day of his life with his efforts to write, his alienation from his family (\\"The Metamorphosis\\"), his difficult relationship with his father (\\"The Judgment\\"), his religious feelings, his Jewish identity (\\"Josephine the Singer,\\" of particular poignancy coming from someone whose sisters were later to die in the concentration camps), his victim status (\\"The Vulture\\"), the absurdity of being an artist trying to communicate with an apathetic or misunderstanding public (\\"A Hunger Artist\\"), man's search for the divine and order in the universe (\\"Investigations of a Dog\\").From a technical standpoint, it must be stated that Kafka was not a perfect writer; many of the stories are structurally flawed and seem inexplicably truncated or unnecessarily lengthened. Ascribing the shortcomings to expressionistic recklessness, however, I'd rather focus on the dark beauty of the images, even though I don't expect to understand them any better than I could know the man himself."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Until you read Kafka, many of us think we know Kafka based perhaps on anecdotal items we pick up in the media or from others. The mere fact there's the term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; perhaps causes us to think we know what it means. But it is only when one reads Kafka do you begin to gain some insight into one of the most mysterious and yet hallowed writers of the 20th century.This volume is really the place to begin. For in it are three of his more widely known novellas: In the Penal Colony, The Judgement, and Metamorphosis. But it is with the other stories that the reader that peruses rather than skims will undoubtedly begin to ask questions. What is Kafka trying to say in such a circuitous manner? What conflict tears at him to write these unusual tales? Because I think most readers will begin to wonder the same, realizing that Kafka felt passionate about something, but chose a metaphoric manner to present his idea so ingenious and subtle that I fear it is lost upon most readers. Clearly, Kafka struggled with something deeply personal. He was engaged twice to the same woman, and called off the engagement twice. And he prefered to live an uneventful, unnoticeable and undemanding life. He ridiculed the bureaucry, yet chose it as his vocation. To me, that is a key element to understanding his stories. And these more obscure tales do more to reveal what is meant by &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; than the grandiose volumes of The Castle, or Amerika. It is clear why so many of his prose strikes one as unfinished (besides the fact most of it was unfinished), because Kafka's own metamorphosis was incomplete. Had he not died from tuberculosis, perhaps he would have solved the conundrum of his personal life. Instead, we are left with these beautiful and mysterious tales that whisper something to us."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka can be a difficult figure to approach for some. His presence looms for some readers as foreboding as that strange unapproachable structure in The Castle looms for the character in that book. One way to get around this is to learn a little about Kafka's own life, especially his relationship with his father. And also to learn that his economical &amp; concise way with language he learned as a student of law and his fascination to the point of paranoia with bureaucracies of various kinds he may have picked up in his career as an office worker in an insurance company. Kafka may never become all together human to some readers. To those who share his particular temperament, however, he will seem very human and become a favorite though a kind of quiet one that lurks in the fringes of your bookcase. These stories are a great introduction. Though they are all prose works in some cases they seem to possess qualities more often seen in parables than in twentieth-century prose ie: use of symbols &amp; layers of possible meanings being more evocative(though sparse) than specific. His work is certainly pessimistic, his landscapes are oblique, and chances are you will have your own way of looking at Kafka the more you read(and there are a vast array of ways to interpret his work). One interesting reader, Jean Paul Sartre, characterized Kafka's work as &quot;the impossibility of transcendence&quot;. His exaggerated worlds(Swift was one of his own favorite authors) do provide interesting glimpses into that very often written about terrain alienation but few have ever delved into it so deeply. After Kafka you may be lead down one of the more interesting paths in the history of literature which includes Nabokov, Borges, Cortazar, Calvino and many many others."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"As a student of the German language, I must say that I view this text from a different perspective than most of its other readers. I selected this book merely to give me a broader understanding of Kafka's work in the short time available to me. It is an infinitely useful resource, gracefully translated and sturdily bound. I give it four stars simply because no English translation could possibly compare to the original German texts. For example, the German word \\"Gesetz\\" is translated \\"law\\" in the foundational parable \\"Before the Law.\\" Though it is a literally accurate term, it does not capture the sense of the Gesetz as a semi-personal metaphysical absolute concerning the condition of the Universe. (\\"Gesetz\\" is something of a German equivalent for the Greek \\"Logos\\" with a capital \\"L\\".) Such slight aberrations are certainly common as they are an ineluctable consequence of translation; this aside, it is an excellent text that will always sit next to my German edition on the shelf of Modern Literature."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"It's hard to fit a review of any of Kafka's work in such a short space, but especially a review of his short fiction (or rather parables, which is more what they are). He was a master of the short story, the likes of which we have seldom seen before or since. This volume contains most of his short stories, those that aren't included here are included elsewhere, where they are more fitting (such as \\"The Stoker\\" as the first chapter of Amerika). Kafka's short story \\"The Metamorphosis\\" is possibly the best short story ever written. It is certainly the most well known. But I'd like to draw your attention to a few other stories by him--examples of what makes Kafka great: \\"Before the Law\\", \\"In the Penal Colony\\", \\"A Country Doctor\\", \\"A Report to an Academy\\", \\"A Hunger Artist\\", \\"The Burrow\\", \\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\\", and \\"Jackals and Arabs.\\" Read this book."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka's genius lies in the intricate use of language. His sublte style conceals a world of secret doors to interpretation. The casual reader will easily glide by the well-masked portals and probably not come out the other end with much to show for it. On the other hand, the careful, open-minded reader could spend a lifetime exploring the labyrinth of interpretive possibilities within Kafka's worksThe only trouble with this particular book is the inherant difficulty related to translating literature. The translator did as fine a job as can be expected, considering the richness and pliability of the original text.Overall, this book belongs in the library of any Kafka afficionado."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Let it be known to all interested, that most of the stories in this collection are fragmentary, sometimes incomplete, and more often than not, extremely absurdist in nature.

As it turned out I liked him from line one, but that is hardly normal for everyone. Read a few of his shorter works first (you can find a lot of his short stuff online) and then determine for yourself; most of his works have a similar feel and theme."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Love this author!Great book, great histories.. =Dx o x o x o x o x o x o"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"I ordered this for a course I am co-teaching this fall.

This is a fabulous collection. Updike is right that these stories are excellent. Kafka has had enormous influence on modern fiction. He may be one of a handful of highly important authors. Reading him today is especially interesting; you would think these stories had been written the day before yesterday. Kafka's subject, which is something like 'the estrangement of the soul and modern man's quest for hope in a hopeless universe' sounds awfully familiar.The truth is that little else has been said to expand on Kafka's central insight into modern man's spiritual dilemma. \\"There is hope, but not for us.\\" Kafka, rather like Poe, writes creepy tales. That his world is ours is the magic of his genius. Yes, we've been there alright, but we cannot explain how it happened.

Perhaps the most influential author of the 20th century is no exception.

Join Karl Rossmann below deck on his way to 'America' or hide out with Gregor Samsa in his room, following his 'Metamorphosis'. You may be stung by the Kafka-bug, and like millions of others be mesmerized into the dreamlike world of Kafka. Anxiety, anguish, and apocalypse await those who dare enter this utterly disturbing inferno. This may sound pretty bad. However, no other writer has given me a reading experience that is even remotely similar to Kafka. He is unique! A new universe yet to unfold within your own mind.

Much of the work is reported to be incomplete and the larger portion of it is collected in this book \\"The Complete Stories\\".In the interest of full disclosure I did not finish the whole book. To be honest I couldn't bear to read another page of it. I know many will say that I cant give a complete review because of this but I am only giving my opinion of what I read which was all similar in one form or fashion so I am operating under the assumption the I would have found all of the stories I left unread as unbearable as those I did read. If you think there is a story I should have read let me know. Before going any further I would say that according to the pros (which I am not), Kafka's writing is of great academic value which I do not dispute. The problem is that this didn't translate into enjoyable reading for me.The Good: According to the critics and those of the academic community the good is practically limitless. Unfortunately for me I couldn't find any of it.The Bad: I just didn't enjoy a single moment that I spent with my nose in this book. The stories I read were boring and full of uninteresting characters, subject matter and plot-less storylines that tended to meander everywhere and go nowhere. To top that off the characters were generally placed in bad situations with no hope of a positive outcome and a lack of desire to look for one. The stories and characters are basically just overly morose and depressing. I slogged on this for as long as I could but found myself constantly wondering why I was reading it since I was enjoying none of it.Overall: Academic value = 5 stars.

Such stories as 'The Metamorphosis,' 'In the Penal Colony,' 'The Hunger Artist,' and 'The Great Wall of China' encapsulate the tyrannical, dehumanizing regimentation of the modern world. Kafka may be difficult to read, and the allegorical form is not enjoyable for everyone. However, it is impossible to not be drawn into the strange madness of 'The Hunger Artist,' or 'The Country Doctor,' surely two of the most terrifying works of literature of the period.In many ways, Kafka was a precursor to the sort of self-reflexive artistry that would later be found in Beckett, Sartre, and Brecht; Kafka is always aware that he is working within the literary realm, and he knows that he cannot escape it. Therefore, (brilliantly), he turns it into an advantage, by intoning the mystical, the metaphysical, and the surreal. His characters are often animals, metaphors, or simply moods. This approach has its strengths, but only in the hands of a true master. Fortunately for us, Kafka was just that, in the truest sense: a master of form, and unity of content."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"The best place to start with Kafka is with his short stories, and here we have all of his stories, published and unpublished, complete and incomplete, in one volume. The longer ones include masterpieces such as The Metamorphosis, In the Penal Colony, and A Hunger Artist. Also included are 2 short introductory parables, Before the Law, and An Imperial Message, which perfectly set the tone for what is to follow.Kafka's troubled life can obviously be used as a reference point for his literature, but the stories stand alone as disturbing, often humorous, unique, and concise yet complex examinations of the human condition. Much is made of conflicts with outside forces over which the individual has no control, but the primary struggle is with oneself and is spiritual in nature. Kafka is a master at using irony and many of his stories end with satiric plot twists and sarcastic character revelations. The 1st line in the postscript mentions Albert Camus remarking that the whole art of Kafka consists in compelling the reader to re-read him. It's an astute observation, and when put into practice, reveals the genius inherent in Kafka's work. It's ability to continually ask more profound questions of us, rather than give pat answers or provide facile solutions to the dark riddles and dilemmas we all face in life to varying degrees.John Updike provides an illuminating intro and the Muir's translations are excellent."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka's short stories are amazing. Few authors really harness tragedy like he does. Take &quot;The Penal Colony&quot; for instance. Kafka invents an ultimate devise of capital punishment, making it vile and disgusting, but coaxing the reader to almost rationalize the purpose of it's existence. As you finish the story though, you realize that it's not about an inhumane killing devise, but instead one man's obsession with it, and it's historical purposes. In a sense the story is a bad-mouthed eulogy of that man.One of Kafka's biggest achievements is his ability to have the reader sympathize with the &quot;bad guy&quot;. Few authors can really get a reader emotionally involved with the book.So take home this book and sit in an under-lighted room as you read it, but be prepared. Soon you will find yourself lost within the words of Franz Kafka."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"This is a collection which first appeared about 60 years ago and has been published a number of times with small variations in the selected works.Franz Kafka (1883 - 1924) was one of the major German-language fiction writers of the 20th century. He was a Jew living in Prague and working for the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute. He wrote in his spare time and was inspired by the problems associated with bureaucratic institutions - such as we read in \\"The Castle.\\"I read all of Kafka's work and put together this Listmania list from my notes and experiences. His short novella Metamorphosis is among the best short works ever written. Unfortunately, he did not write and publish much when he was alive. Most of what is available was published after his early death, and some of it is edited (possibly) poorly as in Amerika. His writings vary from novels to one page impressions of life, such as one essay that is about looking out a window. The novels revolve around a young to middle aged protagonist male named \\"K,\\" who battles the courts and bureaucrats.At some point while reading his works, I realized that his short stories are just as important as the novels, or even more so, and Metamorphosis is just one of a number of excellent short works involving compulsion and one's view of life. So, the present book is an excellent buy for those who want to learn about Kafka.Overall, I like \\"Metamorphosis\\" for its originality. After reading many of his works I got to the point where I had read enough, because many of his writings are just fragments. Some might want to read all his sort stories in one go, but I did not because of all the fragments. In any case, this collection with a forward by Updike is an excellent buy or read, well worth the time. The following short stores are complete works and not fragments: Hunger Artist, A Country Doctor, A Little Woman, The Penal Colony, and the Judgment. The Penal Colony goes even farther than Metamorphosis; and as such, it is an odd reading experience, having almost a nightmare quality to the story. A few of the others are bizarre as well. In any case, an English reader will always wonder if he completely understands or has fully appreciated the translated German writing.This is recommended as a basic introduction. It is missing The Stoker but it has his key short works."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"The fact that Kafka's 55 short works (many unfinished, some only a paragraph long, and some not published during his lifetime) are included in this volume make it invaluable."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Who could argue with the below reviews? The book is breathtaking. The short fiction is not really a &quot;good introduction&quot; to Kafka, though, it is Kafka at his best. In relation to what the top 10 reviewer (with whom I otherwise very much agree) says below, however, I would add that this imagination did not merely spring from the &quot;ordinary life&quot; of an insurance clerk, but from the extraordinary historical condition of turn-of-the-century German and Jewish Prague. Two recommendations: Mark Anderson's *Kafka's Clothes* is a literary analysis of several of these works in the context of the declining Habsburg Empire; Scott Spector's *Prague Territories* relates Kafka's whole generation of German-Jewish Prague writers to the nationality conflict between Czechs, Germans, and Jews. Contexts for Kafka!"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka is much more then the Metamorphosis and the Trial, and this collection demonstrates why. Kafka offered much while he delivered little, meaning that he opens up a universe of possibilities while confirming nothing. Nothing materializes, everything is fog. Stories that sound as if they're going to reveal the meaning of life end up only irritating you, and others, such as A Crossbreed, bore you until the final few sentences when you suddenly realize what you've been reading, and almost cry. Here is a line from Prometheus, which seems to elucidate a main theme of Kafka's writing: \\"As it came out of a substratum of truth it had in turn to end in the inexplicable.\\"Kafka yearns for beauty and writes for truth, but what ends up on the page is often uncertain, vague and close to demonic in its preoccupation with the grotesque. His writing came out of a desire for truth and it had in turn to end in the inexplicable. So, truth metamorphoses (if I may..) into the inexplicable.Also take note: the book is divided into The Longer Stories and the Shorter Stories, and some of the best Kafka is in the final section, which is the Shorter Stories. Watch out for The Bucket Rider, A Crossbreed, Prometheus, Poseidon, The City Coat of Arms... too many to mention!"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"There is nothing else that inspires me to write like these stories. In particular, the ultra-short ones, &quot;A Message From the Emperor&quot; and &quot;Before the Law&quot; made me realize the way in which a writer can create. I read them and imagine a blank page before him. Within the page, or two, he created something which has been burnt into the minds of those who have read it. Oddly enough, these stories have led me to consider extremely long works (such as Anna Karenina or Crime and Punishment) as, quite possibly, not worth the time. I only think that way every other day though.Besides the fabulous ultra-shorts, the just-plain-regularly-short length stories are brilliant. (please don't use that term incorrectly. I'm trying to introduce it worldwide. Just kidding.) &quot;Josephine the Singer&quot; is my favorite short story and my favorite work of Kafka's. I believe it was his final work as well. It is absolutely bizarre, but powerful."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Most of the stroies are gems.Kafka's unique style lies with the way he uses the language - he manages in bringing the reader to the darkest corners of the psyche using a matter-of-fact, almost bland collection of allegedly objective observations on his protagonists' emotions, thoughts and behaviours. These protagonists are sometimes human beings but some are neither human nor animals...One could call them Kafka imagination's progeny.The reason I give it only 4 stars is because some of the stories are bordering on ...boring. I guess the reason in having them in this edition is in order to be able to call it 'The Complete Stories'.Thus - if you are ready to accept some less than stellar writing, you'll be rewarded in most of the book by an extraordinary style and truly 'kafkaesque' ideas."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"This book contains almost all of Kafka's literary works, save his full length novels.Kafka's writing is representative for a large portion of modern literature. Although one can classify his works as dealing with alienation, assimilation, inferiority, and insecurities, they are, on some level, impenetrable by interpretors. His prose is clear and easily readeable; however, the implications of his story remain troubelsome and confounding.Kafka's writing style betrays expected norms of literature. In the metamorphisis, the protaganist Gregor Samsa awakens from his sleep to find himself changed into a beetle. The story is about the ramifications of the event, and the expected pinnacle, his transformation itself, is barely attended too. Furthermore, Samsa seems to take his transformation in stride. He recognizes the uniqueness of his case, but thoughts of his own insanity, nor the impossibility of the situation are hardly voiced. By giving us the absurd and simultaneously sidelining it, Kafka is able to focus on other issues. Samsa's \\"otherness\\" as a beetle, now being an existential given, leads us to explore how being \\"other\\" works in relationship to family and other acquantices.Kafka is a truly marvelous writer, and if his writing seem paranoid and absurd, it adds to their literary quality. His concerns are not so unique as the positions his literary creations often find themselves in, and he provides an interesting voice on the conditions of modernity."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"this book was almost everything a book could possibly be. Kafka manages to make you think more with less then a page of text then some author do with a whole book. he frustrates you with his unfinished works, his incomprehensible ones, or his simplistic, straight-foreward ones (that you know must be much deeper, but can't seem to figure out how). it is brilliant and unintelligent, it is thought-provoking, and completely void of all logic, and it is all these things at once. If this is your first trip into the world of kafka then don't be dicouraged, some of it is bizarre to say the least, and can be very frustrating, but when you find that one story that manages to change the way you think and view the world, then you will begin to see his genius. But then again that's just my opinion and it's pretty irrevilent, but read the book anyway, YOU'LL LIKE IT"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"i've only read one of these buggers, which in my version is the first, DESCRIPTION OF A STRUGGLE. in it, a man walking down the street with an 'acquaintance' of his is drawn into a surreal dreamworld, where his acquaintance turns into a donkey, the storyteller commands the landscape to change, and a fat man is carried into a river and swept away. no doubt all of this has to do very directly with the unconscious mind, but i don't know tuppence about that. what i do know is it's absolutely brilliantly written, and putting the book down is like waking up from a beautiful nightmare. i strongly suggest that anyone with a few screws loose who isn't afraid to lose a few more pick up this book; it may even inspire you to write your own stuff, as it did for me."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"kafka is a nice change from the rest of literature. he makes me think anybody with a subconcious and a mental monologue can write fascinating stories. ie: he gives hope for me, which is somehow increased by how excellently neurotic and totally directionless most of his narrative is (The Burrow is my favorite thing ever!). I much appreciate how well the shorter stories let you see his habit of writing until he came to the end of an idea, and then starting somewhere else, and maybe joining them if he felt like it. this book is obviously a definitive sort of collection, and physically it has a very satisfying heft."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka's stories prove that he is a literary genius. His stories are easy to read and extremely deep. The light reader who just skims the page will not do that well with this book. But, if you are a person who loves to think about what you read, this book is for you. Kafka deserves much fame and intention because of his stories. Every story has an inner-message that can only be found by contemplation. The inner meaning usually has to do with life, respect, and love.Follow my advice, buy it, read it, love it, and E-mail me to tell me about it (allennickell@wesnet.com)."},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"With a great introduction by John Updike, this is the best Kafka short story compilation I have found to date. I have read a lot of Kafka and believe that his shorts include some of his best work. This version presents some of the cleanest translations I have encountered and I think that with them we receive a much more approachable translation. For and introduction to Kafka this book is a great point of departure and for the Kafka fan, both new and seasoned this is a great book to own.Including the famous Kafka shorts like the \\"Metamorphosis\\", \\"the Penal Colony\\" and \\"the Judgment\\" this book also contains some very short works that I would say are more indicative of his style including \\"Conversations With a Drunk\\" and \\"Conversations With a Worshipper\\". Some of these stories are so short that they barely span half of a written page and while they are arguably too short I suggest reading them first. Though some might read like a sucker punch by beginning and ending before you realize what occurred, these works will elucidate Kafka's style quicker than the longer shorts. If \\"The Trial\\" of \\"Amerika\\" is required reading (for students) or even if you have to read \\"The Metamorphosis\\" take some time and read some of these very short stories first, not only will you have a far better command of Kafka's style but you will sound more intelligent in your classroom discussions and your literary analysis when you refer to other works by the author. For the pleasure reader set you can follow this same advice as spending mere moments to read these works will only enrich the experience of reading Kafka's Larger works.Saving Literary analysis for another forum, I will go straight to the point of recommending this set of stories as the finest example of a Kafka shorts collection. Anyone who knows me well will know that I find the short story to be among the most enjoyable literary forms and that I have read more than my share of Kafka. This collection not only provides the most stories but presents them in a well thought out manner by including the very short stories in a section of their own. Since, undoubtedly, you will be reading this book often it is good to know that this a sturdy paperback that will sustain a great deal of abuse. I recommend that even if you don't buy this version read the stories, however if you are in the market for a Kafka short collection this is the one to buy. At a little over ten dollars you can't go wrong... Enjoy!-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Franz Kafka the Complete Stories","review":"Kafka is easy to read and yet impossible to pin down. Often the readers analysis and interpretation says more about the reader than about Kafka himself.

I enjoyed seeing all of this work in one collection; however, I thought the quality of the actual physical book was well below average.

The pages and binding are very pleasant.

I've been very disappointed with this book. It gives the exact same information as the Fireworks PDF manual does. Just repeating the basics is NOT why a person should write a book about a program. I've only used fireworks for a little while and there are some great things about the program. Unfortunately, this book did not give me the added info that I was looking for. It also doesn't even mention some very confusing things that take place when using the program. It does a poor job at describing why certain things happen... like simple Javascript rollovers. You can create 4 states for a rollover and have the option of including all or just one on your webpage. Unfortunately, the book doesn't go into detail about HOW to have the 3rd and 4th states show up on your webpage. When I emailed the author, Sandee Cohen, she gave me the same terse, incomprehensible answer as her book does about this. Another weird thing is when you export Javascript rollover images, it automatically creates a one pixel gif image that it inserts into the HTML table it creates for the rollovers, supposedly for &quot;proper alignment&quot; of the table. The program says nothing about this. I only noticed because this GIF isn't transparent and was creating these tiny black dots on my page. Not only does the book not even bother mentioning this, but when I emailed the author, she claimed that using this gif was ESSENTIAL for properly aligning images in a table. Frankly, in 2 1/2 yrs of studying web design, I've never heard nor read anything about this. No instructor or book that I've run across has even mentioned it. If it's so important as the author states, why doesn't the book address it?? I just took these annoying gifs out of my code... and the rollovers/images are just fine. So much for the ESSENTIALNESS of these gifs.Another example is that in the section on ImageMaps, the book doesn't mention that ImageMaps and Sliced object are exported slightly differently.... and doesn't even SAY in the ImageMap section, the information you need to know to export one!I could go on about the difficulties I encountered attempting to use this book.... but if you buy the book, you'll find out for yourself. Amazing how just a little book of only 250 pages can be so confusing to find what your'e looking for. Don't waste your $$. Just download the Fireworks PDF manual or use the one that came with the program until someone finally writes a comprehensive book about a pretty good program."},{"Title":"Fireworks for Windows & Macintosh (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book was good until Chapter 18 - which is where the How-to of creating rollovers begins. Beginning in Chapter 18, the author forgot she was writting for a Windows and Mac book and only wrote Mac instructions which are of course, very different from Windows.

My advice is to look elsewhere for a Fireworks book."},{"Title":"Fireworks for Windows & Macintosh (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book (despite it's intent) is not really a beginner's book. I'm not certain really where it belongs. The author fails to explain some things; as if taking it for a fact that the reader is a person with some experience. Now, bashing aside, I found the book useful in several cases. Fireworks is an awesome tool, especially when used in conjuntion with Dreamweaver. However, Fireworks is not an end-all be-all. Some of the &quot;side effects&quot; or quirks, ascribed to the book in previous reviews, are actually Fireworks doing. Where the author fails is in explaining these anomolies. The book is organized well with a chapter for each of the following subjects: Basics, Document Setup, Colors, Path Tools, Selecting Paths, Working With Objects, Fills, Strokes, Effects, Text, Automation, Pixels, Importing, Optimizing (this is really good), Animation, Hotspots/Links, Slices (a difficult subject, made easier by the author. I spent a lot of time here), Behaviors, and Exporting. There are appendices for: Defaults, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Regular Expressions. A decent index rounds out the book. I would have liked more in-depth information on connecting JavaScript to objects and also some of the pitfalls of integrating Fireworks projects into Dreamweaver, or integrating Flash objects into Fireworks. If you want to learn how to use Fireworks, then my suggestion is to go through the Tutorial included with the downloadable (and Full) versions of the product. If you would like to expand your knowledge or perhaps fill in the gaps, then this book is good for that.

I don't know how other law schools teach crim law but I find that this book's reflection on international criminal law is really interesting and makes for a nice break from the Model Penal Code. The book also dealt with sensitive topics like rape and assisted suicide gracefully. I'm not sure if I would recommend this book for light reading (this was obviously a required book for my crim law class) but if you were assigned this case book, you lucked out.

But the information in the ghost town guide books we had were too brief (and I've found inaccurate) to really understand what happened there. This short history is a well researched account of what happened along with some interesting photographs of the people and area a century ago. Though the authors are clearly sympathetic with Job Harriman (the colony's founder), it is largely a balanced account - a noteworthy accomplishment given the human emotion almost necessarily connected with the topic of socialism. Don't be put off by the obscure title of this book. The book is about Job Harriman, the bombing of the Los Angeles Times building in 1910, and Harriman's socialist community in the Rio del Llano. It will help you get the facts straight. I just finished reading the book, and I feel lucky I had the courage to purchase it sight unseen from Amazon."},{"Title":"Stick Kid","review":"I read this to myself prior to sharing with my children...I cried...I read with my older son (age 9) and we both cried...my sister read it and cried...It's beautifully written, simple enough even for the youngest, but so touching that you'll all enjoy it! Now one of our favorites...If you like The Giving Tree, you'll love this one too!"},{"Title":"Stick Kid","review":"Adorable book. Great for fun read alouds with children and also a great example of rhyming text. Illustrations are simple, but fun. Any child or adult can relate to this book because we have all drawn stick figures before, the only difference is that this one Stick Kid gets a back story.This book can also be used in the classroom, or at home to get children to draw a picture, whether it be their own stick person and get them to write or tell you a story about it. You can even have them make a series of pictures and have the kid(s) make their own book."},{"Title":"Stick Kid","review":"This is a wonderful, simple and endearing book that is perfect for preschoolers. My three-year-old son loves the rhyming and simple stick figures. The author/illustrator is exceptionally good at telling and showing a warm story that still brings a tear to my eye (I really sob when I read \\"The Giving Tree\\"!).I have been reading this book to my son as the last book at bedtime and it really helps him unwind, especially after reading smart-alecky gross-out books like \\"I Stink\\" (which he also enjoys).Please read the School Library Journal review above for a comprehensive description of why this book is so great."},{"Title":"Stick Kid","review":"My son and I love your books. They are as much for the parents as for the children. I give copies of them as gifts whenever I can.

But while Harold illustrates creative ingenuity, the Stick Kid is a more primal homunculus, the author's alter ego, and when he returns from his road to independence he reaffirms to us in a specific and very non-preachy way that what comes around, goes around--in this case, the self realized through unselfish love. Peter Holwitz has written a classic that is far more profound than it appears at first glance, and certainly deserves more than ten reviewers here."},{"Title":"Stick Kid","review":"I found this book \\"accidently\\" at the library.

I checked it out because I liked the cover. I ended up buying it because I loved the book!Perhaps both Max and I were right: he enjoyed the Clifford books and they were written with his age in mind. I loved Stick Kid and it was written more for me than him.I read it to Max three nights running before my wife joined us for story time. I read Stick Kid. When I get to that part where you finally realize what it's about, she cried on cue.I've since bought Scribbles: loved it to.

The following five chapters are dedicated to a specific movement of the work. \\"Mythologiques\\" is mainly concerned with the source text for the first movement, drawn from Levi-Strauss. \\"O King\\" details the structural properties of the pitch set and the rhythmic set, and the selective resonance of the second movement. For the discussion of the third movement, readers will want to obtain a copy of the score of Berio's work, as Osmond-Smith catalogues the numerous quotations according to the rehersal number they are found in. Osmond-Smith explains the \\"obliteration as form\\" that makes the use of the Mahler quotation so idiosyncratic. The fourth chapter treats the fourth and fifth movements together. Discussion of the fourth movement is very brief, only two pages, but the fifth is exhaustively covered.When I first got a copy of \\"Sinfonia\\", I could relate easily only the zany third movement, which is quite accessible. Osmond-Smith's guide helped me better understand the other movements of the work. The book does indeed expand appreciation of Berio's composition."},{"Title":"The Malachite Palace","review":"This is a wonderful picture book, both the writing and the illustrations. It's about the cruelty and foolishness of snobbery. A very sweet little princess is kept inside the palace gates because the queen, the governess and the lady-in-waiting think she is too good to be mixing in with the riff-raff rabble kids outside the gates. She's not happy. One day the queen and her cronies trap a bird that has flown in to the palace but it isn't happy and starts to deteriorate, so the little princess helps it escape. In the process the princess makes a very important change in the way she is treated. The illustrations of this little princess are just perfect and they capture her emotions in such detail. The illustrations glow with a soft light and the deep green walls of the malachite palace add magic to the pictures and also a sort of innocence. This is a book that shows the strength that a child can have when they decide to live up to their true nature and think for themselves. It should help kids see that they can come up with ideas on their own for doing the right thing and that sometimes grown-ups can make mistakes. I love this book."},{"Title":"The Malachite Palace","review":"&quot;The Malachite Palace&quot; is a beautiful book about friendship and respect. The little princess is not allowed to play with the common children outside because they are &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;ignorant&quot;, according to her lady-in-waiting, governess, and the queen. One day she finds a little yellow bird, and decides to keep it for a friend. But being in the cage makes the little bird weak and sad, and the princess must find a way to set the bird free, and in doing so, show the women that watch over her that she cannot grow or be happy unless she is allowed to have friends.The illustrations in this book are exquisite, almost ethereal. It is a treasure for any children's library, and sure to be a favorite."},{"Title":"Jungle Island,","review":"For you, this book may be quaint and old-hat, but it made me interested in tropical field biology as a biology undergraduate.

It is a worthy attempt and it can be done - and has been done - but Mr. de Bellaigue was not very successful at it!One of the first hints of their upper-crust-ness comes early in the book, a few pages after he talks about Cardinal Maximilian de Furstenberg representing the Vatican during a celebration in Iran and how his grandmother \\"always referred to him as Uncle Max\\"; he accuses the Iranians around him to be \\"terrific name droppers\\". It takes one to know one. Later he relates a story of how his wife Bita, responds to a beggar woman's blessing with \\"choice insults\\" and for him not to see anything wrong with her actions and then sharing it with the rest of us simply reeks of self-perceived nobility and arrogance of the landed gentry. Unfortunately this \\"aristocratic\\" mentality colors everything he sees around him negatively and in black.There are two facets to this book. One the discourse on general Iranian society and culture, and the second the eight year war with Iraq. On the former the book is grossly lacking and what it conveys are only through jaundiced eyes. On the aspect of the war the book is more valuable because it relays some historical facts. There are things to be learned from it as long as the reader takes care to discard any personal and subjective interjections that the author makes. Of course he fills some of the historical voids with a vivid imagination - mostly qualifying them with maybes and perhapses but sometimes letting it pass as facts.The problem that I have with the first facet of the book is that it is littered with gratuitous insults to Iranians and things Iranian. Granted, all subtly hidden but insults nevertheless. For example:* One of the characters he has chosen to represent the average post-revolutionary Iranian is someone that he himself labels a \\"delinquent, a thug, a menace to society\\" and uses him as an example of an average Iranian! Would anyone get away with picking, following, and writing about an inner-city gang-banger - even one who has changed his ways - as representing the majority of Americans? I doubt it.* Driving through streets while documenting \\"former names\\" of each road he passes he mentions a square with:\\"...a scum of shared taxis.\\" Is it the taxi itself that is scum or the fact that it is shared? Or maybe just the people sharing it. Also, what is the significance of giving the previous names of roads and highways? The names were changed 25 years ago for ideological reasons and/or to honor a fallen soldier, but so what? By meticulously documenting the \\"old\\" names of the roads he is just placating his immediate peers and monarchists that to this day refuse to use the new names for the main reason of: \\"The Shahanshah (king of kings) himself had named this road and no one is authorized to change it but HIM\\"! A royal fatwa if you will.* On mullahs and their seminary cells (not unlike a monk's cell) where they live and study, he writes:\\"If they marry, their cells may be passed on to a son, with familiar smells and unwashed tea things.\\" Why the \\"unwashed\\"? Are they all dirty? Not to mention the obvious - like what happens to the cell while the mullah is married, moved out, and awaiting his son to be born and come of age? Is it kept empty for years with the unwashed tea things inside, or will they wash it and then dirty it up before the son is about to move in?* While meeting a subject over lunch he describes the food:\\"The kebabs were filthy, recently defrosted and served with insipid rice cooked with yesterday's oil.\\" And of course after such a fitting meal for a gourmand that can even date the cooking oil one has to have \\"dead bag in tepid water\\" for tea!* Passing a group of 20 sleeping travelers in a park he observes that they ALL wear polyester trousers, and ALL smell of sweat AND \\"decomposing meat in the gaps between their teeth\\"!* A vet who has lost his legs in the war \\"bounded like a chimp\\"* The red carpet in someone's house is \\"lurid\\"! For a country that is renowned for its carpets, he manages to see and describe only two of them, the lurid one and then when he is meeting 10 war veterans in a park they are sitting on a rug that has \\"the image of a nine-year-old girl with a perm and blue eyeliner.\\"* Politicians \\"inclined to stubble and greasy suits\\"! (How do you grease up a suit by the way? I wouldn't mind one myself. It would make it easy to put on and take off.)* Even fictional characters in novels are not free of his stabs. A fictional character's title that roughly corresponds to a baroness or lady is referred to as \\"absurd and self-regarding sobriquet\\"! Good thing uncle Max is not around the read this.* Tea houses are \\"coarse and dirty\\"* Iranian bread is like a \\"mattress\\"* From how vigorously a person exercises in a gym he guesses \\"that he let out a lot of aggression in 1979.\\"* From a shrug of a mother of dead soldier to the question of if she hangs out with other mothers that have sons killed in the war, he surmises that she is saying she is better than them and would not hang out with the riffraff. Not that it may simply mean \\"Not Really.\\", \\"Why?\\", \\"To what purpose?\\", or \\"It will not bring my son back.\\"These and other examples of underhanded pokes that make fun of and insult local customs no matter how irrelevant or banal is what gets on my nerves most about this book. Like when he talks about \\"sowan - the parched caramel, embedded with pistachio shards, that masquerades as a local speciality\\"! It is as though some one writing about history of the US post Vietnam and touching on Kennedy's election campaign in Chicago would suddenly take time to mention Chicago-style pizza as a \\"rubbery, doughy concoction, embedded with pepperoni, that masquerades as food!\\" It is rude and irrelevant not to mention distracting to the subject at hand.And talking about distracting this book has taken a page straight out of the Tarantino's \\"linear story-telling is not the only game in town\\" and then added a few gimmicks of its own by filling it with inappropriate hackneyed interjections. There is so much jumping back and forth in time, from person to person, and place to place that it not only confuses the reader but it almost makes the book unreadable.And I assume just to be able to withstand any complaints like the ones I make he has thrown in \\"Iran has beauty and ugliness in the same elusive hue.\\" Sure. And you would be hard pressed to find any of the beauty in this particular book - it is elusive, after all. Just like the closet racist that after hours of ranting against a people ends by \\"but don't get me wrong I ain't got nothin' against them people, as a matter of fact some of my best friends are blacks.\\"Plus sometimes there are some shocking errors in the book that cast doubt on other areas. For example on page 67 he mentions a character that \\"trimmed his beard, rather than shaved it, for revolutionary grooming contends that shaving is a Western effeminacy.\\" If he had done basic research - very basic, like asking the first passerby in the street - why people trim their beard rather than shave, he would have known that it has absolutely nothing to do with the revolution but because Islam requires it. After all if you can't fact check a basic thing like the reason for not shaving then how can I trust the fact checking on other issues? But I guess after the scandal of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and how the publishers came out on mass in their own defense saying that genre of \\"memoirs\\" are not fact checked and are considered somewhat fiction - something they claimed everyone in the publishing industry is aware of but the general public needs to be educated about - then I shouldn't be surprised. It does say on the cover \\"A memoir of Iran\\"!It really is a sad truth that we live in a time that an intelligent educated man like Mr. de Bellaigue uses all his gifts to malign. It is rare to feel such venom in the works of an author that lives in Iran and is married to an Iranian but that is what comes across most in this book. All he is interested in doing, as he himself tells it after \\"regretting\\" for having told a truth (!) is to \\"jab a needle into Mr. Zarif's smug, certain shell.\\" Except what he really wants to do is not just to jab one person but the whole of a nation.In conclusion, if you are not Iranian and read this book, you will get an impression that has very little to do with Iran and Iranians. But if you are Iranian and can look past the venom there are some interesting aspect of Iranian culture and way of life that you will be introduced to. Aspects that an outsider can have a better view of and explain more objectively. And finally if you are one of Iranian monarchists living in Southern California or the suburbs of DC you will be in heaven. I am sure Mr. de Bellaigue will autograph your copy with pleasure."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"Mr. de Bellaigue's prose is superb and he had many interesting experiences in Iran; It is obvious he wore out a lot of shoe leather writing this book. We are treated to a host of eclectic characters, from the daughter of murdered secular dissidents, to disillusioned former revolutionaries cum reformists, as well as the plight of everday Iranians who are getting by in a poorly managed, authoritarian theocracy.The problem I had with the book was Mr. de. Bellaigue's focus on seeing Iran through the lense of Shiite Islam. At one point he makes the absurd statement that \\"It is every Iranians' dream to go to Karballah (Iraq)\\". Anyone who spends more than a day in Tehran will see how hollow statements like these ring.Overall the book was very good, but if you're going to only read one book on contemporary Iran it should be Afshin Molavi's Persian Pilgrimages, which is in a class by itself."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"The book is so biased. It gave me this impression that the author closes his eyes to all aspects of Iranian culture and sees only what he wants to see: miserable, uneducated people possessing unrealistic ideas. This false attitude gives him some self satisfaction of being an European, which I believe makes his book intolerable.He is concerned with the lives and thoughts of Iran-Iraq war veterans but he cannot put it into the right context. He even fails to see how ideas of this unfortunate -but brave- minority differ from the majority of Iranian middle class who are highly educated.I lived 23 years in Iran and most of what I read in this book was totally new to me. He managed to invent \\"an average Iranian\\" which is too of a stranger to me. Are we talking about the same Iran? I do not know where the author has lived and which part of society he has been in contact with.In summary, he hates Iran and he cannot put his feeling away when he writes a book on Iran. This book only suits a narrow-minded reader who does not have any idea about Iran, still feels obliged to read some thing-no matter what."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"I loved this book. It is a unique blend of history, reportage, travelogue and memoir. It is flawed, because the author's voice doesn't feel fully formed, but this hardly matters alongside the absolute gems it contains. Rivetting description of Khomeni's oratorical style, anedotes which take you right inside the head of those who were ready to martyr themselves in the war with Iraq. I was in Iran in 1987 and this is the first book I have read that answers all the questions I have carried with me since then. Furthermore, anyone who can write a line like \\"matchsticks marinated in Chanel\\" to describe the privileged young women of North Tehran has a special place in my heart. I can't wait to read his novel, for the book has \\"novelist waiting to burst forth\\" written all over it."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"While this book provides some interesting details about life in Iran, I was expecting that it would provide a deeper, more critical analysis. Instead, it came across as a rather shallow, orientalist account of Iranian culture. I, too, lived in Iran, though not as long as the author. While it is true that for years following the Iran-Iraq war there was a national state of mourning, it is also true that there has been substantial change in national mood. With the presidency of Khatami, for example, suddenly murals and billboards of Khatami showed a smiling president. Likewise, images of Khomeini and Khamenei began to follow suit, providing a softer public image. Furthermore, Iranians themselves, whether in Iran or in the US laugh, joke, and carry on as much--if not more--than any culture. I lived in Iran for 6 months, and travel back and forth frequently. Despite the political situation, the numbers of Iranians who died in the 8 year war with Iraq, and other events, I think the Iranian people give us hope that people can find joy and perservere--even under difficult circumstances.There is much more to Iranian culture than Ashura and martyrdom."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"Someone implying to come from the upper-crust of the European society and having married into an upper-class Iranian family is trying to write about everyday culture and custom of the regular Iranian populace.

It is as though some one writing about history of the US post Vietnam and touching on Kennedy's election campaign in Chicago would suddenly take time to mention Chicago-style pizza as a \\"rubbery, doughy concoction, embedded with pepperoni, that masquerades as food!\\" It is rude and irrelevant not to mention distracting to the subject at hand.And talking about distracting this book has taken a page straight out of the Tarantino's \\"linear story-telling is not the only game in town\\" and then added a few gimmicks of its own by filling it with inappropriate hackneyed interjections. There is so much jumping back and forth in time, from person to person, and place to place that it not only confuses the reader but it almost makes the book unreadable.And I assume just to be able to withstand any complaints like the ones I make he has thrown in \\"Iran has beauty and ugliness in the same elusive hue.\\" Sure. And you would be hard pressed to find any of the beauty in this particular book - it is elusive, after all. Just like the closet racist that after hours of ranting against a people ends by \\"but don't get me wrong I ain't got nothin' against them people, as a matter of fact some of my best friends are blacks.\\"Plus sometimes there are some shocking errors in the book that cast doubt on other areas. For example on page 67 he mentions a character that \\"trimmed his beard, rather than shaved it, for revolutionary grooming contends that shaving is a Western effeminacy.\\" If he had done basic research - very basic, like asking the first passerby in the street - why people trim their beard rather than shave, he would have known that it has absolutely nothing to do with the revolution but because Islam requires it. After all if you can't fact check a basic thing like the reason for not shaving then how can I trust the fact checking on other issues? But I guess after the scandal of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and how the publishers came out on mass in their own defense saying that genre of \\"memoirs\\" are not fact checked and are considered somewhat fiction - something they claimed everyone in the publishing industry is aware of but the general public needs to be educated about - then I shouldn't be surprised. It does say on the cover \\"A memoir of Iran\\"!It really is a sad truth that we live in a time that an intelligent educated man like Mr. de Bellaigue uses all his gifts to malign. It is rare to feel such venom in the works of an author that lives in Iran and is married to an Iranian but that is what comes across most in this book. All he is interested in doing, as he himself tells it after \\"regretting\\" for having told a truth (!) is to \\"jab a needle into Mr. Zarif's smug, certain shell.\\" Except what he really wants to do is not just to jab one person but the whole of a nation.In conclusion, if you are not Iranian and read this book, you will get an impression that has very little to do with Iran and Iranians. But if you are Iranian and can look past the venom there are some interesting aspect of Iranian culture and way of life that you will be introduced to. Aspects that an outsider can have a better view of and explain more objectively. And finally if you are one of Iranian monarchists living in Southern California or the suburbs of DC you will be in heaven. I am sure Mr. de Bellaigue will autograph your copy with pleasure."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs has many strengths and was the sort of book I wanted to like more than I did. The prose is sharp and vivid, with some inventively insightful images/phrases. The insights into Iran range from the large (politics, society as a whole, the future of the revolution) to the small and personal (rhetorical offerings of favors/courtesies not meant to be accepted, family tensions). But thanks to the episodic, impressionistic nature of the work, I never felt a strong sense of cohesiveness or narrative.\\"Memoir\\" is probably somewhat of a misnomer, as there is very little about Bellagiue's experiences in the book and \\"memoir\\" as well tends to imply a relatively straightforward narrative whereas Garden is actually more a collection of encounters/interviews/interactions with various members of Iranian society layered between descriptions/explanations of ancient (centuries ago) and more recent (especially 1970 on) Iranian history.On the one hand, it's a nice mix of abstract history and personal impact of that history, especially with regards to the Iraq-Iran war, which takes up much of the book's focus. On the other hand, the mosaic approach didn't quite add up for me, though it does perhaps make a nice companion piece to other, more mundane memoirs such as Persepolis and Reading Lolita in Tehran, two works I enjoyed more though they lacked the detailed history.The range of characters offers up a nice cross-section of Iranian society, the almost incomprehensible human tragedy of the war is vividly conveyed, and Bellaigue makes Iran come alive in human terms more than any magazine article or policy book can. Some of the characters I found more compelling than others, and one of the reasons I didn't find the book completely enjoyable is that I had less interest in Hossein Kharrazi, a military leader and martyr who takes up a significant portion of the book.While the nature of the anecdotal approach didn't do much for me, there's no denying the author's talent with language or his skills of social observation/analysis. I'm guessing the book would have gone down better over a few days, a chapter or two at a time, rather than one or two long reading stretches, more like how I would have read a collection of short stories. That would be my recommendation at least.Recommended, with a few reservations due to the structure and the somewhat inaccurate description of it as \\"memoir\\", Not as enjoyable from my viewpoint as Reading Lolita or Persepolis, but a good companion book, one that could be read a bit at time while reading the others more straight through."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"Christopher de Bellaigue's book sounded like a great idea - an outsider now living in Iran looking back to the Revolution and War (the one fought against Iraq in the eighties) through the eyes of some of its protagonists. The issue is the book's \\"complicated structure\\" (to quote an apt phrase from a previous reviewer). I bought the book regardless thinking, \\"how difficult could it be?\\"Ummm...quite. The book is best described as a stream-of-consciousness collection of loosely connected vignettes. While de Bellaigue's knowledge of Iran and its rich history is impressive in both its depth and breadth (that I should know a subject so well!), there are uneven and choppily paced intersections of 13th-century holy men, the author rummaging around various cities and his transcription of \\"ah, my war gone by, I miss it so\\"-type reverie from his interview subjects. Again, great it theory, but in practice, well, it was really dificult to get any traction while reading this book."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"This is an honest and forthcoming account of everyday life in Iran.

But I would have expected a more rewarding read about the regular people of Iran, and their everyday lives, from a book with \\"memoir\\" in its subtitle. As other reviewers have noted, this book is damaged by a non-linear and diffuse construction that might be seen as literary or surreal by some readers, but which others will find unfocused and confused. de Bellaigue's character sketches and descriptions of daily life can be intriguing and informative, as you would expect from a good travel memoir &#8211; such as his membership in a traditional strongman club and his conversations with disabled war veterans. But these real-life vignettes are lost amid political and historical reporting that can be informative, but is presented in an unsatisfying fashion.de Bellaigue's prose gets too artistic at times, his passages are written in different narrative voices, and he tends to switch haphazardly from first to second to third person. His main historical events of interest are the Islamic Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War, but these are presented in a chopped up fashion, spread out in pieces across the book and not even in chronological order. de Bellaigue also introduces some episodes that would be of interest to his Western readers, especially the Iran-Contra scandal and Bush's recent \\"axis of evil\\" speech, but he then almost immediately dismisses these crucial developments as unimportant. de Bellaigue also occasionally displays the weakness of criticizing and second-guessing the customs and structures of a society in which he has been living as an outsider for just a few years. Fundamentally, the unfocused structure and diffuse writing result in a book that has no beginning, middle, or end, and delivers a very unrewarding read about an intriguing and enigmatic society.

Leaping backward and forward in history, the author, de Bellaigue, examines 25 years of revolution, as overshadowed by centuries of political and religious conflict. The fall of the Shah, Khomeini's rise to power, and the shifting alliances after his death resolve into a new kind of monarchy that, in the opinion of de Bellaigue and those he interviews, has betrayed the Revolution. Meanwhile, his images of Tehran - the city and its people - form a dramatic mosaic as richly varied as Dickens' London.The book's title is a reference to the Iran-Iraq War, when tens of thousands of young, poorly-trained, under-equipped Iranian men gave up their lives in mostly ill-conceived and unrealistic military ventures. In the account of this decade-long bloodletting, de Bellaigue makes clear that the carnage was the result of both blind religious devotion and the utter failure of leadership. Years later, while survivors suffer respiratory failure from Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons, the memory of that time and the magnitude of sacrifice sadly and ironically fade. The only significant achievement of the Revolution and war with Western-backed Iraq has been a hard-won independence from foreign powers.De Bellaigue, an English journalist, casts himself as a stranger in a strange land and rarely regards anyone (there are a few remarkable exceptions) with anything but a skeptical eye. He hopes for an Iran that is true to the democratic ideals that inspired the Revolution, and he makes no secret of his contempt for Western governments that have undermined Iran's sovereignty. But the truth is elusive in this place where reality routinely takes a back seat to appearances. Whether talking to veterans of the War, the daughter of murdered dissidents, the parents of a young \\"martyr,\\" or an African-American Muslim living in Iran, he illuminates his subject compellingly. I highly recommend this absorbing and well-written book."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"Two and a half decades after the Islamic Revolution (the book was published in 2004), Iran clings tightly to its past, yet feels the tremors of change. Christopher de Bellaigue, a Brit who lives in Tehran with his Iranian wife and son, writes vividly of his encounters with revolutionaries, veterans, mullahs, and reformers, delivering a multifaceted collection of snapshots of Iran and its people.Among the revolutionary generation, a wistfulness and disappointment seems to pervade. They reminisce about the sense of purity and purpose the revolution brought, and they speak reverently of the spirit of wartime sacrifice. Still, despite the debilitating war wounds many suffer (including the effects of poison gas), and despite omnipresent reminders of the great legions of martyrs, reality has failed to live up to revolutionary ideals. De Bellaigue captures both the idealism of the revolution's \\"true believers\\" and the hypocrisy of many of its leaders. He also conveys the tragedy of a devastating eight-year war that could have been much shorter if Iran--initially fighting a defensive war--had not become so caught up in a war mindset that peace became unthinkable. The book impresses upon the reader just how deeply the concept of martyrdom is embedded in Iranian society, from the passion plays on Ashura reliving the martyrdom of Imam Hossein to the torture suffered in the Shah's prisons to the gruesome human wave assaults that hopelessly pitted youths against Iraqi troops. That many Iranians yearn for change is evident in the book, which brings up the youth-driven movement toward increased freedoms and the brutal suppression of dissent.De Bellaigue has a keen flair for writing and description, but the book's nonlinear quality makes it unfocused. The book takes the form of a series of vignettes, which sometimes jump around in a confusing way. It is an interesting read, however, and De Bellaigue portrays an Iran that is nuanced and dynamic, full of contradictions and conflict."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"This is the story of experiences during and after the Islamic Revolution In Iran in the 1970s. De Bellaigue is a British journalist married to an Iranian woman. He relates his own experiences thorugh a period of turmoil in modern Iranian history, and the stories of many friends and acquaintances.He has an engaging and artful style that details his own experiences, his interviews and encounters with leaders and victims of the Islamic Revolution. He also provides an almost incidental wealth of cultural observations.His insights and stories brign to life the people of Iran and the struggles with the competing ideologies that have torn at the country's heart for the last several decades. He reveals these as people like us -- struggling with real life, and most caught up in a complex stream of events and religio-political mosaic where the many suffer because of the few and their ideologies.The reader will be able to rise above the political stereotypes and empathize with what some of these individuals go through. Likewise most readers will also grieve and seethe with anger at the insensitivity of political power-grabbers and ideologues who seem to give no thought to the ordinary citizen whose lives are destroyed by their demagoguery.A great value for westerners -- and especially Americans -- is a portrayal of how the United States looks to an Iranian, aside from any political ideologies. Iranian history and culture come alive in a practical way, beyond the ordinary academic study of culture or religion you might read about Iran.This author's skillful and expressive command of the English language will mesmerize the reader with his delightful, artistic turns of phrase."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"This memoir reads like a compilation of thorough newspaper articles or short stories, I never quite knew where the book was going next. It contains snapshots of Iranian life, histories of people involved in the Revolution and people who oppose its growing hypocrisy, and the reflections of a foreigner trying to understand and be understood. I found it very enjoyable to read, an absorbing glimpse into the lives of people who are motivated in ways foreign to my experience and a testament to the difficulty of turning a revolution into a stable government worthy of its citizenry."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"The book opens and closes with descriptions of scenes from an Iranian festival celebrating the martyrdom of the Imam Hossein, hero of Iran's Shia Islam. Sandwiched in between are snippets of the country's history, snatches of the personal experiences of the author's life as a Westerner in Iran and descriptions of the lives of ordinary Iranians and their experiences of the Revolution, the Iran-Iraq war and life in post-revolution Iran. The theme of martyrdom seeps through all of these encounters and experiences, and we are presented with an assortment of attitudes to the sometimes senseless, sometime noble aspects of martyrdom in Iranian history. The book has moments of thought-provoking brilliance as the author presents us with some of the dilemmas and paradoxes faced by ordinary Iranians. It also has moments where things become disjointed and it is easy to lose the thread. In the end, the idea of martyrdom is not enough to hold together a loosely structured narrative that jumps back and forth in history and alternates historical explanations with the anecdotal stories of a large number of diverse characters.De Bellaigue never claims to have no personal opinions on the issues he is writing about and in fact he presents his own biases plainly on occasion. This does not prevent him from offering up alternative points of view, however, and these are the moments that become thought-provoking. It is a struggle to give this book a star rating. At some points it deserves 5 and at others 2. The author's masterful command of language rates a 5 throughout. All in all though, I would say it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"This is a well-written and engaging book.

When it comes to politics it is not as relevant and clear as it could have been."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"This book is perhaps one of the more original memoirs of Iran out there, in that it is less a personal history than a series of encounters with the people who got or didn't get the revolution they fought for in 1979. At times his subjects can be infuriating, as de Bellaigue really introduces readers to people who do not hide their fundamentalism. On the other hand it's what makes this account so fresh and new, that he talks to people others seem to avoid.

Might as well know who the \\"enemy\\" is."},{"Title":"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs : A Memoir of Iran","review":"Thumbing through Christopher de Bellaigue's \\"In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs,\\" I smelled a rat.Riddle me this: How is it that an Englishman who wrote what is being billed as a \\"searingly honest portrait\\" of life in modern-day Iran is not in, uh, jail?How is it that he is permitted, to this day, to reside in unmolested luxury and comfort in a tony suburb north of Tehran? Wouldn't anybody \\"honest\\" be either imprisoned or shoved on a plane?Answer: because his memoir is not \\"searingly honest.\\" Or any kind of honest, for that matter.That's right. de Bellaigue, who (forgetting to mention this in the book) about a decade ago converted to Shi'a Islam and married an Iranian, has managed to write a book about Iran that, while lovingly describing colorful characters, quaint locales, and heart-wrenching situations, never actually takes the trouble to specify where all the grief in this society is coming from! While he is competent at turning a phrase, his book ends up just flitting from anecdote to anecdote; he never manages (or bothers) to stitch his material into a more coherent (and therefore more condemnatory) narrative.What's worse, de Bellaigue is, without hitting you on the head about it, apologizing for the mullahs, for the oppression, for the blood. Not that he does this directly, no. But every description, every episode in the book, each island of woe that drifts into view is allowed to drift right back out of view without our cicerone's ever clarifying the serpent in the basement. Well, no, sorry: not in the basement anymore.If I were Iranian, I'd be fuming.I'm not even sure why de Bellaigue wrote this thing. I charitably stuck through the whole tour, waiting for it to take off, but it never did.

Although, for you, judgment is \\"as slippery as soap\\" (p. 276), I have no such impairment.Here's a few samples of what you're in store for:\\"In around 1970, while he was in Najaf, Khomeini delivered a series of lectures, subsequently collected and published, that put flesh on the bones of Nouri's longing. It was illogical, Khomeini argued, to suppose that God desired Islamic government only so long as there was an infallible guide -- the Prophet or the Imams -- to oversee it. Even now, during the occultation, the government of God should be implemented. Who was better qualified, he asked, to oversee Islamic rule, than the doctors of Islamic law -- the senior jurists, or 'mojtaheds'\\"? (p. 100)\\"Mullahs study so that they can use their knowledge of God's will, and their God-given rationalism, to extract he law. They have tools: their knowledge of Arabic, grammar, rhetoric and logic. these help them when it comes to learning a set of principles for deriving the law from its sources.\\" (p. 104)\\"Having been perfectly dynamic during the 1980s, the Islamic Republic is now inert.

Bill Clinton's biggest tragedy as a president was that he did not live through a time of crisis (beyond those sordid ones that he created for himself) because the evidence suggests he could have risen to the challenge with the utmost skill. He was a truly fascinating politician with an a amazing and powerful love of the game of politics. This book hits all the high (and low) lights of his reign and often gives a balanced and intelligent assessment. The author touches effectively on the changes brought to goverment by the arrival of Baby Boomers into government, such as Clinton and his easily bested foe, Newt Gingrich, in order to supply a context for the narrative. The book is short so it does not dwell on policy issues and cabinet ministers much but it is a nicely done remembrance piece."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I've been a big fan of Klein's previous work on Primary Colors and was looking forward to reading a book that might shed some light into Clinton's strengths and weaknesses.

If you want a look at the flaws and strenghts of current boomer generation of politicians, this is sure to satisfy as well.Klein does a good job of looking at clinton within the context of the whole, the modern bloodsport of politics, the games the spin and how clinton mastered and ran amok by these things. If a clinton sympathizer this book will have you cheering at times, boiling at other times. If you are jaded by politics today, you will be 'emerald' after reading this book.However,I think he is too forgiving of Clinton's tendency to self destruct due to his own personal/character weaknesses. He is too generous in his analysis when he begins to explain why clinton failed because 'He was never really tested'...and at times I think he still struggles with TB-itis (reference from primary colors)."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"This book isn't likely to please either Clinton's critics or defenders.Joe Klein essentially argues that Bill Clinton was a man both of many virtues and many flaws, and I think that is a fair assessment of this book as well. On the one hand, this is perhaps the first attempt at a fair and reasoned understanding of who President Bill Clinton was. Most books on Clinton have either been poorly documented and badly researched attacks on him, or well documented and better researched books explaining how poorly documented and badly researched that first wave of books was. In other words, books like Conason and Lyons superb THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT, provided a massive amount of documentation correctly the scurrilous attacks of Clinton's previous critics. These books, however, primarily say much, much more about Clinton's attackers and the attackers of the attackers rather than about Clinton himself. The great virtue of THE NATURAL is that Klein attempts to focus primarily on Clinton himself.Bill Clinton disappointed Joe Klein. Clinton was, in Klein's estimation, enormously knowledgeable, intelligent, well intentioned, and insightful. Why, then, was Clinton not a great president? Klein has several answers to this. First, Clinton was never really tested as president. There was never a serious crisis facing the US during his eight years in the White House, nothing comparable to 9-11 or Pearl Harbor or the Cuban Missile Crisis. Therefore, there was a sense in which he was never tested. Klein does, however, point out that Clinton does not, perhaps, get the credit he deserves for his role in providing the US with eight of the most peaceful years in US history. Second, Klein shows a number reasons that Clinton was ineffective as president, Monica Lewinsky aside. For instance, his ability to see both sides of issue frequently made it difficult for him to decide which side he was going to come down on. Other problems include his love of meetings and intellectual jam sessions rather than making decisions; his inability to work well with the press; poor decisions regarding the make up of the White House Staff; his constant attention to polls and aligning his policies with them in mind.On the other hand, Klein also wants to give Clinton his due. His two terms were eight years of unhindered economic growth, which Klein in part credits Clinton for because some key decisions he made. For instance, lowering the national debt and engendering surpluses, which made possible lower interest rates. He also praises him for the earned income credit, which was for all practical purposes a lower class tax cut for the working poor. In this instance, money was given to those in the greatest need, but to take advantage of it, one had to be working. Klein points to many other similar achievements that had a substantive effect on the US economy; not terribly sexy accomplishments, but having a very definite effect on the US economy nevertheless.Some of the best sections of the book are Klein's discussions of and interviews with previous Senate and House Leaders from both sides of the aisle, who lament the decay of bipartisanship that was brought about by the Gingrich revolution. The criticism in this book is not partisan. In fact, there seems to be more regret on the part of the Republicans interviewed, like former GOP House Leader Bob Michel and Bob Dole, than by Democrats. I also found his reflections on why the Baby Boomers have yet to produce a truly great political leader comparable to leaders of previous generations.The book, however, has some very serious organizational problems. In fact, it isn't clear that the book has any organization at all. There are chapter markings, but it isn't clear why. The topics and events covered flow into each other, and there is not clear demarcation of subjects. In short, the book seems to ramble from one topic to another, sometimes leaving a subject for good, sometimes returning to it at a later date. Nonetheless, this is a very interesting book that both Clinton's detractors and his defenders can read with profit. And the probably effect on any open-minded individual will be to make his critics a little more appreciative of his positive contributions, and his defenders a bit more critical of his presidency."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein, the author of Primary Colors, probably is the most perceptive commentator on Clinton. The Natural is an analysis of Clinton's tenure as President. Klein is a moderate Democrat, and his political bias shows through at some points. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem; however, in this case, a few good points are obscured by writing that falls into hack political journalism a little too much.At a few points, \\"The Natural\\" inexplicably leaves its analysis of Clinton to discuss the rise of smear politics, the hypocrisy of the Right that impeached Clinton, or the bias of the media against Clinton. I disagree with some of the points he makes on these subjects, and I agree with some. However, the real problem is that it makes the book oddly disconnected, and seperates Klein from the real reason to read him: his perceptions on Clinton. The discourses that Klein goes off are only tangentially related to Clinton.. In a larger book, with more space, they would be appropriate. However, they take the place in \\"The Natural\\" of more relevant information. One gets the sense that Klein was trying to score political points, when all you want him to do is describe Clinton honestly.Still, there are major themes in this book that make it worthwhile. Klein tackles questions such as what Clinton will be remembered for, why the Lewinsky scandal gained such traction, who had his ear at what time in his Presidency, and which of his qualities accounted for his successes. He makes solid arguments that Clinton accomplished a good deal of real policy work as President (a rather new assertion), and excellently documents the workings and powers in the Clinton White House.\\"The Natural\\" is by no means the definitive book on the Clinton Presidency. It is, however, by far the best available to us at the moment."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein's inside expose of the Clinton White House, &quot;The Natural&quot;, is a compelling and intelligent look at the entire scope of Clinton's much disputed yet ultimately successful presidency.Not a glorified Clinton loving book, The Natural takes an insider's look at the inner workings of the White House, through the eyes of one Joe Klein. Klein is both objective and supportive, critical and understanding. He holds nothing back in his examination of the eight years Clinton sat in the White House. From Monica Lewinsky to Hillary to many of Clinton's legislative endeavors, it's all there.Klein manages to paint this picture by a somewhat standoffishness through the book. There are appropriate times he interjects himself into the tome, but it's never hindering or borthersome. In fact, it reminded me that he really was an insider, and that his viewpoints clearly had the ability to be one-side, but he is much more broad than that.Clearly, those who will relelentlessly bash this book without ever reading it are merely fooling themselves. The Natural is a book that reminds us of the man we elected twice to our countries highest office, who oversaw a time of great prosperity, who suffered from his humanness as we all do, and has lived to tell the tale. The Natural is part of that tale, and a great addition to it."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I have to admit that Klein's book about the Clinton presidency is one of the most objective accounts of Clinton I have ever seen. Although friendly with the ex-prez, Klein pulls no punches and presents Clinton's presidency warts and all. In the end we all know what Clinton did, but Klein gives us more insight as to the \\"whys\\" of his actions. Is Clinton the greatest president of all time? No. Is he the worst? Not even close. If all books on presidents were written as objectively as this one, we would all have a better understanding of what makes these men tick.Is Clinton a better president than W? You tell me: peace and prosperity vs. war, a declining stock market, and skyrocketing gas prices."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein is a terrific writer. And this book is excellent overview of the Clinton years. It's a balanced portrait of Clinton's successes as weighed against his many failures. But what makes this book a remarkable achievement is how insightful a political analyst Klein is. Klein is able to capture through reasoned analysis a portait of Clinton that is more than conjecture. And in the in end, what Klein is able to extrapolate about the Clinton presidency is that Clinton was so successful because he was not restricted by the narrow confines of ideology. Clinton was a an orignal thinker, comfortable in the company of his Republican adversaries becuase he didn't dismiss them or their concerns out of hand. He relished the role of political negotiation. Much to their dismay, the conservative the right (as opposed to the moderate right) had to take objection to Clinton's person because they didn't have a legitimate political case to oppose him on principal. As a result they attacked his character. Unfortunately for Clinton, his character was an easy target becuase he was a man prone to indulging his appetites.To be sure, however, Klein doesn't think that Clinton was a President who didn't make political mistakes. Clearly he did. Some of them, were even egregious offenses, notbaly the pardon of Marc Rich. For all that though, Clinton succeeded becuase he was not an ideaolgue. He was a thinker. And as such, he was free to change his mind."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Breaks down Clinton's presidency by taking out the womanizing stories and actually analyzes how Clinton's policies led to the the biggest economic boom the US has ever seen. Discusses the Republicans strategies to bring him down and how Clinton devised his strategy to combat them."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"It is nearly impossible to think objectively about Bill Clinton, the man or his administration. In THE NATURAL, Joe Klein, the once-anonymous author of PRIMARY COLORS, gives us a concise, balanced history of the Clinton presidency. He provides a fair account of Bill Clinton: we are not spared his self-pity or the scale of his appetites and indulgences, but we also see the seriousness and vision he brought to the nation's leadership.The Clinton administration had a rocky beginning, noted for its nave political blunders. Remember Travelgate? How about the mere possibility of universal health care? The Clintons relied heavily on their friends, who were not always the wisest or most capable choices. One of the strengths of THE NATURAL is its portrayal of key relationships. We learn a lot about the former president through Mr. Klein's account of his complex marriage and Mrs. Clinton's formidable, imperfect influence. He also describes the similarities and differences between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, who led the failed Republican revolution and masterminded one of the nastiest, most counter-productive political arenas in American history.It is unfortunate that Bill Clinton's comprehensive understanding of economics will not be what history remembers about his presidency. Mr. Klein points out that balancing the budget was a tremendous gamble and the budget surplus Clinton left the next administration was unprecedented. His sound policies --- welfare reform, Internet commerce, the earned income tax credit --- provided a base for financial prosperity that we are unlikely to see again. One of the melancholy notes of the book is the sense of squandered talent and opportunity. What else might Bill Clinton have accomplished if he had not been so distracted?Bill Clinton was under constant attack from the right wing and the scandal-hungry media. He fended off investigations into his avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War, his use of marijuana, his finances, his extramarital affairs, his wife's law practice and not one of the fanatics determined to destroy him made the slightest impact until he lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern. Why did he give his assailants such a wealth of ammunition to use against him? How could such a smart man make such a stupid mistake? We may never know what he was thinking, but the disappointment and disillusionment of the president's staff and supporters practically soak through the page.The strange thing about THE NATURAL is how distant the Clinton presidency seems. September 11, 2001 was a moment of such enormous import in American history that the overwrought peccadilloes Bill Clinton became known for now seem trivial. Bill Clinton never faced a challenge to the presidency like al-Qaeda's attacks; he made his own challenges. It will take a much longer, more in-depth book to really examine Bill Clinton's complicated character, but THE NATURAL captures his administration, a time that is simultaneously recent history and a long time ago.--- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn"},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"In this publication Klein essentially presents a summary of the Presidential career of Bill Clinton. Any reader of previous Klein commentary knows that, on the whole, Klein likes Clinton a good deal; however, he avoids becoming an apologist that the likes of Frank Bruni and Bob Woodward seem to have become with President Bush. He makes available criticisms of Clinton--both political and ehtical--at least as quickly as he does praises. In the end, this seems to be the culmination of the very vivid picture that Klein has been painting of Bill Clinton the man and politician ever since _Primary Colors_. The prospective reader should note before beginning that there is no controversial argument at work here (apart from what is already controversial about the President), nor is _The Natural_ a systematic synthesis based on study of recent history; this is merely a summary of the events of Clinton's presidency with subsequent commentary. Particularly engrossing is the section just over halfway through the book in which Klein succintly recounts the history behind the presently bitter partisanship in Washington and the effect of the post-Watergate media on public and private political discourse. In the seventh chapter (of eight) Klein also begins to analyze Clinton with respect to his historical context--which quickly gets interesting--but stops abruptly (Klein clearly hasn't gotten this far with Clinton yet). I would surmise that most of the people that dislike this book do so because of their emnity towards Bill Clinton himself, but if you are looking for a summary of the era with generally just and honest commentary from a rational and balanced commentator, this isn't a bad place to begin."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"For someone who did not pay much attention to politics before 2000, I found this book very helpful. All I remember from the Clinton presidency is that the President seemed to be entangled in scandal constantly, and that the Republicans seemed to care far more about bringing him down in any way possible than about guarding the welfare of the country. Klein's breezily written book, while it does at points dwell on all of the scandal (how could it not?), fills in many of the lesser-known details about Clinton's vision and both his accomplishments and failures. I came away from this book feeling that the patchwork of disjointed memories I had concerning politics from 1992 to 2000 had now clicked into place in a coherent narrative. I also came away with a much better understanding of why most Americans think Clinton was a good President, whatever they might think about his personal character."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Obviously, the biggest flaw of this book is Klein's attempt to conduct historical analysis a mere 1 year after the end of Clinton's presidency. And beyond that, the book could have been a good deal longer -- it comes in at a scant 217 pages.Having said that, Klein does a decent, if not masterful, job of analyzing Clinton's presidency. Where it's strongest is in highlighting his list of acheivements, which, given all of the scandals, is important, since the biggest ones were not on the forefront of people's minds (defecit reduction, which led to the boom; bailout in Mexico; EITC, which is more important than you would have thought).There was one thing that he highlighted that I found particularly compelling: \\"In 1986, a single mother who left welfare for work could expect to make about $1900 and lose her health benefits. In 1999, she gets $7000 more and keeps her health beniefits.\\"Anyway, if you're like me -- a moderate-liberal who liked Clinton but was highly disappointed by his presidency -- you'll find it crystallizes what you thought of him. If you hated the guy, at least you'll have a better understanding of what he DID accomplish.And lastly, Klein is at least a smooth and succinct writer, so it's a good read. Not great or monumental; it won't ever stand as the definitive analysis of his presidency; but, given the fact that it is only a year later, it's moderately insightful."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I am a fan of Joe Klein's from his columns in the New Yorker magazine and bought his book after just finishing First in His Class by David Morannis, the biography of Bill Clinton from birth the his announcement that he would seek the presidency in 1991. I enjoyed Klein's book and in fact read it in two quick days. However, it was somewhat disappointing. While clearly not intended to be exhaustive, it was meant to clarify and synthesize Clinton's policy making decisions during his 8 years in office as well as their political overtones. While most of the major content areas are present and accounted for (e.g. failed health insurance reform, welfare reform, effect of the Lewinsky scandal, etc.), the synthesis is hard to find and make sense of. Klein seems to be arguing that Clinton's efforts became less grandiose and more effective as he learned how be a good president, but simultaneously continued to demonstrate his personal flaws and shoot himself in the foot. This is not really a novel conclusion, and probably not worthy of a whole book. If Klein's thesis is more complicated than this, it is not well articulated in the book, and better editing is needed. More likely, future books will tackle this topic more effectively as history provides more of a context for Clinton's accomplishments and failings. Buy this book only if you are truly curous about Clinton now and can't wait for other authors to complete their work."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"THE NATURAL was an enjoyable enough but misnamed book. \\"The Natural\\" seems to refer to Clinton's natural proficiency as a political operator, yet Klein details the up and down, tumultuous presidency that we all remember. Clinton's first two years were not that of a \\"natural,\\" nor was low point of his presidency leading up to his admission of an affair with \\"that woman.\\"The subtitle, \\"the misunderstood presidency,\\" is also misleading. This book reveals no great new interpretation of the Clinton era but rather sums up the conventional wisdom: Bill Clinton was a good, substantive president who failed to live up to his full potential and disappointed a lot of people with his personal behavior.While the title of THE NATURAL creates unmet expectations, the book serves a useful function. In just over 200 pages, it captures the major themes and flavors of the Clinton presidency, gives just enough supporting evidence to back up Klein's instructive but not especially groundbreaking insights, and serves as the outline for what could be a truly great future book. This book serves as a reminder of what the Clinton years were like (seemingly so long ago), but the book itself will probably not endure as especially memorable.THE NATURAL won't endure because it is so short and light on details. Joe Klein is a reporter, not an historian and the book reads like an extended ATLANTIC MONTHLY article. This is not altogether bad - I felt like reading the book pretty much straight through as I would an article. But the potential for a detailed, Robert Caro style biography of Clinton is a tempting future volume waiting for someone else to write.One final note: it bears mentioning that Klein seems admiring of Clinton. Where Klein writes disapprovingly, he seems like a disappointed - almost betrayed - true believer. He's clearly fascinated by Clinton and has a vision for what he could have been. This admiring fascination becomes a little much when Klein begins shilling for the New Democratic movement. Klein's journalistic credentials were hurt with the revelation that he wrote PRIMARY COLORS. THE NATURAL doesn't help, but this kind of a book may be a good medium for his talents."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein, journalist and author of \\"Primary Colors,\\" has written a very light and easy-to-read book about the Clinton presidency. This book is not a tell all, nor does it document all the facts of Clinton's two terms. Instead, in broad strokes, Klein wants to capture a fairly big or overall portrait of the Clinton presidency. With some exceptions, he seems to do a fine job.The book essentially reads like an extended Newsweek article. It is not very meaty, the sentences are short and simple, and one could easily read this book on a longer plane ride. Klein takes us from Arkansas where Clinton was preparing for the primaries, though two terms at the White House, and through key moments of the Clinton Presidency such as healthcare reform, reelection, Lewinsky, and legislative battles. In short, it is a broad overview and not a detailed account of Clinton's eight years.Somewhere in the middle of the book Klein takes a serious right turn for about twenty pages and discusses Newt Gingrich's rise to power. Frankly, I thought the subject could have been handled in half the pages. The tangent is interesting, but I really don't see how it adds much to Klein's account of Clinton's presidency. The twenty pages might have been better used by looking at another aspect of a presidency that continues to ignite debates and stir emotions.The other disappointing aspect of this book is the author's word choice. The book is easy and light reading, but every five or so pages, like clockwork, we see some odd language use that is seriously out of place. We hear about \\"North Carolina's antediluvian Visigoth senator...\\" somewhere toward the end of the book. This is but one example, but many more can easily be found throughout. Other reviewers provide such examples and I won't reiterate. I'll just say that nobody talks like this, and I can't help but wonder why an accomplished writer would want to write like this. The language is seriously out of place relative to the rest of the book.That said, Klein's view of the Clinton presidency is interesting even if there are no new arguments or insights. Klein is certainly one of a small number of people in a position to write such a book. He was there, alongside Clinton in a sense, from start to finish. As a result, we get an interesting perspective and an enjoyable read.This book is certainly worth reading. Little annoyances aside, I am glad I took the time to learn more about this presidency. In a sense, it makes me look forward to Clinton's autobiography. I suspect the story of Bill Clinton is far from finished."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"As an avid reader of everything Bill Clinton, I have been looking forward to the publication of this book for the past 6 months. It is a quick read and an interesting book, but often reads like a Clinton press release on how he was &quot;misunderstood&quot; (this is obvious from the beginning when you read the full title).The anecodtes are great, and the policy discussion is refreshing to find in a mass-media book like this. Yet, Klein does make a few lapses. He repeatedly talks about the &quot;self-destructive behavior&quot; of the GOP when they pushed for impeachment, while at the same time decrying the behavior of the President. He fails to convey how those favoring impeachment were self-destructive or wrong in their pursuit - he just assumes the reader will join him in this assumption.Nonetheless, this is a good book that does an excellent job covering Clinton's personal transformation during his presidency. I finished this book wishing it were longer!"},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"You can tell that Klein is left-leaning the way he describes \\"New Democrats\\" as people who at least like the idea of fiscal responsibility. If he were conservative, he would have trashed all of this ideology as so much bull. However, had he done this, the criticisms of Bill Clinton would have come accross as partisan sour grapes. The fact that he was as open to Clinton's presidency as he was makes the criticisms, in my mind, much more meaningful.Klein does give Clinton good marks in several areas. First, his intellect, which allows the man to bring an understanding of many issues to the presidency that few office-holders before him. Certainly more than the current president. Second, no one can complain that the man didn't come to work everyday with his sleaves rolled up, ready to put in long days, also unlike the extended \\"working vacations\\" of the current administration. Finally, if he were a stereotypical liberal he would have used the wealth of the 90's to fund a myriad of new federal programs that would have had a tough time sustaining themselves these days. Instead, he did pay off a lot of government's bills, which I find admireable.So much for the good parts. When Klein comes down hard, he comes down really hard, and not just on Willie. Hillary gets her share of venom for totally blowing any chance of her precious health care program by making it far too complicated and not accepting any modifications of it. And whatever dislike he may hold for Clinton, Newt Gingrich is many levels below that for his petty politics and hypocrisy that partially resulted in his own destruction.And then there's the man himself. Klein comes down hard, as he should on several ideosyncracies of the administration. Clinton's sloppiness, in consistantly being late for meetings, and letting meetings about smaller matters go on far too long really slowed down the administration. The fact that he took so long to get his staff together, and then didn't really makeup what he wanted resulted in it taking forever to get things going. To it's credit, the current administration does not seem to have this problem.He also comes down hard on the the appearance of impropriety. From hanging around with sleazy characters because they provided funding, to pardoning sleazy characters because they provided funding, Clinton made people around him understandably associate this sleaziness with the administration. For this, he can't be forgiven.And then there's the way he handled the whole Lewinsky matter. Now the Republicans and the media also should have their share of blame for letting this get to the prominence it did, but the bulk of the responsibility lies on the shoulders of Clinton himself. By insisting for months that nothing happened, he forced his staff to take the same stand publicly. When he finally did admit to the affair, this made all these people around him look like fools. And the way he twisted around what the meanings of the word \\"sex\\" and \\"is\\" were just cemented what the general populace feels about politicians and lawyers.In general, the theme of the administration seems to be one huge missed opportunity. While I do credit them with not \\"blowing it\\" when it came to the good economic times, it was also the time to start getting a better handle on such runaway issues as AIDS, Social Security, and yes, even health care. Unfortunately, 9/11 has lowered the priority of these issues. Clinton's biggest sin was to let general disorganization and the blowup of petty issues prevent him from achieving any decent level of greatness."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"When I bought this book I had read some rather nasty reviews stating that the book was very left of center and nothing more then a 200 page campaign add. In all honesty that would not have been disappointing for me to read, but what I got was a book that did not shy away from the biggest disappointments of the Clinton Presidency. The author tries to provide a balanced look at the Clinton Presidency by given equal time to both the good and the bad. Sure the author leans to the left a bit but that did not make him pull up the rains at all when talking over the personal problems Clinton kept getting involved in.I think Klein did a very good job with the book, he is a funny and sharp writer that keeps you wanting to read the book in one sitting. I would also say that the writing style is not for the quick and easy reader, it makes you want to pay attention and think over the writing after you put the book down. My only real complaint is that I would have liked about twice as much volume. At a bit over 200 pages it does feel like it just gives a broad overview. Overall I found the book very enjoyable and interesting that anyone that is interested in President Clinton will find entertaining and useful."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein's account of Clinton's presidency is interesting, in-depth, and well-researched. But he fails to get at the essence of what he originally set out to do (that is, decipher the type of president Bill Clinton actually was).Indeed, the book was more descriptive than explanatory and the writing, at times, tended to be confusing and jumbled."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"This is a very quick read, but it provides a great overview of the accomplishments of President Clinton as well as just how much he squandered through his reckless conduct (e.g., Social Security reform). More imporantly, it also provides a very good portrait of the ugly political climate during which the Clinton drama unfolds.I do not believe this book to be partisan, although the author appears to like his subject. Klein demonstrates that Clinton was a good President who could have been great."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly. From its dramatic opening till its end I never once lost interest reading. The text has all the qualities one expects from a solid piece of journalism: depiction of events, environment surrounding the events, and analysis that are more in the nature of posing questions rather than of definite, authoritative answers. Klein worked as New Yorker's Washington correspondent during the second term of Clinton's administration.Through this book I've learned for example about Clinton's involvement with DLC (Democratic Leadership Council), the formation of the \\"New Democrats,\\" why his (or Hillary's) health care reform failed (for pushing welfare reform at the same time -- due to inexperience), a brief history of the Gingrich revolution, his stance on globalism, plausible reasons behind his sudden resolution to fire missiles to suspected Al Qaeda camps in Sudan and Afghanistan (to avert attention from the Lewinsky scandal), and plausible [absurd] reasons behind his decision to grant a presidential pardon to Marc Rich. The book put events that occurred throughout Clinton's two terms brief and impartially into perspective."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Mr. Klein - Mr. Anonymous of ?Primary Colors? - has written an account of the Clinton presidency. Much of it is familiar, of course, because the history of it is so very recent. There are no stunning revelations, as Mr. Klein was a journalist and not a member of the president?s inner circle. Yet he gives us some very interesting perceptions. One of them is the very major, but almost hidden, role Hillary Clinton played in her husbands decisions. He shows us a president who could argue back and forth throughout the night, but then tenaciously stick with it once he made up his mind. Mr. Klein reminds us of the many achievements of this presidency that were never properly acknowledged because of the overriding preoccupation with Clinton?s personal scandals. And he also shows us how quickly George W. could mess up what took years to accomplish. While Clinton was battered from all sides (especially Newt Gingrich and Kenneth Starr), he did manage to take care of politics and help the more unfortunate of our citizen.Mr. Klein writes a reporter?s language. He presents us with a well researched book that tries to put a more favorable light on Bill Clinton?s presidency. He has done a noteworthy job."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein titles his book \\"The Natural\\", and subtitles it \\"the misunderstood presidency of Bill Clinton\\", and then fails to show either why Clinton is \\"the Natural\\", or why he is misunderstood. There is really nothing new here- we already know these stories. This book is not a biography, but neither is it \\"...the first draft of history...\\" as one of the backnotes would suggest.It is a breezy read, rather like a magazine article than a serious treatment of the man or his presidency. There are no footnotes and far too many \\".....during one of our many conversations, so and so and such and such....\\" We find out how close Klein was to Clinton, and how they had many deep policy discussions. Klein also attempts to provide depth to his book by often using words one could only hear at a Georgetown dinner party: \\"bathetic\\", \\"peroration\\", and \\"poseurs\\", all in one 3 page stretch, just to name a few.Klein does talk a great deal about Clinton's failings and to his credit pulls no punches. But this leads to the biggest problem with this book, and to the reason so many people will read it. Klein gives us the \\"what\\", we want to know the \\"why\\"?Reading this reminded me of the controversy over Morris' \\"Dutch\\" about Ronald Reagan. Morris thought there was no intellect or personality to Reagan, to the point of inventing fictional narrators of his book. A man who lived his simple political convictions was not enough, in Morris' mind, to sell a book. Klein on the other hand, has ultimately written a book much like Clinton's presidency- full of potential at the beginning, but with no real sense of direction, no core. Clinton didn't know what he wanted to do once he got to the presidency, so he tried to do everything and took both sides of every issue, finally leaving no legacy at all; Klein seems not to have known what point he wanted to make when he sat down to write this book, and he ends up at the same time accusing and defending Clinton and not really sifting history at all. He wants us to think he is being even-handed in his analysis, but is unwilling to truly criticize a Clinton policy (not behavior) without explaining away why Clinton wasn't really at fault. Klein loses credibility when he attributes Clinton's disastrous handling of the gays in the military issue to.... him not taking a vacation?"},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Perhaps The Natural sounded better in theory than it does on the page. Surely Joe Klein, who never fails to remind us in this book that he writes for the New Yorker, thought that a non-fictional underpinning should be created for his admittedly brilliant Primary Colors. Written supposedly by Anonymous, later discovered to be Mr Klein, Colors was a thinly veiled and rather comic look at campaigns and more specifically, former President Clinton's run for the White House in 1992.What was right about that novel is what is now so unbearable about this particular book. Klein basically serves us a regurgitation of Primary Colors, only without the more subtle wink that makes fiction enjoyable and with the browbeating of facts that can make non-fiction unenjoyable. And what makes his effort worse is -- the facts aren't historical. The facts aren't really even what scholars would call facts -- this is not a piece of journalism or even a sliver of history. It is more of an opinion piece from Joe Klein, he of the New Yorker don't forget, about Bill Clinton. His talks with Bill, how Bill recognized his children during the campaign, how his relationship with Bill has evolved over the years. His arguments with Bill's aides in the White House, because him and Bill are both New Democrats. And on and on.Which is fine. I want to hear how Bill Clinton leaned up against Mr Klein in a bowling alley for a whole night in New Hampshire, which Mr Klein preferred to call in the book a \\"felicitous\\" moment. Really, I do. Really. But there was probably a magazine where Joe should have submitted it to. McSweeney's surely would have accepted it, too."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Bill Clinton would have been one of the greatest presidents, but... .That is the recurring theme of Joe Klein's superficial analysis of the president he obsessed over for so many years. In Klein's view, Clinton was a victim of the good times, when the public usually ignores the political scene, a victim of divisive politics (which of course he was more than a willing accomplice) and of course, a victim of the blue dress he joyfully stained.These shameful excuses cloak what, for the most part, was a sensible dissection of the Clinton presidency, which started with so much promise to only disintegrate into disorganization and obsession.Clinton came to office talking a good game with his refreshing Third Way governing style. His ideals of government centered on a citizenry grasping opportunity to learn responsibility in order to form a solid community. Good stuff. But as Clinton moved back to the left after the campaign, the Old Democrat took over.Clinton's foreign policy was a joke, no doubt about it, but Klein rightfully gives Clinton credit for his working class tax-credit system which limited the growth of government bureaucracy and was essentially a form of tax cut. Clinton also showed prudence by not [messing] up the technological boom with unnecessary government intervention.Klein should be ashamed for complaining about how Clinton never got the chance to lead like George W. Bush has done so well after Sept. 11. Who would wish that on any president in any country?The plain truth is that Clinton had many chances to lead, and he blew them. The bombing of the USS Cole, in particular, should have been the ultimate wakeup call, but there was no urgency. Had he listened to his supposed instincts and not his pollsters, maybe he would have been the icon he is still wrongfully lauded to be."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"The book shows that a journalist wrote it. That wasn't meant to be as backhanded as it seems. The stories about Clinton et al are those we can recall, this isn't a back room expos&eacute; full of conspiracy theory.A good journalist (at least) writes as if he has something to tell you. Only in the last chapter does Klein really subject the reader to an opinion piece.If you were alive at all for the eight years of Clinton's presidency then...no, none of this is really \\"new\\" or \\"insightful\\" but I, for one, found it none the less interesting."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Liberal, but not a socialist. Popular, but not deified. Two terms, but not four. Wife rumored to be a lesbian, but not confirmed to be a lesbian. For all these reasons and many many more, all of them richly explored in this authoritative volume, one can fair-mindedly state that if Bill Clinton were a soft drink, he'd be Diet Roosevelt.Great taste! Less filling!"},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"This is not so much a book about the Clinton Presidency as it is an explanations of Joe Klein's 12 year relationship with Clinton, he says that they first met in Philadelphia in 1989. Klein as we all know was the author of Primary Colors, which scorched the President and his wife and which he didn't even have the guts to put his name to, or to admit that he had written when first asked about it. So it is extemerly curious and rather hard to believe when Klein writes in this book that he was surprised when Primary Colors was interpreted as an attack on the President. He says now that Primary Colors was nothing than \\"a defense of larger than life politicians.\\" Since Clinton was clearly \\"larger than life,\\" Primary Colors then could only be construed as a bouquet to the Clintons. The fact that he implied that Clinton had fathered illigetimate children and all the rest, I guess was similarly complimentary. Grover Cleveland had fathered illigitmate children and he was also larger than life. Once you have gotten through this dishonest and rather sickening self-explanation of Primary Colors, it is hard to either like Joe Klein or like this book. You become too conscious of the fact that much of it is really Bill and Joe and Joe trying to tell Bill that he never meant to hurt him and telling the rest of us that Billy and Joey are still buds and both like each other very much. Now one would expect in a volume as slim as this, just about 200 pages, that an attempt to reconstruct and analyze the complicated Clinton Presidency would be a tight squeeze. Especially when so much space is actually devoted to the authors use of the word \\"I.\\" So its frustrating when all of the sudden you find yourself being dragged back to some incident in 1984 when Newt Gingrich annoyed Tip O'Neill, a train of thought that seems to drag on for pages and pages, a high percentafe for sure in this little book. And when Klein does talk about Clinton everything seems either old or not very surprising. The beginning of chapter four, for example, he gives a long rendition of Clinton's \\"favorite joke,\\" the very same one that graced a profile of Hillary in the pages of New Yorker and I think was written by Connie Bruck not Joe Klein. This is truly an obnoxious book full of self pity and misguided justification, more about Klein than Clinton. In the end its hard to understand or believe exactly what the :misunderstood\\" part of Clinton's presidency was.Clinton is judged to be a talented- yes larger than life figure, who squandered his presidency. At the end Klein asks Clinton what he could have done, if he kept his libido in check and never gotten involved with Monica. Excuse me, but isn't that exactly what we all know about Clinton. He was a big smart rube from Arkansas who screwed up big-time and even now can't engage in self examination. This book is far too thin and superficial and self-serving to attempt it for him."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Bill Clinton is old news, but the issues and politics of the 1990's remain relevant today.In spite of his jousting with Newt Gingrich, Bill Clinton cemented the Reagan revolution much as Ike had done for the New Deal. Whether for political gain or from wonkish insight, Clinton defined the \\"Third Way\\" of using conservative means to pursue liberal ends. He embraced welfare reform, reinventing government, eliminating bureaucracies, balanced budgets, international trade, the role of entrepreneurs in creating economic progress and the new role of government in the information age. He held on to some classic liberal programs, hopes and organizations, but was unable to move much forward in this area. Even the Earned Income Tax credit was a \\"third way\\" policy approach.Klein provides a balanced portrait, summarizing the president's results and shortfalls, praising the positive skills, decisions and character without overlooking, rationalizing or demonizing the faults. Klein humanizes Bill, sharing how each of us makes choices based on competing factors. Klein wonders what the president would have done faced with a larger crisis such as 9/11. His comments about the lack of worldy experience provide a warning for all aspiring leaders.This book was a good reminder of the 1990's. Reforming health care, social security, and government remain vital issues. Bridging the gap from Democrat to Republican appears to be a larger challenge than ever. The need for true leadership from the president, congress, the press and the parties has increased in a far more complex, challenging and multipolar world."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Slim and definitely not sine ira et studio, but if you read nothing but this and Primary Colors you'll learn all you need to know about the Clintons. In fact don't bother with Hills and Bills memoirs: too long, too tedious and those folks can't write. Joe Klein can."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"This short, fast-moving book on Bill Clinton forsakes a historian's detailed and measured treatment to get at the essence of this man's presidency. Because it's more like a magazine article than a doorstop, you're likely to actually read it, maybe in one sitting.The book has become timely again, in light of Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. The \\"Hillaryland\\" liberal faction split the White House of her husband, elected as a \\"Third Way\\" moderate. Her premature insistence on addressing health care was the most grievous policy error of her husband's presidency. And Hillary's unbelievably complicated proposal, concocted in secret, showed no political sense. Aides described how Hillary could drive Bill, with a phone call, from a good mood to a staff-chastising tantrum, and how they distinguish those tantrums by the tone of his shouting.She comes across as the more conspiratorial and paranoid of the two, an uncompromising liberal true-believer pursuing a scorched-earth policy against enemies. Sort of like, uh, that president she helped impeach, Richard Nixon. You wonder how she, and this country, would fare with her in the Oval Office.Klein does not see this as a sham marriage, though. While ever aware they might be playing him, he sees them as devoted to each other.One of his best chapters describes how Washington's culture of political warfare began with Watergate, intensified through the endless Iran-Contra investigations and the attack-ad era and culminated in the Gingrich speakership and the relentless Whitewater, Paula Jones and Lewinsky investigations.Clinton failed his potential for several reasons. The placid Nineties were too tame for a truly great presidency. After the healthcare miscalculation, he never seized another opportunity to remake major domestic policy. And the impeachment scandal fatally distracted him in 1998 when he had the budget surplus and standing with Congress to make a real mark by fixing Social Security.Like a charcoal sketcher, Klein has a fine eye for quick but telling detail. He sees Clinton as needy of praise and human contact. He'd keep dazed listeners awake into the wee hours, talking more and more intensely, unwilling to let the moment go.Klein describes bowling with him one midnight just before the New Hampshire primary, after the candidate enters but finds the emptied-out joint devoid of hands to shake. Klein, awaiting his turn in the lane, would find Clinton standing so close he pressed up against him, seeming to crave human contact. Clinton's intense but flawed humanity is what makes him interesting, and endlessly so."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein takes a detailed, dispassionate look at the Clinton Presidency. He takes great pains to put it in perspective, both generational (Baby Boomers take over from the WWII Generation) and international (pre-9/11). He acknowledges that it took Clinton a while to get a handle on being President, and bemoans how much was opportunity was squandered because of the President's own failings. Yes, Klein opines (and I agree) that Bill Clinton is one of the most staggeringly bright and naturally gifted men to ever hold the White House. But he also nails Clinton on character issues, even beyond Monica Lewinsky (once referring to the President as \\"a bimbo when he comes to flattery\\"). When you're done with the book, you appreciate all the nuanced things Clinton accomplished, but you're heartbroken over what he could have done, if not for the inexcusable distractions."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Perhaps the best quote from this book is refers to Clinton's critics, &quot;What is it about peace and prosperity that you don't like?&quot;This book is a pleasant, light read. It is not very long, it is not overly deep, but it does get to the heart of what made Clinton so successful.It talks about how his many small successes added up. He may not have passed a New Deal or a Great Society, but his many small successes added up to the equivalent of such programs. The problem was that its hard to communicate with the public that the economy was the product of these many small successes.I think it also gets to the point about the Lewinsky matter, and why it actually hurt the Republican Party in the end. The book also decribes how most of the so called scandals of the Clinton Presidency really weren't scandals at all. It was just his opposition party playing politics. They knew he didn't do anything wrong, but they wanted the public to think he did.I also think this book puts into light the problems within the Republican Party itself, as you can see the difference between Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich. Its easy to tell why Bob Dole was a Republican Presidential candidate and Newt Gingrich is gone.Overall, it is a good, brief, light book."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein tackles the subject he knows best: Bill Clinton. Astute, even - handed, and keenly intelligent, The Natural is the only book to read if you want to understand exactly what happened - to the military, to the economy, to the American people, to the country - during Bill Clinton's presidency, and how the decisions made during his tenure affect all of us today.Much has been written about Clinton, but The Natural is the first work to cut through the gossip, scandles, media hype, and emotional turbulence that Clinton always engendered, to step back and rationally analyze the eight years tenure, a period during which America rose to unprecedental levels of prosperity. Joe Klein puts that record into perspective, showing us what worked and what didn't, exactly what was accomplished and why, and who was responsible for the successes and the failures.We see how the Clinton White House functioned on the inside, how it dealt with the maneuvers of Congress and the Gingrich revolution, and who held power and made the decisions during the endless crises that beset the administration. Klein's access to the White House over the years as a journalist gave him a prime spot from which to view every crucial event - both political and personal - and he sets them forth in an insightful, readable, and completely engrossing manner.The Natural is stern in its criticism and convincing with its praise. It will cause endless debate among friends and foes of the Clinton administration. It is a book that anyone interested in contemporary politics, in American history, or in the functioning of our democracy should read."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein writes a good and informative book about the Clinton Presidency. At times the structure of the book seems a bit illogical, but what it lacks here is made up for in terms of anecdotes and good analytic work by Klein."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"A rarity indeed in the realm of Clinton literature is an honest and balanced review of the Clinton years. It is not a deep review but a wonderful reconsideration of the Clinton years. Klein is spot on in most of writing--from his accounts of the destruction of Newt Gingrich to the accounts of Clinton's self-destruction. He hammers Clinton particularly hard for the Mark Rich pardon, which makes perfect sense in the context of who Clinton was. Klein makes one very bizarre conclusion. He blames Clinton for the current problems between Israel and the Palestinians. It is unclear how the failed peace talks are really Clinton's fault (don't Barak, Sharon and, of course, the Arafat and his ilk, deserve the blame?). Nevertheless, a rare book that is honest and tempered. And it pulls no punches. Fair and balanced."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Although not terribly detailed, this is an exceedingly readable book about the flawed presidency of Bill Clinton. It is an even-handed approach to his years in office, how people did or did not influence him, his strengths, and his weaknesses. Admittedly I still like Bill Clinton, so I'm probably biased in this regard, but Klein does a good job in incorporating the negative aspects of Clinton with his positive skill in exercising leadership."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Once the sensational aspects of the Monica Lewinsky affair settles into the insignificant area of history, it will be possible to develop a realistic appraisal of the presidency of Bill Clinton. Joe Klein starts this process by developing a brief and reasonable account of the Clinton presidential years. One major accomplishment of Clinton was considered impossible before he took office. Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush passed on the incredible federal deficits that they had run up in their combined twelve years in office. At the beginning of Clinton's first term, no one thought that a surplus would ever again be possible. And yet, before Clinton left, the federal government surplus was into twelve figures. Less than two years after George W. Bush took office the deficit has reappeared, which is further evidence of how significant the surplus was. Klein places this in the proper perspective, as Clinton's program was passed without a single Republican vote. The story of how this was done is a political tale masterfully described by Klein. Other major accomplishments of the Clinton administration also described are significant welfare reform, free trade legislation, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.The most interesting stories in the book concern the political dance between Clinton and his primary adversary, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. As Klein points out, the two men were more alike than either would care to admit, right down to their propensity for extra-marital affairs. Both faced ethical charges, and it is ironic that Clinton survived while Gingrich was forced out, largely due to the efforts of his former allies in his own party. The stories about the activity of political consultant Dick Morris aren't as interesting because they are so seedy. Morris is a man with no scruples, which of course makes him the perfect political consultant for a man like Clinton.While Klein gives Clinton his credit, he also does not spare the rod regarding his personal behavior. In fact, his recounting of Clinton's personal failures leaves you wondering how he managed to accomplish so much during his presidency. One cannot help but speculate about what he would have done had he not had to cope with so many sideshows, although not all were self-inflicted.During the Clinton years, I found myself ambivalent about him, which puts me square in the heart of American public opinion. I had a great deal of respect for his accomplishments as president while having a low opinion of him as a person. Reading this book reinforced both areas, my respect for the accomplishments increased while my opinion of his person declined."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I think a rating of one star is a little too generous, but I guess I didn't have much choice. In short, this book is a big pat on the back to try an elevate Clinton to the ranks of more notable (not to mention more honest and qualified) former presidents.... Great read for your most radically liberal friends who are constantly trying to make it seem as if Clinton was America's unsung savior."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein has produced a strong, short work describing the complexity of the human being that occupied the role of President of the United States for 8 years. The Natural delivers a preliminary judgement on a presidency, rather than on the all too human individual. Instead of making psychlogical pronouncements, Klein refreshingly colors his rendition of anecdotes with possibilities and probabilities of meaning. Like the American public, who gave Clinton high marks for his official performance but wrinkled their noses at his lapses of judgement, Klein tries -- and succeeds -- to bring to light the complexity of an imperfect man trying to meet idealistic expectations in raging rapids of Washington, DC. The book is mercifully short; Klein makes his point, and doesn't try to fill the pages with distracting clutter."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein does a very good job unpacking the enigma William Jefferson Clinton. Like many people, I wonder how someone who was so gifted in so many ways could be so recklessly foolish in so many others. Also, Klein, without resorting to psychobabble, illuminates some of the dynamics of the Clinton marriage as well as how many of Clinton's political enemies managed to inflict much more damage on themselves than on the object of their fury. A few days ago there was a report in the press about a recent Clinton restaurant encounter with Lucianne Goldberg, the woman to whom Linda Tripp was talking about what she knew. By all accounts, Clinton was his usual charming self and exchanged pleasantries with one of his most infamous opponents. This is vintage Clinton and readers of Klein's book will come away with a clearer sense of his capacity to triumph over those who loathed him. If you're a political junkie, you'll find this a good read."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I've seen Joe Klein on TV a few times, and he seems a bit defensive about whether he's &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;anti&quot; Clinton. Klein perhaps is buying into the noxious Washington media habit of reducing all civics into two sides, a &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right.&quot; To his credit, he doesn't fall into this trap in this book which was, for me, profoundly useful and insightful in explaining a presidency that was baffling to me. Clinton seems so smart and, at times, far-sighted -- his notions of guiding the U.S., for example, into a post-industrial economy, and yet, the sleazy, amoral side of him is just appalling. One of the many great things about Klein's book is that he explains what made Clinton great at times and awful at times. He skips past the usual media cant and shouting. It's a very readable, compelling book. I am amazed that I could learn this much about Clinton ever seeing all this media coverage of him for years. Yet little of it explained him.Klein doesn't so much tell us precisely how Clinton got this way as he does lay out how he was. I feel now, finally, as if I understood what Clinton really did well, and also just how disturbed and sad he was/is. It's a terrific and very, very smart piece of journalism. There are thousands of reporters in Washington, but most of them seem to be screaming at one another all of the time. Klein has actually and succinctly (and brilliantly) laid out the truth about the Clinton presidency.Silly people are always looking for bias on the &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; but this book is a lot of truth about a complicated, misunderstood and tragically messed up President."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"He had &amp; still has a pronounced love-hate relationship with President Clinton. It seems that Clinton feels the same towards him. Mr. Klein, in turn is impressed with the president &amp; all his talents: his communications skills, grasp of facts, connection with people &amp; vast intellect. He is equally disappointed by Clintons shortcommings of self absorption, sense of entitlement &amp; foolish personal behavior. Those weaknesses disgusted him (as they did all of us). Mr. Klein also gets some rips at Newt Gingrich, George W. &amp; Al Gore. In fact, Mr. Klein does not have much good to say about any &quot;boomer&quot; politicians. They have not the sense of honor, integrity, perhaps gravitas of Lloyd Bentsen, George sr. or Bob Dole. But Clinton bested them all one way or the other. Clinton could not control his appetites &amp; that diluted everything he tried to accomplish. It made him an &quot;average&quot; president. In short, a great opportunity for him &amp; America was lost.This is a very well written book. As the years past there will be better biographies (including Clinton's own). But it now has the advantage of being one of the first. Mr. Klein's skill with the English language &amp; his vocabulary make him a very good writer.

The man is not some stupid southern hick who fell into the White House.I don't care what the pundits and just plain Clinton-haters have to say, I as an average citizen believe he did a remarkably good job over his eight years in office.Indeed Clinton infuriated me at times with his shifting positions and his seemingly uncontrollable libido. He did some stupid and embarrassing things. Yet, he was real, &quot;warts and all.&quot;For my money, he is the most human president we have had in many years. We have enough plastic politicians. In Bill Clinton, what we saw was a very brilliant, yet imperfect man, who had an enormously natural talent to serve the American people. He did a good job on our behalf. As Klein points out, Clinton is a &quot;Natural!&quot;Klein presents a very balaned portrait of a bright and complex man who did remarkably well despite his own humanity and the woes of having to deal with a publicly funded witch hunt for his entire eight years in office.A fast, fair and very readable book about an interesting man who finally has a life that he doesn't have to live under a microscope anymore."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Absorbing, incisive account of what makes Clinton the Devil or a saint in opposing camps and why his wife Hillary seems destined for the White House."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe Klein is still muttering mea culpas for the oft-denied, nown-admitted \\"anonymous\\" Primary Colors. The book was a hoot (much better than the movie) in its depiction of Bill Clinton as a fascinatingly, repellant character. I suppose to prove that he really didn't mean all those snide, mean things he's been telling everyone who'd listen that he really likes the guy.If anyone is a natural polician it is the man from Hope. Even in the depths of his scandals (his falling asleep during hours of phone sex was the latest headline) I told my boys that he epitomized the American dream. Klein agreed. Where else can a poor chubby boy from the most backward state in the Union with a dysfunctional family become the leader of the country?His native intelligence and curiousity was both a curse and a blessing. It enabled him to succinctly explain his point of view and simultaneously become paralyzed in analysis. Klein shows the good and the bad - there was plenty of both. He always wanted to do great things but personal habits, ingrained years before, kept destroying that goal. His daily obscenity-filled tirades have been described by aides; his lifelong filandering has been documented but almost as well known is his deep religious faith.Klein briefly discusses the enigma of Hillary who both made and broke the man. In the end, one is left wondering what Bill Clinton believes - his wide-ranging interests led him into new and different directions while his political genius recognized the latest trend for political use. He was the Natural - an excellent title and description."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein sums up the Clinton Presidency as a great deal of potential unsatisfied. I felt that way about Klein's writing.He had endless material in the charismatic Clinton, but he fails to bring the President to life in this sloppy and hastily written book. It looks like Joe was just looking for another pay check.The book is, thankfully, a balanced account of the Clinton years unlike so many of the predictable, boring conservative smear books in recent years. Klein gives needed attention to the many accomplishments of President Clinton's tenure: NAFTA, the 93 Budget Bill, Family and Medical Leave, GATT, the Balance Budget Act, and welfare reform. He also writes of the great Clinton failures: gays in the military, 94 elections, health care reform and Monica."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"If you want a great read on the Clinton years, this is the book! It's a fast read that you won't want to put down. After finishing Peggy Noonan's &quot;When Character was King&quot; a valentine to Reagan and also a great read, I thought I should give equal time to Bill - while Noonan's book is a love story, Klein's is pretty measured, warts and all about Clinton - but you gotta love him anyway. It's a frank, honest book about the disorganized character and sloppiness of the White House and the man, but reflects Clinton's brilliant mind and charisma. Too bad he couldn't use his amazing ability to lead the nation with his vision, instead of getting stalled in peccadilloes that tarnished his presidency."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Klein, the author of Primary Colors, probably is the most perceptive commentator on Clinton. The Natural is an analysis of Clinton's tenure as President. Klein is a moderate Democrat, and his political bias shows through at some points. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem; however, in this case, a few good points are obscured by writing that falls into hack political journalism a little too much.At a few points, \\"The Natural\\" inexplicably leaves its analysis of Clinton to discuss the rise of smear politics, the hypocrisy of the Right that impeached Clinton, or the bias of the media against Clinton. I disagree with some of the points he makes on these subjects, and I agree with some. However, the real problem is that it makes the book oddly disconnected, and seperates Klein from the real reason to read him: his perceptions on Clinton. The discourses that Klein goes off are only tangentially related to Clinton.. In a larger book, with more space, they would be appropriate. However, they take the place in \\"The Natural\\" of more relevant information. One gets the sense that Klein was trying to score political points, when all you want him to do is describe Clinton honestly.Still, there are major themes in this book that make it worthwhile. Klein tackles questions such as what Clinton will be remembered for, why the Lewinsky scandal gained such traction, who had his ear at what time in his Presidency, and which of his qualities accounted for his successes. He makes solid arguments that Clinton accomplished a good deal of real policy work as President (a rather new assertion), and excellently documents the workings and powers in the Clinton White House.\\"The Natural\\" is by no means the definitive book on the Clinton Presidency. It is, however, by far the best available to us at the moment."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I'm happy to report that this book isn't another smearing of Clinton or a book about how great he was. It doesn't ignore Clinton's foibles (so Republican readers can't say it's one-sided), but it also doesn't ignore the good policies that Clinton passed during his 8 years in office.Too often these Clinton books only speak of how morally bankrupt the former president was... they're all about Whitewater and Monica. It's good to see a book that doesn't gloss over those events, but puts them in perspective alongside the successes of the Clinton administration.Yes, Clinton had sexual relations with Lewinsky and then lied about it... but many other politicians have extra-marital affairs too, and they're not all Democrats. Yes, there may have been some impropriety involving Whitewater... but there's improper things like that going on all the time in politics, involving both Democrats AND Republicans. (Dubya lied about his history with Enron, and Cheney's friends stand to profit big-time from the war with Iraq.)This book is an overview of the ENTIRE Clinton presidency, not just the scandals. This is how Clinton should be remembered in American History... as a man with many foibles, but as a man who brought the country an unprecedented 8 years of peace and prosperity. All of the Clinton-bashing books neglect to mention that:1. During his first year, Clinton passed a $5.5-billion increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit, essentially giving a tax cut to millions of middle-class families and helping to jump-start the economy.2. Clinton passed the welfare reform bill and NAFTA - which should've pleased the Republicans big time - but, unplacated, they continued trying to undermine him at every step.3. Clinton passed a balanced budget that actually gave the federal government a SURPLUS for the first time in 40 years. And by eliminating the deficiit, interest rates went down, and the economy took off.4. Fourteen million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in over two decades, the lowest inflation in three decades, a big increase in home ownership, yearly decreases in crime rates, etc. By every conceiveable indicator, the country was better under Clinton than it was before he took office.Ask a Republican what was so awful about Clinton and the response will be something relating to his personal scandals. But what about his political record?? Shouldn't the president's voting record and the policies he enacts be more important than his personal life? (BTW, I feel the same way about Republican presidents... I could care less about Dubya's scandals - cocaine use, Enron, etc. The man's voting record is more important. But look at his voting record while he was governor of Texas... it's appalling!)This book is a good and objective overview of the ENTIRE Clinton presidency. I hope history remembers him this way, not just for the personal scandals.And Dems take note! In one of the earlier chapters, Klein gives sound advice on how we can reclaim political power over the GOP. The voters don't want a liberal democrat, they want a moderate (or \\"New\\") democrat... that's a big hint."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Despite promising something new with the subtitle of the book, \\"The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton,\\" Joe Klein's theme is familiar. He believes Clinton was the most talented politician of the latter part of the Twentieth Century, but that his personal excesses disappointed his supporters and provided opponents with the ammunition they hoped to use to destroy him. The American people, who in Klein's story are alternatively indolent and endowed with great common sense (depending on what point the author is trying to make on any given page) save the day by recognizing that Clinton was, for all his faults, better than his enemies.Klein's method is to give the appearance of balance by deploring Clinton's well known personal weaknesses, while rendering a selective history of the presidency that inflates its substance.The author is in awe of Clinton's grasp of the details of domestic policy, but aside from his assertion that Clinton was responsible for the Federal budget surpluses of the late 1990s (which, as I will discuss below, is largely a myth), he doesn't adequately address whether Clinton, the policy wonk, had the judgment to separate forest from trees. He glides over Clinton's ignorance of foreign policy, even going so far as to relegate to parentheses an aside that Clinton's \\"handling of national security issues remained sketchy and uncertain.\\"In his account of impeachment, Klein is eloquent in his silence concerning Clinton's perjury and obstruction of justice. To Klein, impeachment was about sex, pure and simple. In his words, Clinton was a \\"rogue,\\" but not a \\"scoundrel.\\"The Constitution delegates to the House the authority to define an impeachable offense and to the Senate the determination of whether the offense justifies removal of a president. Future events may or may not confirm the wisdom of the decision that perjury and obstruction of justice do not meet the constitutional standards for conviction, but the Senate was clear in its acquittal of President Clinton.Nevertheless, Klein is disingenuous in implying that Congress acted improperly in bringing those charges to an impeachment trial. Whatever the merits of the Paula Jones case, the actions for which Clinton was impeached were clearly undertaken to deprive her of a fair court hearing. If the American experiment has any meaning, it is that those who are granted government sanctioned power must be prevented from riding roughshod over the powerless. Congress would have been irresponsible had it not formally considered whether Clinton's abuse of power warranted removal from office.One can agree that Clinton should not have been convicted by the Senate and still understand that his crimes were not lacking in gravity. Klein's cavalier dismissal of the affair as a mere sex scandal reeks of cynicism.On the economy, Klein credits Clinton with producing a balanced budget, and he accepts Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's theory that balanced budgets are the fundamental variable leading to lower interest rates and economic recovery.The facts do not support him.Klein tries to show that Clinton pursued fiscal discipline from the beginning in 1993. He quotes Mrs. Clinton as telling him that the President understood the importance of deficit reduction from the start.Perhaps. But then why doesn't Klein address the often quoted story that Clinton became furious with his economic advisors when they explained to him that his plans for expansive spending policy would jeopardize a recovery? \\"You mean the bond market dictates to the government?\\" he reportedly screamed.Klein's claims for Clinton's fiscal restraint would be far more persuasive had he rebutted this famous story. Instead, his silence speaks volumes.At any rate Klein implies that Clinton's 1993 budget maneuvers were a success. In fact, Clinton's budget was regarded much like Bush's 1990 effort: a combination of higher taxes and smoke and mirrors which did not make much headway in eliminating the chronic budget deficits. No one foresaw progress toward a balanced budget unless difficult political choices were finally confronted. Even at the end of his first term, Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal year 1997 predicted a balanced budget only by 2002. By 1996 fiscal plans which claimed to produce surpluses five years hence were no longer taken seriously.Conveniently picking up the story in 1997, Klein implies that Clinton's negotiations on that year's Balanced Budget Agreement ushered in a new era of fiscal responsibility. In fact the 1997 act represented a retreat from serious budget decisions as both the White House and the Congress gave a sigh of relief on finding that a massive, and entirely unanticipated, economic boom had increased revenues to such an extent that deficit worries were (for the time being) a thing of the past.Both Clinton and Congress then took credit for surpluses that neither created.What about Rubin's theory that deficit reduction leads to lower interest rates and thus to a boom? The fact is, long term interest rates stood at 6.9 percent in late 1993, when Clinton's first budget was passed. They were at 7.2 percent when his presidency ended.Deficits fell; interest rates fluctuated. Rubin's theory, which Klein accepts as fact, was not verified by empirical evidence.Does this mean that Clinton (and Rubin) were poor economic stewards ? Of course not. Is fiscal discipline important? Without question. But is Klein's narrative accurate? No.A less partisan and more factual economic history of the 1990s would read as follows: A relatively conservative Democratic president, prevented from sliding into excess by a nasty, but prudent, Republican Congress, presided over a glorious boom when both branches of government, restrained by the deficit, were forced to keep their hands off the marvelously productive American economy.The hero in this account isn't Clinton, or the Republicans, it's the American economy and that much maligned villain, gridlock.That's not the story you'll read in \\"The Natural.\\" One suspects that Klein's curiously selective history of the Clinton years is really less an honest evaluation of the presidency than an attempt to make it conform to the author's own view of the world."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"In fact, I've written to Doubleday asking for a refund. There is not a single new fact, concept or idea anywhere on the 217 pages of this major disappointment. This book is like reading back issues of newspapers -- after you've read them the first time! Klein also has a disturbing inclination (via multiple references) to pooh-pooh ethical lapses of government officials by trivializing them in the overall scheme of things.Unacceptable. Too bad,as I enjoyed \\"Primary Colors\\" but this is a cheap follow up."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"I got the impression that Mr. Klein just threw together a bunch of odds &amp; ends he had left over from another book and notes -- the way they made the movie &quot;Midway&quot; out of edit-outs from &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"This slim and mediocre book will no doubt be quickly forgotten, but one should consider the \\"paradox\\" that is at the core of this book. True irony and complexity is not Klein's style. But facile \\"paradox\\" is, and Klein's is that Clinton was an insightful man with clear well thought out proposals for necessary reform. At the same time, however, he was also \\"often seemed the apotheosis of his generation's alleged sins: moral relativism, the tendency to pay more attention to marketing than to substance, the solipsistic callowness.\\" The hallmark of these vices was his morally dubious affair with Monica Lewinsky.Let's just ponder this for a minute. If Clinton is guilty of moral relativism what are we to say of his critics who condemned his adulteries but said nothing about Netanyahu's and Gingrich's (and who reserved their special venom for the ostensible victim of his acts, his wife)? What are we to say about those who denounced Clinton as a perjurer but who praise Elliott Abrams, a self-confessed deceiver and an apologist for dictatorship and massacre, as a moral conscience for America and American Judaism? More important what do we say about Klein? The massacre of Sbrenicia goes unmentioned and Clinton's contemptible inaction over Rwanda is otherwise ignored. And consider the following: it was Klein's famous article in New York magazine in the fall of 1991 that declared Clinton to be the front-runner before a single vote had been cast. That Klein believed Clinton shared his political opinions was, of course, crucial to this determination. Klein would certainly not have chosen the two most liberal candidates in the race, Senator Tom Harkin, and Governor Jerry Brown. If Clinton had not been there, who would he have chosen? Probably Senator Bob Kerrey of Nevada. Since then Clinton has been \\"credibly\\" accused of perjury, adultery and corruption. Kerrey, for his part, has been all too credibly accused of murder and war crimes. What does it say of Klein that he preferred these cheap moralists as an alternative to the dangerous, elitist radicalism of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis?Klein, in other words, is a vapid conformist who cannot tell the difference between transcending two positions and splitting the difference between them. He confuses objectivity and open-mindedness with moving to the winning side. Despite the scandal of the savings and loans industry, campaign finance and the Enron affair, he is a man who firmly believes that a \\"special interest\\" is one that is not represented on the editorial board of The New Republic. (Unions, feminists, \\"minorities\\" and environmentalists, are the all purpose scapegoats for the Democratic Party's failures). Although he ends his books with portentous comments about the shallowness of American politics, elsewhere he has praised the low turnout rate and narrow ideological specturm that ensures such vacuity.How does this affect his account? As a \\"tough-minded\\" ex-liberal Klein enthusiastically supported welfare reform, and naturally praised Clinton's efforts in this regard. In criticizing the \\"pathology\\" of the, often black, poor, he could posture about his toughness. And what could be a better target than a weak and despised minority? Scholars such as Thomas Sugrue, Michael Katz and Stephanie Coontz have severely criticized the \\"culture of poverty\\" logic that underlined welfare reform, but for one as well-paid as Klein it is no doubt easier to dismiss them as politically correct rather than to refute their arguments. By contrast, Klein could care less about the tens of millions who are uninsured and underinsured. There was no cachet for him to be generous and helpful, and his main criticism of the Clinton health plan was that, as it was not successfully politically, it should not have been tried.This points to a common theme through his book: its endless recitation of conventional wisdom. The Democrats were bad to criticize Bork, Tower and Thomas, the Republicans were wrong over Whitewater and the suicide of Vince Foster. Clinton's political strategy was flawed because it led to the 1994 Congressional defeats. In turn, Newt Gingrich's politics were flawed because he was ultimately unsuccessful. And of course Al Gore was flawed because he ultimately lost, while Klein blames the collapse of the Camp David process on Arafat.There is some merit in what Klein says, since even a broken clock is right twice a day. Clinton's Employment Income Tax Credit did actually do some good and his presidency did oversee some improvement for the majority of Americans whose incomes had been stagnant or declining since 1972. But consider the issues Clinton ignored or fumbled. Tens of millions of people could die of AIDS over the next few decades, millions of lives could be saved with inexpensive medicines. But the pharmaceutical industry prefers to provide viagra to the wealthy and old. Klein uncritically accepts globalization as a good thing, despite the continued agony of Africa, the resentful stagnation of the Middle East, the South East Asia crisis, the collapse of Argentina, and the everpresent failure of market reform in Russia. He says little about Northern Ireland, arguably Clinton's finest foreign policy achievement, and one where he broke with TNR's endless \\"anti-terrorist\\" posturing. Klein does not mention Juanita Broadrick, either to confirm or deny, and the judicial murder of the mentally disabled Ricky Ray Rector, committed for no other purpose than to show that Clinton was tough on black criminals, gets only a bland sentence. It is hard, in the end, to avoid the idea that Klein's denunciation of Clinton's shallowness and opportunism, arises from the partial recognition of his own."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Yes, another book on the Clinton presidency. Having read several that have gone before, there is little here that stands as remarkably fresh, but Klein's does make an effort to consider the Clinton years with the benefit of hindsight. The problem in that, of course, is that barely a year does not hindsight make. Coming in at just over 200 pages, one cannot hope to view this as a thorough take, but rather a tour through the highlights and the lowlights. Furthermore, Klein's attention was clearly (and understandably) more focused on the first term, making for a lopsided engagement. Klein's clear favoring of the New Democratic ideals adds another layer of bias. And the prism of September 11 makes for some amusingly knee-jerk assessments on Clinton's foreign policies. Mercifully, the reader is spared page after page on the Lewinsky/impeachment mess, but, at this length, one should hope the reader is spared page after page on any one aspect of the Clinton years. At the least, this book provides a quick, relatively satisfying read with some painfully awkward attempts at making history of recent history. At the most . . . well, there's not much else here of note."},{"Title":"The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton","review":"Joe klein surely didn't want to upset the republicans, whenhe wrote this book.If he's President Clinton's friend, President Clinton doesn'tneed anymore friends like him.Would a friend write Primary Colors about his friend,then keep silent??

If you really want to read up on the Clinton presidency, go buy a Playboy. That will get you close to the depth of Billy-boy. If you would like to look for the legacy of his presidency, take a look at today's news events: missed economic opportunity, international turmoil and general moral depravity. If you would like to dream of the days when this guy was president, drop some acid and lock yourself away from the rest of us - say, for twenty years or so.The only redeeming thing about the book's subject is that the author does imply Hillary is a lesbian and even more power hungry than her \\"husband.\\"For you liberals, go ahead and dog my review.

My only disapointment with this book is that the format was not as large as &quot;Dreams from Home&quot; or &quot;Inspired Gatherings&quot;. &quot;Home Style&quot; is an inspirational guide to Tracy's style, and perhaps your own. I find her sense of whimsy and creativity delightful. There a joy and free-spiritedness to her work that is quite refreshing. Her style may not appeal to all, but if you are a fan of Shabby Chic, flea-market finds, romance and comfortable charm, you will enjoy &quot;Home Style&quot;."},{"Title":"Tracy Porter's Home Style: Creative and Livable Decorating Ideas For Everyone","review":"My affair with this book is love-hate.I never heard of Tracy Porter or her 'style' until the publisher sent me a beautifully designed shopping bag filled with catalogs showcasing her retail items and the gift of a personal teapot cum cup & saucer -- very clever.The items from her retail line are much cleaner and more mainstream than the pictures in this book which purports to be from her home.What Tracy does is give the reader permission to take things out of the 'keeping for good' closet and use them everyday. That's good.What she also does, and I'm sick to death of it, is use items that have seen better days. If I see one more piece of distressed furniture or one more chipped painted chandelier I'm going to scream.People -- reupholster your furniture! If something's ripped, fix it. Unless your furniture sports real antique fabrics or finishes or is showing true wear and tear from daily use, repair it. Enough I say!Tracy bravely uses color in her home. I do think there's too much of a mish-mash in many of the rooms, but that's my personal taste and not necessarily bad.The other problem I have with this book is this home supposedly has three small (under 4 years old) boys living in it. Yet, there is pin a cushion on chair seat (a delight to the eye), a faux leopard throw hanging off a chest (on top of which sit four painted glasses and a matching glass martini shaker), lampshades with antique buttons hot-glued around the rim, and a dresser top filled with a letter opener, very, very small porcelain dolls, perfume bottles, and hat pins, to name a few.I hope as soon as the photographer left Tracy ran through the house clearing off all these potential accidents waiting to happen.There is a very short project section which gives instructions on how to make some of the items shown in the book. If you're a fan of decorating books, magazines, or shows you've seen them all before.What I did appreciate is the resource directory at the back of the book. In alphabetical order it lists many of the places you can buy nice home design items. Where there is a web site available, it is included, so you're not forced to call."},{"Title":"Tracy Porter's Home Style: Creative and Livable Decorating Ideas For Everyone","review":"Tracy Porter's newest book continues to give me ideas for making my home unusual and charming using items from my attic and flea market trips. What attracts me to Tracy is her sense of whimsy, sophistication, and confidence that creates a special look to ordinary surroundings. Tracy shows us how to take things we have or can easily purchase and make our home different from the homogenized rooms we see in so many publications with new, shiny furnishings that tend to all look alike. Tracy's book has given me the courage to utilize a favorite old bench with silk fabric that is glorious but ripped, fabric that is too unique to throw away. Because of Tracy, I display a chipped Minton plate that normally I would have kept at the back of a cabinet; I bring out tattered leather books and golf leaf frames with cloudy glass and marred edges. To mix the old and the new, well-worn antiques and flea market/house sale finds, makes a home special. There is no one like Tracy in making a home exciting without spending a fortune. A skirt of tulle on an ordinary wash stand, unusual flower holders on the wall, and a deep shade of red turn an ordinary bathroom into a delight. Weathered garage doors for the closet and old garden ornaments as table centerpieces, along with aged wooden cornices over kitchen windows, make any home look extraordinary. Thanks to her, I browse shops with a new eye and pull out things from my attic and basement that I thought were too worn to use. Something well used but classy is so much more interesting than something new and tacky.

What Porter peddles as unique and original are actually standard craft and decorating ideas (candles, books, crystal chandeliers), and she provides precious little practical advice for transforming ideas into reality.If you're a Tracy Porter fan looking for new material, beware: Approximately 17 of the photos and corresponding instructions are projects that have already appeared on her website over the past couple of years.

I was a pre-teen at the time, and it sparked my interest in westerns. I've only read a few other western authors, and most have left me prefering good old Louis L'Amour.This book, like most by L'Amour, is a quick read. I read it every few years, usually taking a few hours. It always leaves me wishing he had written a sequel to The Man Called Noon.If you like L'Amour, you'll like The Man Called Noon. The amnesia of the protagonist presents an interesting twist, and gives Noon enough challenge to be worthy of writing about.As I've grown older, I've questioned the premise, and the writing style is no longer fluid to me, but like junk food, it is still fun to indulge in at times, and never fails to bring me back to my youth."},{"Title":"The Man Called Noon","review":"Many times in Louis L'Amour's novels and short stories characters are given the chance to start anew, to make a conscious choice. In THE MAN CALLED NOON this chance becomes the chief mystery of the book. The protagonist awakens from a sniper attack to find his memory gone. Fleeing to save his life, he finds conflicting evidence of who and what he was--or could be. Assisted by another outlaw, he takes on the name of Jonas and goes to an outlaw's hideout. The hideout is a once-legitimate ranch inherited by Fan Davidage. Jonas decides to help her out of her predicament. But it is not that simple. He discovers a hidden cabin of the hired killer, Ruble Noon, and the evidence points to Jonas. Further, he is haunted by the memory of being hired to kill four men and one woman. Does he return to his previous life, thereby saving Fan Davidage but losing her to the stigma of being a hired killer, or does he begin his life anew and risk being unable to save Fan? &quot;Then make a decision to start over,&quot; she said. &quot;No matter what you have been, you can always become something else.&quot; &quot;Is it that simple? Is a man ruled by his own free will, or is he composite of all his experiences, his education and heredity? I may not know what I am, but my flesh and blood do know, and they react the way they have been conditioned to react. My conscious mind was born only a a few days ago, but the habit patterns built into my muscles have forgotten nothing.&quot; Jonas finds he cannot abandon Fan to the outlaws, nor put aside his abilities as a gunfighter. Further, there is a fortune in gold hidden somewhere on the ranch, and other enemies ally with the outlaws to find it. Somehow Jonas must save Fan and the ranch, recover the lost gold--and find a way to live with what he is."},{"Title":"The Man Called Noon","review":"Louis L'Amour is the worlds greatest western author.Each ofhis novels is a marvelous adventure with the most descriptivetext.

Did he return to El Paso, Texas or did he decide to go off into another direction? Did he continue being a gunslinger or can one ever change from such a background? The questions go on and on.

His tonge-in-cheek and witty comments shows that he is a normal gardener like the rest of us, making mistakes, buying the wrong plant and putting it in the wrong place but that's part of the fun of gardening, trial and error and seeing what works and what doesn't.

I was very pleasantly surprised.What most excited me, as an experienced gardener who is ALWAYS looking to expand my knowledge, were the many suggestions and explanations for the non-trained gardening &quot;artist&quot; that would help one better understand the principles of design and the use of color.The information on the author's suggested plants for an ever-blooming garden were explicit, yet concise, and would benefit the average gardener as well as the beginner.Within 24 hours, I had read the book, highlighted it, and recommended it to several gardening friends. In addition, I spent the day moving many perennials in my large mixed border to achieve, what appeared to me to be, an overall improvement in the design of my perennial garden. I look forward to seeing the results of the changes I have made as the season progresses.This book, I think, offers the gardener, who might be tentative in his/her design decisions, knowledge that allows one to improve upon one's overall plan with a better understanding of the design principles presented and how to use them most effectively."},{"Title":"Readers Theatre For Young Children","review":"Kids love these scripts! I'm a 1st grade teacher, and I use these readers theater scripts with both my beginning and advanced readers. Regardless of level, the kids love to practice and perform these scripts.The many rhyming or rhythmic poems and nursery rhymes in this book help motivate students, encourage reading for comprehension, and build reading fluency. Students also learn to work together as a small group to provide a quality performance.The scripts in this book are appropriate for high Kindergarten through mid-2nd grade reading levels. Most of the scripts in this book are for 2-reader, 3-reader, and 4-reader performances, although any could be made into choral performances.

This event unties a chain of investigations, betrayals, prosecutions and war, all in the midst of the annual festivities of the country.Several characters are memorable: the dictator himself, Colonel de la G&aacute;ndara, Nachito Veguillas and, above all, the corrupt, decadent, drug-addict, homosexual and transvestite Ambassador of Spain.Written in an extremely baroque but nonetheless readable language, Tirano Banderas is a great Spanish novel which can be read and enjoyed today.

The photos included are fantastic, although some of them are difficult to make out the details. The text is easy to read, although I wish the publisher had used a better font.A good companion book to &quot;Babylon Blue&quot;."},{"Title":"Eros in Hell: Sex, Blood and Madness in Japanese Cinema (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"This is a highly distressing book. For as much information as the reader discovers, the sense of lacking mounts, creating more questions than this book has means, or intent, to answer. It is best to think of Eros in Hell as a primer for the reader interested in getting a taste of extremism in Japanese cinema. The high points of the book include the chapter on Koji Wakamatsu and the \\"underground\\" films of Shinya Tsukamoto, Shojin Fukui, et. al. Meanwhile, the rest of the book founders under the weight of excessive footnotes, goofy interviews of Japanese filmmakers by Parisian photographer Romain Slocombe and a pedantic chapter covering the minutia of Nagisa Oshima's AI NO CORRIDA (IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES).For readers with more than a passing interest in the Japanese New Wave Cinema, I recommend picking up David Desser's Eros plus Massacre (named after Yoshishige Yoshida's film). Hampered by its aggressively wide scope and passive acceptance of misogyny, Eros in Hell does a terrific job of stressing the need for a comprehensive look at the radical reaches of Japanese Cinema. (ISBN: 1871592933)All of the footnotes in Eros in Hell would work much better if integrated into the text.Slocombe is best known for his photographs of Asian girls in bandages and, apparently, he feels a need to bring up his fetish with everyone to whom he speaks."},{"Title":"Eros in Hell: Sex, Blood and Madness in Japanese Cinema (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Attention to anyone who wants the most in depth insight into japanese shock cinema that money can buy.

Although it certainly would have benefited for a more in-depth examination of the subject, writer Jack Hunter does cover a lot of important milestones, from the early pioneers of Japanese extreme cinema to the independent filmmakers of today.Japanese culture is complicated and full of paradoxes, and those paradoxes are reflected in the films highlighted in \\"Eros.\\""},{"Title":"Eros in Hell: Sex, Blood and Madness in Japanese Cinema (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Jack Hunter states in his introduction that one of the only things that Japanese cinema bans is the depiction of genitalia, and states that this sole barrier has brought something that is lacking in the West: an absence of boundaries.For his book, Hunter has chosen to explore blood, sex and madness as themes running through Japanese films. For the average film viewer, chances are the only film they will have seen or heard of in this book is \\"In the Realm of the Senses.\\" For the Japanese film connoisseur, this book is one of THE handbooks.Chapters detail film genres along with specific directors who have shaped the modern Japan film industry. There are also tons of black and white pictures, showing personalities as well as scenes from the many movies."},{"Title":"Eros in Hell: Sex, Blood and Madness in Japanese Cinema (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Being a fan of both Japanese movies in general, and horror movies in particular, this book is a rare gem indeed. Not only does it cover some of the films released by Japan Shock Video (&quot;Naked Blood&quot;, &quot;Mermaid In A Manhole&quot;, &quot;Entrails Of A Vergin&quot;) but it also gives you a brief history of &quot;pink films&quot;, exposes the Japanese fascination with fetisches of all kinds and shows some of the differences between Western and Japanese culture.While it offers only a few answers to why films like &quot;Raping Female University Students&quot; or &quot;Rapeman&quot; are tolerated in Japanese society, I'd say it's a good start for someone wanting to understand a culture so very different from ours.Since most movies are mentioned with both English and Japanese titles, it is also a good book for film collectors - for me it's more or less a shopping list.&quot;Eros In Hell&quot; - approved."},{"Title":"Teacher's Lesson Planner","review":"This is the best plan and record book combination I have seen yet.

Another gem!"},{"Title":"Oedipus the King (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"The only budget series of audio books and recorded drama comes from Naxos. One of their more recent entries is a very modern version of Sophocles' &lt;Oedipus Rex&gt; in a translation by Duncan Steen. In fact, some might find it a little too modern with its use of idiomatic expressions such as &quot;You can't pin that on me&quot;--which might be taken as an ironic reference to the final horrible deed of the hero. But when the messenger the agonized Oedipus as calling himself a &quot;mother f...&quot; (although he stops at the &quot;f&quot;) the effect is far too &quot;modern&quot; for comfort. You see, given a sound recording, we can only assume that the action is taking place in the nearly prehistoric past. I do not know the tone of Sophocles' Greek; but I do read that it is elegant and decorous. Therefore, I can only assume that this translator is doing his source a great injustice.On the other hand, the dialogue MOVES. There is an excitement to this performance, although the Creon of Adam Kotz lacks some force. Michael Sheen is good in the title role, as is Nichola McAuliffe as Jocasta, Heathcote Williams as the Chorus Leader, and John Moffatt as Tiresias and the Narrator at the start of the recording. The Chorus itself is cut down to four voices, but they are handled nicely with stereo separation and are quite comprehensible. The music is meager but effectively used.All in all, a very good if not perfect attempt at making one of the greatest Western plays accessible to a wide audience."},{"Title":"Oedipus the King (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"Sophocles's fatalism is somewhat foreign to the modern audience, and while Oedipus's determination to discover the truth is admirable, it's unfortunate that this turns out to be his fatal flaw. But this is still a powerfully dramatic play even today.This is a good production, very listenable and accessible, and would be a good introduction to the play for those unfamiliar with it. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Oedipus the King (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"I loved it. In many books, you can experience dry phases where reading it seems more of a chore than a pleasure. In Oedipus The King, I didn't put it down once, it kept me interested the entire time. The plot was so intricate and complicated, yet so simple to follow, I never had to stop to re-read anything. I rarely ever read plays,...I may have found a new hobby."},{"Title":"Oedipus the King (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"I used this adaptation of Sophocles' masterpiece for an outdoor production complete with masks.

I highly recommend it as a new look at an important dramatic work."},{"Title":"Oedipus the King (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"I would like to say that I have read this book and I think that this is not boring at all and tells us a lot about the olden days in Greece.

If you are that type of person that likes to read novels that are challenging and learn a thing or two, then &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; is right for you.

It's about 3 friends and their adventures over that strange, wonderous summer between eleven and twelve... That summer when suddenly the girls become interesting, and dancing is no long to be abjectly feared but possibly even sought out; when there are things in life that are slowly becoming more interesting than baseball or time travel. Carlson has always been excellent at portraying innocence lost and recapturing those whimsical moments of our youth (see \\"Plan B for the Working Class,\\" \\"Oxygen,\\" \\"Keith,\\" to name a few of his stories), but this novel captures a time that most of us have shared in our life so perfectly that it's sad and sweet as nostalgia brewed into a heady and soft liquor. It's suitable for young adults, sure, but this book will do a lot more for grownups than Harry Potter novels ever will."},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"I confess that I have a bias in regard to this book. I grew up in the same neighborhood as Ron Carlson at the same time. He has captured the essence of what youth was like in the west side of Salt Lake City. I can't help but believe that he has captured the essence of life in many cities in the late '50s and early 60's. Narrated from the point of view of a sixth grader, he has recreated a community in which violence is subtly present at all times, yet not acknowledged by the powers of the community. It is a community in which 15% of those who graduate from high school were expected to graduate from college (and many didn't graduate from high school). At the same time he has profoundly presented the naive (innocent?) point of view of children who grow up in such a setting. I remember sleeping out and playing car baseball. Sorenson Park was my hangout in my junior high years, and I remember the bully who tried to take over the park. Miss Talbot was one of my teachers. Carlson has described it well, but the value of the book is not in mere nostalgia. His narration explores numerous themes of adolescence and the responsibility of adults to protect and teach them. Carlson's narration accurately reflects the emotions and thought processes of an adolescent in a working class neighborhood. At the same time he keeps the interest of the reader, who can't help but wonder what's going to happen next. In the last chapter, rather than tell us what happened to every character, he hints and tells us about the meaning of it all. This is a novel I will treasure for years."},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"I can&#65533;t believe there are not more people reading this book. This memoir of the summer between grade school and Jr. high is a classic. The all-star chapters about getting Rafferty voted an all-star, the &#65533;baseball goggles,&#65533; and corking the bat are just some of the classic adventures of this part of adolescence.Don&#65533;t get the idea that there is just a fun summer of boyhood sleep outs in the book. The retrospective look at Witt, Rafferty, Larry and their families are a look into our own lives and the lives of those around us. It&#65533;s a heart jerking look at growing up with lots of laughs."},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"I have read everything Ron Carlson has published. He is one of a handful of contemporary novelists and short story writers who never let me down, who are consistently intelligent, original, thoughtful. And entertaining. \\"The Speed of Light\\" is, for me, his best, most accomplished piece of writing. The story may be about young adolescents, but the novel's natural audience is adults, and why it was marketed as young adult literature is beyond me. In point of fact, young adults would miss much of the humor and irony of the story. No, this is a book for grownups who have lived enough life to be able to reflect on the innocence and idiocies of childhood. Story aside, Carlson's use of language is so impressive, so evocative, so precise. This is a book I will read once every year of my life and, I'm sure, find something new each time to relish."},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"After having read Hotel Eden and Plan B for the Middle Class I was excited to find this book. And while it didn't completely remind me of Stand by me it does at times sort of run in that same vein of nostalgic boyhood memoirs that writers of a certain generation seem to keep putting out every few years. That said, Carlson is great. He gives you just enough background and scenic description to keep you engaged but not so much that it feels like he's trying to kill the mood with authenticity or details. Its kid-noir. And, best of all, its mild enough that it can be included in the teen fiction section!"},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"This book is about normal kids who love the summer time. They count the days until school gets out and have the time of they're lives in the summer. They love to play baseball and make up all kinds of wacky games.My favorite part of the book is probobly when he's sitting with Karen on the swingset at the park and then he beats the crap out of Benny. This shows that he is maturing and learns how to stick up for himself and his brother. Benny and Cling have picked on kids for a long time and nobody has ever done anything about it. Finally they got taught a lesson.I would defianately recommend this book. It never really got boring and I'd just want to keep reading it. I felt like the characters in the book and I were alike. They liked the summer and liked playing baseball and so do I. This book wasn't very hard to read and it's just an interesting story. This is my book review."},{"Title":"The Speed of Light","review":"The Speed of Light is about three friends Larry, Witt and Rafferty. They have just began their summer and next year will be going into jr. high. The book takes them through the summer and all the changes they went through.My favoite part of the book is every time the author really gets into Larry's(who narrates the whole book) head because it shows what Larry is really thinking and feeling. The author gets into how Larry notices all the chnages in his friends and how he feels when he proclaims himself as \\"a nocturnal butt-looker\\". My point is the author captures all those \\"first\\" things during that one magical and changing summer and revolves it around three young friends. The author shows that Larry is a normal baseball-loving kid who has many things going through his mind that weren't there last summer.I would and would not reccomend this book. I would not reccomend this book because for me it was a little hard to follow. I didn't understand all of the games they would play and there would be a part in the book where it would say how much Witt hated a certain game and in the next paragraph or so it would say how much Witt enjoyed the game and how good he was at it. I would reccomend this book because I think it shows a powerful message: Everything and eveyone is changing. The summer in the book is that special summer where everything has changed and in the book this is probably the last summer Larry will spend with his three best friends because, after playing an excellent game of baseball, Rafferty suddenly is thrown into the popular crowd and Witt moves to Pocatello, Idaho to live with his uncle for a while, while Witts' abusive father gets therapy. Over all,this was an \\"ok\\" book, not quite what I expected, but it had its moments."},{"Title":"Opportunities in engineering, (Opportunity books)","review":"This is a good read if you are a young guy looking to get into the engineering feild, or a a current engineering student. The Authors views are very very similar to my own. I strongly agree with many of the statements and descriptions that the author makes in this book. There are a few things that the author talks about that never did come to fruition (like engineers playing an important role in todays political scene) but this does not in any way hurt the other messages the book portrays.Again I would strongly recommend this book to students entering or currently enrolled in the study of engineering. Also a note worthy point is I found some of the passages quite comical!"},{"Title":"Opportunities in engineering, (Opportunity books)","review":"This is a great work, I found it very informative. It's strange that there really aren't a whole lot of books like this written in contemporary times.

The battle was a monster of its kind, with a huge number of soldiers involved. 300,000 troops fought over a 2 day period; there were about 72,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, prisoners), with each side suffering about equally. As the book concludes: \\"The year after Wagram, Napoleon still looked unbeatable, but Wagram was to be his last decisive victory, the last to break the enemy's will to resist.\\"The book itself traces the Wagram campaign from its early origins. It describes how Napoleon created an army by shuffling a variety of units, some scattered hither and yon. It also describes the Austrian forces, under the leadership of Archduke Charles.The maneuvering before the battles itself is described. Indeed, the lead up to Wagram was most propitious for the Austrian forces. In a battle at Aspern-Essling, Charles managed to bloody the French and experience a tactical victory. Unhappily for the Austrians, however, they did very little (such as fortification) after their modest victory. On the other hand, Napoleon redoubled his labors, brought some additional forces onto the field, and developed a typically ambitious plan of action.At the last instant, Charles decided that he must also show some initiative. Thus, both armies planned to attack the other at about the same time. However, the French generals were better, Napoleon hit his stride during the battle at Wagram, and the end result was a fairly convincing French victory. It was not Austerlitz, but it was a substantial win.Some useful features of the book: there are some decent maps at the beginning (while they could be better, they are serviceable); there is a nice section with short biographies of the major figures; the \\"order of battle\\" provides detailed information on the structure and leadership of the armies. The writing is not elegant, but it is serviceable. For a brief description of Napoleon's last big victory, this will serve.A final brief comment. The author died before this book was published, always a sad event."},{"Title":"Savage Life","review":"Set in the long hot summer of 1990, this broad satire of the Thatcher era is populated with oversaturated characters grinding out meaningless existences in a crumbling West London neighborhood and the posh outer suburbs. The full spectrum of class is represented, from inept teenage burglar Gaz Hoskins (son of a semi-whore, brother to a porn performer), to middle-class insurance salesman Colin Nutter (plus wife and two sprogs), and finally, disagreeable rich guy Dorian Savage. Gaz's life consists of staying out of the way of his sister's mean boyfriend, while scheming to acquire 200 Japanese sneakers and all the junk food he can cram into his pimply face. Colin's busy trying to keep up with the Joneses, or more precisely, his boss, while ignoring his alcoholism and nagging wife. And Savage is simply intent on enjoying the perks of wealth, and the services of two sisters.The semi-madcap story finds these three lives intersecting and interweaving in preposterous, but amusing ways. Characters act stupidly, and then bad things happen. A botched burglary leads to a dead dog. Another botched breaking and entering leads to a spontaneous murder. And a drunken misunderstanding leads to a contract killing by a delusional loner. Actually, pretty much everyone in the book is a loner. No one has any friends to speak of, and women exist in their lives almost exclusively as sex objects. There is absolutely nothing redeeming to hold onto in the book, everything is gross and tawdry, everyone is out for themselves, and no one has any illusions about anything. Of course, this is a dark comedy, so that's more or less fine. The story jolts along at an appropriate pace, and there are enough comic beats to keep one reading, but it lacks the subtlety or style to really distinguish itself."},{"Title":"Scandinavian Art Pottery: Denmark and Sweden","review":"I'll begin by stating that I am an avid collector with extensive knowledge of Scandinavian studio art pottery. And while I don't consider myself necessarily and authority on the topic, I'm not writing a book on it either. I found Hecht's book informative on some levels and largely misinformative or under-informative on others. The information gathered here filled a gap in collector's books that was long overdue. It is unfortunate, however, that this book is littered with very poor and inaccurate references to its topic. It contains either false, nebulous or no reference at all to some pottery marks and their meanings &amp; rarity. Some of the most significant factories and artists are often barely touched on or left out completely while several pages will be devoted to others that are comparatively far less significant. I also found that of those artists featured, many have no reference to their most representative work. Not to mention, 3/4 of the book is devoted to Danish work, with the last afterthought 1/4 to Sweden, which is, in my opinion, diametrically allocated. And as for values, I don't know where these came from -- some are strangely through the roof while the very few absolute hottest collectible artists will be strangely undervalued. I hate to think that the author is providing this to help sell her own collection at terribly inflated values alongside her Fleetwood Mac albums and tour buttons on eBay while picking up the best pieces at lower prices. Some of us are not fooled."},{"Title":"Scandinavian Art Pottery: Denmark and Sweden","review":"This is the best available introduction to Danish and Swedish pottery that I know of. Especially the chapters on \\"Royal Copenhagen\\", \\"Saxbo\\" and \\"Arne Bang\\" are excellent. The material on Swedish pottery are not at all that good but still O.K."},{"Title":"Scandinavian Art Pottery: Denmark and Sweden","review":"I'm not a collector of pottery of any kind. I saw this book at a friend's and started reading it. The history of the pottery houses and different genres are very well explained here and it's a compelling read. I was able to even see styles and artists that matched my sensibilities. Overall, I learned something new and saw many pieces of art pottery that I enjoy. I understand why Scandinavian art pottery is so collectable now."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"If you want to learn about the gangster/outlaw breed of Pretty Boy, Ma Barker, Baby Face, etc., &amp; understand more about the forces that created them, forget about this book. Any story told in a pure narrative style, like this one, naturally lends itself to embellishments of the truth, wild assumptions &amp; a good few gross exagerations. This one is no exception. The fact that certain characters' feelings &amp; thoughts in their final moments of their death throws, are clinically &amp; vividly described, says it all. Bottom line with Charley Floyd is that he thought himself too good to become a poor farmer &amp; proved himself incapable of success at any other activity, legal or illegal. He was a thieving, violent, adulterous &amp; under-achieving cry-baby, who, as we see from his choice of cranky, miserable &amp; homicidal side-kicks (Birdwell excepted), was also an awful judge of character. The author however, paints him in such tender tones, that when Pretty Boy's tacky, unsuccessful life of crime comes to it's predictible violent close, I am half expecting to read in the book's Epilogue, of his elevation to sainthood. His great gifts were his good looks &amp; his immense charm, especially with women. What a shame he didn't move West to take part in the then burgeoning Hollywood film industry, or even try his hand as a door-to-door saleman. He was an absolute natural for either. Be that as it may, the narrative style is racy &amp; exciting. The chapters are short, making this a very undemanding, entertaining bed-time read. Sadly, the flimsyness of the content is likely to leave you real hungry in the morning!"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"While this novel is a bit too slanted in its representation of Charles Author \\"Pretty Boy\\" Floyd, it is written well enough that someone who enjoys reading about gangsters will be left rooting for the outlaw at the end of the book.Of course this effort doesn't approach McMurtry's classic \\"Lonesome Dove\\" -- likely because he has a co-author in Diane Ossana-- but it does capture the times (1920s-30s) well: The Great Depression, the Dust Bowl era, and the age of the modern-day Robin Hood gangster, at least through the eyes of the 20,000 Oklahomans who attended Floyd's funeral.The book glosses over Floyd's warts and makes him out to be a saint. But in an age when people seem to root for the outlaw (see such movies as \\"The Godfather,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Natural Born Killers,\\" \\"Scarface,\\" etc.), such a book would likely go over well with a reader who who admits to such tastes.For me, it was a fast and enjoyable read. When I put it down, I looked forward to getting back to reading it. I expect that anyone who isn't bothered by what I've written about this novel would be obliged to try it out for himself or herself."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"If you're looking for a tragic-comic account of a poor boy turned outlaw, this is an amusing and satisfactory version. If you're seeking a more historically accurate account, you'd best look elsewhere.The book offers McMurtry's usual blend of humor and quirky characters and a folkloric depiction of the life and times of Pretty Boy Floyd. Unfortunately McMurtry and his partner Diana Ossana wrote it first as a screenplay and it's conversion to a novel resulted in several flaws--the biggest being a lack of character development. Floyd and his associates often come off as little more than caricatures.A few minor quibbles a country boy like McMurtry should have avoided: There's virtually no recoil in firing a .410, yet Dempsey Floyd experiences it several times as his father gives him a shooting lesson. Acorns have a high concentration of tannic acid and can be toxic to humans, though the novel has Floyd eating them. Floyd wades the Little Beaver river, up to his armpits; even in Ohio in October that sounds like an invitation for hypothermia and not a good idea for a man on the run dressed in street clothes.Still this is fiction and I mostly enjoyed the read. The narrative flows well and kept me turning page."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Yes, I am on a roll in reviewing Larry McMurtry inspired works (this one is co-written with his fellow screenplay writer Diana Ossana), although the subject of this presentation, the tale of Pretty Boy Floyd the Oklahoma dustbowl outlaw from the Depression-era 1930's, has always had a certain personal appeal unlike some previously reviewed McMurtry anti-heroes. The name Pretty Boy Floyd is well known to me from my youth listening to Okalahoma- born Woody Guthrie on a folk music program that I tuned into on the radio in the early 1960's. The tale that Woody told played into (and still plays into) my attraction toward Robin Hood-type figures (whether truly so or not) as part of the American struggle against the old time capitalist bosses and their bankers. Take this line - \\"Some will rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain pen\\". Sound familiar today?Of course the reality, as the plot in this book makes abundantly clear, is that these so-called heroic figures tend to either have feet of clay or have been glorified through sheer \\"trade-puffing\\" publicity agents, voluntary or otherwise. Nor is Pretty Boy alone in that category. On a scholarly level the late British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawn spent the early part of his professional career investigating these types in his seminal work, Primative Rebels, and in other sociological monograms on the subject of social bandits. But enough of the scholarly because what our two authors have attempted to do here is to take a little away from that heroic notion and tell the tale as it more probably happened- including the boredom and monotony of everyday life even for well-known outlaws.Pretty Boy's tale is standard 1930's stuff. Nothing doing at home except hard words, hard work, no pay and no adventure on the old homestead. That's 1930's Oklahoma in a nutshell. So off to the big city to learn a trade. The trade being robbing banks. Every profession has its rules and etiquette and as the authors tell this tale we are treated to some insights into those customs. But mainly it is set up the job, avoid getting shot and get away fast. If not, then jail, the hangman or shot down in some dark alley. Of course, this would not be a McMurtry-inspired novel if there was not a ton of sex, longings for sex or exasperations with sex. That, I might add, is true as well for those of us who are not social bandits. This is a decent read from a period that kind of marked off the Old West from the new-Tommy guns and fast cars did not figure in those Old West tales, right?"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"This is worth the read, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" it's not but a different era, different attitudes. I still liked it"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"The adventures of a doomed hero that makes Bonnie and Clyde tame and the impostor seem honestkept me interested.In the 30's era where poverty in a wealthy nation was common being a hero seemed to involve having the nerve to take what you wanted.Being a bad boy gangster who robbed banks became a folk hero to the downtrodden.Our own has rapping gangsters of a different color and they have become heroes to a new generation of the hopeless.This book is well written and like \\"Zoot Suit\\" makes you feel like you are therebeside the characters.It was the comparison to Clive Cussler's ersatz hero Dirk Pittthat made me realize that this was a gem of a historical novel."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"WOW! This book is incredibly written. They showed a complexed version of this worn out outlaw. If I were stuck on a desert island I would unquestionably want this book with me, because I could never get tired of reading this excellent book. I have, therefore, read it four times in the last two years. It's something about the way it made you feel, and the emotions the two took you through. It is my favorite book and I will cherish it. Thank you to the writers, you don't know how much gratitude it gives me picking up this book and starting from page one. Even when I was twelve I started reading, but it was too difficult for me to understand. Now that I'm older and know a little about the outlaw I appreciate it. If only Siskel and Elbert reviewed books. They would definitly give this book Two thumbs way UP!!!"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Larry McMurtry delivers on his proven formula of rich and funny character development. His strength is the ability to bring alive trivial minor characters and make them unforgettable. Too many characters from inferior works appear to only serve as plot suppliers and do not fuel the continuing story. McMurtry makes his characters believable, solid and Pretty Boy Floyd is in the same light as Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show and Texasville. His simple, unpompous yet resonant writing style compares to Steinbeck's observations. Recommended."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Although this was a generally entertaining book, it was disappointing on two counts. First, it really does read as though it was written by two different authors. The first half of the book lacks depth, while the second half of the book is much more well written. Second, the authors' give an often historically inaccurate and inexcusably sympathetic portayal of Floyd, who was one of the most notorious criminals of his day. The authors would have you believe that he was a fairly decent guy who only hurt others when he had to. On the contrary, Floyd was an extremely self-centered man who cheated regularly on his wife (he often lived with another lover, Beulah Baird, and was known to frequent brothels), and stole from, expoited, threatened, harassed, kidnapped, or killed many innocent victims, including many poor and middle class people. Today, Floyd would be diagnosed as an antisocial personality disorder and he was a sinister man whose criminal deeds, including numourous murders, reaped havoc on dozens, if not hundreds of people. This is the overriding impression that one should have of Floyd and how he should be remembered. McMurtry and Ossana were irresponsible for presenting him in a glorified manner, even though this is a novel. Readers who are uninformed about Floyd's devious nature will be swayed by this book to feel sorry for this egocentric gangster. Therefore, they would be better off reading other, more accurate accounts of Floyd's life, such as Jeffrey King's &quot;The Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floyd.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"I really liked this book mainly for two reasons: 1) It is based on a true story 2) It was VERY fast-pacedOver the years, I read almost everything by Larry McMurtry and have not yet been disappointed. &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; is a very enjoyable romp. It approaches every character and situation with light-hearted attitude and excitement but does not allow too much time to pass by before reminding the readers that there are consequences for every action and a certain point after which you can never turn back and make ammends.Charlie appears to be a larger-than-life character. He is kind and courtuous to everyone he meets, unless he takes immediate dislike to a person or that person is shooting at him, and although he has moments when he's blue or his temper flares up, he is hard not to like. The novel abounds with fun characters; from sensible but vulnerable Ruby, Charlie's wife, prescious Dempsey, Charlie's son, spunky Beluah, Charlie's girlfriend, smart and sassy Ma Ash, Charlie's mentor, George Birdwell, Charlie's partner in crime and a cowboy at heart, Bob Birdwell who is the most original character in the novel and etc. The only problem with the whole novel is that it has too many characters and not enough space devoted to each one. The authors take the time to describe Charlie's victims and random people who cross his path but they spend too little time on them for us to care about or too much time to let us know that they were real people and good too.I don't think that this novel glorifies Charlie in any way. On the contrary, I think a more apt title for this novel is &quot;Crime does not pay&quot;. For all the hoopla surrounding Charlie's life and career, the fact remains that he died at 30 and never could lead the life he truly wanted."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"What a surprise! I thought the authors might try and glamorize criminal life, but after reading Charley FLoyd's story, I'd want to grow up to be anything but an outlaw. The chapters are short, quick, but affecting, sort of the way life is when you're young and in a hurry to grow up. I've read LAST PICTURE SHOW and LONESOME DOVE and loved them; nothing will ever be as great as LONESOME DOVE, but this book ranks right up there with the rest of McMurtry's stories. The characters are colorful, flawed, makes you wish their lives had taken a far different turn (especially Charley and Ruby). Highly recommended!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Having read all of Larry McMurtry's books prior to this, I was really looking forward to it, but it's much more akin to Woody Guthrie's song about Charlie Floyd, and is just kind of weak. I first read McMurtry'sThe LAST PICTURE SHOW : A Novel, soon after the film came out in the early 70's, followed byAll My Friends are Going to be Strangersand afterwards read every book by him, both his earlier work, and his later stuff(especially the trilogy begun withLonesome Dove: A Novel. Since this is the first book I'd read where McMurtry collaborated with Diana Ossana, I really had no expectations....and they weren't met, nor was I impressed by their next work,Zeke and Ned. They did do a fine job on the screenplay forBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition), but I think I'll steer clear of any other books they co-write.And since I know far more about \\"Pretty Boy\\" Charlie Floyd now than when I first read this, I'd have to say that I think this would have been be a better book if it had simply had been a novel about a fictional character \\"loosely based on Pretty Boy Floyd\\". As it is, I'd recommend giving this a miss. If you want to read about the real Pretty Boy Floyd, I highly recommendThe Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floydand/orPublic Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34. If you want to read fiction about an early 20th century folk hero(or anti-hero), try Wallace Stegner'sJoe Hill."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Charley Floyd, had a simple life and had a wife and son.

Though it's loosely based upon an historical outlaw, it is a story told by FICTION WRITERS. It was funny, sad, full of colorful, clever, original dialogue, that made me feel as if I knew these characters inside and out. Pretty Boy was considered a folk hero in the late twenties and thirties, professor sir. Read the novel in that context. I think that was the point of the authors--that this was a time and place they wanted to capture with their imaginations, to bring to life for those of us who weren't alive then (and to entertain those who were). It was a rough time, people were poor, hungry, the banks were the enemy because they put entire families out on the streets, with nothing. There was no welfare, no homeless shelters. It was a wild, rough time. I gave this book to my grandpa (a fine, upstanding man if there ever was one), who remembered Pretty Boy Floyd from his own childhood, and he LOVED it!!! If anything, this novel, by the end, shows us how a wrong turn in the road of life can change the course of our entire future...and how hard it is to ever go back...give it a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"What a breath of fresh air.

Boy, was I ever wrong. &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; was a masterpiece, and so are the other McMurtry books I've read - but this, by comparison, is amateur night. The writing is stiff and reads like something McMurtry might have written when he was just starting out - and then threw in the trash.Forgive me, Mr. McMurtry, but you're much better as a solo act, and I'm only sorry that you're not going to write any more novels about that wonderful pair, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Pretty Boy Floyd, is somewhat fictionalized account of the true life of Charles Arthur &quot;Chock&quot; Floyd, the son of Oklahoma farmer and notorious gangster. I listened to the audio version of this book and it was most impressed, despite having reservations about wanting to hear about gangsters. (Not my usual fare). I was, however, most impressed with this audiobook. McMurtry and Ossana do a great job of bringing Pretty Boy Floyd to life. Even the minor characters have great personalities, and McMurtry and Ossana really DO manage to get into Pretty Boy's head.The Story: Charles, &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; is a small-town boy, with country charm, who is married to a young half-Native American woman named Ruby Hargove. They have a son named Jack Dempsey Floyd. When money becomes scarce, Charles headed north looking for work. After trying various jobs, Pretty Boy tries to make money the easy way- by robbing an armored car. What follows is the tale of Floyd's life. You see him get further and further embroiled into his life as a gangster, have affairs with his girlfriends, and watch as he tries to outwit the law.Floyd is consistently portrayed as a charming loveable rogue... An'outlaw' with a good heart, a weakness for women, liquor, and a well-cooked meal. (While I doubt many of Floyd's victims found him quite as so charming) the story worked for me. The novel moved at a brisk pace and was overall, greatly entertaining. I would recommend this novel for those interested in Gangsters or the life of Pretty Boy Floyd."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Larry McMurtry uses his excellent characterization skills in portraying Pretty Boy Floyd (aka Charles Floyd), a bandit of the Dillinger variety who robbed banks in the early 30's. McMurtry and Ossana give Floyd a charismatic, misunderstood character, one who robbed banks with a touch of wit and charm. This is in stark contrast to some other accounts of him being a ruthless and vicious criminal.The book starts off covering Floyd's first payroll heist. It also tells about his adventures in jail and his attempt at a normal life. However, being an ex-con, he wasn't trusted and had to return to crime. The book then follows his various heists, his jail escape, and his adventures with his partners, wife and son, girlfriends, and friends. The reader is also treated to an inside look at his home life with his wife and child and how the life of crime distanced him from them. Ultimately, Floyd's career ends and McMurtry paints a sad picture when Floyd is finally brought to justice by Hoover and the soon-to-be FBI.This book started off very exciting. I was drawn into the short chapters and Floyd's exciting adventures. However, I found a pattern to the book, which made it difficult to remain interested in: Floyd robs something, Floyd visits his girlfriend(s), visits family and friends, law catches on, Floyd goes and robs something else and repeat. Also, I didn't find much sympathy in the character. McMurtry did color him as a good-hearted man with a wild streak, but I didn't buy into it. He was still a thief. However, his character is interesting and at times, Floyd's adventures are funny and poignant -- which save this book."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"McMurtry and Ossana have written a novel that is wholly uninteresting. I'm given to believe that Pretty Boy Floyd is something of a legend, and this novel does very little to tell me why he attained that status. Most of the novel focuses on his exploits with various lovers, rather than on his bank-robbing, which would be fine if there were any more depth to the romantic entanglements than there is to the short-shrifted heists. Worst of all, Floyd himself is a blank. We don't understand why the people close to him remain devoted to him, and therefore I have no idea why I should care about him. All in all, this is a boring novel, and a big disappointment given that one of the authors is McMurtry, who is one of the better novelists America has ever produced."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"The dialog is stilted, and the plot seems to repeat itself over and over...rob bank, spend time with wife/girlfriends, someone dies. Repeat. But, it was well written and there was some interest in the characters."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Larry McMurtry is NOT a man who would ask to rent a pig. Nor did he write anything less than a great book, in Pretty Boy Floyd. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Starting with a bungled armed car holdup in the fog, and ending with me actually holding back tears. Wow! If this helps others with a frame of refence, I loved Lonesome Dove, and Texasville, but didn't really care for Terms of Endearment or Cadilac Jack. If this book was a dead snake, I'd skin it and make it a belt. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Pretty Boy Floyd","review":"Fans of Larry McMurtry need not visit this book for any understanding of whom Charles Arthur Floyd was, what he did or why he ended up doing what he did. While it offers us an interesting and easy read, it offers nothing of the reality of life in depression era Oklahoma (as well as other states) that lead this sad person to become the criminal dubbed as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;. While the writing is easy to follow and the characters are interesting (as are all of Mr. McMurtry's characters)we are lead to believe that someway, somehow this person was wrongly treated and that his robbery of uninsured banks and murder of people doing their jobs in that depressed economy were not only acceptable, but in some way were honorable actions.

If it were, I would dismiss it with three stars and little comment. The first clue that more is afoot here than culls from the Wednesday food section are the blurbs on the back of the dust jacket from Christopher Kimball, Anne Willan, and Steven Raichlen. Kimball I could expect, being a good old boy Yankee New Englander from way back, but Anne Willan is serious stuff.The chapter titles are a bit unusual, but they are exactly the range of topics you would expect to find in newspaper food columns. They are:Appetizers such as deviled eggs, liver pate, ceviche, crab cakes, eggplant caponata, toasts, crackers, etc.Salads such as Eggless Caesar, French Market Salad, Creamy Potatoe Salad, Fattoush, Greek Cypriot, etc.When You're in a Rush with Soups, Chicken, Tuna, Salmon, Bass, and Scallops, quick Bolognese, etc.Dishes We Make All the Time such as Vege Soup, Chili, Yankee Pot Roast, Meatball, Lamb Stew, etc.New Classics such as Corn Chowder, Oyster Stew, Boulangere, Baked Beans, Salmon Cakes, etc.Good Enough For Company with Rack of Pork, Leg of Lamb, Ossobuco, Duck Breasts, Roast Salmon, etc.Simmering Pots with lots of soups and stews such as Cuban Stewed Chicken and Beef Daube, etc.Sides such as Fresh Corn Risotto, Scalloped Tomatoes, Quick Couscous, Blue Cheese Popovers, etc.Rise and Dine with Frittatas, Muffins, Soda Bread, Quesadillas, Banana Bread, Blueberry Loaf Cake, etc.If You Love to Bake with Strawberry Shorkcakes, Carrot Cake, Pies, Tarts, Cookies, Gingerbread, etc.Simple Fruit Desserts with five recipes for apples, oranges, and peaches.The first thing which bumped my opinion up from three stars to four was with the description of how to cook hardboiled eggs. For starters, they recommended my preferred method of pricking a hole in the shell and dropping the eggs into just boiling water. Then, they gave the additional tip of rolling the just dropped eggs around a bit in order to center the yolk in the cooked egg. To cap things off, they gave a recommendation on how to crack the hot eggs to make them easier to peel when they cool.The next thing which warmed my opinion of the book was that I could not find any steps in any recipes which I would do differently. There are few fancy techniques called for in the recipes and almost all of them take no more than a page, but there were also no short cuts.The last thing which appealed to me was the lack of processed ingredients. All pie crusts are made from scratch and I detected no cans of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. I did find the directions for the pie crusts to be less than perfect, as it was lax in calling for very cold ingredients, combined in such a way to keep them cold and to leave bits of butter to fluff up the crust. But then, this is not a book on pie baking and I'm sure the technuque they give works well enough. Another less than ideal baking recipe was the carrot cake, which called for but a single layer. If I am going to the trouble to make a carrot cake with butter cream icing, I will make three layers for sure.This is not a book for died in the wool foodies. Were I not reviewing it, I would not buy it myself, but for that very large number of people who need to make good meals at least three times a week and don't have time to wade through 800 pages of \`The Joy of Cooking' or \`James Beard's American Cookery', this book is just the thing.I think Steve Raichlen's comparison to Julia Child and Simone Beck is misplaced because the latter duo was doing an in depth survey of a very specific local cuisine while the current authors are collecting recipes originating from all over the world and presenting them for a particular audience. So, their emphasis is on a specific audience rather than a specific cuisine. Sorry Steve.This is an excellent book which accomplishes it's mission at a reasonable price.

Therapeutic Parenting is easy to read and well organized, enabling the reader to find information for any specific concern regarding children's emotional issues. The information is clearly defined by topic so that the book can be consulted as problems arise. The language has been distilled from Ms. Kim's case studies where she has drawn from her vast experience in the field of counseling to give any adult the working tools in order to succeed in the complex and difficult world of communicating with children today.

They know just which buttons to push to get a parent going! No matter what problem your child is experiencing and thus, which button he or she is pushing at any given time, it is addressed in this book. Not only does Ms. Kim recognize this issue, she gives examples showing a parent's normal reaction, and then shows how a parent's calm and matter-of-fact response can defuse the situation turning a negative experience into a positive one. The book format makes it an excellent reference guide easily referred to as various situations arise. This makes it a book that can be used over and over again instead of being read once and placed on a shelf. This is definitely a book for every parent.

Younger children will enjoy the realistic and warm illustrations by Diane Stanley. This story tells the tale of a young girl who is forced to go out in a January storm by her stepmother to look for flowers for her stepsister. While stumbling around in the snow, she meets all twelve Month Brothers, representing all the months of the year. My 8 year old has checked this book out of the school library so many times that we are finally purchasing the book for our personal library. That is the highest recommendation any author can get, the repeated reading by a child."},{"Title":"The Month-Brothers : A Slavic Tale","review":"The Month Brothers, A Slavic Tale by Samuel MarshakEveryone knows that the twelve months of the year never meet but in this charming folk tale a little girl saw all twelve months at one time. Deep in the forest around a blazing fire the Months meet together as brothers in the depths of the Winter.On a freezing January night, a wicked woman ordered her stepdaughter to go into the forest to find flowers. The poor child, bundled in her ragged clothes, sets out on her impossible quest. She is without hope knowing that she cannot return without flowers and that flowers won't bloom until March. The young girl weeps as she walks on until she comes upon a glade where twelve men stand warming themselves by a huge fire. They listen to her story, and you must read this book if you want to find out how they help her.This children's book is based on a Soviet-era Russian play The Twelve Months by Samuel (or Samuil) Marshak.

She challenges both believer and non-believer in a dramatic story of humanity balancing on the knife edge of extinction as the most sacred tenets are supported and flipped upside down simultaneously. Her scriptural knowledge forms the basis for an exciting and unprecedented plunge into the unknown and unknowable, a place where hands cover faces, allowing only tenuous peeks through the fingers to watch the approach of doom while praying for salvation. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Chosen: The Final Potential Is Discovered (Battle for Creation)","review":"For a first time author this book is amazing.

With the two captivating protagonists, the loving Raphael, and the troubled Noah, Chosen enchants us into a world we just might wish was our own.With God's arriving retirement the Angels of Heaven scramble to prepare for the coming change. The Vanguard of this transformation is the Archangel Raphael who has lead the Host through the transition of each new God. Tasked with the greatest duty, Raphael and his Angels seek the Potential among us. Each Potential is guided carefully along his path, insurance upon the day it may become His path. But Earth is no longer the innocent land of the faithful it was. Evil's hand touches many and leaves each generation with fewer Potentials. Where devotion reigned, bitterness clouds the eyes of many. Among these hurt people is Noah, a troubled young orphan,While those before were guided by the delicate and invisible hands of Raphael's Angels, Noah is gifted with the sight to see angels and their working in this world.

This work is purely transendental. It merges both her brilliant talent for rhythmical poetry , alive with action and sparks, and her obvious internal knowledge of the stage. The continual metaphors of this book show a dedication to the oral tradition in poetry, taking the reader inward in a burst of colorful motion, then spewing out the dynamics in gesticulation of the written word. Minds who claim that poetry is purely for academic stiffs, prepare to be taken where the lyrical sounds of a modern day female writer will take you, --the stillness in between pulse beats is only a momentary illusion--but swift enough to make the open minded among us dance with the power of poetry. Recommended to those looking to explore both poetry, and acting."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie knocks me out. He breathes original life into the art of literary fiction while laying out the realities of contemporary Native American Indian existence. The LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN is a collection of confluent short stories that can also be read as a novel. In fact they can be read much the same way as Cortezar's HOPSCOTCH, that is, in any particular order, and the whole still adds up with the motion and fury of a novel.Each story is a picture of life on or apart from the Spokane Reservation in Washington state. Alexie moves between voices and perspectives, from the aspect of Reservation children trying to dream of a future amid the oppressive poverty to the adults who often have lost the possibility of purpose. He moves seamlessly between dark wit and profound tragedy, uncovering a multi-layered existence of which white culture has no equal, no comprehension. Yes, he is angry, but he informs readers, he does not beat us up, and he gives us a beautiful literary experience to boot. And more praise: read his other novels, particularly RESERVATION BLUES which shares characters, settings and themes, and be astounded at how Alexie is not redundant but is able to further push his dialogue and artistic borders."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie magnificently depicts the lives of people on the Spokane Indian Reservation through the short stories in his book &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven&quot;. Each story is a piece of the big picture that Alexie is trying to make which simply is to show the hardship and struggle of the lives of the people on the Reservation. This book is fascinating to read because each story is as intriguing as the one which it has just past and the one which proceeds. The lives of the people are filled with anger, pain, hurt, heartbreak, bitterness, love, and the loss of it. It also shows the relationships and how they vary between whites and within their own reservation, and how their lives and the way they view life is completely different than those outside of the Reservation. In &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven&quot;, Alexie's usage of flashbacks help the reader understand the theme of the book: there are many things in life we can't change, even if we want things to turn out differently or have an outcome which we desire. In each story in &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven&quot;, at least one flashback occurs. A typical story in this novel will start off with a story, and then tell another story by flashing back to the past in order to help explain the present story, and then it finishes by going back to the present story. Alexie efficiently uses this technique in order to relate to the theme of endings sometimes don't end up how we wish them to be because many of the traits and stories of the people in the flashbacks didn't really change in the present. People try to change bad habits inherited by their ancestors, but they never seem to be able to. There were times when two people love each other, but one has to leave. These are just a couple of examples of the stories told in this book. Each goes from present to past and then finishes off with the present with leaving the reader with some conclusion or a direction as to how the story would finish. These examples are things that some people can't change, even if they had wanted things to work out, they simply wouldn't. It isn't just love they can't change, often it is basketball, the future, drinking problems, or family. The use of flashbacks enables the reader to really grasp the theme of some things in life cannot be changed, because it shows how things were and how things are now and how many times even though change is wanted, it doesn't always happen."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie's The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is the author's first collection of twenty-two of his short stories. And every single one is an absolute gem. Just as most of William Faulkner's stories conveyed the world of his fictional Alabama county of the Old South and Philip Roth's stories the world of modern American Jews, Alexie's stories take you to a world of Native Americans in and from the modern day Spokane Indian Reservation. His narratives, told from the varying perspectives of different characters - Victor Joseph, Thomas Builds-The-Fire, Junior Polatkin, Norma Many Horses and others - whose lives are frequently intertwined, are beguiling in a seductively bleak way, taking the reader to this world and showing them what it means to live on the bright edge of despair, where alcoholism and dysfunctional relationships are a shared experience, along with HUD houses, commodity cheese, and byzantine BIA bureaucracy.All of the stories here are good, each a glimpse into a live or lives of the characters that slowly build a picture of Alexie's world. \\"The Only Traffic Signal on the Reservation Doesn't Flash Red Anymore\\" is a poignant tale of how hopes are often pinned on promising young basketball players, hopes that on the reservation are all too often dashed before they are realized. \\"This Is What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona\\" (the story that Alexie later used as the basis for his movie Smoke Signals) is about two estranged friends who come together for a road trip to Arizona to bring home the remains of one of the two's father who died there.What is impressive is Alexie's range. A lot of his stories have dryly comic moments like this one from \\"This Is What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona\\":--Victor's father, his ashes, fit in one wooden box with enough left over to fill a cardboard box.--\\"He always was a big man,\\" Thomas said.--Victor carried part of his father and Thomas carried the rest out to the pickup. They set him down carefully behind the seats, put a cowboy hat on the wooden box and a Dodgers cap on the cardboard box. That's the way it was supposed to be.--\\"Ready to head back home,\\" Victor asked.--\\"It's going to be a long drive.\\"--\\"Yeah, take a couple days, maybe.\\"--\\"We can take turns,\\" Thomas said.--\\"Okay,\\" Victor said, but they didn't take turns. Victor drove for sixteen hours straight north, made it halfway up Nevada toward home before he finally pulled over.--\\"hey, Thomas,\\" Victor said. \\"You got to drive for a while.\\"--\\"Okay.\\"--Thomas Builds-the-Fire slid behind the wheel and started off down the road. All through Nevada, Thomas and Victor had been amazed at the lack of animal life, at the absence of water, of movement.--\\"Where is everything?\\" Victor had asked more than once.--Now when Thomas was finally driving they saw the first animal, maybe the only animal in Nevada. It was a long-eared jackrabbit.--\\"Look,\\" Victor yelled. \\"It's alive.\\"--Thomas and Victor were busy congratulating themselves on their discovery when the jackrabbit darted out into the road and under the wheels of the pickup.--\\"Stop the goddamn car,\\" Victor yelled, and Thomas did stop, backed the pickup to the dead jackrabbit.--\\"Oh, man, he's dead,\\" Victor said as he looked at the squashed animal.--\\"Really dead.\\"--The only thing alive in this whole state and we just killed it.\\"--\\"I don't know,\\" Thomas said. \\"I think it was suicide.\\"--Victor looked around the desert, sniffed the air, felt the emptiness and loneliness, and nodded his head.--\\"Yeah,\\" Victor said. \\"It had to be suicide.\\"--\\"I can't believe this,\\" Thomas said. \\"You drive for a thousand miles and there ain't even any bugs smashed on the windshield. I drive for ten seconds and kill the only living thing in Nevada.\\"--\\"Yeah,\\" Victor said. \\"May I should drive.\\"--\\"Maybe you should.\\"And at the same time, Alexie can shift effortlessly into moments of subtle magical realism, particularly when Thomas Builds-the-Fire is telling one of his stories or relating one of his visions (which are often the same thing), like this bit from \\"Tradition is a Drug\\":\\"There are things you should learn. Your past is a skeleton walking one step behind you, and your future is a skeleton walking one step in front of you. Maybe you don't wear a watch, but your skeletons do, and they always know what time it is. Now, these skeletons are made of memories, dreams, and voices. And they trap you in the in-between, between touching and becoming. But they're not necessarily evil, unless you let them be.--What you have to do is keep moving, keep walking, in step with your skeletons. They ain't ever going to leave you, so you don't have to worry about that. Your past ain't going to fall behind, and your future won't get too far ahead. Sometimes, though, your skeletons will talk to you, tell you to sit down and take a rest, breathe a little. Maybe they'll make you promises, tell you all the things you want to hear.--Sometimes your skeletons will dress up as beautiful Indian women and ask you to slow dance. Sometimes your skeletons will dress up as your best friend and offer you a drink, one more for the road. Sometimes your skeletons will look exactly like your parents and offer you gifts.--But, no matter what they do, keep walking, keep moving. And don't wear a watch. Hell, Indians never need to wear a watch because your skeletons will always remind you about the time. See, it is always now. That's what Indian time is. The past, the future, all of it is wrapped up in the now. That's how it is. We are trapped in the now.\\"Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a unique voice and mastery of the short-story as an art form."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This collection of short stories about the American Indian experience is brilliant. I teach this collection in my college lit classes and students love it. The story \\"Because My Father....\\" is a favorite. We read it along with analyzing clips of Jimi Hendrix playing the Banner at Woodstock. I've presented several professional papers at conferences of this story along with the Hendrix clips and the audience of lit profs like it too. Always generates a lot of discussion of the intersections of cultures and classes. Students also love Reservation Blues. (I can't get rid of the \\"Kid\\" tag. Definitely not for kids.)"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie is my favorite contemporary writer. Strangely, I read Indian Killer first, then I proceded onto this great collection. Obviously, the two works are strikingly different but both excellent. I liked this one better. Alexie truly captured life on the Reservation and Indian life in general and how Native Americans relate, survive, stay together in modern America. Above else, this book made me think about a culture I grew up near but didn't pay much attention to. Alexie is truly one of America's best writers."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Although \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven\\" is a collection of short stories told by a variety of characters, one voice emerges, the voice of the Spokane. The short stories tell the life of three main characters, from their childhood to adulthood. They tell of their innocence as children, and their ability to forgive and accept their parents wrong doings. They tell of their plights as adults, how they try to hold on to what traditions they have left. Victor accepts his father, who drank a lot and eventually left him and his mother. Thomas Builds-the-Fire lost both of his parents and grew up with nothing but stories. Jimmy Many Horses had cancer and a wife who left him when he was dying. All of this seems dark and hopeless, but the characters learn to cope with the hopelessness, embrace their tradition, and even find humor in their suffering. Victor's father says that one should remember the few seconds before a painful moment. The part that is good before it turns bad. That helps ease the pain. Each character has a way of easing their pains; Victor listens to music, as his father did so passionately. Thomas has his stories and Jimmy has his letters. The storytelling is wonderful in that it takes a plain happening and turns it into a beautiful piece of art. The problems that face the Native Americans are very serious, and the book helps show them by using dark humor. The stories are imaginative. The meaning of the stories can be lost, but they are still beautiful, giving an excuse to read the book again. Although the book gets confusing at times because of its many perspectives, I would still recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie's &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; is a vivd accound of the life on an Indian reservation in modern day. Instead of focusing on one character, Alexie shared stories of several different people which gives a more complete description. There is Victor, who is brought up around alcoholism, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, who is constantly telling stories, and Jimmy Many Horses, who jokes about his cancer. The characters are very unforgettable as their experiences are told in a most entertaining way. Since each chapter is a different story it is hard to tell which character is being described. It goes from VIctor in one chapter to Jimmy Many Horses in the next. That can definitely be confusing. But what it shows best is life through the eyes of true Spokane Indians and their struggle with depression, alcoholism, and seclusion. Alexie shows the contrasts between modern Indians and the Indians of the past and how the traditions were lost. It gives views of whites through Indian eyes and how they have dealt with inferiority. Though it has many strengths, it also has weaknessess. Other than the confusion between characters, there is also a confusion on time. In one chapter it's 1976 and in the next it's 1992 and sometimes it isn't explained very well. But Alexie definitey gets his point across in showing the world the hard times faced by Indians growing up in modren day USA. It's a very entertainig book that is easy to read and very seldom put down. I definitely believe it could be the Bible for modern day Native Americans in this country."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I've wanted this book ever since i watched &#34;Smoke Signals&#34; for the first time. I am now a fan of Sherman Alexie!"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I came to this book after reading \\"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,\\" a wonderful and important book. From that standpoint, this collection of short stories reads like a rough draft. Like most collections, there are good stories and those not-so-good. Unlike many collections, there are recurring characters.Many of the characters and the stories are recognizable in the later \\"Diary.\\" They become a full-blown novel and coherent story. Here they are less coherent and much more ragged in quality. There are also two semi-autobiographical recurrent characters here, a feature that obviously differs from \\"Diary.\\" In each case, \\"Diary\\" is the better work.The collection is ragged in part because it lies too close to what I imagine Alexie's journal looks like. A few stories are highly polished, while others still need quite a bit of work. Some are collections of anecdotes, and the book as a whole often seems like a collection of anecdotes. The introduction to this version is a mature reflection on Alexie's first two books, which made his reputation (this is the second). After the sensation of the first, he went with the agent who would push this book without much more work, and he tells the story of rejecting the superstar agent who wanted him to work on it for two more years. He was offended, but my reaction is that his would-be agent was probably right.This book has been criticized for its relentless portrayal of relentless drinking on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Alexie defends that as \\"Reservation Realism,\\" and I am not one to challenge him. In this book, the drinking is without hope; \\"Diary\\" also has its alcoholics but the landscape of drinking is more varied and less relentless, leaving space for hope.If I had read this book first, I think I would have liked it more. As you can tell from this review, I don't think it can hold a candle to the later masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"\\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" is a great collection of short stories and the perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the works of Sherman Alexie. Alexie was born and raised on the Spokane Indian reservation in Washington, and many of these stories are based off of real experiences from his time there. The topics this book covers range from alcoholism, relationships between a father and son, and traditional American Indian culture, something that these people are losing more and more as the years go by.The stories mainly follow a Spokane Indian named Victor. The stories in the book are all independent of each other, they only share people and setting. In some of the stories, Victor is a little boy witnessing the evils of alcoholism and its effects on the people living on the reservation. In some others, he interacts with his father. Some of the stories also include a character named Thomas Builds-the-fire, a childhood friend of Victors who is known, but not necessarily liked, on the reservation for his ability to tell stories in the vein of traditional Indian storytelling. His presence in the collection gives us the voice of traditional Indian culture, which is not often seen these days in contemporary literature.If you can read this review, I would recommend this book to you. Alexie is a brilliant writer. If you are unfamiliar with the current state of American Indian life, Alexie's prose will take you on a very enjoyable, and informative, ride. If you are already a fan of Alexie, this work is one of his darker and it would be the one that helped launch his very successful writing career. Five stars!"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I want to press a copy of The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight In Heaven by Sherman Alexie into the arms of my good friends. This book is comprised of vignettes pertaining to reservation life, which though often bleak has an undercurrent of hope. There are 22 stories which weave together to form a portrait of what life may be like for the Spokanes. Life is peppered with poverty, alcoholism, basketball, music and dancing. Certainly, there are universal themes within this book.The characters are vivid and three-dimensional. They have their strengths and their flaws. Alcoholism is rather a prevalent flaw for many of the characters. I don't particularly find the alcoholism offensive, as it is unfortunately the number one health problem for Native Americans, so props to Alexie for not painting Native Americans as mystical creatures, but as real people with real problems.I think the prose within this book is gorgeous. It's simple, yet illustrates hard truths. I just want to quote the whole book for you. However, I will settle by showing you my favorite quotes.\\"I guess every song has a special meaning for someone somewhere. Elvis Presley is still showing up in 7-11 stores across the country, even though he's been dead for years, so I figure music just might be the most important thing there is.\\" - pg. 29Again, music is so universal. I love how true this rings to me, and how much it reminds me of some people I know who are truly passionate about music.\\"In the outside world, a person can be a hero one second and a nobody the next....A reservation hero is a hero forever. In fact, their status grows over the years as the stories are told and retold.\\" pg. 48The prevalence of hope, sunshine in a place of bleakness...\\"Once, he owned a black-and-white television. He thought everything was much clearer then. Color complicated even the smallest events.\\" - pg. 87I just loved the way this was written. Maybe, not a huge special meaning, but to me, lovely writing.\\"Thomas looked at these five men who shared his skin color, at the white man who shared this bus which was going to deliver them into a new kind of reservation, barrio, ghetto, logging-town tin shack.\\" - pg. 103Poverty is universal, no matter your background, the man is there to keep you down. I know, I know, bleeding hearts and all, but honestly, poverty does suck a lot."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is a collection of short stories written by one of my favorite authors, Sherman Alexie. Alexie's writing can be very powerful and beautiful, and it has the added bonus of taking us out of our comfort zones and letting us see \\"how the other half lives\\" in the United States. Alexie is a Spokane Indian, and his writing has been formed in part by growing up on the reservation.Growing up in central Illinois, I had no clue about reservations, other than knowing that the governmental policy always seemed to be one of placing reservations on worthless pieces of land. It wasn't until I moved to Arizona and could drive to places like Chinle or Page that I realized that there are indeed countries within the United States. The Navajo Nation is a nation. It has its own police force, its own language, and-- unlike the rest of Arizona-- observes Daylight Savings Time. The trials many Navajo face just to have enough water for themselves and their livestock on a daily basis are trials that you and I would never put up with. We deserve better. (Hopefully I didn't lace that last bit with too much sarcasm.)We need writers like Alexie. Not only does he possess story-telling magic, he reminds us that we need to take off our rose-colored glasses from time to time and take a much closer look at America. There's work to be done. This collection of short stories contains the seeds of future films and books. It spans several years in his development as a writer, since some were written when he was nineteen:\\"So why am I telling you that these stories are true? First of all, they're not really true. They are the vision of one individual looking at the lives of his family and his entire tribe, so these stories are necessarily biased, incomplete, exaggerated, deluded, and often just plain wrong. But in trying to make them true and real, I am writing what might be called reservation realism.\\"I would imagine that, if all writers were completely honest with us, they'd have to say that what they write is often biased, incomplete, exaggerated, deluded, and just plain wrong. Sometimes you need to do some (or all) of those things to get your point across. Although these stories aren't as strong as his novels Indian Killer or Flight (both of which blew me away), I'm glad I read these stories. They are good, and they show the evolution of a very gifted writer."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I was originally required to read this book for my English class, but I ended up really enjoying it. Sherman Alexie is an outstanding author and I plan on reading more of his work. I think everyone should read it!!"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The most important thing to realize before jumping into The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven--or even reading anything by Sherman Alexie--is that the author is Native American, and his humor and presentation does nothing to soften his portrayal of the gritty reality still found on many reservations. Native Americans are a serious people who rarely take themselves seriously. We are not the grim stoics or the tragic figures of past lore. Sherman Alexie brings together past and present perceptions and presents them in a fashion of the Native American colored by their own culture AND that of the West (as in West v. East, not western expansion).This book is a collection of short stories, with the general basis of location being their common theme, and anyone looking for a further connection is sure to be disappointed. One could assume before opening an anthology of Stephen King that the stories are going to be unrelated--or if there is a connection, that it is loosely based. I do not see why it should be any different for this collection. Take each story as it is."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Have your students read this book.

Alexie has an old soul and he conveys its insights with a power and beauty that a rare few writer can attain; he writes in the ranks of the Classic Pens and I have no doubt that he will be considered such in days to come.This collection of stories is astounding in their breadth and depth of emotion, and Alexie shares with aplomb the struggle of the Ancient with the Modern and the clash his peoples are embroiled in as they seek to maintain their connections to the past while attempting to find - and embrace - their rightful place in the present.Alexie's characters are real, poignant, heartbreaking, wise, wonderful, complex, astute, ordinary, extraordinary...If you want to blast away forever your preconceived ideas about the Native culture and its peoples, pick up this man's work - any of the titles.

However, white liberals will still find them an awkward and painful read, regardless how enlightened they perceive themselves and whether they are in agreement that American Indians are victims of oppression. Alexie speaks from the perspective of a victim of white oppression and with understandable resentment, anger, and prejudice against Caucasians. Many well intentioned whites will find these stories difficult to embrace, and certainly not &quot;enjoyable&quot;. In this respect I found reading these stories reminiscent of the experience reading Elderidge Cleaver's &quot;Soul on Ice&quot; -- awkward and disturbing, but undeniably valid.Alexie's stories are educational, and essential as they introduce us to a perspective and condition with which most Americans are entirely unfamiliar -- decidedly &quot;benign neglect&quot;. While the context is depressing: poverty, alcoholism, poor self image, an absence of motivation, and the distain, if not active hostility of the majority population, Alexie's tales also are warm and touching. Despite the destructiveness of the circumstances into which American Indians are born, he describes a proud group self identity (if often ambivalent) and the importance of family and community among American Indians, despite the challenges which work to pull them apart.Sensitive, profound, and often sardonic, these are very important stories and we owe Alexie our gratitude for providing them."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot;, by Sherman Alexie, is incredible collection of short stories.

If you said you only read half of it, I won't believe you! This book introduces us to a whole range of characters (American Indians) living on a reservation. Sherman Alexie takes us into their lives, which is filled with humour, and also frustration. My favorite character was Victor. I liked him because he has a huge history and rich culture... and it mixes with the new western civilization. We also see how he developes, so it was interesting. All in all, if you are remotely interested in learning about the difficulties of a &quot;coming of age&quot; in the US, or just looking for a few hard-to-put-down tales about Native Americans... buy this book."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This book made me want to be a writer. No one mixes humor and melancholy quite like Alexie does. I think it's groundbreaking in that Alexie shows what it's like to be a young person of color in contemporary times, as the experiences of characters in the LRATFIN ring true for blacks, Latinos and members of other ethnic minority groups. Yes, we have our Toni Morrisons and our Louise Erdrichs, but this books shows what it's like to be a young person of color in a \\"white\\" world in the here and now. I also love the elements of \\"magical realism\\" in the collection. The Shermanator rules!"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"From his many short stories of pain, suffering, and broken dreams, Sherman Alexie taught his readers of the lives of present-day Native Americans. He confronts many significant issues, through the stories of the people around him. For example in the story of a great basketball hero, Julius Windmaker, who falls into the trap of drinking and carries out senseless acts of violence to prove his worth as a warrior to the tribe, Alexie depicts the Native American struggle against there traditions of the past and new reservation life. From this, he shows Julius, like countless other Native Americans, have their dreams crushed as they turn to a life of drinking. Countless other issues were raised, however towards the conclusion of the book Alexie describes what he considers the perfect Native American, Norma Many Horses. As she appreciated her ancient traditions, yet living modernly. Norma was respected by all, kind to everyone and very forgiving."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Alexie is a masterful writer. The images in the title story, \\"A Drug Called Tradition\\" and \\"The Trial of Thomas Builds-the-Fire\\" are not only beautiful but compelling. An inspiring read."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This is not a culture I know very much about--American Indian. Well-written, sensitive, insightful. I was moved and intrigued."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven, by Sherman Alexie, had to be the most confusing book that I've ever read. It's strange but in the end I really liked it. The stories were so well written and had a flow to each of them even though I still can't tell what the connections were between the characters from one story to another besides the whole being Native American thing. The characters in each story had different outlooks on life and on how to survive and just live. The first chapter &quot;Every Little Hurricane&quot;, was this mix of emotions seen from the surroundings of a little kid. The whole basis for what he saw had to do with alcoholism. He first ignored it than accepted it and just dealt. That's not something that you see in someone so young. He shouldn't have had to accept it but than again that was his life and nothing could be changed. Two of the of the stories that I think were best connected was &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and &quot;Because My Father Always Said...&quot;. The first went on about creating images in mind that reflect and show the people in your past. The second story actually did this. It showed a boy's images of his father after his father left him and his mother. They were never negative images just the best memories that he could think up. I think that most people can relate to that. This book was on e of the best I've read all year. The stories captured your attention as you realized that you sometimes feel just the same way as the character in the story. A lot of the stories came off as being long poems because of the way the author wrote them they just flowed so well. Some stories weren't as captivating as others but I enjoyed the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"_The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" is a series of vignettes of modern-day life on the Reservation. The stories are sad - tragic, even - but also deeply moving and at times, humourous (in a gallows-humor kind of way.) It is a profound commentary on the struggles of Native Americans, battling the remnants of their past and their marginalization in the present. A sense of desperation, hopelessness and failure runs through the stories as the characters struggle with alcoholism, prejudice, and the injustices of the past. Yet there remains a strong sense of community and love even as they fight among themselves.The stories are rich with symbolism, but there is also an honesty and forthrightness in the experiences Alexie relates, particularly in the struggle between \\"Urbans\\" (Natives who have left the reservation) and \\"Skins\\" (Natives who remain on the reservation). Should this be required reading for students? I think so - _The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" ranks up there with _To Kill a Mockingbird_ and _A Raisin in the Sun_ with contemporary literature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This book was amazing. The book grabs your attention on the first page and doesn't let go even as you finish that last page. The book leaves you looking for the next story. The stories show you so many sides of Reservation life. After reading this book I feel like I understand Reservation life a lot more then I did before reading this book. I think it takes you inside of the Indian culture, their family life, and into the lives of the people. It surpasses all the superficial, sugarcoated crap that they teach you in school and shows you what really goes on behind \\"closed doors\\".This novel has very strong voice, you feel as if you are there, always being given a little more and a little more to keep you reading. It takes you into the world and lives of the characters, it makes you understand their lives and see a lot of different sides and aspects of reservations life. It gives you details that most books wouldn't dare deal with. It brings reservation literature to a new level of understanding. When I put down the book, I felt as if I had known the characters in the book for years. I felt like I was in the book. The characters speech fit the story, they didn't try and sugar coat things, and the author gave it to you like it is. I think knowing the characters gave to book so much more meaning. And with getting to know the characters, you got a feel for there surroundings. You feel as if you can see their homes and the land on the reservation. I could visualize in my head the places that they went to through out the book.All and all I think this is a wonderful book, I think that if you are interested in Native American literature you should check this book out. It is written very well and well keep you reading and wanting more."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I was very impressed by the book although it was hard to get used to, Alexie has a really difined, confusing form of writing where he uses a lot of reacurring implicit metaphorical themes and the writing is majoritly based around these themes but after a while of reading one begins to understand how he writes. I enjoyed the book but it is not a book that I could get deeply involved in because you don't grow a relatioship with the charecters like you would with a book that is just a constant plot instead of short stories. Yes Victor is the main charecter for most of the storys but you dont really learn the charecters consistent emotions and personality because he's more of a person whom some of the storys are about then a story following one peroson and his life. I belive for the intention of the book it worked well but it doesn't appeal to me as much as a tradiional book, I liked how the storys are told, in a very realist, unfantasized way that is intresting because it is believable that it is non-ficiton and people are attracted to firsthand accounts of poverty that don't fantasize it nor do they look for pity. I believe that it was very creative and believable and the cool part is the storys are very possibly made up but also very possibly true but teetering on the virge of unreal, backwards trucks and drunk indians on the rollercoaster, thats what makes this series of storys so intresting is that the reader can make up what they want for the underlying metaphor and if it is a happy or sad set of storys, I saw it overall as a happy set because the people aren't always too unhappy but are satasfied with where they are partially because they dont have the motivation to pursue anything more, partially because is INdian tradition and partially because they really dont mind too much that they are living in HUD house on an Indian reservation. Overall I enjoyed the book and felt it was well written."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Winner of two Sundance Film Festival awards, writer of the screenplay for Smoke Signals, along with a few other books and collections of poetry, Sherman Alexie authored The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.Victor, a nine-year-old Spokane Indian boy, awoke on New Year's Eve of 1976 to the sound of his parents having a party. Not only did he awake to a party, soon after he heard his uncles fighting. Not that this was a surprise to young Victor, but every time they fought it made him angry because he knew there was more pain than could ever be spoken. Remembering back to earlier days, Victor remembers that around this same time when he was five he saw his father look into his wallet and reach for money that wasn't there. Alexie uses such vivid details in explaining the pain Victor endured seeing his father cry, one of my favorites is how he describes Victor seeing his father's tears as \\"... millions of icy knives through the air, each specific and beautiful. Each dangerous and random.\\" It is symbolism such as this that keeps the reader engaged and interested throughout the book. Alexie continues on using different characters such as Thomas-Builds-the-Fire who never gives up on his storytelling, and Jimmy Many Horses who is dying of cancer.Although this is an engaging book and gives the reader a different perspective on what it's really like to live and grow up on a reservation, Alexie can be slow at times. He reminds me a little of one of those sob stories you hear on a bad small claims court case on TV. Maybe it sounds a little harsh, but you know when an argument is clearly over yet the defendant just keeps on going? There are a few times in this book where I just had to put it down and ignore it for a while because I couldn't handle Alexie's humor of basketball and drunken dancing. Overall, I would have to give Alexie props for this book because he does use some incredible sensory descriptions. Hopefully for his next novel though he can get past some of his shattered dreams and stick to a story."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This book is true about what happens on the rez in a young natives life and I think most natives would agree with me the drunk fights the parties the drugs thats what I like about the book its not non of that dumb harry potter [stuff] its based on indian life and if your looking for somthing real not non of that hockas pokas [stuff] then read this book thats all I got to say about this book"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Lone Ranger &amp; Tonto was awesome.

Well I finally got a hold of this one and I couldn't put it down. It is written so fluidly that it is obvious he is a poet and the stories are interesting and subtle. Each story conveys Alexie's life philosophies and some interesting insight on the fate of the Native Americans in today's society. Although at times it can be depressing this book is written with a touch of black humor and sometimes you can't help but laugh at the ironies."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Alexie captures the delicate balance of humor and anger that is present in everyday life for Indians on and off the &quot;Res.&quot; This young man has shown a great aptitude for the short story, as well as poetry and the novel. I look forward to reading more"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I tend not to like short stories; to me, novelsare preferable because you have so much more tosink into and leave the world behind for awhile.In fact, I probably wouldn't have picked up thisbook if I hadn't already read, and liked, &quot;Reservation Blues&quot;by the same author.I found myself pleasantly surprised. This is an incrediblyenjoyable collection that pulls you in and shakesthe cobwebs out of your brain. Far from escapist,these stories *feel* like real life, which is always a mark of good fiction. Alexie is a master at the humorous twist, inserting hilarious one-liners where you least expect them without interrupting the flow of the story (&quot;The only living thing in the state of Nevada, and we killed it.&quot;)I've heard that &quot;This is what it means to say Phoenix, Arizona&quot; is being made into a film, and I'm eager to see how Alexie's spare, yet panoramic style translates to that medium."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie's short stories are both vivid and refreshingly honest. Discussing everything from a basketball game to a battle with cancer. Each story has such an element of truth, I find myself wondering if this is really a book of fiction. Alexie has a way of relating everything faced on the reservation with all people. While my knowledge of Indians does not go past my 7th grade study of them, I found myself relating to so many of the issues discussed. &quot;Do you ever want kids?&quot; I asked Norma. &quot;Yeah, of course,&quot; she said. &quot;I want a dozen. I want my own tribe.&quot; &quot;You're kidding.&quot; &quot;Kind of. Don't know if I want to raise kids in this world. It's getting uglier by the second. And not just on the reservation.&quot; (Page 207) I don't think Alexie could have captured my thoughts on the subject any better, maybe this is why I enjoyed reading &quot;Tonto and The Lone Ranger Fistfight In Heaven&quot; so much. It not only opened my eyes to Native Americans, but showed me there were other people that felt this way on many of the issues. A very comforting feeling. I highly recommend this book, and feel privileged at the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The author's introduction is well worth reading; it made me want to jump into the book. This book could only have received a lot of attention because of the author and unique title. Must have been very cathartic for author S. Alexi. Very disappointing. My two stars are only for the writing. One or two of the stories would have been more than enough for me."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"For those of you who read the works of leading, contemporary writers, this book should be in your hands and in your library. The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is an excellent collection of short short stories that delivers high-velocity entertainment and quickly rips away the space between reader and writer. You will be completely immersed in the realistic and sometimes fantastical literary world of Sherman Alexie.As a mesmerizing storyteller with feathery wings, Sherman Alexie's keen, double-edged intellect will at times soar with the reader to extraordinary heights of literary fantasy while exploring the realistic and often difficult world of the Indians on the rez. Reading this collection of stories is more than entertainment. It is an experience."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Lone Ranger And Tonto Fistfight In Heaven&quot; is the short story collection which made Alexie a darling of the literary establishment. In these tersely written tales Alexie offers much pathos and humor, replete with irony, in his engaging glimpses at life on a contemporary American Indian reservation. Several of the tales feature the character &quot;Thomas Builds-A-Fire&quot;; these were later adapted for the film &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;. Like Frank McCourt, Alexie excels in turning poverty into high literary art, using much of the same sardonic humor present in McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;. Certainly this short story collection is an impressive debut by one of our finest American writers."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"In the book The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven Junior struggles with his background and his life. He lives on a Indian Reservation and through out the book he is telling stories about his life, his past, and his friends lives. Life is not easy on the reservation and many things that we take for granted are rare commodities there. The book is a collection of short stories that I found to be very confusing at times. When Thomas Builds the Fire is brought to trial and he tells the stories in his defense I was lost. Other Chapters I really enjoyed. The chapter about James and how he will not talk I found to be captivating. It was a change of pace from the rest of the book because I showed more intellect and more hope for the future generations. Some parts of the book were quite sad but written in a way that I found them quite funny. When Victor was diagnosed with cancer but uses hummor to try to get through it I found to be uplifting. He knew that he was going to die and because he thought that he lived a happy life he did not want to spend the last of it being sad and feeling sorry for himself. And when he has to be driven to get his wife and he gets the one person on the resorvation that drives backwards is so ironic. Driving backwards was his way of showing what a weird world that they were living in and even though it may be odd it does not mean that they can not be as happy or as sad as the rest of the world. I though that the book was well written and even though I did not particuarlly enjoy it I think many others will. It shows us a world that were in our minds strown with stereotypes about Indians and because of the this book I feel a little more enlightened into the world on a resorvation."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"A fantastic contemporary look at life for Native American descendents. An excellent book. One I highly recommend. Deep and passionate with a fine line of humor that sometimes had me laughing out loud.. It is a very realistic book with very well written stories. I also recommend: Ceremony and My Fractured Life."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie, himself a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian, writes with great wit and obvious anguish about life on the modern Indian reservation. This book, it isn't really a novel but 22 interlinked stories, depicts a life where alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, car wrecks and violence compete with history for a claim on the residents' souls and where the worst epithet is &quot;apple&quot;, an Indian who is red on the outside but white on the inside. The cumulative impact of the stories is to create a sense of despair. It seems like the characters are unwilling to break out of a hopeless cycle of doom, defeatism and failure.The best of the stories, &quot;This Is What it Means to say Phoenix, Arizona&quot;, offers a glimpse at the possibility for something better.The stories are relatively free of the New Age wise Indian pabulum we see so much of and despite a few dated and silly references to things like El Salvador, overt politics doesn't intrude much. Best of all, Alexie does not make excuses for his characters. He recognizes that their dismal lives are the product of conscious choices, but that the choices are bad ones. This is the great strength of the book, his ability to judge the characters harshly, yet present them with obvious affection.However bleak, this is a very interesting book.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I came to Alexie's book through \`Smoke Signals', the movie that was loosely base on it. While the movie was first rate, and touched on the themes of despair and sadness endemic to life on the Reservation, it in no way prepared me for the dark, brooding, bitterness that lies coiled like a snake ready to strike at the heart of Alexie's prose. He has distilled five hundred years of his culture's loosing battle against the interlopers who have replaced them in their own land down into a powerful, bitter prose that rivals that of the greatest and grimmest of Russian novels.If this was all there was to the book, \`The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven' would have a limited appeal at best. But there is much more here. Alexie's talent at creating characters rivals that of Dickens, and the residents of the Reservation whom he introduces us to in these short stories are likely to stay in your imagination forever. Also, his sense of humor and comic timing are just as deft as his skill at emoting bitterness and despair. This softens the blow of his grim vision just enough to allow us to appreciate its bitter beauty.Though I have no first hand experience of life on the Reservation, these stories feel as raw and honest as anything that I have ever read - painfully honest. Alexie has taken that pain and reshaped it into something beautiful and wonderful, and provided a window into a world that most of us will never know.After reading this book, I am convinced that Sherman Alexie is a master talent, who will eventually take his place in the pantheon of great American writers. He was a wonderful discovery, and if you have not yet experienced his work, well then, get to it!Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The title itself is very intriguing. The title pits two famous american icons, who are indian and white, against each other. Sort of setting the stage for reservation life in the present day. A constant clash between races and rights. This collection of short stories, in my mind, is one of the best books published by a Native American ever. The author, Sherman Alexie, has a very distinct voice. He sets scenes very well and the descriptive language he uses is great. Each chapter brings a new adventure and a new lesson to learn. Alexie creates many interesting characters in Lone Ranger and Tonto but a few stand out. One is Victor who was left by his father at a young age and goes threw many adventures chronicled by Alexie. One of his adventures is very well depicted in the film Smoke Signals. The movie focuses on Victor traveling to Arizona to retrieve his dead Fathers remains. Smoke Signals focuses on my favorite chapter in the book anyway. A lot of issues are brought up between Thomas Builds-The-Fire and Victor. Their travels bring them closer together and many of their past conflicts are resolved. Usually I'm not a sucker for stories with corny happy endings but this one got me. I read this book for a school assignment and usually I don't like to read books issued by teachers as required reading but I liked this one. It isn't my favorite book of all time but I liked it. That is saying a lot because I don't read much outside of the classroom and getting exposed to new authors I like is always fun."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie fearlessly confronts the problems faced by the Native Americans of Spokane, Washington. With his sense of hilarity and deep berevity, Alexie points to such problems as alcoholism, broken families, drug abuse, poverty, loss of culture, loss of community, and loss of pride. While it may appear as though Alexies' musings are all \\"fun-and-games,\\" it will not be difficult for the reader to discern that there is something deeply troubling about most of the characters in Alexies' writings. One gets the sense that when ALexie paints a verbal picture of the reservation, a sense of utter hoplessness prevades the entire situation. Just look at the picture on the book cover. If one were to look closely, they would be able to see a pickup truck making its way away from the reservation. The reservation that it is leaving appears to be in flames. One of the main character's father drinks himself to death, and his son is too poverty stricken to even come collect the remains. It is not all bad, however. Alexie does offer a corridor of redemption when the main character ( a young Indian named Victor) adopts a child and turns his life around, leading one to beleive that all hope is never lost. All in all, this read is both heart breaking and hilarious as Alexie writes some genuinely funny material."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This gifted Native American poet offers us a collection of beautiful, powerful, and ultimately very sad stories about the lives of Spokane Indians in the modern world. Loosely unified by time and place and occasionally by character as well, these stories paint a bleak landscape of wasted lives and forgotten people. The protagonist of these stories - a young man ironically named \\"Victor\\" - epitomizes the problems endemic to his people. What does a warrior do once the battle is over? How does a proud man accept subservience? How can a man have good relationships with others when he despises himself? Alcoholism and despair are rampant. Love and basketball are the only joys left in this young man's life - and both are all-too fleeting.Despite the hilarious and somewhat misleading title, there's very little humor in this book - and only of the wryest, blackest sort. The darkness of this man's worldview casts a pall over what otherwise might have been amusing situations, and it's hard to feel anything more than sorrow at the plight of these lost souls. Although Alexie's prose possesses an austere beauty, the book is recommended more for the power of its message than for the entertainment it provides."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I totally adore this book. I first read it in 1994 as a Freshman in High School. It's how I fell in love with Sherman Alexie (he spoke at my graduation last year at the University of Washington and was FABULOUS!!). It's such a lyrical story, the vignettes are lovely, very poignant.I love Thomas Builds-The-Fire so MUCH!! It makes me so sad the way in which he is received by most people in this book. His stories are so precious and important, I want to blast them over loud speakers!!So glad I re-read this. Such a beautiful string of intertwined vignettes, even when discussing UN-beautiful things, Alexie's poetic words caress my tongue and brain. Ahhhhh....Good Stuff. Very Powerful. Everyone should read this, at least once."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"\\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" is one of Sherman Alexie's first collections of short stories. The collection deals with the lives and troubles of Indian in and around the Spokane Indian Reservation. The stories also deal with characters that Alexie would later revisit in his novel \\"Reservation Blues\\" (specifically, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, Victor, and Junior).In a 1996 interview with Tomson Highway, Alexie explains a bit about the title of this collection: \\"Kemosabe in Apache means \\"idiot,\\" as Tonto in Spanish means \\"idiot.\\" They were calling each other \\"idiot\\" all those years; and they both were, so it worked out. It's always going to be antagonistic relationship between indigenous people and the colonial people. I think the theme of The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is universal.\\"This universal theme permeates many of Alexie's stories here and in his other writings. The stories take a fresh, sometimes painful, look at life for modern Indians on the Spokane Reservation. Alcoholism, violence, and death all permeate this collection. At the same time, Alexie brings an extreme level of humor and compassion to these characters, making their hardships bearable to the reader.The stories here mostly interconnect, referring to the same events or at least the same characters, creating a narrative that almost flows between stories. Exceptions to this flow include \\"Distances.\\" \\"Witnesses, Secret and Not\\" and \\"Jesus Christ's Half-Brother Is Alive and Well on the Spokane Indian Reservation\\" also seem disconnected but remain similar in style to the rest of the collection. A follow up to \\"The Business of Fancydancing,\\" a collection of short stories and poems, the stories in this collection alternate between a poetic style and a more conventional prose style.The characters in these stories have not reached \\"happily ever after,\\" it is not clear if they will ever get there. Sometimes, the characters are at fault for these failures. At other times they are victims of circumstances far beyond their control. Regardless of the reason, Alexie portrays his characters with compassion and the hope that they will one day succeed. Even Victor, a drunk continuously falling off the wagon, and Lester FallsApart (whose name might say everything) are presented with a certain dignity and afforded a degree of respect throughout the stories.When writing about such modern problems as car wrecks and alcoholism, there is always the risk of being too serious, too tragic. In \\"A Good Story\\" Alexie acknowledges this fact when his self-proclaimed storyteller, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, goes out of his way to tell a happy story.Other stories remain less concerned with themes discussed and instead are focused on presenting rich narratives. One favorite is \\"The Only Traffic Signal on the Reservation Doesn't Flash Red Anymore\\" in which Victor and his friend watch reservation life from their porch while drinking Diet Pepsis. However, bar none, the best stories in this collection are the title story and \\"Somebody Kept Saying Powwow.\\" Both stories are as evocative and compelling as any novel. Furthermore, in each story Alexie creates characters that are unique, well-developed and completely absorbing--no easy feat for stories of around ten pages.\\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" does two important things. First, it illustrates Sherman Alexie's wide range of talents as a writer. Second, it tells a lot of good stories."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie has an incredible gift for writing direct and poignant prose which greatly impacts the reader. His style of writing swept me into the book and I was hooked the whole way through. In Lone Ranger and Tonto, Alexie combines the sad truth about life on the reservations with his wry sense of humor to create an interesting collection of stories. One story claimed: \\"It's hard to be optimistic on the reservation. When a glass sits on a table here, people don't wonder if it's half filled or half empty. They just hope it's good beer.\\" In another tale a character said \\"Why should we organize a reservation high school reunion? My graduating class has a reunion every weekend at the Powwow Tavern.\\"Not only does Alexie confront the problem of alcoholism, but he also talks about all other aspects of life on the reservation from the viewpoint of different characters. Basketball, tradition, powwows, fry bread, music and hope are mentioned repeatedly in the stories. However, the stories themselves can be confusing because the narrators, characters and even time periods can change. The best way to describe the collection of stories is that it is a photo album that contains pictures of many different people from many different times; each tale in the book acts like a photo of a person that represents one of their struggles or experiences. Together the images form a complex picture of modern Native American society, even the \\"photos\\" don't completely correspond to each other. However, looking past the confusing issue of who is telling the story and simply trying to understand what the narrator is saying makes the book worthwhile. Alexie writes with such depth, truth and wit that the book is a joy to read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I found this book sitting in my classroom (I'm a teacher) when I moved into it. One night, having little to do, I took it home and opened it. I had a basic knowledge of Sherman Alexie's work, but had never read any of his stuff. Finding that book in my classroom turned out to be a stroke of good luck.The book is a fast read, but manages still to convey complex stories and messages. At first, the short stories seem disconnected, but as you read on, you come to recognize patterns, connections, and themes. It is a book that I can open up, read a story or two, then put it down and feel satisfied. The short stories do well on their own or as a part of the larger stories."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I had to have this for class and it was cheaper here than at my student bookstore. I ended up doing my final research paper on it. But it will likely sit on my shelf for a long time. It was good, better than the other books we needed for class, but I won't read it again."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The book is a collection of short stories whose characters keep returning. There is no single plot, although Victor comes closest to being the protagonist. The stories feature residents of the Spokane Reservation and convey the current state of the American Indian: mostly depressing. Alexie, however, tells his people's stories in such a desperately real yet humorous way that it is as fascinating as it is educational (for most of us). I have always appreciated gallows humor."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie is one of the more peculiar authors I've ever read. He has a very personal way to tell a story and to choose the words to tell it. He has an incredible eye for the setting. In just few well chosen words he can \`make you be there', seeing, smelling, touching the reservation, or whatever other setting he chooses (but it's seldom very far from the rez). He has a way to bring characters to you that you would think you can nearly speak to these people. They're there, you can touch them, you can hear their words, both spoken or only thought. You can touch their emotions.It's a very pregnant style. When you read it, you're invested with the places and the people and feeling. They're all around you.And yet, he leaves a lot of space to the reader. There are a lot of things as a reader you have to sort out by yourself. Alexie gives you the row stuff, a very rich, textured, flavoured row stuff, but then you as a reader have to work it out and turn it into a refined idea or sensation.So, my experience with this book, which is the first I read by Alexie, was this strange dual occurrence: he gave me a lot of what it's his, but he left space to me to put my experience in and feel in the gaps. So that our experience mix, and they have a meaning because they mix. Because in the moment I put forward my own ideas and thoughts and feelings to make sense of the story, I let his ideas and thoughts and feelings come freely to me.I think this is the reason why, even if Alexie always tells about Indians, in a very strongly Indian way and language, from an achingly Indian outlook on the world, seen thought places which are Indian and experiences which are undoubtedly Indian, when his message comes to me it is, most of the time, a universal message. Something which I can understand, and feel and experience as if my own.There are many stories in this collection. Some are funny, some are haunting, some are sorrowful. Some are all of this together. Humour is never far away, no matter how tragic a story may be.My favourite are the three about Thomas Build-the-Fire. There are many recurring characters in this collection, Victor, Junior, Thomas, Seymour. Still I came to the conclusion they are not really the same people even when they carry the same name. It's more like they're the same kind of person and the name is a symbol to identify them.For me, it's the same with Thomas. He's the keeper of memory, the one who remembers the past and tries strenuously to make his people remember. Sometimes he's listened to, but more often he's shied away, made fun of, even beat up. And still he never gives up. He's always there when his people need him.He's a young, freaky boy in the first two stories he appears in, \\"A Drug Called Tradition\\" and \\"What it Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona\\" (beautiful, this one). He's the guy who think he can fly and breaks a leg jumping from the roof of the school. But even as his pears laugh at him for that stupid idea, they envy him for believing he could do it. He's an old man in the last one, \\"The Trial of Thomas Build-the-Fire\\". The man who didn't speak for tens of years and when he finally speaks again at his trial, he tells stories his people thought they had lost, he awakens the memory and the pride that goes with it.There are similarities in the young and the old Thomas, but there are also such differences that I wondered whether they really were the same man.Alexie's stories are all like this. A sort of riddle that push you to look deeper, more carefully, if you want to make sense of them."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"My order arrived ahead of schedule and I couldn't be happier saving over half of what it would have cost me at the school bookstore.

His stories flow along as though they are being told to you in person. They manage to be funny, sad, and wonderful all at once. Though they are about Native Americans, they could be about anyone's family. It occurred to me that if you substituted methamphetamine for alcohol these stories would apply to a large swath of rural America, including my own native state of Utah. The characters the author gives us are ordinary people struggling with their lives and trying to find dignity in situations that are sometimes of their own creation and sometimes not. We are often left to wonder if the stories the characters tell us are entirely true or whether they have rearranged the events to protect their own psyches, or perhaps someone else. I found myself wondering sometimes which matters more in life: the exact truth, or the way we deal with events? These are the kinds of deep issues that the author manages to raise without ever overtly raising them. He also makes us think very much about poverty and culture and what they do to people of all races, both for good and for ill. That the author manages to make us laugh out loud while we think is some kind of miracle, and I thank him for it."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"\\"Mr. Alexie's is one of the major lyric voices of our time\\" New York Times Book Review editor Rich Nicholls wrote of Alexie after reading his work The Business of Fancydancing. Alexie opens The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven with this recollection, and I have to agree after reading his short story collection. Alexie shines light on the life of modern Indians, and all the tragedy and humor that goes along with growing up on a reservation. The twenty-four stories in this collection all center around Indians on the Spokane reservation and the different incidents that occur. Alexie writes with such intimacy about his characters that it becomes obvious some of these stories must be based in memory. Through his fiction Alexie manages to bring up painful issues of alcoholism and family strains that ring true for many in reservation life.The characters in Alexie's stories are the real gems of the collection. Victor and Thomas Builds-the-Fire stand out the most, as Victor narrators a majority of the stories either through first or third person. I felt the strongest stories in this collection centered on Victor and his family, whether it was dealing with the absence of his alcoholic father or his own alcoholism in later stories. Even though as a reader I had no experience with Indian Reservation life, through Alexie's exploration of personal relationships I connected with the characters. Thomas Builds-the-Fire, with his endless story telling, added amazing depth to the stories with references to Indian history and insight into the past. For readers not familiar with the past grievances between whites and Indians (Custer and Wounded Knee for example), some passages involving Thomas Builds-the-Fire might be slightly confusing. At times Alexie shifts from the present to the past without any warning, but this only makes the reader think more. Also, the weaving of the past and present adds demonstrates the importance of tradition for Indian culture. Overall, what gripped me about Alexie's story collection was how each story seamlessly flowed into the next while also being able to stand on its own. These stories could be read out of order or individually without losing any of their importance or meaning. My personal favorite, \\"Because My Father Always Said He Was the Only Indian Who Saw Jimi Hendrix Play \`The Star-Spangled Banner\\"\\" uses a song to weave a tragic story of Victor's father abandoning him. It is the raw emotion; it is the ability of Alexie to allow his characters to admit their true feelings; it is Alexie's bravery to address controversial issues, that carries this collection.The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is a powerful collection that celebrates the differences between Indians, while never forgetting the shared tragedy that links them. The unique stories, from betraying friends on rollercoasters to missing the winning basketball shot, demonstrate the complexity of the characters and the choices they must make. Alexie writes with such sharpness that readers can feel the haze of alcohol, can sense the ghosts of the past, and understand the importance of traditions they might have never known before reading this collection. This is one of the most eye-opening and magical collections and should be considered not just one of the most important books in Native American literature but American literature."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I have read most of the books Alexie has written. This one is particularly enjoyable. It is funny easy reading and gives one a lot to think about. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"So what is reservation realism? Through the course of these twenty-four interconnected short stories you learn of life on the Spokane Indian Reservation and of the many Native Americans who call it home. Victor Joseph and his family and friends, like Thomas Builds-the-Fire are the narrative centers. The stories of the modern Indians are not very hopeful, and are drenched in alcoholism and all kinds of abuse. Despite these characters being the victims of circumstance, Sherman Alexie makes these stories easier to handle with humor and unforgettable characters.I'm usually a person who tries to block out reality and search for \\"happily ever afters,\\" but despite that I still loved this book. Alexie's humorous voice and beautiful prose made this collection so dear to my heart. The characters in this book are searching for their different versions of happy and some might never get it, but that's not stopping them from trying.One of my favorites from this book is the title story where Victor returns to the reservation from living in Seattle with his white girlfriend.\\" In Seattle, I broke lamps. She and I would argue and I'd break a lamp, just pick it up and throw it down. At first she'd buy replacement lamps, expensive and beautiful. But after a while she'd buy lamps from Goodwill or garage sales. Then she just gave up the idea entirely and we'd argue in the dark.\\"You're just like your brother,\\" she'd yell. \\"Drunk all the time and stupid.\\"\\"My brother don't drink that much.\\"She and I never tried to hurt each other physically. I did love her, after all, and she loved me. But those arguments were just as damaging as a fist. Words can be like that, you know? Whenever I get into arguments now, I remember her and I also remember Muhammad Ali. He knew the power of his words, too. Even though he only had an IQ of 80 or so, Ali was a genius. And she was a genius, too. She knew exactly what to say to cause me the most pain.But don't get me wrong. I walked through that relationship with an executioner's hood. Or more appropriately, with war paint and sharp arrows.\\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is poetic and real. It's the perfect Sherman Alexie book to start with, because once you read this one, you'll want to read more."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I bought this book in part because the title is irresistable and I had heard an interview with the author. I believe its the first book he published. These short stories of life on the rez,have recurring characters, and many are clarly autobiographical. Yet they are completely accessible, universal and beautifiully written. It's fabulous book which will cause you to think about the vignettes he's just presented you, the lost way of life of Indians, the current life of Indians--the functional and disfunctional sides, and the role of whites in making it happen and perpetuating it. It's a great and beautiful read from a major talent."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Not the greatest book but I needed it for class so I had no choice but to buy it. Don/t recommend"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I had to read this book for my comp. lit class, and I am very glad to have had the chance. Throughout the stories, the location of hope and hopelessness on the reservation is made apparent, and while in general there is much poverty and degeneration described within the community, the narrators of the stories within Alexie's novel bring hope and a human touch to the experience."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"States Alexie in the introduction (pp xviii, xix) to this collection of short stories. Of his leap from literary obscurity to published author and member of the middle-class, he writes, \\"all because I wrote stories and poems about being a poor Indian growing up in an alcoholic family on an alcoholic reservation.\\" And that about sums them up. Read the introduction and you can't help but like the guy (especially his brief experience with a too big for her britches agent). His tales are unusual, spiritual, and immensely important, but often sad. Even so, after reading several with similar themes, most will have had their fill. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Likers of Alexie's stories may also enjoy: Love Medicine by Louis Erdich, The Whale Rider by Witi Ihimaera, The Bone People by Keri Hulme and Ordinary Wolves by Seth Kantner."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I thought the book was good to pass the time in the car between Wisconsin and Chicago, but it's not the best book I've ever read. The stories seem to be in random order - you could read them in reverse order and it wouldn't make any difference. The shifting viewpoints can be powerful when used in moderation - this time, it wasn't. It just got confusing. (FYI: This is one of the few times where the movie is better than the book.)"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I have to say, that this book is the most amazing book I have ever read. The story of Victor and Thomas intrigued me so much. In fact, I have found a movie entitled 'Smoke Signals' It focuses on the lives of Victor and Thomas and the long Journey they take together while Thomas tells his stories and victor gets annoyed but in the end it did not matter because they realize that they are true friends. Victor finally learns to accept his father for what he was. I highly recomend renting this movie, you will see and understand much more clearly. &quot;It's a good day to be indiginous, ain't it&quot;"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"A review of The Lone Ranger and Tanto Fistfight in HeavenI'll get straight to the point on this book; It's a cry for help from the Spokane Indian Reservation urging the reader to actively take part in aiding the Native Americans in their fight against the opressiveness of the policies that said government is using to slowly eradicate their culture. This may sound a bit harsh to the uninformed, but after hearing story upon story of the United States somehow screwing up (whether intentinally or not) the very heart of the Native American culture, I'm honestly so angry I could spit! Every story in this novel just leads us to the same conclusion: that the Native Americans, despite the abuse they've been forced to endure, are still very much alive today as a culture and are not very happy about the way they've been treated. Is it any wonder that groups like AIM are so angry? We have created a frankenstein's monster by creating the reservations, and we have to live with the fact that what our ancestors did (and what our current legislature is doing now) is wrong, and no matter how much money we send to the Native Americans in an effort to somehow alleviate our guilt, they will still not be satisfied until we give them back what they really want: their land. While Sherman Alexie certainly gets these points across in the book, at times he seems to be quite flamboyant, almost to the point of showing off. I can see his point in doing so, however...Is there really any other way to grab the attention of the average layman who might just be thumbing through the book? I mean, attention to their cause is certainly what the Native Americans need to further their fight to regain their soveriegn rights! Of course, any writer always needs to watch out for being too preachy, and occasionally Alexie borderlines on this. One of the great things about this novel is that the characters are just so rich in their depth and understandability. Take the character Thomas Builds-The-Fire, for instance....Here is a chaacter who, despite being held as an annoying twit by most of the reservation for buying into the &quot;old&quot; Indian ways, continues to tell his luscious stories, somehow managing to relate even the most modern of things to the ancestral ways of the Spokane Indians. All in all, this novel is a good, easy read that, while angry in its disposition occasionally, is well deserved of that emotion. The only real problem that I can foresee is that the literary structure of the novel tends to deviate substantially from the normal accepted canon, and some people may not understand that this is the way some Native Americans write...It's just a cultural difference, and the reward is great should one be able to decipher the the literary structure."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie's book, \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" is a captivating masterpiece about the lives of Native Americans. Native Americans are regarded by many as people we often forget about or look over, and this book gives us a window into their hearts, souls, and ideas. We follow the lives of many ordinary Indians like Victor and Thomas builds-the-fire. Victor who must face the pain of a nine year old growing up without a father and Thomas whose only means of expression is through his stories which are the same stories that ended in his downfall and imprisonment. For Thomas the stories he had linked him to his heritage, and though many thought he was unjustly imprisoned he faced injustice by his own people. Sherman Alexie is able to intertwine memory, fantasy, and dreams together to write a compilation of short stories that are poetic in many ways. Although many different authors narrate many chapters, it does not take away from the realism of the stories. One stops to care about who is talking and starts to care only about what they are saying. Alexie combines the harsh realism of the everyday world for a Native American with a great amount of humor that goes along as well in the lives of the Indians. The Native Americans continually talk about how the white man has been the root of all their problems, but through the eloquence and narration of these short stories, the Native Americans themselves have contributed as well. Whether it be drinking heavily or losing respect for there own roots. Alexie has truly written a masterpiece and has made us all look differently upon American culture because of this book and it is a definite must read for anyone. If ur reading this, &quot;Hello&quot;."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"If you are looking for a fleshing-out of the characters in &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;, you will be disappointed. The movie cobbles together some very disparate elements of the stories here, but no one in the book resembles anyone in the movie. Thomas Builds-the-Fire, for instance, while a central character in the movie, gets one short story here, and a passing mention in a few others. And he is nothing like the likeable nerdy character in the movie. The story of Victor and Arnold Joseph is totally absent, etc, etc, etc.....While the movie had some &quot;heart-warming&quot; elements, the book is very depressing in it's exposition of living conditions on the reservation today.Now if you're a fan of Alexie's already, you might love this book.

If the book had one focused theme or if the author made it easier for you to be able to tell who the narrator is it would have been a much more understood book and easier. The author would give good detailed conversations. Such as when they took a drug and they were describing what they saw. It made the reader seem as if he was right there listening to the conversation. The author could have been a little more thoughtful of how well the reader would understand the book. He had no central plot and and it kind of seemed more like some type of a documentary were they just record daily, what the characters do. Overall it was an ok book, but it could have been reader friendly and have some type of theme or plot that sticks out more boldly."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This collection is a touching look at what life in Indian country can be like.

A friend turned me onto alexie and now I'll be buying it all up."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie's work Tanto and the Lone Ranger: Fistfight in Heaven boldly and touchingly portrays the dispirited reservation life of the modern Indian. Through the use of a myriad of short stories, Alexie beautifully weaves the tapestry of alcoholism and tradition; hope and despair; segregation and devotion; a cut of which serves to clothe every Native American still subjected to government issue cheese and beef.Through the use of these masterfully crafted anecdotes--told from varying points of view by those that could best serve as authorities on them--one cannot help but empathize with not only the characters, but the point of view itself, common, seemingly, to most Native Americans. One cannot ignore the humility and abuse the youths of Tanto and the Lone Ranger: Fistfight in Heaven have been subjected to, in as much as one cannot ignore the similarities between Native American and Caucasian American cultures (not to mention the plethora of other minorities that America houses). First, with the aforementioned empathy Alexie fosters, and then with the intelligent comparisons he illustrates, the Native American is never to be looked upon in the same light again."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"So much American fiction, these days, seems to be shallow trash, knocked off in a few afternoons, that I think I will read this book over several more times, just to savor its beauty. This is not prose. It's poetry. Sometimes, I did not quite grasp the exact meaning of a story, but it didn't matter. The words still conveyed the feeling. However, if you're expecting &quot;Smoke Signals,&quot; I found this much less upbeat. Before Alexie, I read some novels by D'Arcy McNickle. He was a prominent Native American who died in the '70's and whose books dealt mostly with the early reservation period. I was touched by his depiction of frustration, and of failure despite educational opportunities. It's very sad to realize that, in the 90's, Native American authors are still having to deal with these same themes."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Imagination, dreams, friendship, racial pride and hatred for Whites for history, sadness for family for love, disjointed memories like those seen through a smashed mirror where beer and whiskey and Jimi Hendrix form the poetic beauty of these badass, unforgiving visiontales. As an Irishman, the love of dreams, booze, potatoes, Hendrix, friends and lousy love-life as well as dancing on the roof of the sky with words and stories and even b-ball feet, speaks to me! Alexie is the f'ing man!!!! I hope his other stuff is as good."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Some of the stories are funny, others are mystical, and still others are thought provoking.

Even though the stories are fiction, they are based on things he's seen and experienced. Some of the stories in this collection are a little boring, or too deep for some to catch. But most of them are worth reading more than once. For example: \\"A Drug Called Tradition\\", \\"Because My Father Always Said He Was they Only Indian Who Saw Jimi Hendrix Play \`The Star Spangled Banner' at Woodstock\\", \\"All I Wanted to Do Was Dance\\", \\"The Trial of Thomas Builds-the-Fire\\", and many others."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I was born in Spokane, Washington and was interested when I learned that the author Sherman Alexie lived in Spokane and was a run away Native American from the tribe in Idaho Falls. After picking up this book I was immediately in love with it and drawn into the stories that the author tells. Alexie is able to convoy the complexities of living and growing up on a reservation. Personally I love Thomas-Builds-a-Fire the most, his random in puts are classic and his sense of timing is totally off when it comes to serious situations. In the title story of the book, the Lone Ranger and Tonto do not make an appearance, let alone fight, but what the relationship between these two men represents to Indians infuses the entire book. This particular story begins and ends with encounters with white men the first concerning a late-night visit to a 7-11, where the initial fearful doubt of the white clerk relaxes as his Indian customer starts to joke with him. Later, the narrator is forced to admit that a white basketball player is better than he is. In between, the story tells of his return from the city to live again on the reservation, his concerned mother, a white girlfriend, and an aimlessness that resolves into finding a job. Like Tonto, for better or worse, he makes a place for himself in the white man's world.I truly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh and a deep story that keeps you entertained as well as you form a connection with the characters because their characteristics and comical insights.

It hooks you in such a way that you can't put it down without wanting to read more. At first you're wondering who is talking, but in the end, you don't really care that much because the stories themselves are so good. This book paints such a vivid realism of Native American life that it blows you away.

It is both hilarious and moving in equally profound ways; altogether, great reading. I loved it. It made me want to read more of Alexie's work. And I have."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I should preface this book with a personal explanation. The best way to approach Sherman Alexie is to look into your own personal history regarding American Indians. For me, I grew up with the vague notion that Indians didn't exist anymore. I think a lot of kids that don't live near large Native American populations suffer from this perception. I mean, where in popular culture do you ever come across a modern day Indian? There was that movie \\"Smoke Signals\\" (based on one of the stories in this book) and possibly the television show \\"Northern Exposure\\" but that is it, ladies and gentlemen. In my own life, realization hit when I started Junior High and read \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" for the very first time. If you've read the book then you know that it dwells on the character \\"Chief\\" and his past. I read about him and found out that I knew diddly over squat about Native Americans. They show \\"Dances With Wolves\\" in high school homeroom and through that you're supposed to infer contemporary Indian culture? That's like watching \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and wondering where all the happy slaves are today. It doesn't make sense. This is why I'm nominating, \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight In Heaven\\" as the book that should be required in every Junior High and High School in the country immediately. We've all read our \\"Catcher In the Rye\\" and \\"Scarlet Letter\\". Now let's read something real.The book is a collection of short stories, all containing repeating characters and events. There is no single plot to the story and while the character of Victor is probably the closest thing the book has to a protagonist, he hardly hogs the spotlight for very long. In this book we witness a single Spokane Reservation. We watch personal triumphs and repeated failures and mistakes. Author Alexie draws on history, tradition, and contemporary realism to convey the current state of the American Indian. You'll learn more than you thought to.My favorite chapter in this book, bar none, is \\"A Good Story\\". In it, a character's mother mentions that her son's stories are always kind of depressing. By this point the reader is more than halfway through the book and has probably thought the same thing (deny it though they might). In response, Junior tells a story that isn't depressing. Just thoughtful and interesting. It's as if Alexie himself has conceded briefly that, no, the stories in this book aren't of the cheery happy-go-lucky nature the reader might be looking for. That's probably because the stories are desperately real and fantastical all at once. To be honest, I feel a bit inadequate reviewing this book. It's obvious that Alexie is probably the greatest writer of his generation. Hence, these stories are infinitely readable and distressing.This is a good book. This is the book to read when you ask yourself, \\"What author haven't I ever read before?\\". This is the book you will find yourself poring over on subways, buses, and taxi cabs. You'll leave it on park benches and run twenty blocks north to retrieve it again. I don't know how many other ways I can say that it's a good book. Well worth reading. Funny and taxing all at once. Sherman Alexie deserves greater praise than any I can give him. All I can say then is that this book is beautiful. Read this book."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I initially picked this book up for two reasons--I liked Alexie's novel, Indian Killer, and more importantly because I live in Spokane, WA and have traveled extensively through the Reservations and towns that are described in the stories. The descriptions and the characters are very realistic, the names and places are not very fictionalized, and it makes me feel right at home. Fortunately for those readers not privleged to live in the Inland Northwest, the stories also teach a lot about Indian culture, the modern Native American and their heritage. It is a disturbing picture at times with too much alcaholism, violence, and racism, but underneath it all there is a great deal of love which makes the stories comforting and redeeming. Alexie has a lyrical voice, and when combined with his authenticsity, beautiful, rich stories are produced. Aside from those academic traits, he is also very funny, honest, and affectionate throughout, and those qualities are what I will remember about this book far more than the descriptions of familiar hotels on Third Avenue and the basketball games played between Springdale and Wellpinit. It is a great, quick read, and a wonderful way to pass an afternoon."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This is my personal measure of Sherman Alexie, the gifted young Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian writer: He caught my attention in a recently rebroadcast &quot;60 Minutes&quot; feature story. What appealed to me was his sardonic wit--edgy, thoughtful, ironic, challenging, and, yes, I thought, a bit sad. I told myself, Let's see if he can really write, let's see what he's got to say. So I pick up one of his books of prose; within a week, I had read three.This outstanding collection of interrelated stories was the first. Very, very impressive! I loved his writing, his crisp, bone simple and straight style. I felt for his finely etched characters, a handful of them--especially one named Victor, presumably the author's stand-in--recurring throughout. And these are all stories with bite.&quot;Maybe hunger informs our lives,&quot; says the narrating voice of &quot;Family Portrait.&quot; Roughly the first half of this book exposes us to what it means to be &quot;Native American&quot; today: The spoils of defeat--the tight-lipped, self-destructive despair of a once proud, historic people reduced to segregated conditions. Isolated from the white world, isolated from their own traditions. Subject to poor housing, education and food, chronic unemployment, rampant alcoholism, diabetes, blood fights and bloody ends.Alexie's sharp depictions of conflicted identity, uncertainty in the everyday and lifelong struggles for survival on the Spokane Indian reservation, the contradictory capacities for tenderness and tragedy, beauty and brutality, breaks down our detachment, jars us into realizing both the unique and common human attributes of his people. What he induces is simply called &quot;empathy.&quot; As another who grew up in a &quot;reservation&quot;--&quot;the urban ghetto&quot;--I felt that same incoherent rage that plagues so many of his characters. In the commonweal of pain, it was a further demonstration that &quot;you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy.&quot; Yeah, okay--&quot;empathy.&quot;At the halfway point, I was ready to start writing this review--no question, Alexie had shown he had the literary goods and I wanted to proclaim it--but something told me, first finish the book. Good thing. Why? Because he tricked me--he still held an ace up his storytelling sleeve.&quot;Hope feeds among the tombs,&quot; Melville wrote. &quot;Always darkest before the daylight,&quot; goes the tireless adage we've all heard somewhere from our elders. &quot;That's how I do this life sometimes by making the ordinary just like magic,&quot; says the narrator in one of Alexie's stories (&quot;Jesus Christ's Brother is Alive and Well on the Spokane Indian Reservation&quot;). &quot;Every Indian learns how to be a magician and learns how to misdirect attention and the dark hand is always quicker than the white eye . . . no matter how close you get to my heart you will never find out my secrets and I'll never tell you and I'll never show you the same trick twice.&quot;Might be Alexie begins his sleight of hand with the (deliberately) Kafka-esque tale of the trial of Thomas Builds-the-fire, &quot;misfit storyteller&quot; who can still feel the pulse of tradition within him and stubbornly refuses to disown it. (Hmm. Defiance.) Then there's &quot;A Good Story,&quot; about the loving, mutually respectful relationship between an old man and a boy. Or the story about the Indian married couple who reconcile after the wife has left her wise-cracking husband for making one joke too many about his terminal cancer. (Hmm. Redemption!) Or the character arc of Victor--whose name, keep in mind, means &quot;conqueror&quot;--over an array of first and third person narratives, as he struggles against the pull of his parents' drunken, broken marriage; resenting his father's departure; the low expectations of Indian schooling; the high expectations of being a local hero; incipient alcoholism; the fear of and yearning for love. The Alexie magic is in balancing the bitter with the sweet; showing us that in the midst of desolation there is also room for resilience, for humor, for trust--for hope.It was during this time I happened to see a repeat of Chris Rock's last HBO special, the one where he advises those folks who're always popping off in the media about how bad their people have it now in this country--how they're &quot;losing America&quot;--to just shut up. &quot;Nobody has it worse than the Indians,&quot; he says. &quot;They're all dead!&quot;No, not quite, Chris. Deliberately wounded by long-standing government policy, yes. Demonized and ignored by a &quot;dominant&quot; history, yes. Suffering, yes. But they still survive, human as the rest of us--with faults, foibles, and feelings, nightmares and dreams--and they're championed by one of their own, a writer with a singular voice who tells modern day Indian stories with clarity, style, perception and wit. This book opens a door to consciousness. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This is an awesome collection, but when you read it, keep in mind that the stories are not supposed to be connected. Each wonderful story stands on its own and portrays reservation life from the perspective of different characters, although some characters appear peripherally in more than one story. Some may say that Alexie is angry and that this book describes a life of alcoholic depressiveness on the Rez; in reality he is just describing much of what is. There is love and caring and pride and intelligence right next to the stuff one might consider ugly. Reading this book will alternately make you sad and happy--that's what Life is anyway.And go rent the movie, Smoke Signals; Alexie wrote the screenplay for it based on some of the scenes from this book, but don't expect the book to be like the movie or vice versa. Alexie is a talented young writer who deserves the attention he is getting."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Halfway through this book I emailed the friend that bought it for me to tell him how much I was loving it. I then asked him \\"How the hell am I supposed to review this?\\" His reply was to explain that \\"He needs a new star, a category for 'Holy Sh!t, that one hit me hard.' But they don't make the Holy Sh!t category on Amazon.\\" That pretty much says it all.The truth is I was blown away by Sherman Alexie somewhere after the first paragraph of the introduction to this book. In the intro he presents himself in a manner that is completely honest and straightforward. He had me laughing from the start, and I can and do appreciate someone who can make fun of themselves. But through his introduction and throughout all the stories in this book, one word ran through my head continuously; brilliant.I am not going to give any sort of plot summary because it's simply impossible. What I will do is give you the titles to a few of my favorites and if that doesn't entice you to want to read on, nothing will. This book contains 24 short on length but not on content, stories. Each story is unique, yet there is always a sense of familiarity, whether it's the presence of a familiar character, a diet Pepsi, fry bread or a basketball game. Each story is its own theme, place and time, but always about Mr. Alexie's Spokane Indian people and the reservation.My favorites:The Trial of Thomas Builds-the-FireJesus Christ's Half-Brother is Alive and Well on the Spokane Indian ReservationA Train is an Order of OccurrenceThe Approximate Size of my Favorite TumorIn his introduction he states that these stories contain some truths, but explains it as \\"reservation realism\\" and challenges us to figure out what exactly that means. My interpretation is that all these stories contain little threads of truth, some more than others, and with these little threads he weaves and enhances creating a blanket of fantasy and fiction. Whether I am right or wrong, I have to believ each tale is based on some truth, they were just too real to me to be otherwise.I think I experienced every human emotion while reading this book, and then experienced them all over again. Some stories are horribly sad and gut wrenching, others are lighthearted and funny and mischievous; most are all of the above and then some. The one thing I am left with after reading this book is that Sherman Alexie conveys more in a short 5 page story than most writers manage to say in a full 300 page novel; that's an exquisite gift. I am grateful to my friend, eternally, for gifting me with this book and introducing me to this writer. I can't recommend this book enough, it's a treasure I will read and read and then read some more.One Stick SongCherise Everhard, February 2008"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"My son sent me this book in the mail and recommended that I read it. He said that he was loving the book and &quot;laughing like a madman.&quot; Since I enjoyed the movie, Smoke Signals, which was losely based on the book, I took my son's recommendation. The first thing that struck me about Alexie's writing is that although there is much humor, it is a kind of humor that elicits guilty laughter: the kind that when you do laugh you immediately look around to see if you are being observed. At first I was not sure if this uncomfortableness was because I was a white reader or if Alexie (knowing that he would have a large white audience) was just displaying his anger. And there is a great deal of anger in this book; but there is also a great deal of humanity, and by the end of the book I decided that Alexie is not grinding his ax, only describing a life that he knows in every detail. It is up to the reader to make his own interpretation and his own moral examination.This is not to imply that the book is not enjoyable. It is eminently readable and Alexie displays a style that combines poetry, mysticism, and an understanding of the human condition that is remarkable. He describes life on the Spokane Indian Reservation with poignancy and without any trace of pathos that permeates similar works. His characters are fully drawn and occupy real space, and the reader feels that he has actually spent time with them. To repeat, it is an angry as well as a funny book. The reader's decisions to laugh out loud or surreptitiously will probably be an indication of how well that person is comfortable with hiw own moral framework. I think that Alexie would want his readers, both Indian and white, to laugh &quot;like a mandman.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Real life, on and off the Reservation. This is a collection of insightful, unflinching, yet sometimes laugh-out-loud funny snapshots of contemporary Native American life. Here is one of my favorites: \\"Adrian and I sat on the porch and watched the reservation. Nothing happened. From our chairs made rockers by unsteady legs, we could see that the only traffic signal on the reservation had stopped working. ... We watched the grass grow and the rivers flow.\\" (Which, of course, is treaty language.) \\"It's hard to be optimistic on the reservation. When a glass sits on a table here, people don't wonder if it's half filled or half empty. They just hope it's good beer. Still, Indians have a way of surviving.

In his short life (born 1966), he has garnered a truckload of accolades and can lay claim to a wide range of achievements as poet, novelist, screenwriter, filmmaker, public speaker, media personality, humorist, recognized spokesman for Native Americans, and on and on. He's won any number of prizes. And all with the inauspicious beginnings of an Indian boy, growing up on the Spokane reservation in Washington.It's pretty easy to see the promise that is to be found in this early collection of short stories, published when he was still in his twenties. The range of literary forms and voices used to express a complexity of sentiments and a deeply rich sensibility in a writer so young is remarkable. The many customer reviews already posted here (90 as of this writing) attest to the author's impact on his readers. And he is not just a Native American writer. The mix of grief, suppressed rage, and wry humor in these 22 stories cuts through to universals underlying all cultures.In the title story of the book, the Lone Ranger and Tonto do not make an appearance, let alone fight, but what the relationship between these two men represents to Indians infuses the entire book. This particular story begins and ends with encounters with white men - the first concerning a late-night visit to a 7-11, where the initial fearful suspicion of the white clerk relaxes as his Indian customer starts to joke with him. Later, the narrator is forced to admit that a white basketball player is better than he is. In between, the story tells of his return from the city to live again on the reservation, his concerned mother, a white girlfriend, and an aimlessness that resolves into finding a job. Like Tonto, for better or worse, he makes a place for himself in the white man's world.Probably the best-known story from this collection is \\"This Is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona,\\" made into the film \\"Smoke Signals,\\" about the quirky and unlikely companionship between two young Indians who drive to Arizona to retrieve the remains of the dead father of one of them. My personal favorite, however, is \\"The Approximate Size of My Favorite Tumor,\\" about a dying man who makes light of every adversity. His encounter with a racist, corrupt cop is full of clever, laugh-out-loud wit, and his relationship with his wife is told with deeply tender humor.I heartily recommend this book as an introduction to modern Indian literature. It captures for anyone with a mind and heart the complexities of Indian identity that lie behind the stereotypes that prevail in the popular imagination - whether racist or sentimental. Readers of Alexie's books will also like Adrian Louis' novel, \\"Skins.\\""},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Sherman Alexie writes a powerful description of the Native American's life in the modern world. He uses methaphors to engage the reader into a deeper thought process which must be first understood if the book is to be useful. This book is written for intelligent people who truly want to understand what Native Americans endure and how they cope with the inhumanities placed upon them. Taken out of context, the stories in this book seem to be jumbled up pieces of a puzzle. But when the book is read in its entirety, it weaves together an elaborate portrayl of human emotion and deeper consciusness. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be challenged by a dark yet colorful description of the Native American life."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I am an African American female who teaches writing at a private college. More than 97% of the student population is White. Sixty percent or more are from upper middle-class New England families. I mention this because I'm trying to set up a distinction here. Many of my students are not aware of the plight, culture, contributions, etc. of the American Indian, or other peoples of color. I am reminded of this daily when I am questioned as to the reason we are reading such and such. I take a deep breath, exhale, and begin a speech that I seem to have constructed years before I knew I'd need it. (I won't bore you with the details).The Chair of the English Department, who happens to be a former professor of mine, chose two of Alexie's novels for the incoming Freshmen class to read. Being a former student of &quot;John's&quot; I am very aware of his strong interest in Native American culture. I was not surprised then when he informed me of the books we would be reading. I love this book by Alexie. There is a kinship I feel that cannot be expressed in words. I understand the alcoholism that pervades the Native American community, the &quot;quiet storms&quot; that come suddenly, end quickly, but cause immeasurable damage. Poverty, Hunger, Unemployment, Depression...powerful, soul-stripping entities that can cause one to die slowly, ever so slowly, each and every day. There is a line in the novel that reminds me of something Toni Cade Bambara once said: &quot;It's the small things that hurt the most&quot;(p. 49). Understood, Alexie. Definitely understood. Thank you, Alexie, for this window into the hearts, minds and souls of Native American peoples. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The Book The Lone Ranger and Tanto Fistfight in Heaven by Sherman Alexie was very well written and enjoyable. It is a collection of inter connecting short stories that share similar themes and characters as well. It revolves around a few main characters including Victor the main character, and Thomas Builds-The-Fire an obsessive story teller. The characters are very well developed, in each story he builds on each character until you really feel as if you know them. The flaws to this are sometimes there are contradicting traits in different stories, but that is understandable with a collection of short stories. He seems to develop the settings enough but not to great detail, which is sometimes effective and at other times leaves you waiting for more. For short stories his plot development was excellent, as well as the way in which he compiled his stories, theses two elements combined kept me engrained in the book and were very effective in portraying theme. His overall writing style is very blunt, honest, and real, he also uses some elements of realistic satire to keep you interested and shocked simultaneously. I also saw hints of budding surrealism in some stories, but not enough to create an overall surrealistic effect; I think his usage of it is appropriate but as well developed as it could be. I enjoyed his style of writing because it gave me the raw and bitter truth behind life on an Indian reservation. He spoke so realistically and honestly, like he had been there first hand, which makes this book very good and effective with its portrayal. The themes are very apparent, and do not involve much reading between the lines, but are there and do leave an impact on you. The themes of differences and discrimination are very effective as well as the theme of the difference between modern and past Indians. Overall I really enjoyed his work, despite his minor flaws in development of character, and setting. I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in Native American life, or someone willing to read an entertaining and powerful book."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is for the true American Indian.

This book has many modern traditions of both today and the past Indian cultures.

So I bought THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN on name recognition only. Out of curiousity. This book is wonderfully original and quirky, off-beat with authentic characters. The stories, most of which I liked, seem to tell the truth about what it's like to live in the northwest on the Spokane reservation. The author's use of language is masterful. Be prepared for quirky, off-beat humor as well. The book manages to be poignant and ironical at the same time (as in &quot;Crazy Horse Dreams&quot;, in which a character says,&quot;'Nothing more hopeless than a sober Indian'&quot;). My favorite stories: &quot;Jesus Christ's Half-Brother Is Alive and Well on the Spokane Indian Reservation&quot; and &quot;Indian Education.&quot; If you read and like this book, check out SMOKE SIGNALS--the movie based on Mr. Alexie's book by the same name."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"There's nothing more powerful than a good story.

West The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist-Fight in Heaven 7/10/01The novel, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist-Fight in Heaven, written by Sherman Alexie is a well written story that embraces the hardships and struggles of Native Americans. He tells the story of Victor, Thomas, and the others that live on the Spokane reservation, in a series of short stories that take place both on the reservation and off it. From story to story he changes his narrative voice and point of view so that the reader has to figure out the main character from chapter to chapter. While telling an important story of alcoholism and drugs and tradition he also incorporates political ideas of discrimination and prejudices. Basketball is used as a way of expressing the modern Native American hero, the rising ball-player and future pro-superstar. Sherman Alexie creates his characters as if they were real life fallen heroes, buried under pity, hatred, and memories on the reservation. From chapter to chapter the narrator changes. Sometimes it is written in an omniscient voice or in the point of view of Victor or Thomas. The first chapter, titled \\"Every Little Hurricane,\\" is written in third person about Victor as a young child caught up between the alcoholism of his parents and the violence of his family. Victor's uncles Adolph and Arnold got in a drunken fist fight during one of his family's parties. Alexie described it: \\"Victor could almost smell the sweat and whiskey and blood (p. 3).\\" It is hard to see one's parents paralyzed on the floor with alcohol and drugs concentrated in their blood. It is harder still to put up with this everyday of one's life. Victor was raised with this pain and the chaos of an uncertain childhood made worse by the poverty and helplessness of the reservation. Alexie makes this easily understood by writing: \\"Victor was back in bed... the ceiling lowered with the weight of each Indian's pain, until it was just inches from Victor's nose (p. 8).\\" Compared to the chapter titled \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist-Fight in Heaven,\\" the first chapter is completely different and the story relates but the plot does not. This chapter is written in first person and is about a Spokane Indian married to a Seattle white woman. When he enters nice residential areas alone he is interrogated by the cops. He cannot even enter a local 7-11 store without receiving a skeptical stare. When he was interrogated by the cops the narrator of this chapter states, \\"I wanted to tell him that I didn't really fit the profile of the country but I knew it would just get me into trouble (p.183).\\" Eventually the narrator's character leaves his white wife to return to the reservation. He could not handle the fights they had everyday, when words became raging fist, or the constant discrimination he received from locals. The sad truth is that discriminated exists and the Native Americans are still deeply affected by these prejudices. In this same chapter, the narrator used basketball as a way to prove himself and his race by playing a white man. He called himself \\"one of their [Indians'] old and dusty heroes (p.189).\\" He ended up loosing that game. Basketball was a way to escape his life on the reservation of drinking, watching television, and sleeping. Basketball was a way to break the bridge of race and explore the opportunities of equality. After all, a good basketball player is a good basketball player despite his skin. In the chapter called \\"The Only Traffic Signal on The Reservation Doesn't Flash Red Anymore\\" is also about basketball. This chapter is told in first person by Victor. He himself is an ex-player who once had potential to make it as a pro-player, but he fell into drinking, laziness, and obesity. Every ball-player that becomes great only lives his glory for a short time. Victor watched Julius Windmaker destroy his potential and great expectations. His friend Adrian said to him the \\"He [Adrian] looks good,\\" to which Victor responded \\"Yeah, he must not be drinking (p.45).\\" By the end of the chapter Victor is there to see Julius follow in his footsteps and lose his skill of basketball by falling into alcoholism, by falling into failure. The title of this chapter seems to mean that the Native Americans of the reservation do not know how to stop anymore, so that occasional drinking fades into hardcore alcoholism which absorbs potential heroes like Victor and Julius. One of the biggest themes in this book was written by Sherman Alexie in the chapter \\"Witness Secret and Not.\\" He wrote, \\"Most of all, I had to find out what it meant to be Indian (p.211).\\" Native Americans, as described by Sherman Alexie, are a lost race within this nation, pushed aside and hidden on the reservations. I do not discriminate against Native Americans, but if I see one in a city I look at him. It is strange to notice such a different man. Sometimes I can almost actually see the pain in his heart and the alcohol rotting in his veins. Sherman Alexie embraces this sad fact in his novel, broken down into short stories each adding to his story on Native Americans. Amidst his political inferences about treaties and the reservation, Alexie creates charismatic characters lost in the chaotic spin of reservation life. Drugs, alcohol, tears, and fighting, mixed with confusion about what tradition is and is for, finished off with more alcohol, failures, ancient heroes, and broken champions. That is Alexie's recipe for this novel, a true quest into Native American battles, some fought decades ago, others still being fought each day, every night. The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist-Fight in Heaven is not a book of plot, climax, and conclusion, it is a story about Native Americans and their struggles in a world that is not eager to help."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"It was simple in text yet filled with symbolism through out. The book itself was complex in the way that each story was connected to give you in the end one long story. The story of a people living on a reservation, wanting to get out, yet terrified to leave, humanity being the ultimate protagnist in this book."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Like any short story collection, Sherman Alexie's \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\\" is a mixed bag. Some are brilliant, funny and life-affirming; others are dreary, and a couple feel more like character sketches that merely create a mood rather than tell a story with a beginning, middle and end. So, while the collection is definitely worth reading, I am glad that I first discovered Alexie by way of his novels--Absolutely True Diary of aPart-Time Indian(text only)Reprint edition by S.Alexie] andFlight: A Novel.Of course, one of the advantages of a story collection is that you really get to see an author's concerns as they repeat themselves in the tales: not surprisingly, reservation life is a major concern; but storytelling itself is also one of Alexie's favorite topics; he clearly sees it as a necessary and under-appreciated art, like humor. One gets the impression that without humor and stories Alexie would never have survived the reservations he at times likens to death camps.A perhaps more subtle motif in his stories is the paradoxical nature of time. In many of these tales the past flows directly into the present and the future. As if to reify this phenomenon, one character--Simon--only drives backwards. \\"He always obeyed posted speed limits, traffic signals and signs, even minute suggestions. But he always drove in reverse, using the rearview mirror as his guide\\" (156).Sometimes, however, time is experienced in these stories as an almost hellish eternal now. Experienced, that is, like Dante's characters live time in \\"The Inferno.\\" In these cases, Alexie's characters--like so many of us--find themselves trapped in situations where the alcohol-driven plot seems to remain the same and only the names change. On these occasions, the characters struggle to turn the ordinary into the magical, which is (more often than not) exactly what Alexie does with these stories.Overall, a great collection."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"An accurate look at reservation life cleaverly written. I have not been dissappointed with any of Sherman Alexie's books. I expecially like that he uses familiar characters in most of his books--like Lester Falls Apart or Thomas Builds The Fire."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This book choked me up twice on the bus into work. Once during the very first story where Victor imagines himself catching his father's frozen tears in a little box and wrapping it in newspaper comics so at least one person in the family has a Christmas present that year. Then again in &#34;This is What it Means to Say Phoenix Arizona,&#34; when Thomas Starts-a-Fire tells Victor about his conversation with Victor's dad in Spokane. So lovely and tragic. I had to set the book down on the last one because middle-aged men getting weepy on the bus over a book ist verboten.Here's the quote that I think encapsulates the theme of the book in many ways: &#8220;He could see his uncles slugging each other with such force that they had to be in love. Strangers would never want to hurt each other that badly.&#8221; Alexie then takes that concept of the connection and tension between love, life, struggle and tragedy, and plays it out on many levels, including between lovers, family, friends, groups, and even between progenitors and progeny. The result is poetic."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I hope you check out this site once in awhile.Just wanted to say Thank you."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"I rated this book, The Lone Ranger and Tonto FistFight in Heaven, two stars. It wasn't very interesting and I couldn't really connect with words. Few of the chapters left me confused and pondering. This book consisted of twenty-three different tales each relating about Indians. The main points that were established throughout the book were about how Indians got discriminated against by whites. Another point made about Indians was how they overcame their sorrows by drinking, telling stories, and trying to have a good time while living on the reservation. But overall the author does make some good points and analogies about Indians' struggle to make it in the world. I just felt it could've been better."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Throughout the course of the book, many characters and plots arose making it very difficult to follow the plot. Although it was funny and sad at times, it didn't flow enough for me to make any connection with earlier events that took place in the book. However, I also feel a different approcah to writing was experimented because there were many &quot;unexpected and impossible-to-anticipate moves.&quot; The book started off talking about Victor and Thomas Builds-the-fire as younger children but then goes into many different scenes and characters. These new characters that were introduced such as Rosemary MorningDove, Frank Many Horses, and Lester FallsApart made it hard for me to connect back to Victor. The one thing that I did observe from the book was the distances between the Indians and Whites, males and females, and the many different Indian tribes. I was fascinated by how so many connections were made with the Indian's traditions of the past and what was going on in the modern times with the Indians. I was highly disappointed in that it wasn't one of those books that I was anxious to see what would happen next. I found myself going back through material that I had previously read and trying to analyze the events of the next scene or chapter. However, I am glad i took the time out to read it beacause it was very different kind of reading material than what I was used to."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"This book portrays the real life of Native Americans on a reservation. This book could be taught at the college level due to the symbolism and tough issues that are dealt with while reading the book. It is a series of short stories that are based partially off events that took place in the author's life. Some tough issues are dealt with throughout the book. This book deals with alcoholism, absence of role models, poverty, and broken dreams. Some background on Native Americans and reservations would need to be taught before teaching this book. Also, there would have to be a lesson on symbolism. This book is very deep and the any grade level lower than the college level might not understand the impact of the short stories. Victor, the main character, is a great strength in this novel. A strong character analysis could be done on his life and what he has had to go through in order to grow up on the reservation. Great discussions could be based on his actions throughout the novel. Some may favor his actions while other may have strong feelings against his behaviors. It is a challenging read that forces the reader to be open minded and understanding of different cultures, traditions, and lifestyles. One of the negative parts of the book was the use of language. There were numerous swear words that took away from the understanding of the story. The language that was used was too rough and not used appropriately. It took away from the dramatic story line"},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"After reading this book The Lone Ranger and Tont Fist Fight in Heaven, I found it to be very racist and discriminatory towards whites.It shows how some whites are discriminatory towards Indians also and this makes me feel very sad to know that ther are still tensions between the races today. It did have a lot of good stories in it though and it hold my attention from the begining tto the end."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"The vignette is the last refuge of the scoundrel, or at most a struggling writer like Sherman Alexie. The stories in this book are filled with characters drinking and dreaming of their horse riding pasts, complaining about the Washington Redskins. What else is new? Can't Alexie get over these stereotypes and invent more interesting things for his readers? This is not a book, but a diary filled with random observations. The prose is very confusing and unimpressive, giving the readers a worse impression of Native Americans."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"You may learn something about Native Americans from the northwestern part of the United States, in this book. It is notably easy reading, sometimes a bit slow of pace.Mr. Alexie writes in a sort of lazy manner, maybe reflective of his cultural background. These short stories about himself and his fellows, and their relationships to other people in Spokane, Seattle, and in other cities and towns in the state of Washington, are somewhat interesting, in an offhanded way.The picture painted by Alexie is one of desuetude among these Native Americans. They are generally poor, dependent upon the government for many survival needs, tending toward alcoholism or drug addiction, and not well educated.The major emotion all this aroused in me was pity, and maybe that's what Alexie was aiming for? I don't think he was trying to elicit pride, or even cultural interest.Anyway, it won't hurt you to read this book. It goes real fast and you may learn a little bit about a small population formerly unfamiliar to you, except through brief descriptions by others.Diximus."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"Tonto and Lone Ranger Fist Fight in heavenBefore I even picked up this book I had a feeling I wasn't going to enjoy it. I am the kind of person who either likes to read Mark Twain, John Steinbeck or newer novels that have more of a plot with some action involved. I knew that this book was not going to be anything that could hold my attention for more than a few pages. I did not like this book very much because it was rather dull. The begining started off with a lot of swearing and fist fighting that left the reader a little mift as to were the book was going take me. It wasnt clear whos' story the book was. by that I mean it was confusing if the book was mainly focused around Victor, Jr, or Thomas within the first few stories. As the book progressed the Sherman Alexie managed to bore me even more by basing all his stories around the mistreetment of the indians. He even makes his book worse by not giving it a plot. The only interesting short story he wrote was distances because it was so obscure..."},{"Title":"Lone Ranger & Tonto Fistfight in Heaven","review":"My son was required to read this book for his freshman high school class. It is full of the f-word and other foul language. It also is replete with drugs, binge drinking, and overt sexual situations among teens.

Brown invites the reader to probe within himself and to see when to leave the comfort zone. I found the book refreshing and uplifting. That Perception Thing forced me to look at things differently. The book is filled with anecdotes of how Brown herself looks at life another way after helping others to help themselves. I must say that the book opens several little doors inside your head as you read along. I truly recommend it."},{"Title":"That Perception Thing!","review":"The book was received when it was promised. Wonderful condition and book has very good information. I would order from the distributor again."},{"Title":"That Perception Thing!","review":"\\"That Perception Thing\\" outlines interesting accounts of various life observations. Many of these you have probably encountered in your own journey. While you may recognize the truth in these observations, you might still find it difficult to personally practice them. Lending a wealth of her own personal experiences, Dawn prescribes simple remedies for many of life's common challenges. The information is presented in a simplistic yet thought rousing fashion, making this book a great source of comfort during times when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or bored by the peaks and valleys of life.Certainly there is reassurance and self-acceptance in viewing your situation through the lens of another person undergoing a similar circumstance. Dawn illustrates several stories of real people with real issues. Many of these issues you might personally identify with, however, rather than offering hard and fast interpretations, you are allowed to develop your own conclusions based upon the choice of your response. Take, for example, the biblical story of Nathan's parable to King David. Nathan told of a rich man who took the only lamb of a poor man to feed a traveler. King David was outraged at the man who would do such a thing. Then Nathan pointed out that King David was that man!Dawn clearly views incidents in life as opportunities to grow emotionally through a mental realization that life really is all about how you choose to view it. This type of optimistic thought process, if nurtured, will in turn favorably affect all aspects of one's life. In essence, Dawn invites you to maintain a balanced \\"perspective\\" to life's every day challenges.I had the pleasure of meeting Dawn while vacationing in Greece. She is a very warm, charming and philosophical person, and these attributes are easily recognized in this literature.Lisa Phillips CPAFairburn, GA.

This book would be ideal for a small discussion group. I have found it very helpful in dealing with \\"difficult\\" people, and have lent it to several people at work who have also enjoyed it.

Her savior, Ethan Knight was beat up and never got the chance to say goodbye. Fast forward 18 years, and Abby is now Anna Segee, daughter of a Canadian lumber baron and currently the foreman of the Loon Cove Lumber mill. She has inherited the old sawmill ranch owned by her estranged grandfather, and keeping her identity secret, she tries to reconnect with gramps (whom she feel abandoned her) by reading his many journals.Anna has always had a crush on Ethan, so when he steps out in front of her loader, she dumps her load in order to protect him. On his first day at the mill, he doesn't make a good impression - Anna fires him. When he returns weeks later as the owner/manager, sparks continue to fly, particularly since his father has arranged for him to bunk in one of the vacant cabins on Anna's property (and Ethan discovers what she wears under her work clothes). As the two start to fall for each other, they discover that someone wants to do harm to Anna, and the culprits have broken into her many outbuildings in search of who knows what...Chapman's second in the Knight family of Maine is a fun read from cover to cover. When the mention of a ghost appeared in the first chapter, I almost tossed the book at the wall, but thankfully there was no paranormal crud to be found. Ethan and Anna are a great and charismatic couple - definitely equals in a battle of the sexes. The secondary characters, including her four burly French-Canadian lumberjack brothers, keep the story grounded."},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"In the sequel to The Seduction of His Wife Janet Chapman focuses on Ethan Knight. Ethan is set to take over the family's new acquisition, a sawmill. After being fired by the mill's foreman for a stupid accident prior to the sale of the sawmill, he is holding a small grudge. Not only does he end up keeping the foreman, but unknowingly rents a cottage on her property as well.Anna had a huge crush on Ethan when she was young and he saved her. Her grandfather shipped her off to her father after \\"the incident.\\" He did it for her own good, but Anna is just now figuring that part out, after his death. She's gotten past her childhood traumas, but can't get past her crush on Ethan. The fact that he keeps saving her doesn't help.A great story, and a beautiful addition to the series."},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"As with any book by Janet Chapman, I find myself reading some, then checking to see how much of the book is left---I just hate to see the pages go by! You want her books to last forever, and The Stranger in Her Bed is no exception!

I would recommend it for any day rain, shine, or in between."},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"It's been a while but I remember enjoying Janet Chapman's stories of rugged men in wild and manly Maine with strong women showing them the way to a blissful future but this book didn't do it for me. Anna Segee works as a foreman, or is that forewoman?, at a mill and when Ethan Knight walks in front of her loader she does avoid killing him but fires him on the spot. Little does she know at that point that he is to be the new owner of the mill. Turns out that Anna has had a crush on Ethan since childhood, that once he saved her from rape and that of course he doesn't recognize her for who she is until later.I missed the chemistry that should draw one character of a romance novel to the other. When Ethan and Anna get down to the kissing part (oops, I hope I didn't ruin anybody's experience of the book with that bit of info) it seemed to me that the author did it because she knew she had to get them to kiss rather than in a way that has you on pins and needles until it finally happens. Clumsy, that's the word. The book felt clumsy to me. The story, Anna inherited land after her grandfather had what looked like a deadly accident, is boring. I had to make myself finish the book. Still, I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because I did enjoy (very short) parts of it. My advice: Wait until your library gets it in, read it and if you like it great and if you don't you didn't waste any money."},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"I have enjoyed Janet Chapman books.

The problem with this book is that is exactly the same plot of \\"The Seduction of my Wife\\" by the same author. You cut something here and paste something there but is exactly the same.

I wish you could give halves.Anyway, this is the sequel to Seduction of His Wife and I read the two back to back. I got this book from a bookclub, and it didn't turn out quite the way I expected. I thought there would be more angst involved since he was someone from her past, but it's whatever.So, what did I think of this book? Well...first off I'm disappointed that Paul will probably not get his book since we find out what happens with his love life in this one. Secondly, I wonder why this woman has such a fascination with settings fires lol. Just cause you are in the woods doesn't mean fire is the only way XD.But anyway, as for the story. Well, it was OK. Their history felt kind of weak to me, but I went with it. I really wanted to see some more angst with that though. Perhaps if she had been a little older in the past? I dunno.Though why is it that Ethan can admit to others that he loves her, but he can't tell HER that? And it almost seemed like he 'folded' cause he was too horny to wait any longer. And I thought they jumped into bed WAY too easily. He kisses her once, and it seems out of place. Like there is going to be awkward silence, so let's just have them kiss. And cause of that, we'll cross the bridge easier to get them together. I really would have hoped for some more close encounters before they actually jumped into the bed.But don't get me wrong, I'm just nit-picky.

She barely raises a fuss and she still keeps seeing him and letting him use her. I hate books like this where the tough, independent woman turns into a doormat.Inconsistencies. EX: Anna could hear a whispered conversation from over 300 feet? Not unless she has Superman ears.Why didn't Paul's get his own book? His story was covered in a few pages.

It's not quite what you'd call a beach-book, but it's nothing terribly gripping either. Just a nice romance with a little action thrown in on the side. And like the last book, I waited too long again to write my review so I've forgotten half of what I was going to say.A couple of criticisms...there seemed to be a few inconsistencies between this book and the first one. I can't remember what they were, but there were a few details that didn't match up. I didn't like how Chapman handled Ethan figuring out who Anna really was. It was kinda like - don't you think, Abby? (the heroine's real name) And that was it. We didn't get his thought process or much of a reaction and that was disappointing. Another thing I hated was the sanitized language. You can only read so many \\"holy smokes!\\" or \\"goshes\\" before you want to smack your head. Maybe it's just me, but if you're going to write a sexually explicit scene, you should be able to curse. I'm not saying there had to be 5-star swear words all over the place, but a couple of the less objectionable ones wouldn't have hurt. Or even just some variety in the \\"pretty\\" swears would have been nice. I just got really tired of read \\"holy smokes\\" every couple pages.I think the most disappointed aspect of the book was realizing that Chapman wasn't going to do a story for the third brother, Paul. She married him off in this one in few pages and that was that. It just seemed a bit lame after building up this thing with three bachelor brothers in the first book. I was looking forward to a third story.Overall, I liked the book enough. It was a cute romance, nice chemistry and characters, and a solid storyline. But I wouldn't say it was utterly fabulous. It was just a solidly slightly above average read."},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"This was a really good book.

To get a better handle on the daily operation before they take charge, Ethan obtains work there. On his first day on the job he causes an accident that hurts foreman Abby Segee, damages expensive equipment, and leads to his being fired.Not long afterward, Ethan returns to take charge of running the sawmill while also moving into a cabin he rents from Abby. He has problems with a female in charge in a male dominated realm, but adapts as his father warns him and he sees how loyal the crew is to her. Ethan also fails to recognize Abby as he assumes she is part of the powerful Canadian lumber family Segee, but she does recognize him as she loved him when she lived as a youngster with her maternal grandfather until her Canadian birth father took her from him. As they fall in love, someone wants her dead as accidents including icing a road she takes between her home and her work occur; the same stretch that killed her grandfather.The second Knight in shining armor contemporary romance (see THE SEDUCTION OF HIS WIFE) is an exciting tale starring two likable protagonists and a strong support cast, mostly her crew and his family. The story line is at its best when the lead duo duels over the workplace and their relationship. The suspense elements seem forced, but no one will care as love blossoms in the Maine sawmill between the owner and the role model gender bending foreman.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"STRANGER IN HER BED (KNIGHT FAMILY, NO 2)","review":"When I started reading the book I could not stop.

It begins with finding a plot of land in which to build their cabin, to the growth of the family, and, thusly, adding more houses, and the eventual growth of a settlement. It covers clearing the land, building the cabin, adding \\"luxuries\\" such as a new cupboard, the harshness of the differing weather conditions and how they dealt with it, candle making and spinning, furniture (including rope beds), bathing, health, Sundays, courting, quilting, letter writing, and so much more.It doesn't get into great detail - more of an overview - but it gives the reader a sense of life lived during the time period covered. The sketches, which are on every page, are the icing on the cake.I have numerous other books by Bobbie Kalman - all of which are geared toward children, and this one is no exception. And yet, this is not really a children's book per se, for she writes in such a style that all who read these books - adult and youth - can learn something new.

I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars if I could.My friend had preordered this artbook and showed it to me when it arrived yesterday. I gushed over every single page of it. The artwork was exquisite - pages after pages of beautiful lineart with superior coloring (I can now understand why this had to be printed in Japan). I am ordering it right now!The first major category was Clover, and the illustrations were even more beautiful than in the manga - the coloring definitely boosted the beauty.The next section was Magic Knight Rayearth, including a few pieces of artwork drawn for the OVA (Princess Emeraude looked stunning). A minor complaint I have for this section is that the little strips of MKR mini-manga dialogues were already in print in the Magic Knight Rayearth I Box Set Memorial Book. Then again, the box set was limited edition so it could be considered a plus.As you might've already read from the artbook descriptions, this artbook also includes Legend of Chun Hyang and CLAMP in Wonderland as well as many little extras (I love the index of the artwork in the back with small explanations of each), so I won't make myself redundant.Just one thing that might slightly turn some people away from this artwork is that in the CLAMP in Wonderland section, one (and only one that I've noticed) page portrayed explicit nudity (specificially: realistic coloring & shading of the female topless body). I doubt any long-time anime/manga fan would mind this very much, but I'm mentioning this here just the same in case it matters to some people for any reason.A note about North Side versus South Side is their major difference: The artwork in North Side is from mangas published by Kodansha, while South Side includes artwork from mangas published by Kadokawa Shoten. I personally love the series from North Side a whole lot more, but make sure you check out both artbooks if you're interested!With that said, if you are a CLAMP fan, this is a MUST have for your collection. Even if you are not familiar with CLAMP, I feel that this artbook is in many ways superior to others due to the high quality of print and artwork. What can I say? This is worth the $30 - and as I am typing this, Amazon has it on sale for $20. It'll be worth every penny! I strongly recommend \\"CLAMP North Side\\"!!"},{"Title":"CLAMP North Side","review":"I absolutely love this book! It's amazing! Don't think you can just get the pics off the net, because it's so much better seeing the pics in real life, and it really makes a difference. It's worth every penny, and Amazon seems to have it on a permanent sale of twenty rather than thirty dollars. You can't get it any cheaper. Believe me, I looked everywhere. Great quality book, beautiful art and lots of it. The full-spread pics that cover two pages are the only setback, and a minor one.Now for the contents:1. Clover: the biggest section. Clover, like fine wine, needs an acquired taste. (I always wanted to say something like that) The art may not hit you at first, but once you get used to the art, you realize how beautiful it is. Clover is so beautiful, and I love the way they draw her hair blowing all over the place. I also love the futuristic mechanical theme and gorgeous, brilliant colors. And Kazuhiko and Suu are the cutest together. Not to mention Ai and Gingetsu. And there are a few stunning pics of Oruha, who I love! Plus all the cover art pics of the four Clover volumes. And a boxed set of Clover should be coming out this August (2005) so I'll finally be able to read another CLAMP masterpiece.2. Magic Knight Rayearth: Well, I have to say I was disappointed. Of course, there already were two volumes of artwork, so you can't expect to have that much left in this book. Most of the pics were the characters drawn chibi-form. I'm not that crazy about CLAMP's chibi guys anyway, so I wasn't so happy. Magic Knight Rayearth is one of my favorite CLAMP titles so far, so I was expecting more. The good thing was the full-color manga that wasn't included with the tankoban I got and had some crucial info in it. Where do they sleep? What do they eat? And what are there families like? The only problem was that the four pages of each section were squishd together in one page, making some small letters kind of hard to read. Still, there were some gorgeous pics, like the two posters with Emeraude-hime, Lantis and Zagato.3. Legend of the Dragon Kings: Love the art!! The four boys are so cute. There are the four of them as kings, and a napping series, and a tuxedo series and everything! Kawaii!!!!4. The Legend of Chun Hyang: Exuberant, energetic and colorful artwork. Chun and her hottie Yumeryu are the stars of this section, with one pic of Chun's mom and one of Chun as the cutest little girl y'ever saw! The full-page spreads of Chun on yellow and the other on red are so beautiful. I've been studying all the pictures of this book for ideas and tips to incorporate in my own drawings, the reason why I bought this book in the first place!5. CLAMP in Wonderland, CLAMP Campus Web Subschool, Others: the final art section. This section has group pics combining characters from all different series together, from Tokyo Babylon to x/1999 to RG Veda, plus pics with characters you have never seen before. This section also had the only nude picture of the book, a girl taking off her shirt and not wearing anything underneath. Nipples and breasts drawn explicitly, with full color. But it's only the one, so you can rip the page out if you like. Actually, there are a few not-quite nude pics in Clover and MKR, where the breast is not seen clearly, and no nipples are drawn. But don't worry; they're PG rated.6. Princess Mokona in CLAMP Country: A cute, short manga, very silly, drawn entirely in chibi-mode.7. Interview: The interview wasn't very personal; it was more facts than anything. The handwriting wasn't really THAT small, like other interviews say. There are also little pictures and footnotes that are useful and fun. But it was fun to read, especially the part on Chobits, the CLAMP series with the best artwork and cutest character!!8. Comments: Thumbnails of the pictures with comments. Unlike Naoko Takeuchi's comments on her artwork, CLAMP never really personalized the comments. Naoko-sensei (who created Sailor Moon) is a lot like me; she had problems drawing, disliked work after she made it and really loved her stuff. Anyway, the comments were fun.This book is great! I loved every page of it. Well, some of the pics at the end were ugly to me, but anyway...buy it now!!! If you want series like Legal Drug (ahhh....I just love Kazahaya-who doesn't??) Shirahime-syo and others, check out CLAMP South Side, which has a how to draw section, less extras, but more pics. BUY IT NOW!!!!

But I can now say it's one of the best books I have ever read. It's sad yet honest, beautifully written. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Well-Beloved (French Edition)","review":"Jude the Obscure is often called Thomas Hardy's last novel, but 1897's The Well-Beloved came two years later. The latter would be significant for this alone, but it has many other points of artistic and historical significance; also, though far from Hardy's best, it is quite good in itself. All fans and critics should read it, not least because it was the last novel one of the world's greatest writers chose to give us and almost his last piece of fiction.The book has an interesting and complex publishing history. Hardy's novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles was rejected by his chosen serial publisher on sexual grounds, and he chose to cancel the contract and submit another serial later. The trouble he continued to have with Tess convinced him that his next novel, Jude the Obscure, would also be rejected, so he put it aside and wrote The Well-Beloved as the serial replacement instead. As this suggests, it appeared at a very important point. It was serialized just as Tess, which catapulted Hardy to worldwide fame and ignited a firestorm of controversy, was published as a novel. Though undeniably lesser, The Well-Beloved indeed shares much with Tess and Jude, not least in thematic terms. All three paint an extremely bleak picture of domestic life, particularly marriage, and otherwise heavily criticize other Victorian society aspects, sexual mores especially. Jude parallels are especially strong; some of The Well-Beloved narrator's marriage critiques were slightly modified and used in Jude, and there are obvious similarities between the books' heroines and their married interactions. All this would make the book invaluable to hard-cores and scholars as a snapshot of Hardy's thought and artistic concerns of the time even if it had no literary merit.The Well-Beloved is also of historical interest for reasons not directly related to Hardy. Most notably, it deals with contemporary concerns and events in a way Hardy had not previously done. A proto-feminist, he had long been concerned with women's issues, and the times were finally beginning to catch up. Modern feminism was beginning in earnest, as many 1890s novels - e.g., Kate Chopin's The Awakening - reflect in various ways. Hardy was of course no exception. He famously said in a contemporary letter that his goal was - I am paraphrasing - to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have any kind of fiction at all. The Well-Beloved is an early attempt, certainly less overt than Tess and Jude but leaning in their direction. The three main female characters are certainly not models of current feminism but stand far above Victorian clich&eacute;s as bold women with independent streaks, individual touches, and some clear merits. Hardy is famous for his heroines, and the book's three Avices are among his most overlooked. His novels had idealized women almost from the start but in a way very different from other Victorian writers, much less the social ideal. This has fascinated feminists and had a profound influence on later writers like D. H. Lawrence and Marcel Proust. The Well-Beloved is the epitome of this tendency. The Avices are not Hardy's strongest, most independent, or most conventionally appealing heroines but are his most idealized. They are almost otherworldly in their attributes and, most importantly, their significance. It is mesmerizing to see how he works them into his narrative, and those interested in his life and thought will appreciate them as a glimpse into the mind of a man far ahead of his time.Though obviously tame by later standards, the book was also astonishingly frank about related sexual issues. In an era when statues were covered and it was not even socially permissible to mention legs or ankles, it referred openly to premarital sex and its consequences, treats marriage with a lightness remarkable even now, and has several instances of cohabitation. This is of great interest as a portrait of an era. Laughable as it now is, many thought the book nothing less than pornographic. One critic infamously accused Hardy of sex mania, saying \\"Mr Hardy has once more afforded a dismayed and disgusted public the depressing spectacle of genius on the down grade.\\" Particularly amusing are the euphemisms Hardy was forced to use; for example, he refers to the actual rural England practice of sex between couples with marriage contingent on pregnancy as the \\"ratification of their betrothal, according to the precedent of their sires and grandsires.\\" There is also a good deal of sexual symbolism; as always with Hardy, Freudians will have a proverbial field day. Yet, also as always with him, these elements never overwhelm the story. Hardy clearly had a didactic purpose by now but was never preachy and very rarely heavy-handed. He makes what he has to say arise naturally - forgetting to do so being a fatal sin that many writers, especially late in their careers, unfortunately commit. Hardy is notable for avoiding it and, here as nearly everywhere, should serve as a model.Related and at least as important is the book's central idea - that a man can have an ideal \\"Well-Beloved,\\" perhaps more spirit than real, that manifests itself in individual women, causing the man to love them with a slavelike passion, but can switch to another woman without warning. It may last for days or years, and there may be long periods between, but the man is as loving and faithful as possible when it is there yet loses all interest as soon as it goes, causing an endless cycle. Many saw this as a mere ploy to exploit the \\"sex mania\\" Victorians seemed obsessed with, and it is now easy to assume Hardy was simply using it as a euphemism for unpopular ideas now considered commonplace. However, this sells him very short as both artist and thinker. It is in many ways the coalescence and culmination of various ideas pursued throughout his career. On one level, as noted, it is the apex of his female idealization. On another, perhaps more subtly, it is another instance of the fatalistic streak that increasingly dominated Hardy's fiction and became even more overt in his poetry. Based on Percy Shelley's \\"One shape of many names,\\" the evil force inhabiting tyrants throughout history that enslaves the masses, it is Hardy's way of dramatizing what he later called \\"Love the Monopolist\\" and is another manifestation of what he eventually termed the \\"Imminent Will\\" - the blind force, slowly gaining consciousness, that rules the universe. Men have no control over The Well-Beloved; they can neither resist it nor make it stay. Some may still say this is a convenient way of skirting moral issues, which Hardy surely realized to his convenience, but he would not have thought in such simplistic terms.As this suggests, the book has a fantastic quality distinctly opposed to Hardy's usual realist/naturalist fiction, and he indeed classed it with his \\"Romances and Fantasies.\\" Other novels in this category - e.g., A Pair of Blue Eyes - have a similar air of unreality, but this is alone in being essentially allegorical. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and exploitation of melodramatic coincidence, but this exceeds all others in being so implausible that it is almost impossible to accept at face value. His denouncers always assume that he lacked the skill to plot without relying on such things and that he uses them for shock value - in short, that he is amateurish. In fact, though, anyone who knows anything about him is well aware that it was very conscious artistically and philosophically - Hardy's way of dramatizing a universe where people are no more significant than any other element and just as much the prey of fate's \\"purblind doomsters.\\" This is especially so here; Hardy had jotted down the Well-Beloved concept several years prior, also exploring it in contemporaneous poems, and thought of the book as a \\"fantastic little tale.\\" Adding to the sense of unreality are light-hearted chapter titles that poke fun at the events and protagonist in a way Hardy never did elsewhere in fiction and rarely in poetry.The Well-Beloved is in fact what no other Hardy novel is - an allegory. Hardy's painstaking attention to realist detail and some of his other characteristics make him an unlikely allegorist, but he succeeds admirably. The subject also ties the book to its era - the artistic ethos, shown by works like Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray to be a hot topic. The book is subtitled \\"A Sketch of A Temperament,\\" and so it is - Hardy's depiction of one kind of artistic temperament, perhaps what he saw as the ideal or even the only one. The sculptor protagonist, Jocelyn Pierston, symbolizes all artists, The Well-Beloved symbolizes his muse, and his attempts to translate them into sculpture symbolize how artists transmute muse into art. All this is fairly obvious; the real interest comes in how Hardy shows the process' effect on everyday life and how the two play off of, and often conflict with, one another. Fantastical as it is, many see the novel as one of Hardy's most autobiographical, and there is much to support this. Those interested in his life and techniques will thus find much to engross them, but the important thing to focus on is his general point. Hardy unfortunately never formally formulated his aesthetic theory to the degree of many other Victorian writers, and this, his most purely aesthetic novel, may be the closest he ever came; fans and critics will want to read it for this alone.Thankfully, though, there is far more. Different as it is from his other works in many ways, there is also much to attract fans. Chief among these is a profound sense of place. Perhaps no one equals Hardy in not only describing settings so realistically that verisimilitude is astonishingly vivid but also in making them an integral part of the story; setting for him is never mere backdrop. Most of the book is set in the Isle of Slingers, which is closely based on the Isle of Portland in Hardy's native Southwest England. Though not usually considered one of Hardy's Wessex novels, this shares many elements with those acclaimed works. The scene is lovingly and painstakingly portrayed, seeming to truly come alive in a way later fiction has rarely even approximated and certainly never equaled. Hardy's trademark pathos is also very present; lack of realism makes it hard to identify with the characters as strongly as in most Hardy works, but they gain our sympathy, and the book takes us on a roller coaster ride of emotions. We also get a good sense of why Hardy was arguably Victorian fiction's suspense master - not his least influential characteristic. His masterly characterization is also on strong display, and the social and artistic commentary gives readers plenty of substantial meat.Yet the novel is clearly below Hardy's top tier. At about 150 pages, it is much shorter than all his novels except Under the Greenwood Tree and The Trumpet-Major, and it lacks the major works' ambition. The latter's epic sweep and full tragic hit are missing, and there is an awkwardness to some of the prose that had been missing since his first few novels. Anyone expecting another Tess or Jude will be disappointed.Hardy clearly knew this and probably would have been the first to admit that he gave the serial relatively little effort. It was written quickly under deadline pressure and interrupted by preparations for the novel publication of Tess; this probably accounts for the length as well as picking up an old idea and the possible heavy autobiographical reliance. Jude was clearly prioritized; Hardy finished it and saw it through novel publication before returning to The Well-Beloved. He revised all his books for novel form, but The Well-Beloved got by far the most numerous and drastic changes - another Tess/Jude connection. Hardy never found a serial publisher willing to print those works as written and was forced to print bowdlerized versions, restoring them only in novel publication. Though immensely popular, both were widely denounced as immoral; the furor became so great that Hardy decided to abandon novels.However, he still had The Well-Beloved to publish in novel form and finally began the task five years after the serial. Hardy bravely refused to compromise his art to public decorum throughout his sixty-year writing career, but the Tess/Jude explosion left him disgusted and cynical. Wishing to avoid further controversy and return to poetry, his real literary love, he thus engaged in an extraordinary act of self-censorship, altering and removing most or all of what he thought might offend. He removed the harshest marriage and monogamy critiques and considerably toned down sexual suggestiveness, for instance moving premarital sex references from dialogue to narration and deleting the mention of Pierston kissing Marcia's underwear when he dries her clothes.Several other significant changes seem unrelated; Hardy likely changed his idea of what the novel should be after finally giving it due attention and seemed to want it more cleanly rounded for final publication. These changes ranged from deleting chapter one - which some speculate Hardy thought gave too much of himself away - to changing name spellings. Yet the extent of the changes is often exaggerated. One often sees the claim that the two versions are practically different novels, and many recent editions have both in full. However, the great majority is identical or nearly so, and the middle section is almost unchanged. True fans and scholars will of course want both, but those wishing to avoid repetition can safely restrict themselves to the serial's first nine and last six chapters. Aside from removing controversy, the changes are of little significance until the latter. As desire to avoid controversy was clearly not the driving force behind this changed final section, it indisputably stands as Hardy's final vision. However, as with the lesser changes made to other works, one can easily debate if this was for the better. The final ending arguably arises more naturally, but the original is clearly more in line with Hardy's tragic vision and determinism. If the third Avice's refusal to marry Pierston in the final version is more believable for her character, so is the latter's attempted suicide in the serial, and Marcia's original return is certainly far more plausible. More importantly, the original ending's dark concatenation of circumstances drives Hardy's bleak message home in a far more biting and grandly sweeping way than the somewhat abrupt and inconclusive final ending. Perhaps he thought it too heavy-handed or wanted to end his fiction career on a more positive note. It would be hard to blame these impulses, but I find the first ending indisputably superior artistically, and I cannot shake the feeling that Hardy begrudgingly compromised his vision in the final for insufficient, if unknown, reasons. At any rate, it is surely true that the final words - his closing statement in and on a quarter century of fiction - were written with not only his past work, and Tess/Jude particularly, in mind but also the future: \\"At present he is sometimes mentioned as \`the late Mr Pierston' by gourd-like young art-critics and journalists; and his productions are alluded to as those of a man not without genius, whose powers were insufficiently recognised in his lifetime.\\"Hardy himself was of course insufficiently appreciated in life, or at least at the time, and it is a testament to his far-seeing vision that he was confident time would mitigate his era's unfair prejudices. His reputation is now higher than ever, and he remains well-read and immensely influential. The Well-Beloved is a minor part of his legacy but an essential one for fans and critics, while its significant differences from his other work also mean those not normally keen on his fiction may well be pleasantly surprised.As for this edition, it is ideal for most because it is not only inexpensive but has both versions of the story; an excellent introduction with substantial background on Hardy, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; and useful notes. It is one of the best versions available."},{"Title":"Well-Beloved (French Edition)","review":"The Well-Beloved sounds very modern; it's got that brilliant minimalist prose Hardy does so well, and reminds me of many novels about twenty-something commitment-phobes. Jocelyn Pierston (sp? sorry - I just returned it to the library) has an \\"ideal\\" type of woman in mind (and the ideal keeps changing) so that no real female ever fit the bill. Consequently, he remains unmarried - and lonely - and he's forever (patronizingly) fidgeting with the lives of his discarded muses to the point that he actually harms some of them. One of the weaknesses of the novel is that the protagonist is supposed to be a brilliant sculptor. However, he is never shown pursuing his art. This reminds me of Philip Roth's main character in \\"Everyman,\\" a professional (late-life) painter. Though Hardy was an architect, like Roth he has not captured the character of a visual artist. As both a novelist and a painter I know what it means to be a passionate visual artist. There are \\"quirks\\" in such people - ways of literally seeing the world - that these otherwise great writers have missed entirely, giving proof to the contention that a writer should write about what he/she knows. Both books left me with a sense of their emptiness, though I also gave Roth high marks at his Amazon site for \\"Everyman.\\" Despite the lack in both novels, these writers know how to burn words into paper, mind and soul. Just to be in their presence, even to read a lesser novel, is to hear what it is to write. Too bad their protagonists don't make us see what it is to sculpt or paint."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"A fascinating look at the cultural significance and spiritual--and sometimes political--influence of tea on Japanese culture.

The Book Of Tea was in fact written in English, in order to prove accessible to English-speakers, and presents chanoyu (literally \\"the way of tea\\") as a spiritual culture and a ritual that interlaces with the \\"Art of Life\\" itself.

Authors, both Japanese and other, were quick to satisfy this new hunger for insight with a variety of metaphors on Japanese society. In his book \\"Bushido,\\" Tsunetomo Yamamoto exposed Western audiences to the \\"soul of Japan\\" as a warrior's code. Kazuko Okakura found a much more gentle metaphor in chanoyu, the Japanese tea ceremony.\\"The Book of Tea\\" does not propose to be a manual on the tea ceremony, but rather a launching point for Japanese aesthetics and values of beauty. Okakura himself is not a tea master, but is a highly-educated aristocrat, schooled in classical Chinese studies and Japanese art. He sees in chanoyu the unique elements of the Japanese eye, and juxtaposes the appeal of architecture, interior decoration, approach to art and other points with the Western view.The writing style reflects the tone of literature of the early 1900's, with an authoritative tone and elf-important turns of phrase. Like \\"Bushido,\\" \\"The Book of Tea\\" seeks to showcase the idealized Japan, that dream of an aesthetic that never-was but is always sought after. An average Japanese home has no relation to the sacred space of the tea house, and your average Japanese cup of tea is knocked back with little ceremony. But within that, there is the search for art in life, and that can be found in chanoyu.Not that it is all esoteric. There is an interesting tour through the history of tea, and its transportation from China to the world. But \\"The Book of Tea\\" is very small, and one can not expect too much from a volume of this size. Okakura's mussings are a quick and interesting read, and might be considered a launching point for a deeper investigation of the mysteries of Japanese aesthetics and tea."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"I've read it 4 times and own it on paperi've given it as a giftit makes Zen and Dao understandable to Westernersit is wise and generous"},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Its ok once you get started but you just have to slog on and it gets better have fun ok"},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"I chose four stars because I enjoyed reading this book about the history of tea.

It is, in fact, none of the above. Historically, Kakuzo discusses tea as a device that has fascinated, caused rebellion, and united the world in its honor. In essence, Kakuzo describes tea as the \`cup of humanity', savored and shared by the world. Within that structure, the tea ceremony is the intersection of the undisturbed, free-flowing beauty of nature with the meditative discipline of preparing and consuming tea. Therefore, the Tea Room is the vessel used in advancing the tea ceremony. It's simplicity along with its contrasting demand of careful decoration; serve to represent the simplicity of nature and purity of art as the highest means of human expression and mediation. Upon partaking in the ceremony, the Tea Room serves as a sanctuary for our soul, to free it from the mundane, superficial activities and aspirations of modern human endeavor. For a few moments, to be able to cleanse it within the serene, guileless facets of our world serve as Kakuzo's message on the nature of harmony. By mediating on nature through the ceremony of tea, we are free to cultivate our own intrinsic artistry, allowing it, with each successive drop, to warm our hearts, ease our mind, and foster a clear understanding of self. Great art is to be savored, relinquishing us to drown in its careful composition, savory fragrance, and lingering warmth, akin to a savory cuppa tea."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"This slim little book is not just an illustration of the history and preparation of tea, or a paean to a shared love of boiled leaves through the ages, although you'll find both inside. It's also a window into the culture and history of household ritual, of humble yet uplifting custom built around food that reaches back beyond a thousand years and into our own homes today. Everyone who has found solace in preparing a cup of tea will find this book speaks to them, and will find themselves touching and understanding something of the lives of people from the Victorian British to the ancient Chinese. The tradition of tea, as tradition is meant to, turns history into continuity."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Thanks for listing this great book.

Originally published by the Charles E. Tuttle Company in 1956, it is intended to introduce Western readers to the ceremonies surrounding the preparation and serving of tea in traditional Japanese culture -- and, by extension, to the broader precepts of that culture. A fascinating read."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Okakura' small distillation of 'Teaism' is really a survey of Eastern philosophy. He points to Zen and Taoism as the foundational ways of thinking that anchor this idea called Teaism. There are brilliant moments of insight in this small and curious book, with many true assessments of the West's shifting perceptions of Eastern civilization. I am reminded of the late Heidegger's philosophy (and indeed Heidegger read 'The Book of Tea), particularly in essays such as 'The Thing' which point out the significance of our everyday objects and their intimate relationship to world and culture. This book is truly a small treasure of Eastern thought."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Okakura Kakuzo (1862-1913) was a Japanese scholar who contributed to the development of arts in Japan. Outside of Japan, he is chiefly remembered today as the author of The Book of Tea.The Book of Tea is truly a beautiful work in spite of its harsh criticism of the West, but at the time it was written, Japan was sacrificing its traditions and its culture in favor of Occidental trappings. Kakuzo's desire was not to have Japanese art remain in stasis, but mature and evolve along lines untouched (or \\"untainted\\" as Kakuzo would probably say) by Western influences.In this book, Kakuzo goes into great detail about the spiritual development of Japan and how the celebration of tea, seen at that time more as an artistic and spiritual art form, developed from a fusion of Buddhism, Taoism, and Shintoism.Alas, as important as Kakuzo's work was during his lifetime, today Japan is one of the most secular countries in the world having embraced a more materialistic worldview. The West has won.This would have saddened Kakuzo , but would not have caught him completely by surprise as the Japanese Tea Ceremony teaches all things are ephemeral and that all things, including countries, pass away.So I leave you with this quote from the book before we once again turn and submerge ourselves back into our sterile and secular world:Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea. The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle. Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"I wanted to read more about the origin of tea and the different varieties and how it is made, etc. This book was written quiet awhile ago and was basically a history book.... so really didn't find it relevant (at least me). Was very boring, and I couldn't get through the book."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"At its best this book provides an interesting look at tea. On the downside, Okakura Kakuzo, gets several of his facts wrong by not proofreading. All the facts are corrected in a brilliant afterward by E. F. Bleiler. Also, Okakura, has several comparisons to the West and how Japan is different. This is to show his Japanese uniqueness and it borders on nihonjinron.However, Okakura does make a clear connection between the consumption of tea and aesthetics. He explains the background of the tea ceremony and the Zen influence. It is interesting of how he first talks about Taoism and its relationship to Zen, which I knew about but haven't really read anything on it.I like the chapter on the Tea House. It explains a lot of how the Japanese view the tea house experience. It starts with certain objects placed inside the tea house such as flowers and maybe one painting or poem. It is this simple refined use of space that the interior of the tea house is to be best appreciated and enjoyed. He also shows how the tea house is a way to experience Zen. From the walk down the path, to the washing of utensils, to putting it all together and consuming tea this reflects how a Zen monk will break from the world, as he enters the tea house, and begins meditation.If you have any interest in Japanese culture or just like a good hot cup of tea, this can be an entertaining book."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"the articulation is so enchanting that prejudice aside it is hard to say that any other work of literature expresses more clearly what the east is all about. magnificent"},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages.

Totally ignorant, I opened the book half expecting to find dry writing on types of tea leaves. Instead I discovered something deeply beautiful. This book does indeed teach the history of tea and its preparation, but it also provides an eloquent introduction to Teaism and other aspects of Japanese culture. Okakura wavers most delicately between prose and poetry, between the educational and the spiritual. The words linger with you long after you have finished, and tea, once an ordinary beverage, acquires a soul-- a source of peace.\\"Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.\\"(Chapter One, The Cup of Humanity)"},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"I loved this book.

By the end of his life he had seen the Great War and Japan's first imperialistic military adventures in Korea and Manchuria that would culminate in the tragedy of the Second World War.The scion of Japanese aristocracy, Okakura chose to spend the latter half of his life as an expatriate living in Boston, Massachusetts, where he befriended the Brahmins of that city. THE BOOK OF TEA was written in this period, sometime in the nineteen-oh-ohs. Written for an American audience, it eloquently introduced the Boston bluebloods to an idealized vision of Japan, the Japan of cherry blossoms, kakemono, and Chanoyu, the Tea Ceremony.Reading THE BOOK OF TEA, one realizes that Okakura was not \\"selling\\" Japan to the West. THE BOOK OF TEA does not engage in any lacquer-box hucksterism. Rather, THE BOOK OF TEA is his paean to and his lament for a Japan of the virtues that was all-too-rapidly being consumed by Occidentally-intoxicated militarists and industrialists. THE BOOK OF TEA was written to banish the soot-stained chrysanthemums of Okakura's deepest nightmares.Although this reviewer came to THE BOOK OF TEA expecting a manual on the Tea Ceremony, this book is nowhere so vulgar as that. Yes, a manual on the highly stylized Chanoyu has its place, but it's place is nowhere without this book which penetrates to the heart and soul of the ceremony. This reviewer can honestly say that THE BOOK OF TEA provided him with comprehension, a deeper insight, and a first true appreciation for Japanese art forms, so different than the European.In its simplicity and its elegance, the Tea Ceremony is a form of Zen practice. Every element, from the atmosphere of the tearoom (called in Japanese \\"The Abode of Fancy,\\" a world unto itself), the selection of the flowers, the artwork, the bamboo tea implements, the bright, sharp jade green macha tea, and the specially made jangling teapot and ceramic cups, speaks to an aesthetic foreign to the West. Okakura calls it \\"Teaism,\\" a play on Taoism, and its purpose is to delight the senses, touch the heart, and place the participant fully in the present moment.Shambhala Publications has presented THE BOOK OF TEA in a fine paperbound edition, the colors, typeset, and dimensions of which please the mind. Shambhala has also provided color photographs, in truth forms of abstract art, of the tea implements in use, that add a visual dimension to this already fine book."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"This book is a delightful oddity. It's about 100 years old now. It was written by a Japanese expatriate, in English, for an English-speaking audience. I mean the term \\"audience\\" in the most audible way, since this text was meant to be read aloud to the highest of the Boston Brahmins. (That attention to sound is probably a big part of why this reads so smoothly.)Kakuzo explains the Japanese tea ceremony to a non-Japanese audience. Oddly, he does not describe the ceremony. Instead, he lays out the history of tea and the history of the Zen esthetic in which cha-do (\\"the way of tea\\") makes sense. He describes the place in which the ceremony is held, and some of the tools used in that ceremony. He does not, however, spell out the mechanics of the service. Perhaps it's just as well. As Kakuzo describes, it is not the tea that matters. It is the effect that the ritual has on the people who perform it.This book is laid out simply and elegantly, as befits its topic. The primary font is a little unusual - a long-waisted serif that connotes the warm feeling of the text itself. Page layouts are airy, and have a distinctive swaying gait from as they step from chapter to chapter. The few photos that illustrate this book are atmospheric, and printed in a subdued color scheme. It doesn't equal the old slip-case edition, but it's still a pleasing and instructive sample of book design.This is a pleasant book, and a short one. The reading is over much too quickly. It is also a delightful contrast to another Japanese author writing for an English audience at very nearly the same time. Nitobe's unfortunate \\"Bushido\\" tries much too hard to explain itself in Western terms. Kakuzo, instead, expresses his home culture in its own terms, the only ones that make sense, and in much more readable language.//wiredweirdPS: This edition has a new intro by Liza Dalby, the first and possibly only American woman to complete training as a geisha."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"On the surface, this is a book about history - the history of tea, and art, and religion.

It makes the reader think about and reassess what is important in life, what is really beautiful, what is worth keeping or fighting for. What is dignity.This essay, which wends its way between the discovery of tea, flower arranging, architecture and Taoism along with other enticing subjects, is truly an enlightening and thrilling book, in a quiet and gentle way (is that possible?)

Fuji, is not about benefits of tea.The book by narrating how the tea philosophy and ceremony tradition developed in Japan, tries to take us into the beauty of Japanese minds refined by Tea traditon of Japan and the lure of Budhisim or Taoism upon which the tea philosophy is based. One particular icon representing the tea religion is Rikyu Sen the very founder of the tea phlosophy in Japan. The scene of the death of Rikyu is just brilliantly written.So for some Japanese tea is beyond health drinks.

This book, as other reviewers have said is not so much about the actual tea ceremony itself as it is an effort by a japanese person to explain the history and philosophy behind the custom. In the process, he explains a great deal of how the japanese mind works and gives a sometimes uncomfortable look at how the oriental sees western culture. I particularly was fascinated by the account of the discomfort felt by a japanese person talking to a western man who was standing in front of his own portrait. To most western people, their would be no problem, but to the japanese, there is an overwhelming feeling that either the picture or the man is a fraud and he may have difficulty telling which fraud to believe.For a western person trying to understand the oriental attitudes to life and culture, I would place this book on the must-read list along with the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu and the Art of War by Sun Tzu. For the ordinary reader, it gives a fascinating glance at a different view of Art, Religion, Life, and Culture.

Kakuzo Okakura attempted to correct that lack of knowledge in his 1906 book The Book of Tea: The Classic Work on the Japanese Tea Ceremony and the Value of Beauty. This book has become the defining text on the meanings woven into the ceremony, the setting, and everything surrounding it.It's a small book, 155 pages, and that even includes notes and explanations from those who have written the forward and afterword. Okakura himself goes into poetic detail on each part of the ceremony, such as the history of tea, the role of art and flowers, the utensils, and the teahouse itself. Since it's written from a perspective of explaining the significance to a non-Japanese audience, it's far more than just a recitation of facts and rituals. For instance, one whole chapter is about flowers. Of the 16 pages, the first 11 are odes to flowers, poetic descriptions of the blooms, and the lamenting of how the Western mind minimizes and destroys these plants without a second thought. Once you get past that, there's a brief description of how the tea-master will select and place the flower in the teahouse. This is then largely rounded out by explanations of the different schools of thought on the art of flower arrangement, not necessarily on how the flowers are further involved in the ceremony. This type of writing tends to give you a broader idea of the Japanese mindset and culture, but not necessarily anything specific on the actual tea ceremony. Of course, that's probably *my* Western mind wanting to get to concrete descriptions and steps rather than becoming immersed in significance and wonder...Given the small size of the book, it's not going to consume great amounts of time if you decide to read it. Just be prepared for more contemplation and poetry rather than a logical dissection of all that is the tea ceremony.

It's as much a look at the ceremony itself as a portrait of a certain romanticizing interpretation of Japanese culture, written by a scholar who was straddling both worlds and sought to explain one to the other. The introduction is immensely readable, not to mention informative - many amusing turns of phrase in there which I wish I remembered for occasional use (need to reread the thing!). A treat rarely offered at this price, even if you read it only once."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"This classic exploration of Japanese culture, done at a time when there was great Oriental interest among cultured westerners, outshines all the trendy &quot;let's have tea&quot; books of today, in that it exposes the wonderful relationship between &quot;Teaism&quot; and Taoism, among other cultural traditions. Woodcut illustrations help set a peaceful mood. I urge people to get the nice hardcover edition if available, that has endpapers the color of real green tea."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"This book was written around 1900, it seems, for those upper class ladies and gentlemen who delight in tea yet are ignorant of its artistic quality to life past and present.I expected at least one receipe of Japanese tea unknown to the west but found not one blend but certainly a receipe for greater bliss, rapture with each cup. I found the missing ingredient in my tea - perspective.This little book takes you through the history, the philosophy, the poetry, and the religion of tea.The chapters are as follows:-The Cup of Humanity-The Schools of Tea-Taoism and Zennism-The Tearoom-Art Appreciation-Flowers-Tea MastersThis book reads like poetry. There is a chapter called \\"Flowers\\" which gives you the perspective of a flower in the grasp of man. It challenges you to gain feeling, to become alive by admiring life.\\"Tell me, gentle flowers, teardrops of the stars, standing in the garden, nodding your heads to the bees as they sing of the dews and the sunbeams, are you aware of the fearful doom that awaits you? Dream on, sway and frolic while you may in the gentle breezes of summer. Tomorrow a ruthless hand will close around your throats. You will be wrenched, torn asunder limb by limb, and borne away from your quiet homes. The wretch, she may be passing fair. She may say how lovely you are while her fingers are still moist with your blood. Tell me, will this be kindness? It may be your fate to be imprisoned in the hair of one whom you know to be heartless or to be thrust into the buttonhole of one who would not dare to look you in the face were you a man.Like all the Shambhala classics, this book is spiritual. I hope you can read it and be forever changed. Next time I will taste with my spirit not my tongue."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"I came across this book about 10 years ago and am still enthralled with it. Not only does it explain the hows and whys of the Japanese tea ceremony, the author gives wonderful thoughts on living and his philosophies of a good life.

A great book to return to periodically to refresh your beliefs in the beauty of the world and tea."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Okay. Please note: The Book of Tea was written in ENGLISH originally. Yes, Okakura Kakuz' was fluent and decided to target the book towards Westerners. In knowing this, I have very little patience for those publishers that have editions filled with errors (Looking at you Dover). Since it's not a translated work, the original text should be what is printed. The original copyright has expired, so there is not legal reason why subsequent editions would vary with the text.So the main determining factor I used is finding a publisher that I trusted. Sadly my first purchase of this book was returned because I hit buy now and it popped the Dover edition into my cart... But click under Format and select one of the editions from a reputable publisher. If you look at the 1 star ratings, most are the Dover, Tuttle, or Kindle editions. The 5 star ratings tend to be for the Penguin or Shambhala editions.I think the acid free, high quality paper used in the Shambhala edition is nice and the pictures nice to look at. It makes a great book for quiet reflection and isn't an embarrassment to your coffee table or bookshelf since it has a nice cover."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Anyone interested in a deeper understanding of Asian culture, especially as it pertains to Zen and Taoist teachings, should check out this classic work.

A simple beverage creating a simple pleasure, yet holding enough signifigance to be the focal point of religious ritual."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"'The book of Tea' is a small essay written in 1906 by a Kakuzo Okakura, an early divulger of Japanese culture abroad; he lived for quite a few years in the US, and mastered his grasp of the English language, as can be seen in this volume (his English is very fluent, polished, even cultured).The book is, therefore, a very basic introduction to the philosophy behind the Japanese Tea-Ceremony, a complex and developed art by itself (Chado, the Way of Tea). Don't expect here much details or information about it. The book is a general introduction for westerners, and stays for the most in the very basics, touching more the spirit behind the art (and connecting it with Japanese and Oriental cultural and religious views of life, as opposed to 'Western' views and lifestyles) than its characteristics.This small treatise is divided, nevertheless, into 7 chapters. The first (The Cup of Humanity) gives some general background information to the importance of tea consumption East and West. The second (The schools of tea) takes a brief overview of the 3 modes of tea-consumption in China and Japan: boiled (in bricks), whipped and steeped. The three ways correspond to three moments and atittudes: T'ang China (tea was a novelty and a mere refined pastime), Sung China (tea becomes a refined art connected with philosophical Taoism) and Ming China (generalized, democratic, and with Zen Buddhism). Japan's art and tea-drinking would connect with the Sung China period of converting tea-drinking into a refined art, a process presumably interrupted in China by 'barbarian' invasions (Yuan, Q'ing). Chapter 3 (Taoism and Zennism) explores the religious connections of Chado, establishing a link with 'Southern' China forms (Zen and Tao, religions of the Yang Tze) as opposed to the 'Northern', communal and Confucian world views. Chapter 4 (The Tea-Room) dwells on the elements of Japanese and tea-house architecture (wooden, unasuming, minimalistic); Chapter 5 (Art Appreciation) dwells on the religious important of art, as a 'following of the heart' and 'feeling of the void', and as a cult and aesthetization of everyday life, as in Chado; Chapter 6 (Flowers) talks about the importance of nature and flower arrangement as an Oriental art by itself, (Ikebana) but also included (and more properly developed) in the Tea-Ceremony. Finally, chapter 7 (Tea Masters) concludes with a brief mention of the contributions of tea-masters to art in general, stopping a bit to describe Sen no Rikyu nd his refined end.To conclude: 'The book of Tea' is an interesting and well written essay that will allow you to enjoy the few hours it takes to read it, and that will lend itself graciously for re-readings. Nevertheless, it is very basic, and very obviously betrays the time it was written (in its style, criticism of the West, sentimentalism and in the odd way it translates Asian names). If you want to get acquainted with Chado you'll have to look elsewhere, but this can be a useful and entertaining, albeit very limited, introduction."},{"Title":"The book of tea","review":"Didn't care for the book.

Here are three of the strongest:1) In 1992, when Malcolm X was being transformed into a fashion accessory/popular culture icon and the black influence on the cultural politics of the 1960s whitewashed, the reissue of Cleaver's book reminded us that \\"what was great was not Malcolm X but the truth he uttered\\" and that the survival of black genius is crucial to the good mental health of white America.2) Inasmuch as the 1960s of the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement was about closing ranks -among other things- \\"Soul on Ice\\" did not support any dysfunctional black unity, which explains its challenge of author James Baldwin's unconstructive and unfair criticisms of writer Richard Wright and Negritude advocate Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire.3) Useful condemnations of slavery's racist (re) presentation of black/American sexual politics (subtle or blatant) can be found in the pages of Cleaver's book; it anticipated much of the contemporary scholarship intervening in part or wholly in this domain: Ed Guerrero's \\"Framing Blackness\\", Mike Marqusee's \\"Redemption Song\\", and Spike Lee's cultural politics and cinema.Cleaver had his soul on ice but managed to produce this brilliant collection of essays. As readers we must, in turn, freeze \\"Soul on Ice\\" in the 1960s fridge; let us consume it 1960s-frozen for therein lies its Twist(ed)-Hula-Hoop(ed) richness. The author of \\"Soul on Ice\\" was no prophet, just an intelligent angry young black man who wrote under duress during an era when it was very difficult for his people to free their psyches from subjugation to the point where they could \\"say it loud: I am black and I am proud!\\"."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"The overall effect of the book was one of an eye opening experience where I was able to crawl inside the mind of a Black revoltuionary. The fact that this man was an American and not a part of a revolutionary force somewhere in the Uganda showd me that the crystal clean superficial of what we call America does not always have the same tint when we strip it down to its roots, with the oppressed. I wanted to read more about the author himself rather than read his highlt intelletual essays and for that reason, it took a great deal out of me to pick up the book after bringing myself to conclude one previous chapter. Not completely agreeable were some of the essays but at least they provided me with a new and often militant outlook on the situation that encased America for years. Cleaver opened my eyes and ears to an experience that will often be attempted to be left behind, but as long as the word is out, it will never die. &quot;Stay Strong!&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"This is a lively, entertaining work. Cleaver never seems to lose sight of the fact he needs to entertain his audience, or sell books (or his ideas). Near the end Cleaver develops his own sexual philosophy of sorts and fleshes it out with a bit of detail.In the 1992 preface Ishmael Reed writes, \\"(although Cleaver criticized writer James Baldwin) it is obvious that Soul on Ice is influenced by Baldwin's flamboyantly eloquent taxidermist's style\\". It's said Soul on Ice is a classic and influential work. . . When I read this I wondered if what I write has been influenced by Cleaver. That is, I wonder if I've been influenced by those who've read and imitated Cleaver. I've come back to this review and given it 4 stars instead of 3. It's worthy of the 4 stars I just can't myself agree with the message. At times Cleaver makes a profound statement hidden simply inside half a sentence and then moves on to something else in the wink of an eye without following up or expounding upon the apparent revelation.In the middle of the book he writes, a bit facetiously, \\"all red-blooded Americans who love TV and gentle toilet tisue know that the negro revolution was conceived in Moscow (scratch Moscow, insert Peking) and launched by left-wing fanatics, and that the growing mass movement in opposition to Americans war in Vietnam is \\"communist inspired, manipulated and controlled\\"'.When I read that I thought it was one of the best things I've ever read. Looking back over it, I noticed 'toilet tisue' is misspelled. For a moment I thought I discovered a typo but most likely Cleaver misspells the word on purpose for effect.Overall there's a conciliatory or hopeful tone to the work. He seemed to see the white youth of America as ready and willing to change. Elvis and the Beatles were not going to corrupt white youth but liberate them. On the inside Jacket Cover, Media and Methods, writes, \\"this book is a black man's spiritual odyssey away from hate and crime towards understanding and 'convalescence'. Best Sellers writes \\"Cleaver is not simply a zealot or reactionary. . . He moves through Soul on Ice with a hunger to reaffirm his existence, sometimes in anger, sometimes with abundant pride, but the need is there to speak out, to comment, to seek truth\\". I have to disagree with that very last idea.Soul on Ice is divided into four parts. In part one, Letters from Prison, Cleaver talks a little bit about prison life and his previous experiences being a member of the Nation of Islam. At the end of part one there's a subchapter titled \\"initial reactions on the assassination of Malcolm X (Cleaver was ex-nation of islam but not yet a Panther when he wrote this book, I believe)\\". Of his pre-prison life, He writes, \\"I became a rapist. . . rape was an insurrectionary act (against white male domination or whatever)\\". Summing up his fall from grace, he writes, \\"After I returned to prison, I took a long look at myself and, for the first time in my life, admitted that I was wrong, that I had gone astray -- not so much from the white man's law as from being human, civilized\\". For the most part, though, he doesn't talk about his past \\"crimes\\".Part two, Blood of the Beast, is about the white race and it's heroes, and the heroes of the black race, Muhammad Ali for one. Cleaver suggests that a previous champ, the black Floyd Patterson, was the white man's hero, \\"There is no doubt that white America will accept a black champion, applaud and reward him, as long as there is no \\"white hope\\" in sight. But what white America demands in her black champions is a brilliant, powerful body and a dull, bestial mind--a tiger in the ring and a pussycat outside the ring\\".Part three, the aptly titled? 'Prelude to Love', is simply a short love letter to his Lawyer, and her reply. The love letter was so mushy and flowery even I had to pull back from the passage, thinking, 'come-on now'. Then Cleaver writes, \\"NOW TURN THE RECORD OVER AND PLAY THE OTHER SIDE\\" and proceeds to contradict every thing he's just written - a warning perhaps or a reality check? We love it when you keep it real. \\"I have tried to mislead you. I am not humble at all. I have no humility and I do not fear you in the least. If I pretend to be shy, if I appear to hesitate, it is only a sham to deceive. . . I had planned to run for President of the United States. My slogan? PUT A BLACK FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER. 400 years of docility, of being calm, cool and collected under stress would prove I was the man for the job. . . then came Watts!. . . Most Emphatically Yours, Eldridge Cleaver\\".The beginning of part four (titled White Woman, Black Man) is the best part of the book. It's basically a recounting of a speech given by an elderly black prisoner in the mess hall who sits down to eat with him and two brothers from the Nation. They refer to the old man as 'Lazarus' and 'the infidel' and 'the interloper' and 'the accused', as he tells his story, \\"we had him written down as an Uncle Tom - not that we had ever seen him buck dancing or licking the white man's boots, but we knew that black rebels his age do not walk the streets in America: they were either dead, in prison, or in exile in another country (I should note that the black man they are allegedly talking to is in prison with them)\\". The old man explains why he thinks black men want white woman. It sounds a bit like the story told in the movie \\"Jungle Fever\\". Cleaver expands upon this in the next sub-chapter of White Woman, Black Man, called 'the primeval Mitosis'. He calls black men 'Supermasculine menials' and white men, 'Omnipotent administrators'. Black women, 'self-reliant Amazons' and white women, 'Ultra Feminines' He says we're each striving to achieve a 'unitary sexual image' we're drawn towards each other, basically. It's quite interesting, but I don't think I believe all of it.The final subchapter of White Woman, Black Man, the very end, he dedicates, \\"to all black women, from all black men\\".The blueprint is laid out here in Soul on Ice. . . He calls on black women to remain faithful to black men while black men are being 'oppressed' by their need to sleep with white women. Soul on Ice is not so out of date. . . at Duke University recently the campuses was up in arms (about the patterns of abuse evident in the lacrosse player scandal) reiterating these very issues of oppression."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I read this in the fall of 1969 and was struck then by the essay dedicated to James Baldwin and sexual orientation, particularly by the term \\"ghost\\" in reference to male homosexuals. Cleaver's comments are acute and, in a certain sense, prescient and prophetic. This work is about much more than black frustration and rage (remember the violent riots of the 60's) and for Americans who are interested in the past, in order to comprehend better the present and anticipate the future, this is good reading, much better than the bestseller pulp out there."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Mr. Cleaver seems to have been a very conflicted man. In this book he discusses his predicaments in his life and how he feels he came about them. He discusses his imprisonment, his life thereof and how he ended up there. He also shares his ideas on everything from corrupt government to his feelings about his convicted rapings of white women. I don't always agree with some of his views but they are very powerful nonetheless. If you are at all interested in the writings of Mr. Cleaver and have not read this book, I highly suggest that you do. To better understand his mindset.

He was possessed of a rich, raw eloquence and the ability to manipulate profanity as a form of punctuation. Cleaver epitomized a form of thought leadership manifesting itself in this whirlwind period of Black radicalism which had wrestled ideological dominance back from the sanitized presentation of the centrist Black clergy and political class. Its orientation was towards a grassroots fusion of street knowledge with a rediscovered deep leftist political ideology. An ideology which had flourished in the Black community throughout the Harlem Renaissance only to be subverted by the Great Depression, Red Scare nativism and individual economic gain. This fusion, while possessed of the noble aim to draw urban youth in from exile to be politically engaged, was also lacking the long view which renews political ties with a progressive past in order to build upon prior knowledge instead of duplicating present effort.This latest reading finds my views matured in their acknowledgement of the profound sociopathy inherent in Cleaver's description of exploring rape as an insurrectionist act (\\"On Becoming\\"). Where once existed an intellectual curiosity to understand the psychology, I can now experience only the utmost antipathy as he outlines refining his technique by practicing on Black girls before crossing over to white. The brisk logic of his confession no longer strikes the necessary emotional tone which would convince me of his empathy for the victims. He seems certain of his rationale, but unable to discern any true fault in his decision which factors into the literary construct he builds throughout the text. In prison studies, he was able to master a militant discourse made routine by the cultural fluctuations of the time. This proficiency was juxtaposed against a narcissistic indulgence in his own opinion which was nearer to didacticism than dialogue often leading to conflict between his rhetoric and action. As one of the beneficiaries of a cult of personality in which the white counterculture emphasized a revolutionary narrative above the continuous resistance required to overturn an oppressive system, his writings would be widely circulated in the political magazine Ramparts garnering support for his release. This support was forthcoming even as his sole contribution to social transformation consisted of a series of strident political dispatches and dexterity in prison debate.In further inspecting his trajectory from fiery American iconoclast to conservative ideologue, his longstanding admiration of Malcolm throughout the text peaking in the essay \\"Initial Reactions on the Assassination of Malcolm X\\" returns to haunt him. Malcolm had rooted himself in the organizational hierarchy of the Nation of Islam only to be rebuked for expressing an opinion not conforming with the established guideline. His analysis that the program espoused by Elijah Muhammad was ineffective did not lead him to conclude that the American experience held any greater virtue by contrast. Cleaver adopted precisely the opposite position upon his return from exile surmising that because communism as it was practiced in Cuba, Algeria and North Vietnam was injurious to members of its population, capitalism must be the only socioeconomic construct capable of producing a just and democratic society. In a telling line from the text about coming to atheism in his early years in prison, Cleaver writes \\"Unsophisticated and not based on any philosophical rationale, our atheism was pragmatic.\\" The conclusions drawn by Cleaver from his expatriation fostered an inability to launch any deeper inquiry into the nature of American society beyond the dichotomy of America and its antithesis hindering any evolution from his nascent pragmatism. His later life reflected an unprincipled commitment to a multitude of complementary and contradictory causes. Thus he returns once to the arms of the Republican party, another time to evangelical Christianity, again to the Unification Church and later to his own personal synthesis philosophy, Chrislam, searching for a place to belong, but never elucidating a single point of focus as succinctly as Malcolm.Cleaver's most egregious criticism in \\"Soul On Ice\\" is reserved for James Baldwin (\\"Notes on a Native Son\\") whose work he alleges exhibits \\"...the most grueling, agonizing, total hatred of the blacks, particularly of himself, and the most shameful, fanatical, fawning, sycophantic love of the whites that one can find in the writings of any black American writer of note in our time.\\" Cleaver goes far beyond mere literary critique in order to advance a vicious personal vendetta founded not on any principled disagreement with those critical insights raised in the writings of Baldwin, but on his distaste for the homosexual lifestyle. Cleaver presents the following three points as evidence of Baldwin's racial disdain: the dismissal of Norman Mailer's premise in \\"The White Negro\\", an alleged snub of Aime Cesaire in the report from the Conference of Black Writers and Artists in Paris of 1956 and the censure of Baldwin's mentor Richard Wright in the opening essay of \\"Notes of a Native Son\\" which disassembled Bigger Thomas as a Negro stereotype. Cleaver fails to build his case against Baldwin on any intellectual basis using those three points and peppers the remainder of the essay with a variety of ad hominem attacks against Baldwin's Blackness, sexuality, masculinity and sincerity. Here we discover the young Cleaver in critical collapse for his arguments become incoherent. As with his sexual victimization of women, he seems unable to confront his deep seated issues of misogyny and masculinity choosing instead to assert his literary domination over the political direction of the Black community while framing the world to conform with his vacillating conviction.At the outset of this review, I had every intent eviscerate of any further need to study this text in earnest. When I first entered organizational activism, my admiration of Cleaver was once so great that I took his title of Minister of Information as my own and sought to exhibit as firm a grasp as Cleaver of the political micro and macrocosm occurring about me. My initial desire was to exorcise the part of me that once accepted the gorgeous rhetoric displayed here so uncritically. Upon further contemplation, I have come to understand that it is necessary to retain Cleaver as a picture of fanatical naivete which encircles both his participation and our own. The fluctuations which he exhibits should remind us to never locate the success of our radical endeavors so far outside of ourselves. Cleaver's vision of a successful socialist revolution was located in Algeria, Cuba, Korea and each of the other places he was able to experience in exile. When combined with a mostly self absorbed radicalization and the crushing defeat suffered by the Panthers at home, his appetite for resistance was left fatally injured upon his return. He now resembled a character from Soul On Ice described as an \\"Old Lazarus\\" (\\"The Allegory Of The Black Eunuchs\\") whom Cleaver and some fellow inmates confronted for not being dead and accused of lacking the dedication to offer his life to the struggle for Black liberation. Cleaver exhibits here another momentary lapse in the certainty of his masculinity as he reaches down to examine himself \\"afraid that my rod would be missing\\". The pseudo-mythology from the conversation with the \\"Old Lazarus\\" is then used to formulate the bizarre thesis of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\". This essay is presented in so a compelling fashion that such terms as \\"omnipotent administrator\\" would work their way into a broad array of Black Panther literature including the writings of Huey P. Newton. One of Cleaver's own narratives again returns to haunt him as a new generation found itself prepared to pummel him with the same question \\"Old Lazarus, why come you're not dead?\\" His answer appeared as a jumble of changes and permutations with no discernible objective to be found even in his writings and speeches taken together.After a fresh reading of \\"Soul On Ice\\", I am cautious to consider if I have judged Cleaver too harshly solely on the basis of this extreme transformation following exile. If the author of memoir and essay is to be judged by the philosophy he espouses in textual form, he must be bound for worse or better effect that those words form ideas remaining attached to his personal actions and are affected by each new transition. While Malcolm's activism gave him a wider lens through which to dissect and offer criticism to the internal socio-poltical mechanisms of America, Cleaver opened his eyes and seemed content to return to squinting through the eyelids once more. \\"Soul On Ice\\" appears now as a series of malformed ideas and incomplete analyses of a proto-revolutionary which is sufficient to get the wheels stirring in the minds of those who would study history to extract the lessons left behind, but not fruitful enough to sustain a growing consciousness or fortify one's personal philosophy. There are thinkers with a wider and more consistent body of work who can occupy that role with greater adequacy whose attractive language is not merely a vehicle for speculating upon perverse ideas."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Eldridge Cleaver wrote this book with an incredible sense of description of what being African,African-American is and means.

Various sections of the texts were underlined, but the book was purchased in a used condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"This is absolutely one of the the most overrated books of all time. Soul on Ice is a collection of outdated essays, along with a few love letters to his attorney written while Cleaver was serving time for being a serial rapist. Cleaver shows a poor understanding of the political workings of the elites, the reasons why many middle and working class whites are \\"racists\\", and virtually every other thing he opens his mouth on with one major exception. His observations about the disturbing mental and sexual pathologies that exist in the American black males mind towards white females are very insightful and realistic. At one point Cleaver actually says that his whole motivation for raping white women was that he considered it a \\"revolutionary act\\", it was his way of striking back at \\"white\\" society. He also goes into blacks pursuance of white females having more to do with black self hatred more than anything else. Although I think the general pathology black males have towards white females has evolved into something slightly different now, given the system now approves of and out and out promotes relationships between black males and white females, this book is still brilliant as far as delving into the psychological illness that exists within that dynamic. Other than that most of Soul on Ice is a complete lump of garbage. I can't fathom why this book is used in many University literature and sociology classes in America except to brainwash and indoctrinate white students with white guilt. I bet those classroom discussions are a real hoot!Cleaver was certainly the weak link in the Black Panther leadership, ultimately contributing more towards its destruction than helping it. He wasn't really a hardcore black nationalist or racial seperatist when you get down to it, he wasn't, which was common for that time, an overblown hardcore Marxist or leftist. What Cleaver was really all about was expanding his overblown ego more than anything else. He also later proved himself to be a complete flake going through stages as a black right wing conservative, a born again Christian, and I think he even got involved in some sort of bizarre eastern religion for a while. There are lots of reasons to admire the Black Panther Party, Cleaver is not one of them."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"If there is another book out there that more effectively excavates the subterranean foundation of American race relations in a mere 200 pages, I'm not aware of it. Barack Obama's presidency has demonstrated both how far we've come as a nation and how far we have yet to go. While it could be argued that visible, public evidence of racism seemed to steadily decrease prior to his nomination, we have now seen the miscreants smoked from their dens and they're running around, coughing and organizing, wiping the tears from their eyes and wondering what the heck happened. Read \\"Soul on Ice\\" and you'll understand much of what we see in the news today. While some of Cleaver's views are nave, outdated or just plain wrong; his sexism, idolization of Mao, demonization of homosexuality, and blanket condemnation of law enforcement and the military, for example; most of this book is as applicable to 2010 as it was to 1968. The book is not without troubling contradictions. Cleaver's letters to Beverly Axelrod capture the essence of new love's manic infatuation but the absence of any kind of empathy for the women he raped leaves us wondering. His enlightened embrace of Malcom X's acceptance of all races clashes with his surprisingly hateful attacks on gay people. The truth he utters, however, far outweighs the lies; and the light he sheds on the taboo dynamics of race in America is still needed today. The breadth of his knowledge and his masterful illumination of the interplay between historical, social, psychological and physical forces responsible for our daily on-the-ground realities makes \\"Soul on Ice\\" compelling. The fact that most of his assertions make sense but are rarely discussed makes it required reading.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"One must remember, this man is a convict, sent to prison for attempted murder.

In France he is suspected of the murder of a man that had an affair with his wife. In Algeria he ran a auto theft ring. Does this sounds like the re-incarnation of Malcolm X. Or does it sound like the a street thug. The fact that he became a crack addicted whore towards the end of his life renouncing the Black Panther attest to the fact that Eldridge Cleaver was a phoney only hustling the system to get out of jail.I read his book and essentially was bored.

Cleaver is an excellent writer that proves that you don't have a PhD. to be an intelligent, articulate, person. Cleaver has knowledge he gained from school of hard knocks and the school of life.

They celebrate these criminals and their crimes without shame. This book gives the reader a glimpse into the mind of someone who has gone through his own hell and gained some enlightenment and insight that a wise reader can glean. No one is calling Eldridge Cleaver a saint unlike the people mentioned above that some fools adore without question. Mr. Cleaver is wreckage, but among that wreckage there are gems of hope. He is not promoting rape or chauvinism, but is being more honest and open about how misguided he was in his life. It today's society a pathological liar who refuses to admit guilt is forgiven before a person who acknowledges his crimes.

Despite those that believe that this book pertains only to this era are obviously blind to the fact that many of the same issues then exist today. What makes it worse is that many people are unaware of it now, the gimmicks of media and political correctness have only mastered camouflaging it.

Some people have referred to this as an autobiography, though I don't remember the author calling it that. It is more a series of essays. It is pretty deep. To understand it at all you have to constantly remind yourself who is writing it, from where, and when.Cleaver has a lot of insight on several levels. He offers his thoughts on the society as a whole during his day and particularly on the origins and effects of classism and racism. He talks about forces at work and the effects of such diverse phenomena as hula hoops, Elvis Presley, and the Beatles. Reading it as Barack Obama was being elected President was particularly informative, because we could see the longer range effects of some of the directions Cleaver saw the country moving forty years ago. I wish he could have seen it happen. The author goes deep into his analysis of the role of sex in society and especially in racism and he uses some graphic, colloquial terms.Cleaver was the Minister of Information for the Black Panthers, and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.A Call to Arms!

The uncomfort it produces explains much of the reason why it will endure as a classic"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I first encountered this tall white haired man standing curbside along 5th street in San Bernardino awaiting the west bound city bus. His complexion was a grayed out brown and his skin looked warn yet he stood tall and erect and desplaying an air of confidence. I passed him day after day and had no ideal that the man awaiting the morning bus was Leroy Eldridge Cleaver. At some point it was pointed out to me that \\"he'd once been somebody important,\\" but that was obviously along time ago. I pondered stopping for quite sometime but decided against it. At this stage in my life, Cleaver was a relic from the distant past. A man whose importance I was faintly aware of yet had no ideal of how I should feel about him and his contribution to black history. Once I'd learned of his activities first as a writer and activist, my impression of him changed. I found him not only shameful but contemptible as well. I continued to pass him by casting clear and purposeful glances tinged with emotion. I wanted my contempt to be obvious. Day after day this continued and I began to wonder if he was ashamed of what he'd allowed himself to become. For the manner in which he'd allowed himself to be used in the war against his own people. I was equally angered by his duplicitous dealings with prison authorities, the FBI, CIA and ultimately right-wing Evangelical Christian zealots and the GOP.F--- that fool I thought, look at him now. All that scheming and scamming and he's catching the city bus? He'd once been a celebrated author, respected community activist and Presidential candidate. He was beloved and respected but he'd traded it all away and for what? As I glanced upon this broken down shell of a revolutionary I couldn't imagine the depth of his fall. He now occupied a place in society that was no better than my own. I made absolutely no since and so I picked up for the first time \\"Soul on Ice\\" and then I began to understand. The faults and frailties were always there plain as the snow white goatee on his aged face. I read line after line and kept running into ideals that seemed completely disingenuous for someone in his position. We are often damned by our own words and deep within the pages of Soul on Ice, the author opens up in a confessional manner that should have served as a warning for all those who allowed him into their inner-circle and placed trust in him.\\"I mislead...I pretend...I...sham to deceive...I sucker my fellow men in and seduce them of their trust. And...if it suits my advantage, I lower the boom-mercilously...\\" In this letter to attorney Beverley Axelrod, the man formerly known as Leroy E. Cleaver Jr., Eldridge X., and ultimately Eldrige Cleaver went on to say \\"my vanity is vast...my heart is that of a tyrant, my arm is the arm of the Executioner. It is only the failure of my plots that I fear...\\" I often wonder at what point did that decrepit old man feel the fear rise from his failures? I wonder what role did the arm of the Executioner play in the death of little Bobby Hutton? There were so many things to regreat in the life of Eldridge Cleaver none more so than the granting of his wish to be the \\"voice of doom,\\" for the black panther party. I suppose it fitting that the quisling should end his life disdained and forgotten. However there is something sad and disappointing with the story of Eldridge Cleaver and the disingenuous penning of Soul on Ice."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Controversial book written from prison. This is the 1968 paperback edition somewhat oversized and easy to read with larger type than a newer mass market edition would have."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"In this piece, Eldridge Cleaver writes about many times, experiences, and happenings during one of the most critical times in the 20th century. After reading this, I'm shocked it isn't given the respect it is surely due. He talks about various people, such as the contrast of styles between James Baldwin and Richard Wright, the assassination of Malcolm X and the aftermath it left from Folsom Prison(where he was serving time) as well as other places around the country, and an eye-opening examination between himself, two of his comrades, and another fellow prisoner, which was shocking and all too surreal to say the least. Like other books which has been previously written during that time, there is still major relevance for it in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Even though this was one of the most important and popular books of the 1960s, it is not discussed that much now, some thirty-five years after its initial publication. \\"Soul on Ice\\" is as much an allegorical masterpiece as it is a real description of black male (whom he refers to as Supermasculine Menials) attitudes towards prison-life, white racism (and white women in particular, who are here referred to as Ogres and the Ultrafeminines) and the Nation of Islam (Cleaver writes compellingly about his disassociation with the Nation, citing their racism--\\"The onus of teaching racial supremacy and hate, which is the white man's burden, is pretty hard to bear\\"). Cleaver's at-times amazing writing gives this book a peculiar power, and given this, it is easy to understand why the book was so popular in the late 1960s. For several reasons, though, it is easy to see why this book doesn't get as much attention as, say, James Baldwin's \\"The Fire Next Time\\" [1963]. The chapter on Baldwin in \\"Soul on Ice,\\" entitled \\"Notes on a Native Son\\" (a reference to one of Baldwin's early essays) is exceedingly homophobic, and other sections fairly hateful towards women (even though, in this regard, Cleaver is at times aware of his own misogyny--especially in his blushingly honest letters to one-time attorney Beverly Axelrod) and exceedingly macho. Many contemporary readers might not have the patience for this (especially given Baldwin's elevated status in the world of literature). Also, this book has lost some of its bite over the years because of excellent books written by participants in the Black Power Movement and the Black Panther Party. \\"Soul on Ice\\"--especially when compared with George Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" (1971), Huey P. Newton's \\"Revolutionary Suicide\\" (1973), Amiri Baraka (1984) and Angela Y. Davis' (1974) autobiographies, and Elaine Brown's \\"A Taste of Power\\" (1992)--lacks the political vision, accuracy and believability of these other books, but it should also be credited for setting some of the standards by which these books would later have to judge themselves against, especially in regard to prison life (though Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" is much more powerful in this regard). Nevertheless, \\"Soul on Ice\\" is a compelling read, and I agree with a statement that Ishmael Reed makes in the introduction that this book IS the 60s. If this memoir were a western, we could smell the sawdust on the floor."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Eldridge Cleaver writes his memoirs here, and much of the book seeks to justify his actions and sentiments. It is as if he knows that his actions have been looked down upon by America and he needs to tell us where he is coming from. I found it shocking, not only that he should admit to raping women, both white and black, but more so that he makes excuses for why he HAD to rape them. He also explains his veiws on the inferiority complex that has plagued the African American since slavery, and his motivation for violent response. These views, though, are exceedingly hard to sift out of the pontificatory run-on sentance that permeates this book. He will launch into the feelings of a black woman in this society, and while his point may be valid, his statement consists of two pages of metaphorical secondary clauses. But, for all of his circumlocution, Cleaver's points provide great insight not only into a black revolutionary, but a convict, a Muslim after the style of Malcom X, and the african american experience in general. In all, his thoughts are hauntingly true."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Soul on Ice, written by Eldrige Cleaver is a collection of essays (written during his 9 years in Folsom State Prison during the 1960's) in which Cleaver discovers his racial identity. \\"I knew I was black, but never really stopped to take stock of what i was involved in. I met life as an individual and took my chances.\\" Cleaver was sentenced 9 years for raping a white woman. Cleaver felt his crime was a way to \\"spit\\" on the white man's values and women. He lived his life only to benefit himself. After meeting with his attorney, he realizes the value of listening and absorbing what another human being has to say. \\"The price of hating other human beings is loving one's self less.\\" Cleaver, educating himself in prison, also writes \\"In prison those things held and denied from the prisoner become precisely what he wants most of all.\\"Cleaver becomes especially interested in the writings of Thomas Merton, particularly his excerpt on the \\"New York Black Ghetto: Harlem.\\" After many religious endeavors, Cleaver found himself most intrigued by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. Malcolm X appealed to the black convicts caught in the vicious prison paroll cycle, like himself. One aspect in which Cleaver felt most attracted to in Malcolm was that the society owed a debt to prisoners and not vice versa. Malcolm X did not \\"compromise truth to have favor with the white power structure.\\" The American tactic was to emmasculate the black leadership and to manipulate them. The unique black leader who would defy white power would ultimately end up dead, in prison, or forced out of the country. Classic illustrations of this policy are the careers of Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Dubois, and Paul Robeson. White America crushes the black leaders while inflating the images of Uncle Tom's (black on the surface, white on the inside)and celebrities. Power is taken out of political and economic context and plainly debased to the level of good sportsmanship. James Baldwin was an author who wrote \\"Native Son\\" and \\"White Negro.\\" Cleaver, inspired by Baldwin, felt that police brutatily was not caused by the hatred for the black man, but for social, economical, and political reasons. Blacks, having their freedom for approximately 100 years as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation, were still treated as \\"part of someone's invetory of assests.\\"After the most violent negro uprisings, the Burning of Watts, the white power structure pacifies the black community by appointing John Roseboro, an African American baseball player for the dodgers, to consultant for community relations. Cleaver also writes about the Vietnam War. Black soldiers are called upon to sacrafice their lives for freedom in Vietnam. In Watts they are killed because of their desire for freedom. Cleaver felt the black man should stay and die here for a better life.Cleaver's first imprisonment in 1954, for a drug charge, set the tone for his next 9 year term. Cleaver hung a poster of a white woman in his cell like the other prisoners. One of the guards came by and tore the poster down. The guard would only allow Cleaver to hang a picture of a black woman. Cleaver realizes that his attraction to the white women is not because of beauty or sexual appeal but because of their status and symbol. The white woman displays a symbol of freedom while the black woman is a symbol of slavery. \\"I will not be free until the day i can have a white woman in my bed and a white man minds his own business.\\"Although Cleaver's actions were not always moral nor did he go about things in a peaceful way, his fight was to allow the black race to revive their eradicated identity. From the moment the blacks were brought to this country from Africa, the white man imposed their culture and heritage upon them. Cleaver's quote, dealing with the white woman in bed, hits the nail on the head. He does not care for trivial freedoms and rights such as drinking from the same water fountain or riding at the front of the bus, he cares for the freedom where he can do what he wants, when he wants, without the white man looking over his shoulder. \\"One task that we have in the black community is a coupe de'etat against our present leadership, to strip them from that machinery that controls the community. So that new ideas and new people can percualate up, then we can have a new agenda.\\"I thorougly enjoyed this book because Cleaver moves from hate and violence towards an understanding of himself and humanity. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to gain a better understanding of the black struggle in the 1960's."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I've spent the last thirty-two years being reminded of the brutal honesty and truth of much of this classical work on race, sex, and poverty by Eldridge Cleaver. I was honestly shocked by some of the sexual/racial ideas it contains the first time I read it in 1968, and decided to try it again to see if my present understanding of and assumptions about America now render this work moot- or affirm it.Not surprisingly, as much as I'd like to confirm or refute this work, the jury still won't come in and remains out. You should read this book if you've thought deeply about the &quot;why&quot; of our race problem in America, our prison problem in America, or the psychology of gender.

It may even move up to four upon a second reading. It is a harsh book that is difficult to accept at times. The homophobia and sexism can be usettling. Of course, one must understand where Cleaver was coming from. The rascism is easier to understand in that light. And it should be noted that a lot of the anger and bitterness began to wane in later years. Cleaver seems to have undergone a spirtual transformation similar to that of Malcom X. This remains an important book from the 60s. It is critical for Americans both black and white (and yellow, brown and red as well) to read books like this to try to understand the horrors that have underscored this nations evolution. Cleaver, overcame tremendous obstacles to achieve this degree of success."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"The FBI could not have created a better person to sow the seeds of destruction for the Black Panther Party than Eldridge Cleaver.The treatise from jail - before Cleaver became a BPP member - catapulted him into the 1960s revolutionary/black power movements. But his so-called consciousness was never for the greater good of the whole.Cleaver failed to gain control of the BPP during his time in exile - and when he was essentially booted out of Cuba - by making what he felt was a left-turn by placing the organization into solidarity with nation's \\"at war\\" with U.S. imperialism. The attempted coup was foiled when Huey Newton kicked Cleaver and his followers out of the party. But Cleaver sounded so good when barking out orders thousands of miles away!The split began the fragmentation of the party. I contend it was the cornerstone development for the U.S. government to manipulate as a means to destroy the party from within. And I still have questions concerning the police shoot-out where Cleaver emerged basically unscathed, but his comrade in arms was shot dead.Cleaver - a convicted rapist - was legendary for his physical/verbal abuse of women. Again, the sickening spector of control through intimidation.It should have come as no surprise to anyone that years later Cleaver made an abrupt political turn into a right-extremist camp. He feared not being the head of the game, and with no place to turn on the left, Cleaver scampered to the right in hopes his new friends would pick him as captain of the team.As a slice of American History, Soul On Ice remains an essential read. But Cleaver's ideology cut severe wounds in the BPP, caused death and dissension, while arguably driving Newton into consolidating a national party into one Oakland chapter.Cleaver a revolutionary? Hardly. An egotistical coward? Yes."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I have seldom read anything as offensive as Cleaver's attempt to pass off rape as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; act. By his own admission he is a serial rapist,and if he'd served time for all of them would never even have been out of jail in the sixties in the first place! While the other content of this book isn't totally worthless, I found that Cleaver came off as a typical criminal, filled with reasons why SOMEBODY ELSE was responsible for everything he did wrong. The first step to self respect is to accept responsibility for one's actions, Cleaver has not done that, nor does he give the slightest indication that he ever will. If you want to read an autobiography of a panther read Huey Newton's, because with Newton, instead of self pity, there was substance and intelligence behind the anger."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Mr. Cleaver wrote a semiautobiography about how society sets itself up along racial and gender lines. Raping women is reprehensible and evil and it doesn't help solve the racial/gender problem. It excabates it. Challenging the racist/sexist society by making alliances with people whom he considered to be his enemies will solve most of the problem. He should have shown love for his fellow man/woman. Didn't Jesus tell people to love your enemies, not hating and violating them? Later on in life, his views have changed for the better."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Outside the generally detached and often cynical reviews that are so typical of those who have little to no understanding of the inordinate complexities commonly born by blacks of the period, do I humbly submit this evaluation. I believe that if one is open enough to the notion of understanding life from an entirely foreign perspective, then one might also be able to appreciate the indefatigable efforts on an impossible journey to sainthood by this book's author. In my mind, Eldridge Cleaver most adequately personified the rebirth of the black conscious alpha male. His writing in this book was the perfect blend of a sort of primal rage coupled with the suave literary sophistication of the most accomplished poet. Soul on Ice is essentially an allegorical retelling of some of the most profound experiences in the life of a man who's awakening in a world drenched in terrorism (of the European variety) was anything but kind.As a black man in his thirties, I am always impressed and then ultimately relieved to see how men of my own ethnicity have torn through the societal constraints (real or imagined) seeking to right the wrongs of their lives that the whole of the community can begin to heal, thus being at peace with itself. Many can learn from this book -including whites- but only if the goal is not to seek justification for condemning the overall purpose of the black panthers harping on the imperfections and past sins of many of it's heralds. Believe me, there are quite a few reviews written about this book that give precisely that impression, only to concede begrudgingly of course, that these black men & women were indeed human after all.For Eldridge Cleaver, the book was a catharsis, in which he admits to the unsavory truth of his involvement in rape - a nearly unforgivable crime in my opinion. Nevertheless, one soon discovers that the author is not beyond the reach of redemption thankfully. His prose and allegory give strong testament to his skill with a pen. The back-n-forth love letters with his one-time lawyer Beverly Axlerod, are endearing and is sure to make every women blush. His unflinching analysis on the social politics of the day is defiant but also lucid; to suggest that the U.S. government (p. 153, paragraph 2), was sending 16% of blacks to Vietnam in order to butcher peasants who like themselves, were fighting for the right to self-determination - not so much to die - but that hate for blacks would metastasize across the rice fields of Asia like a cancer is jarring, but not entirely without merit. Lastly his appeal to black women was a call for reconciliation with the brothas, a call that has mostly gone unanswered even today sadly. Cleaver was no angel, nor should he have been as the world in which he lived, was no place for the faint of heart. And he was not trying to explain away, much less mitigate the severity of his crimes which quite frankly, pale in comparison to the force of the upswing in his life. I don't think his goal was to assuage white people or anyone else for that matter. Instead, he set out to discover himself and the world around him. In Ismael Reed's preface in this extraordinary book, is a most fitting description of Cleaver, given first by Amiri Baraka: Bohemian Anarchist!(Page 34, Paragraph 3)That is why I started to write. To save myself. I realized that no one could save me but myself. The prison authorities were both uninterested and unable to help me. I had to seek out the truth and unravel the snarled web of my motivations...It may be that I can harm myself by speaking frankly and directly, but I do not care about that at all. Of course I want to get out of prison, badly, but I shall get out some day. I am more concerned with what I am going to be after I get out. I know that by following the course which I have charted I will find my salvation.

I'd be weaker and less certain of where I want to go, what I want to do, and how to go about it."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"Whew! The how-to shows the success of a writer who bootstrapped his way to the top a best-sellers list, deftly using his experiences and the several mentors who recognized his brainpower. The life path Eldridge Cleaver spent in getting to this writing peak is the not-to part. Much of the book is the kind of rant one might hear on Sunday morning TV, often with a socialist twist. But the ranting is quite clearly written, and sometimes just when the reader is about to say, \\"Oh, for pete's sake,\\" the author nails a concluding sentence right on the mark, and not necessarily where the reader thought the thread was heading. Such an unexpected thought hits in the middle of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\" chapter: Cleaver concludes that, \\"liberality is, in fact, charity.\\" How true. To do the thought fairly, one has to read the chapter up to that point, of course.Then comes the chapter, \\"The Allegory of the Black Eunuchs.\\" If Cleaver could write like this for a whole book in a row, he would be a best-seller without resorting to polemics. Polemics, unfortunately, was the whole point. The disjointedness and flights of fury and semi-sense that showed up sporadically in the first part of the book suddenly funnel into a well-told story, almost in the style of the biblical tale of Job. Job's \\"friends\\" were more interesting (and speak better) than Cleaver's wooden pen pals, but \\"Lazarus,\\" or \\"Infidel\\" is arguably a much more complex person than old Job. He thus makes several key points using a character who changes page by page, chameleon-like. Here is a master story teller.Whatever the \\"yeas\\" and \\"boos\\" for most of the earlier book, the last chapter stands out as a worthy piece of writing. The reader realizes at this late point that the whole book was leading up to this ending, an apology and a love letter from all black men to all black women, from souls on centuries of ice. This was wonderfully done, and all the earlier diatribes and nonsense look like mere practice writing for the finale. That chapter is worth re-reading, as well as \\"Eunuchs.\\"."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"CLEAVER CLEARLY STATES HE PRACTICE RAPING LIGHT SKINNED BLACK WOMEN (BECAUSE HE THOUGHT DARK SKIN WOMEN WERE INFERIOR) UNTIL HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON WHITE WOMEN.

Cleaver spends a great deal of time writing on the injustices Black people face in America, and how even though he is what society wants him to be, it is his fault that he allow society to be right. He pledges to take steps towards change and to become a benefit to society.I know that a lot of people think that they know about the civil rights movement and the effects it had on the Black race, but they don't. This story of a man who, at the time, had been locked up for more than half of his life, is the story of all real Black people. I think that sometimes Black people do things and think that it is their nature, which is how stereotypes brew. Cleaver shows us that it is history and hatred that have made us a collective in an usual individual world. We do think for ourselves, yet a racist society continues to force us to travel down a road that we have not set for ourselves, and that he has fell into racist America's trap. He has become the stereotype: (supposedly) uneducated, a prisoner, and a victim of \\"The Ogre\\" (the white woman)."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I'm on the hedge with my opinion of him as a person.

While reading this memoir, I was engaged, repulsed, seeking further understanding, and more. So many emotions were brought forth. Eldridge Cleaver provided us with insight to the soul of a complex man during a time of turmoil. While I may not have agreed with some of the things he had to share, I appreciated being able to look at social issues during that time period from his perspective. It's harsh, it's gripping, and it was his reality. Cleaver conveyed his feelings and views of society with such clarity and emotion that it certainly allows you to step inside of his mind and see from his perspective how it was to be black at that time...whether you agree or not, it certainly provokes reflection."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice.","review":"I AM A YOUNG MEXICAN, AND I AM AMAZED THAT AFTER 30+ YEARS THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE!

Eldridge Cleaver is just another criminal rapist who thinks he got smart in Prison. This book is so bad! It's supposed to be iconoclastic and insightful but it's really just a showcase for the extensive lexicon that Cleaver has. Serously, though, this book reads like that In Living Color skit where those dudes pontificate while they misoginate because they're ingrates and who cares what they ate! So if you are in for hearing how the Man has repressed his human brother for 400 years with a liberal sprinkling of .50 cent words then this book is for you.

I could accept his psychoanalytic speculative ventures about Booker T. Washington's personal biography, but as the major underpining of a judgement against Washington that he is intent on making, it is very thin. Especially when there are no specific references from Up From Slavery, or testimony by students, acquaintances etc. to support such theorizing.

It covers most common pathologies instead of very rare academic cases.It is a practical book with very good pictures. There are a lot of good quality pictures to help to recognize cases.

If you are a Texan it is a must. If you love photography and the ability of the camera to probe the lives of others and in return tell us more about ourselves you won't want to miss this.Under the sensitive vision and the caring heart of Michael O'Brien the rich, the famous and the common folk come together in this extraordinary look at Texans and indeed all of humanity. Though his photographs span a wide cross section of various ethnic and socio-economic groups, Michael shows us that we have more in common with each other than we realize. We are more alike as humans than we are different.He is an artist as well as an anthropologist who happens to use a camera. We are so much the better for his work."},{"Title":"The Face of Texas: Portraits of Texans","review":"The Face of Texas stands out within the array of Texas books that have been published in recent years. The photographs by Michael O'Brien--portraits of Texans, both famous and ordinary--are stunning; and the subjects themselves, from celebrities like Earl Campbell and Lady Bird Johnson to regular folks like painter Ran Horn of Van Horn, TX, the self-described &quot;Van Gogh of Van Horn,&quot; and Ila Johnston, the beloved, retired Spur, TX high school teacher who just renewed her Texas driver's license at the age of 97, are fascinating individuals. The pictures in The Face of Texas are accompanied by well-written, plainspoken stories by Elizabeth O'Brien about each subject. The text and photographs combine to create a substantial picture of each person that transcends the visual; both writer and photographer treat their subjects with warmth and respect. The book is not meant to be a definitive portrait of Texas; as photographer Michael O'Brien says in his introduction, it is simply a collection of his favorite portraits taken over the years on assignment, primarily for various magazines. Bravo for O'Brien--what a phenomenal photographic journey!"},{"Title":"The Face of Texas: Portraits of Texans","review":"This is a beautifully photographed coffee table book picturing Texans from small towns and large cities all over the state. Photographed by Michael O'Brien, a photographer with a background in photojournalism, the book spotlights Texans as diverse as Willie Nelson, Lady Bird Johnson, ZZ Top, small town chearleaders, ranch families, and Laura and George Bush. Michael's wife, Elizabeth O'Brien, a writer, captures each person in a sensitive, personal interview which describes each Texan in that moment in time. The Face of Texas would be a wonderful gift for anyone who lives in the state of Texas or has friends or relatives there, or for anyone who appreciates beautiful photography or Americana."},{"Title":"The Face of Texas: Portraits of Texans","review":"This is a beautiful and expressive collection of portraits of a wide variety of Texans, from the famous to unknown, real Texans.

I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in photography or Texas."},{"Title":"The Face of Texas: Portraits of Texans","review":"The Face of Texas is a beautiful book which I believe any Texan, particularly those living away from Texas and homesick for the Lonestar state would be proud to own. Micheal O'Brian's photographs portray famous Texans (Lady Bird, Pres. and Laura Bush, George Strait) along with little-known individuals from varied ethnic backgrounds. O'Brian manages to capture the essence of his subjects in a sympathetic and very artistic manner. I loved the portrait of Destiny's Child, shot in black and white, with a luminosity shining from their beautiful faces. Who wouldn't be stopped dead by the photograph of 2 members of ZZ Top in leopard print tuxedos, cowboy hats and shades flanking the third guy sitting in a barber chair, chin covered with shaving cream. The text by Elizabeth O'Brian brings the photographs to life. In a page of text on each subject, she manages to combine cogent biographical information along with funny tidbits of background. \\"...neither Gibbons nor Hill (from ZZ Top)has had a close encounter with scissors since 1979.\\"I love this book and it will be top on my list for birthday presents."},{"Title":"The Face of Texas: Portraits of Texans","review":"This was purchased to be a gift.

I can find no way to contact the seller to inquire about exchanging it for another book WITH the cover. I think that if this switch was intended, it is fraudulent advertising since the description picture showed the book with the jacket and the words \\"The Face of Texas Michael O'Brien\\" across the front.

It's impossible in one book to encapsulate the entire state of Texas but I think Michael did a great job showing us the faces of people who have power, passion and purpose. The photography is just what I would expect. Very well executed, with a personal style that instantly says, Michael O'Brien, combined with a sensitivity to people that in turn makes each image very accessible.From a production viewpoint the images are very well reproduced and well integrated with the writing.The book is on my office shelf and I refer to it often when I want to reset my sense of seeing after a long day of work.

Almost all the photos have previously run in Texas magazines, primarily Texas Monthly, and most of them were taken from 1990 through 1997. These two important facts have not been publicized by the publisher or the author/photographer team in their press interviews,releases,etc. People expecting fresh photos done expressly for this book will be disappointed like me.To make matters worse, it is a poor reflection of the real Texas. Although Texas is about 50% non-white, (Afro- and Latino- Americans) you would think Texas is an almost lily-white state based upon this book. Of the 160 photos, only 10 portray the non-white residents of the Lone Star State. Of the approx. 225 persons portrayed, only about a dozen or so are non-white. This is a glaring omission! It's as if the writer and photographer included them for local &quot;color&quot;, pun not intended. There are much better Texas photo/coffee table books available than this one.

My observation is this, most of the stories which were not published anywhere, were either rejected, or known to be of lesser quality and thus not submitted. I have to say that almost every story which was published in an actual journal was well written and enjoyable, but the others, were generally not up to snuff. I make exception for the final short story \\"A Grandmother's Tale\\" which was charming and brief, and I think would have been accepted at a publication which would publish a story that short."},{"Title":"Sinister Shorts","review":"I thought this book was very unusual in the writings than the previous books I have read of theirs.

Stephen King of course has proven himself with his short fiction often equalling his novels in quality. Ray Bradbury made himself a master of the form rising out of 40's pulp fiction. There are classic short story writers like O'Henry, Bret Harte, Damon Runyon who also specialized in the form and those like Mark Twain and Arthur Conan Doyle who shone with both long and short forms.Just as not every author is adept with the short form, not every reader will enjoy it. However, those who do enjoy short stories will love this collection of stories, several from Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, some from internet sites, and some written especially for this volume.A collection must be well organized and some weaker stories must be interspersed with the standout ones. The sisters have done this in a superb fashion. Individuals will have their favorites and also ones which will be counted as minor. My personal favorites are \\"The Master's Hand\\", the Gertrude Stein one, \\"The Furnace Man\\", \\"The Young Lady\\", and \\"To Still The Beating Of Her Heart\\".

Each tale is fun to follow especially when the audience learns of the crime. In addition the award winning The Long Walk is also part of the compilation.

That's why, when done well, they're so satisfying. Think of \\"The Gift\\" by O. Henry -- what a classic!The stories in this book accomplish this with mixed success, in my opinion. The first three zinged right along, and were real grabbers, but things really ground to a halt with \\"Gertrude Stein Solves a Mystery\\". Obviously written to emulate Stein's style, it was stilted, predictable, and pretty boring.From that point on, it was pretty much a grab bag: some were pretty good, some okay, some were a waste of time.It was a treat to see a couple of O'Shaugnessy's regulars show up: Nina Reilly and Paul van Waggoner.

When I saw the title of Perri O'Shaughnessy's new book I thought, \\"Aha, Nina Reilly has a case involving tennis pros!\\" But, no. SINISTER SHORTS is actually a collection of \\"short\\" stories written by sisters Pam and Mary O'Shaughnessy, who between them have penned eleven legal thrillers that always leave readers eagerly wanting more. Fans will not be disappointed with this diversion from their norm.While SINISTER SHORTS is not the series we're familiar with, it does contain all of the elements that go into making that series so popular. And, in addition to the usual fast-paced, no-nonsense writing, there are components that reveal a darker side of the usually sanguine duo that will resonate with readers who enjoy a bit of the macabre with their mystery. The introduction challenges readers to try to figure out which sister wrote which story. But no matter. These nineteen stories are so engrossing you will soon forget the writers and become immersed in the characters and action. Which is as it should be.Over the years I had forgotten how satisfying reading short stories can be: an entire plot, with well-defined characters, a theme, suspense, irony, humor and resolution, all wrapped up in ten exciting pages. In SINISTER SHORTS there is the almost poetic \\"Sandstorm,\\" which unexpectedly reveals how easy it is to follow a disturbed stream of consciousness. \\"The Couple Behind the Curtain\\" offers a frank exchange between husband and wife that is both haunting and shocking. To keep you guessing, there's the paranoid lady of \\"Lemons\\" --- and we find out she has a lot to be paranoid about. Look at the time, it's way past my bedtime but, oh, just one more!!!The plot twists will keep you from becoming too confident of your detecting skills.

His bail was set at five times that of a cell-mate charged with armed robbery. Though a peaceful Christian man, he was paraded to his Court appearances from the jail shackled between hardened criminals for the benefit of press photographers. Now, convicted of CONSPIRACY, for the mere authorship of a book, he has been stripped of all rights as an American citizen. He may not own a firearm; may not vote or hold public office; may not obtain a passport; and must travel by permit only!* Nord Davis is a Korean War Veteran; the holder of 4 Navy campaign ribbons; and an Honorable Discharge.

Some of the sequences are so strange you think it all must be a dream as when a female thief breaks into the narrators hotel room only to be invited to stay the night. Other meetings are full of a very engaging and speculation rich kind of conversation as in the meeting with the Hugo and Pessoa quoting eastern intellectual. If it is all a dream it is a very literate one. The last meeting takes place in the old Portugese port of Goa and there the narrator meets a lovely charming stranger to share a dinner with as he waits for a chance to spy a glimpse of his old searched for friend. But as they eat the narrator relates his &quot;story' in a way that makes one suspect there was no one and nothing to search for after all(modern fiction indeed it is). But you are left after putting this book down with a feeling of having had several intriguing conversations and having met a lovely woman. Not at all a bad feeling. An insomnia well spent."},{"Title":"Indian Nocturne (New Directions)","review":"The first time I read this book was when I also read for the first time Carrere's The Mustache - a fortunate accident as they both pose a question of identity. Tabucchi sets his tale in India in the form of an unnamed man trying to find a man, perhaps his brother, who has been missing for about a year. His search takes him to a brothel in Bombay, to a Bombay hospital, to the Theosophical Society in Madras, to the library of a religious order in Goa ... Along the way he encounters a dying Jain, a deformed saddhu/fortune teller, a former Philadelphia mailman, a photographer of human misery ... An interesting story, well written, with an unexpected ending. A movella well worth your time."},{"Title":"Indian Nocturne (New Directions)","review":"Indian Nocturne is such an easy read. So well written. When I had heard of the Author's passing, I wanted to experience his writing style & so, purchased this book. So glad I did!! Looking forward to my next purchase..."},{"Title":"Indian Nocturne (New Directions)","review":"A narrator's novella with precise images, active imagination, and a subtly suggested plot should enthrall any reader. Tabucchi is probably Italy's best living writer. This tale, made up of dreamy yet clear episodes, in a seach of ambiguous meaning brings out all the narrator's ambivalencies. An understanding of India emerges and most important portraits of men and one woman."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"George MacDonald Frazer's eighth book in the historical adventure series on a British cowardly lion called Flashman is \\"Flashman and the Dragon.\\" The book is colorful,sensual and exciting. This novel is also an enjoyable way to ingest Chinese and British history.The Plot: It is 1860 and Colonel Harry Flashman is in China. Flashy sleeps with a fetching preacher's wife. She entices him to run opium up the Yellow River but he is actually transporting guns for the Taiping rebels. Many Christian missionaries supported the Taipings who claimed to be Christians. The Taipings were fighting against the Manchu Dynasty which was corrupt and cruel. Author Frazer claims that over 30 million people died in the Chinese conflicts of the Victorian era. Famous people appear in these pages including Lord Elgin, George Bernard Shaw and the Orchid Lady who led the Boxer rebellion.The enchanted reader will see Flashman captured and tortured by the Manchus; be usued as a sexual slave by the evil Orchid Queen concubine to the Emperor of China and enjoy Flashy's lush descriptions of nineteenth century life. The most harrowing part of the novel occurs near the end of the story when the Summer Palace of the Chinese Emperor is burned to the ground by British and allied troops in retaliation for the perfidy of the Emperor. Flashy has a brief affair with a Chinese Amazon pirate woman who is said to stand six foot six inches. Frazer's sex scenes are alway brief with the author loving to use a slang word for the female breast.!. Profanity and British slang are utilized to add realism to the wild tale. The story is not for the squeamish as there are sanguinary scenes of terrible Chinese tortures and massacres. China was a scary place to live in during time sequence covered in this Flashman novel.Once a reader becomes addiction to the Flashman novels it is almost certain the entire series will be read!Once you"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Our intrepid hero, Harry Flashman, is back for volume eight of the Flashman Papers, a narrative of the life and times of one of the most ne'er-do-well wastrels to ever grace the pages of a published autobiography.The first five Flashman novels were presented in chronological order. This \\"packet\\", like its two immediate predecessors, acts to fill in a previous \\"gap\\" in the Flashman timeline. From a chronological standpoint, the adventures of this novel immediately follow those contained in Flashman and the Great Game, wherein we left Flashman in the wake of heroic deeds committed in the course of quelling the great Indian Mutiny. After a brief stint in British occupied Hong Kong, Harry believes himself to be on the verge of a return to merry old England and the bosom of his lovely wife Elspeth, only to be drafted into further military service as an intelligence officer in the service of a dangerous diplomatic adventure.As in the previous Flashman novels, our Harry is revealed as the premier coward and opportunist of his era; faults which he quite willingly admits and even boasts of. Much as a prior day Forrest Gump, he has a way of finding himself among the most powerful and famous personages of his era, as he takes part in the great events of the period, in this case, first hand experience in the Taiping Rebellion and Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, including an audience with the Chinese Emperor.Aside from uproarious fun and games, the Flashman series is set against historical events and actually serves as an educational experience. On to volume nine of the Flashman Papers."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"The history of China and the country's interaction with the European Great Powers may not be taught at school (particularly not in my native Germany) but knowing about it at least in a rudimentary way becomes important in the age of globalization. Otherwise it might be difficult to understand China's fierce nationalism and effort to eradicate the unequal treaties of the 19th century and their consequences. Flashman and the Dragon gives an entertaining introduction to the motivations and actions of both sides in the two Opium Wars. Explicit descriptions of Flashman's sexual encounters, of horrible tortures (one wishes that they were not based on contemporary eyewitness reports) and violent action turn this history lesson into a gripping adventure novel. But after reading it I also understood why every once and so often art treasures from the looted and burnt Summer Palace in Beijing turn up at auction n London and Paris and are repatriated by Chinese art collectors or the government. Again, the book is fun to read and full of interesting historical information!"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"I read in a Stars and Stripes article that former President Bush(the younger) read some of these books, so I was curious about them. I like the stories but coming from a woman's perspective, I'd like to kick Flashman in the @#$#@. He is as bad as the introductions to the stories say he is. The historical settings of the stories are great especially if you have a person who hates history, although they would learn some very bad habbits from this cad Flashman. I would suggest everyone read at least one out of the series, for a quick book that will cause a lot of \\"are you kidding me?s\\" and \\"I can't believe this guy!\\" Try it you'll like it. If you are a critic there are probably a hundred and one things to pick apart, but if you just want a quick humorous read, truly consider the Flashman series."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",R,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",N,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,q)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(S,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-8765b531"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/5.md","filePath":"people/5.md"}'),E={name:"people/5.md"},W=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{O as __pageData,W as default};
