With meticulous research and drawing on U.S., German, French, British and some Soviet sources, the author admirably fills in this void by piecing together an account of Nazi resistance. He focuses on the Nazi Werwolf diversionary groups, part of the SS-Police establishment and closely linked to the Hitler Youth corps. These groups were established to engage in partisan resistance to the invading Allied forces.Biddiscombe describes their organizational, ideological and social character and follows their development inside a Nazi bureaucracy beset with turf wars and personality clashes. Noting that \\"the Nazi Reich was hardly a unified totalitarian state, but rather a feudal patchwork of rival fiefs,\\" he adds a geographic element to his analysis, highlighting the regional differences among the werewolf groups within Germany and the differences found in groups outside German territory.The Nazi resistance or partisan movement began in 1944 as the Allies began to dislodge the German army from occupied territories. Biddiscombe draws on detailed archival materials to describe how support for a resistance movement came from a variety of competing interests within the Third Reich. First established as part of Himmler's SS, then coupled with the Hitler Youth, the Werwolf groups were subsequently dominated by the military who saw their usefulness in slowing the Allied advance. In analyzing the active role of the Werwolf in partisan resistance, the author presents many detailed descriptions of attacks on Allied soldiers and collaborating Germans (sniping, decapitation wires, assassinations, poisonings, etc.) and sabotage actions. He documents a few cases involving children as young as 9 or 10 years old (p.62 and p.64) and many conducted by teenagers (pp.59 ff.).At times the author's analysis distinguishes between Werwolf attacks and partisan resistance that occurred before and after the German surrender, but generally this distinction remains in the background. This distinction deserves greater prominence. While some fighting has continued after the formal end to many wars, most stops soon thereafter. (Fighting continued only briefly in Texas after Lee's surrender and President Johnson?s declaration that the civil war was over.) Continued and vigorous post-surrender partisan activity in Germany would have revealed a significant residual pro-Nazi German sentiment and resulted in a much more difficult occupation.Biddiscombe at one point characterizes post-surrender resistance as \\"minor\\" (p.275). He labels post-war Werwolfs as \\"desperadoes\\" (p.151) and describes them as fanatics living in forest huts (p.80). He also cites U.S. Army intelligence that characterized partisans as \\"nomad bands\\" (p.197), judged them as less serious threats than the attacks by foreign slave laborers (p.152) and considered their sabotage and subversive activities to be insignificant (p. 115). Finally, he notes that: \\"the Americans and British concluded, even in the summer of 1945, that, as a nationwide network, the original Werwolf was irrevocably destroyed, and that it no longer posed a threat to the occupation.\\" (p.51)It would appear that the defense of home and family from outside invaders united large, disparate groups of Germans, while post-war partisan actions only attracted relatively few fanatics and/or thugs. A plan to mount post-war resistance, the Axmann Plan, never worked. In tallying up the Allied soldiers killed by partisan activities after the surrender, this reader found fewer than several dozen. It appears that when the war was over, so was the most of the resistance.Bidiscombe's book on German resistance and the Allied occupation has received some notice by people searching for historical parallels to the current US military occupation of Iraq. Hitler and Saddam Husein as personifications of evil make such comparisons seductive. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor Rice evoked this theme in their 25 August 2003 speeches before the 104th National Convention of the VFW. While one hopes that our national leaders bring an historical perspective to their actions, it appears that they have chosen to read Biddiscombe's book, not to learn from history, but to manipulate it for their own ends. Biddiscombe's book should, however, cause one to reflect on the current US situation in Iraq.First, General Eisenhower and his staff devoted considerable effort during the war to developing a post-war occupation strategy, not all of it consistent with international law. (pp. 252-254) Second, the occupation of Germany was a direct result of German military aggression and followed a formal surrender by German authorities. Germans knew that Germany had started the war. Third, the successful occupation of Germany occurred after it was entirely surrounded by hostile forces. There were no open borders with countries opposing the Allied occupation, unlike Iraq, which borders Iran and Syria. Fourth, the Nazi Party?s extermination of the Jews left only Protestants and Catholics, two Christian sects that hadn?t been at war in Germany for over 200 years. The ethnic (Kurds and Iraqis) and religious (Sunni and Shiite) tensions in Iraq continued to erupt throughout the twentieth century. Finally, the partisan resistance to Allied occupation quickly faded at the end of the war. Continued Iraqi resistance quite likely points, in part, to simmering ethnic and religious tensions.These historical differences show the magnitude of the problems facing the current U.S. military occupation of Iraq.If nation building by military force is now an accepted tenet of U.S. foreign policy, this book should provide valuable historical background for the U.S. officer corps and the enlisted personnel called upon to implement that policy. It would also be useful for citizens who wish to understand better some of on-the-ground issues that would be faced by their military occupation forces."},{"Title":"The Royal and the Runaway Bride (Silhouette Desire Ser.: Dynasties: The Connellys)","review":"There was absolutely nothing new to this book.

If none of that sounds new to you, the problem isn't you. But that doesn't mean the advice isn't sound. It is. Author Brian Sullivan, a motivational speaker, has packaged old guidance in a new wrapper that he calls the \\"Precise Selling Formula.\\" He says nothing that is outright wrong and much that is outright right. We think his elementary but helpful book (and its accompanying CD) will be most useful to inexperienced salespeople who lack self-confidence, and who may need exhortation and reassurance. The author's earthy anecdotes, Kansas City optimism and self-deprecating but enthusiastic tone may be just what novice salespeople crave after a day in the trenches."},{"Title":"20 Days to the Top: How the PRECISE Selling Formula Will Make You Your Company's Top Sales Performer in Twenty Days or Less","review":"This book has a ton of applicable information and a proven strategy that can put into play starting tomorrow.I have read a large majority of the sales books on the market, and until reading this book, I would have considered SPIN Selling to be the best material available.

Refreshingly, Brian Sullivan offers a proven, duplicatable formula based on learning what the customer really wants, and giving it to them in an ethical way they find hard to resist. One problem with most sales books and training is that the student has no way to easily remember and implement what they've learned, so the initial enthusiasm quickly wears off and sales people resort to their old way of doing things.

Being out of print, it was difficult to locate. But I finally found a copy at a local library. It was worth searching.Paths of Glory was written by Humphrey Cobb and first published in 1935. Cobb, who had served in the Canadian Army during the First World War, wrote this novel as an anti-war statement. In my opinion, it's one of the best. Cobb shows an unpositive view of war. There are no heroes. Not even Regiment Commander Colonel Dax is the courageous man he was in Kubrick's film. He doesn't even have that big of a part.French General Assolant is given orders by his Army Commander (Whose name is not revealed) to take an important German position called the Pimple. To take the \\"Pimple\\", Assolant calls the 181st regiment, which was supposed to be placed on leave.We see the attack beforehand from the eyes of those on the battlefield. A patrol is sent out, where one of the men gets killed by the drunken commander due to a careless accident. The incident is covered up, but would play a part later.The next morning, the eargely anticipated attack on the Pimple is launched. It proves however to be impossible. The 181st is made up of a combination of battle weary vets and fresh new recruits to compensate for losses. Thus, casualties are high. The bombardment from artillery and machine guns also is so difficult to go through that many soldiers never even leave the trenches. Believing the men are mutinying, Assolant orders the battery commander to fire on the men. Fortunately, in what may be the only sensible act in the novel, the man refuses without a written order. Assolant then orders a court martial to preserved his dignity at the expense of others.Four men are selected: One from each of the attacking sections. One section refuses to send a man but the other three select. The men are sent in front of a court-martial with a well-trained lawyer at their side. But it is really more of a Kangaroo Court. This is because the Indictment against the convicted is not read (\\"It basically states the accused are convicted of cowardice\\"), no Stenographic notes are kept of the trial, thus denying the convicted the possibility of a pardon, and the defense is not allowed to build its case. For example, when an attempt is made to call witnesses, it can only be \\"To prove that they made it to the enemy wire\\", which no one of the regiment did. And when the defense attempts to state the decorations one of the men has received (So it can be shown he isn't a coward) the president of the council says \\"The men are on trial for their current cowardice, not their former bravery\\" and that \\"Medals are no defense\\".What is most ludicrous is the line of questioning on the defendants. It is absurd in the way it forces the men to answer irrelevant questions. An example by the President of the council on the convicted Private Ferol:President: Did you advance?Ferol: Yes, Sir.President: How far did you advance?Ferol: To about the middle of no man's land.President: Then what did you do?Ferol: Well, the Boche machine guns were like a hailstorm and I saw that-President: No. Answer my question. What did you do?Ferol: Well, sir, I saw that me and Meyer-President: I didn't ask you what you saw. I asked you what you did.Ferol: Yes, sir.President: Did you advance?Ferol: Not after I saw that me and Meyer-President: Did you turn round and go back?Ferol: Well, when I saw that-President: Attention! Answer my question. Did you turn round and go back? Yes or no?Ferol: Yes, sir.This edition (Paperback, University of Georgia Press, 1987) includes a fascinating afterward by Stephen E. Tabachnick. He mentions about the book's placement of the chain of command and about themes from the book.Sadly, Paths of Glory has become largely underrated over the years. My English teacher hadn't even heard of it. This book should be put back in publishing as soon as possible so more people can experience how great it is and should be recommended reading at schools so people can see how ridiculous war can be."},{"Title":"Paths of glory","review":"Soldiers have forever obeyed the commands of officers, knowing sometimes that to obey the command was to die and to refuse to obey it was to die.

Dancers in mourning","review":"No doubt Allingham fans will remember Uncle William from \\"Police at the Funeral.\\" William's near miss with the British legal system and the death of his mother having left him at loose ends, so he decides to write his memoirs. Having lived an unexceptional life, William decides to make it up out of whole cloth. Unexpectedly, the book, \\"Memoirs of an Old Buffer,\\" becomes a comic bestseller. To ice the cake, a musical review, starring Jimmy Sutane, the dancer, is a runaway success. All should be roses.Unfortunately, this is not the case. Freak accidents and practical jokes have dogged the cast of the play, and nerves are running high. Uncle William calls in Albert Campion to help resolve the problems and return things to normal. After a backstage visit Campion accepts an invitation to Sutane's country house, where he meets Sutane's long time friend Squire Mercer, his understudy Benny Konrad, supporting actress Chloe Pye, and many other players in the drama about to unfold. Much to Campion's shock he find's himself stricken by Suntane's wife, Linda. Everything comes to a head when Chloe Pye falls off a road bridge directly in front of Sutane's moving vehicle. The inquest is inconclusive, unable to decide if se was pushed, fell, or jumped.Completely befuddled by his feelings for Linda, Campion has difficulty focussing on the case. He withdraws, providing help only sporadically. Not even the sudden tragedy of the bombing murder of Benny Konrad, which leaves 15 people dead or injured, seems to rouse him from this state. Finally, it is the pleas of Linda herself that arouse him to the hunt again. Even so, it is an unwilling Campion that follows the trails to their inevitable, tragic conclusion.This is one of Allingham's most difficult books. Truly, we are not used to an unwilling Campion. Without the precious antics of Magersfontein Lugg, Campion's manservant, the overall tone of the book would be darkly somber. Yet the writing is some of her best. Character depictions are deep and well made. There are moments in the dialog and narrative that attain an almost poetic clarity. The plot is complex and moves along well. And, for those of us who do not always pay close attention, the ending is a bit of a surprise. Allingham has wandered onto uncharted waters in \\"Dancers in Mourning,\\" and she has done very well."},{"Title":"... Dancers in mourning","review":"Margery Allingham is a great writer. Albert Campion is a classic figure in mystery literature and I hope they never stop reprinting her books. I haven't been able to read many Allingham books but I can say that this is one of her best. The mystery is fascinating and she provides a wonderful twist in the plot right in the end. Just when you think it's all figured out. Wham! Even Campion is shocked. This is the first Allingham I read and I was hooked. Campion is such an intrigueing character. Sometimes he's not even the main character in her books, but he's still a force to be reckoned with. A character that adds much warmth and richness to Allingham's books and particularly this one, is Magersfontein Lugg, Campion's valet, butler, cook, etc. He also happens to be a former burglar, I believe. Writers like Allingham don't happen all the time and I wish I had discovered her sooner. Any book written by her is bound to be good and I also recommend Tiger in the Smoke. Wonderful suspense too."},{"Title":"... Dancers in mourning","review":"I've often wondered what it would be like if Margery Allingham decided to write an English country manor mystery. I knew instinctivley that it would be nothing like anything we've seen from Patricia Wentworth or even Agatha Christie. Well, now I need wonder no longer. This is an English country manor mystery like none you've ever read before. For one thing it is much more sinister and much darker than the books from this genre usually are. Secondly, it's written by the grand mistress of crime Miss Allingham herself. We are treated to another look entirely at Albert Campion - different than anything before. The main difference is that he is much more personally involved with this one than he usually is, and he knows that too. And because he knows that he is not comfortable with it and tries repeatedly to pull himself away, but finds that he can never successfully withdraw from trying to solve these crimes. The book is also different for Miss Allingham and her hero Campion because it is set within the theatrical set. And what an excellent job she does of portraying the artistic temperament. It also goes to show that not only Ngaio Marsh can excel in this particular arena. You must read this book if you are interested to hear more since I will not spoil the fun for anyone. If you've never read Margery Allingham before this may be a good place to start, but bear in mind that the plot is quite different from most of her books about Campion."},{"Title":"... Dancers in mourning","review":"Uncle William Faraday (POLICE AT THE FUNERAL) was at lose ends for awhile after Albert Campion cleared up that bit of unpleasantness for the family a while back. After his mother passed on William needed something to occupy his time - and replenish his bank account, and so decided to write his memiors. Unfortunately Uncle William, other than that distastful murder business, had not led a very exciting life and his memiors reflected that. Being Uncle William he had no problem spicing them up a bit. Anyone else would have been exposed as a fraud but once again Uncle William was undeservedly lucky and his book was adapted for the stage, becoming a hit musical. When his old friend Campion turned up again Uncle William was happily included in the perpetual cast party being hosted by the star of the production, Jimmy Sutane, at his country house.Sadly this is where the luck runs out and the trouble begins. Albert quickly becomes involved in the midst of things, sorting out the petty practical jokes that have been plaguing the production, unearthing old scandals, current rivalries and the odd murder or two.This is the ninth CAMPION novel and Allingham has really hit her stride, Campion is now very much his own person with his own unique style. The mysteries (and there are several questions to be answered) are all clever, the clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow and the characters, both old and new, come to life. This is an excellent read, definitely a 'must' for fans of the series but it would probably be better to begin the series with the earlier books."},{"Title":"... Dancers in mourning","review":"\\"Dancers in Mourning\\" is one of my favorite Allingham mysteries. Although I'd read most of them almost 20 years ago, I decided to re-read them after watching my Campion DVD series. I have to admit that I'd forgotten how very well the author wrote.The plot here is much like the DVD,Campion - The Complete First SeasonandCampion - The Complete Second Season. I'm often amazed at how faithfully PBS/BBC murder mysteries are. The respect for the original work is almost always apparent to anyone familiar with it. There are few minor changes here, with the heroine having a small child with whom Lugg develops a strong connection and whose exisitance complicates even more Campion's strong attraction for his hostess. There is also less focus on the theater itself as a venue, giving the actor's home the place of \\"manor house\\" in the mystery.The mystery itself is well designed, although perhaps a little long by way of narrative which serves in place of red herrings to distract the reader from the solution. The clues are well placed but may have one or more interpretations. In the end it's a matter of understanding the psychology of the various suspects and following that and the clues to the logical conclusion. The reader should not feel \\"cheated\\" or \\"manipulated by an author who has written herself into a \\"spot\\" and had to use a fabricated \\"fix\\" to make the mystery come out right. It's a well mastered thing, and it shows.As usual the author does a wonderful job of creating a visual and emotional environment for her characters; in this instance one of tension and angst. The plot is active, with the sleuthing taking place in the house, on the grounds, at a doctor's home, in London at Campion's home, at his club, at the police stations, on the highway, etc, with no sense of the \\"armchair\\" about it. It's a lot of work for the author, but it makes for a much more interesting and textured story. The little idiosyncrasies designed into each character makes each a masterpiece of individuality. I had not realized that there had been so much retrospective in the author's work when I first read them. Having re-read many recently one after the other, I find that the inclusion of earlier characters or the reference to them really fleshes out the identity of Albert Campion himself and that of the individual taken from the earlier episode. It lends the story more of a \\"family\\" ambiance. These are people known to the reader from other situations and now one sees that they had a subsequent history and that this history still intersects with the life line of the hero.Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"...

The author's serial detective, Albert Campion tracks the wrong suspect through most of this claustrophobic mystery. It will never be my favorite entry in this Golden Age detective series, because of the overabundance of characters and the difficulty in sorting them out. I had to read \\"Dancers in Mourning\\" twice before I got everyone straight. However, Allingham is always elegant and psychologically astute, and she keeps the blood and dead bodies at one remove, although there are more bodies than usual in this mystery.Some of the most humorous incidents in this book involve Campion's manservant, Lugg, who is pressed into temporary service as a butler in the house of the chief suspect. He develops a relationship with the dancer's neglected daughter, and furthers her practical education in such techniques as lock-picking and card sharpery.Another character, \`Uncle' William Faraday emerges from a previous Campion novel, \\"Police at the Funeral\\" as the author of the mainly fictional autobiography, \\"Memoirs of an Old Buffer\\" which has been turned into a popular musical. He serves as Campion's side-kick, along with Lugg, in solving the mystery of who is persecuting star dancer, Jimmy Sutane, even to the point of murdering his fellow cast members. Campion himself prefers to remain off-scene, as he has fallen in love with Jimmy Sutane's wife (I thought this was a bit unjust of Campion, since he and Amanda Fitton from \\"Sweet Danger\\" were a definite item).Warning: there is quite a lot of gay stereotyping in this book. In fact, in her earlier Campion novels, Allingham does a fair amount of minority-bashing, and sometimes indulges in anti-feminist tirades. Fortunately, these unlovely characterizations disappear in her later novels.Here is a complete list of the Campion novels that Allingham wrote (\\"Cargo of Eagles\\" was completed by her husband after her death in 1966). There are also short story collections and Campion novels that were written by her husband, Youngman Carter, which I didn't include in this list.1.

Dancers in mourning","review":"Margery Allinghan's 8th Albert Campion mystery is a wonderfully crafted tale that blends the worlds of London theater and English country life in an absorbing mystery that includes several deaths, the injury of innocent people, love, conflicting emotions and an ending that will surprise you.One of Campion's friends asks the detective to help out Jimmy Sutane, a song-and-dance star. A series of escalating pranks has befallen the star, and Sutane and his entourage are becoming increasingly tense. Campion travels to Sutane's country home and meets Sutane, his family and theatrical friends and associates. The pranks continue, then comes murder.Campion pulls together bits and pieces of information that lead to the author of the pranks. But he hesitates to solve the murders due to his emotional connection with Sutane and his family.This book was first published in 1937. The crimes aren't solved by science; they are solved by investigation and brain power. You know what Campion knows and can test your deductive powers along with the detective's.A great read that should also be made available on Kindle."},{"Title":"...

These telephone polls have their limitations, generated as they were for immediate media use, not systematic academic inquiry. Still, their sheer profusion provides insights not usually possible.Mueller's main conclusion is that &quot;The opinion dynamic that probably helped Bush most was a growing fatalism about the war.&quot; The sense of inevitability he says, fueled the feeling that the fighting might as well be gotten over with. Trouble is, the author displays such immaturity (sarcastically using such phrases &quot;our glorious military,&quot; &quot;our gallant, and presumably virginal, men and women in the service&quot;) that most readers will find themselves unsure how much to trust his judgment. Indeed, Mueller's hostility to the American war effort significantly detracts from the authority of his conclusions.Nearly every polling organization in the United States contributed to the 289 tables at the back of the book. Having them all in one place permits the reader completely to bypass Mueller's interpretations and ponder the data for himself. One fascinating poll shows that at the exact end of the war, only 38 percent of Americans thought the war was not a victory if Saddam Husayn remained in power; and that this figure steadily increased to 69 percent one and a half years later. This shift in attitudes goes far to explain why the war, far from helping George Bush's reelection effort, probably ended up hurting it.Middle East Quarterly, September 1994"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I love Charlotte Perkins Gilman, so what's not to love? If you are a fan of hers, you'll love it. If you've never read her work, I will let you know it is a dystopian feminist novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's quite small but it is packed with so much food for thought and I'm left in complete awe a week after finishing it. I don't know how I'm going to sum it all up in order to do it justice but I'll give it my best shot.This book is often described as a feminist book but I don't feel educated enough to really speak to that. So I'll just be looking at it from a perspective of how fascinating it was to me as an average reader.The book starts out with three friends on an adventure to discover the mysterious land of women they've heard about. These three men seem to embody different male perspectives. There's Terry who is a playboy and womanizer, Jeff who idolizes women, and Vandyck who is the narrator and falls somewhere in the middle.Of course the men are curious about whether a world of women really exists. When they find it and fly over, they are surprised to find that it looks civilized, that there are buildings and farms and things in order. Terry is especially skeptical that there really aren't any men in this place because he just can't believe women are capable of building things and creating a civilized society.After entering the place the men begin referring to as Herland, they feel threatened by the women and try to escape which leads to them being captured. Although they aren't treated badly, they are contained in a sort of castle where they are given quite a bit of freedom but are constantly watched to ensure they aren't a threat. They are also assigned tutors and they begin learning the language, culture, and history of Herland.They quickly become accepted into the society as they continue to learn. Much of the book entails them exploring Herland and learning about the ways of the women there. The women also want to learn of the outside world and there is quite a bit of comparing and contrasting. It seems the author wanted to create some kind of commentary on the shortcomings of life in the outside world (the world as we know it).What impressed me the most is the world building of this book. The women of Herland answer all the men's (and readers) questions so thoroughly and I found myself totally convinced of everything they did, how they came to certain conclusions, and how their society developed the way it did. After having read The Giver which I thought had a very poorly built world that wasn't well explained, I was just blown away by all the thought that went into creating Herland.This book is incredibly thought provoking as well as it comments on society and the way things are. In Herland the community is very collectivistic and everyone works together to improve their society. They have a collective identity of \\"we\\" and think of themselves as a whole, without individual families or needs. Instead,\\"all the surrendering devotion our women have put into their private families, these women put into their country and race. All the loyalty and service men expect of wives, they gave, not singly to men, but collectively to one another.\\" (pg. 95)When the women realize their land can only support so many people, they work together to control the population. Although some women might desire motherhood, they realize it wouldn't be in the best interest of all involved. Instead, they channel all their motherly love into nurturing other children and caring for the people around them. This seems to be a judgment on our own overpopulation and what some might regard as a person's jealous desire to have their own biological children.Another interesting thing was the way the men perceived the women of Herland. They were expecting them to fit their idea of women and be very feminine. But if there are no men then the concept of masculinity and femininity doesn't really fit. How can a person be feminine if there is no other way of being (masculine) to contrast with? One of the women observed that, \\"in a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be intensified.\\" (pg. 89)So is femininity just a concept and would women really act in \\"feminine\\" ways if there weren't any men? Would they need to differentiate themselves by dressing differently and having long hair?The men also realize how much they view women as women instead of just people. Because the women of Herland aren't feminine, they begin to see them as people, not as women. At one point it is stated, \\"We were now well used to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing every kind of work.\\" (pg. 137)There were so many other things to think about that this blog post could go on forever. But I'll stop there and hopefully I've given you a glimpse of all the things you'll encounter in this book. I personally didn't find it to be overly preachy or declaring that women were superior to men. There were a lot of interesting ideas and I think anyone can learn a lot from reading this book and get ideas about how our world could be improved if everyone looked out for one another, for example.So I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. The world building is excellent and there's plenty of food for thought. I think I could easily re-read this several times and come away with something new each time."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"On an exploratory trip in \\"savage\\" lands, three young American men find a country composed entirely of women. As these men learn about the history and culture of Herland, they are at first dismayed but later impressed at the asexuality and absolute social perfection of these women. For the first time, they notice the flaws in their own society and feel ashamed.I'm having a really hard time deciding what to think about Herland. I tend to prefer plot-driven novels, or at the very least character-driven novels. Herland was neither plot- nor character-driven...it was concept driven. Gilman was trying to convey a set of principles using an allegorical dialog. Gilman felt that women are subjugated by their sexuality. Because their economic happiness depends on their ability to attract men, they resort to jealousies and obsessions with fripperies. In Herland, there are no men...therefore they do not depend upon their sexuality to land them a desirable place in life--they depend only upon hard work and virtue. Since there are no men, they have no reason to be jealous, catty, gossipy, or hysterical. Thus, they are perfect.For the most part, I did not enjoy reading Herland. I found the dialog grating due to the sickening perfection of the women and the irksome sexism of the men. The men's characters were very flat--their purpose was simply to present a contrast to the perfection of Herland. The three men came in three stereotypical varieties: gentlemanly to the point of sexism, brutishly sexist, and imperfect-but-somewhat-objective observer. Other than these characteristics, the men had no personality at all. The women also lacked character partly due to their obnoxious perfection, but also due to their nature as a social \\"we\\" instead of being unique individuals. In other words, the perfection and socialism merged them into one character with many names (with the slight exception of Alima who brought Terry's brutish behavior on herself by having a \\"far-descended atavistic trace of the more marked femaleness, never apparent till Terry called it out.\\")I think Herland was an interesting thought experiment, but I personally didn't enjoy reading it. If your'e interested in concept-driven allegories, especially feminist and socialist allegories, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \\"Herland\\" is a lost-world fantasy in the Haggardian tradition with a decided twist: It functions primarily as a discourse on the supposed but not necessarily actual differences between the two sexes, and as a feminist screed in the utopian genre. Written in 1915, the novel was initially serialized in the pages of Gilman's own monthly magazine, \\"The Forerunner,\\" a publication whose main agenda was to further Gilman's ideas of feminism and socialism. We are introduced to three very different types of men at the beginning of this story: Terry, a chauvinist kind of man's man with decidedly old-fashioned ideas concerning \\"women's place\\"; Jeff, a Galahad type of dreamy idealist, who's fond of putting women on top of proverbial pedestals; and our narrator, Vandyck, a level-headed sociologist. The three discover a land of some 12,000 square miles on a plateau in some unnamed part of the world...a plateau that is inhabited by nothing but--you guessed it--females. The 3 million females in what Vandyck refers to as Herland have, for the last 2,000 years, been cut off from civilization and have been reproducing parthenogenetically; virgin births that come when the women turn 25 or so, and that always result in baby girls. These miracle births are perhaps the most fantasy-oriented aspect of Gilman's tale; an aspect that might have helped secure its pride of place in Cawthorn and Moorcock's excellent overview volume \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" Our three men, after spending many months of learning the language of Herland (an education not easily accomplished, unlike in many other lost-world adventures where explorers, less realistically, seem to pick up a new tongue in a matter of days) and getting acclimatized, are given a tour of the land, and Gilman shows us how well the women work together, how they have raised childbearing and motherhood to a religion of sorts, and how far advanced their methods of agriculture and education have become. It is a true utopia, with all its inhabitants happy and healthy and well cared for. The men perceive this land in conformity with their various temperaments; not too surprisingly, Terry has the roughest time here. But even he is forced to admit that Herland's accomplishments have outstripped ours in many regards, after initially thinking that no \\"civilization\\" could possibly exist without men.Simply written by its author, with many touches of humor and (at a mere 146 pages) short enough to never wear out its welcome, despite the occasional didactic tone, \\"Herland\\" is a winning read indeed. Even in these more enlightened and more PC times, when American women have the right to vote, can hold any job a man can (even president, perhaps?), and earn almost 75% of what a man earns (OK, guess we still have a way to go!), this book serves as a good reminder that sexism is such an easy trap to fall into. I would like to especially recommend this particular Pantheon edition of \\"Herland\\" because of the wonderful 20-page introduction to the book written by Ann J. Lane, who discusses not only Gilman's life, but the history of the utopian novel in general, and \\"Herland\\"'s position therein. Modern-day readers might find this intro very helpful. And speaking of the modern-day reader, if there was one problem this reader had with Gilman's novel, it was one dealing with the question of sex. Is it reasonable to expect 3 million women trapped on a plateau NOT to resort to lesbianism after so many centuries? The gals seem completely chaste in Herland, and even after Terry, Jeff and Van take three of the Herland women as wives, their brides still insist that sex is only for procreation purposes (which brings to mind the old saying \\"There goes paradise!\\"). But here's what I had a real problem with: Van, amazingly enough, is just fine with this, claiming that he'd rather have a virtually sexless marriage with his wonderful Herland bride than be married to a fully active partner back home! Forget about those virgin births...THIS is the biggest fantasy aspect of \\"Herland\\"!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The stunning dichotemy of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's &quot;Herland&quot; exists in Gilman's attempt to present her fictional civilization as a type of Utopia, while instead creating a civilization founded on such loathsome aspects of humanity as pursuit of one &quot;Superior Race&quot;, justifying imprisonment for selfish purposes, ecological tampering and perpetuated stereotypes regarding men and women.Herland, a civilization of only women and girl-children, who reproduce through immaculate conception and produce only female children, reflects Adolph Hitler's belief in societal &quot;cleansing&quot; and pursuit of a superior race. Women in Herland, a place where women are stereotypically all longing for no more in life than to reproduce and pop out babies, are expected to produce no more than one baby each, due to limited resources and land. Any woman who posesses personality traits that do not fit the rigid framework of Herland society, are point blank asked not to reproduce. It is made clear that any personality trait outside of the societally-desired norm of unrealistic goddess-like calm, reserve and mommy-ism is undesirable. Therefore, they &quot;weed out&quot; any differentiation and individualism, establishing a clone-like state of &quot;We're so pure we float&quot; women.The narrator of Herland is Van. He and his two buddies have gone exploring the myth of Herland and landed by plane just there. Exercising a stereotype that doesn't seem to fit, three beautiful, young women are sent out to act as sirens, and lure the men. The problem with this part of Gilman's story, is that supposedly the society has not had any knowledge of or contact with men for thousands of years. How then would they know that men would be so attracted and play chump to this lure? --Be that as it may, again, we see Gilman using women and basing this on the stereotype that young women are to be used as jezebels, temptresses, while the older women are naturally the wise ones, described as &quot;the colonels&quot; by the men in jest. Second female stereotype: A mature woman is a crone. She is not attractive to men, but does have wisdom and authority. Of course there are no young, attractive women on the council of &quot;colonels&quot;. Young, pretty women are of course, flighty and stupid and not in positions requiring wisdom and authority (read: sarcasm).Van and his two fellow-explorers, Jeff and Terry, are apprehended by being rushed by women and anesthetized with ether. Does this say &quot;Peaceful Utopia&quot; ? I didn't read it that way. The men are imprisoned and guarded. They are forced to tutor the &quot;colonels&quot; in English and to learn the parlance of Herland, so that they might better communicated with the colonels and be of more use to their self-concerned purposes. It is apparent that the men want to leave and go home. They attempt to escape. The women spy on them from the treetops, unknown to the men, almost toying with them this way. They observe them, hungry and desperate and wanting to go home. When the women's curiosity in observation is satiated, they drag the men back and double up on the guards. The men are held prisoner in Herland for about a year. This imprisonment of human beings for personal experiment/education in sociology circumvents Gilman's attempt to paint a picture of a superior society.In closing, getting through Herland was a labor, not of love, but of college course assingment. I found these women to reflect stereotypes about women (all women love cats, all women want to be mommies, young women are temptress-sirens, mature women are wise old crones) and other unlikable traits: eliminating indigenous animal and plant life that they made judgements about, tampering with ecology. I also thought the three men were very narrow-minded-ly created compilations of male stereotypes. It was all I could do to even finish reading this book."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Three stars: Five stars as a period piece, one as a work of literature.Mine is the 1979 edition whose preface claims it is still relevant. Perhaps that, too, is an indication of a past phase of feminism, because the story has really not aged very well.The writing is awful. Sorry. I know that it was originally serialized in Gilman's magazine, which might account for the shallow, unpolished quality of it, but it makes for tiresome reading in novella form.I hesitate to criticize Herland too much because Gilman was so obviously a product of her time and social class that it's almost impossible to evaluate her in our modern terms. The work is clearly a reaction against extreme male domination of society and is absurd if it is divorced from its original context. It seems as if the best testament to just how limited women were in 1915 is the painfully-restricted scope of what even an ardent feminist could envision for her gender. I was struck in particular by the apparent inability to develop much technology, and the narrator's statement that Herland had been unable to generate much of a science of geology; I'm sure my mother, who did graduate work in crystal physics, would find that darkly amusing. It seems that even radical women saw the talents of their sex as primarily organic and not scientific or mathematical.What strikes me most in this novel is that Gilman managed to depict women in a way that was revolutionary and yet still to stereotype them. The robotic, heterogeneous inhabitants of Herland--all of them beautiful, athletic, rational, and wise--seem nearly as objectified as the shrinking-violet heroines produced by contemporary male authors"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"HerlandIt is truely amazing how far ahead of her time author Charlotte Perkins Gilman was.

To fulfill their own curiosity and learn more, three women of Herland agree to become married to the three men. Unfortunately one of the men has not been able to overcome his own prejudices about how women ought to behave, and with one act he brings their time in Herland to an end.

While I didn't particularly connect with the characters, I don't think that Gilman's point was to have readers fall in love with the characters - the message here is deeper than the characters or the story. It definitely gave me a lot to think about, the main thing being that this society, because they have no men, don't see through a lens of gender in any way. As I can't imagine such a thing - women are always compared to men in real life - it is an interesting concept to spend time thinking about. What would it be like if people were just people and gender was completely irrelevant?If you want to know whether or not I would recommend reading Herland, the answer is yes I would if you are interested in classic feminist literature.

The first is a doctor, and a southern romantic, and the other is a classic male chauvinist and the antagonist of the story. I found that parts of the story were a little rough, but the work as a whole was very enjoyable.The basic questions of why our society works the way it does causes the narrator to rethink his entire world view, and his views of civilized society. This novel is a worthwhile read, and an interesting perspective on a Utopian society."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Early 20th Century feminist activist and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman is best known for her nonfiction treatise Women and Economics, which analyzed the detrimental effects of the economic reliance of women on men in American society.In Herland, Gilman takes a different approach: A political satire in the form of a untopian adventure story.Her three protagonists are all male, typical wealthy explorers and adventurers that you might expect to find in the pages of something by H. Rider Haggard. And in fact, Gilman exhibits a strong command of the \\"Lost World\\" and uptopian adventure genres, writing an enjoyable fantasy tale with tight pacing, good action, and enough conflict to keep things interesting even before one examines the political aspects of her writing.The three adventurers hear a rumor of a sheltered valley that is home to an all-female society and they set out to explore it. The narrator's motive is mainly curiosity. He is genuinely interested in the workings of this society, and he approaches the experience as a scholar. His two companions represent more extreme views. One is the typical male chauvinist, a macho \\"man's man\\" who expects to be greeted as a conquering hero as the only man in a land of women. The third member of the group has an idealistic view of women, placing them on a pedestal, but not accepting them as capable or competent.The society they find is described in excellent detail, considering the relatively short length of the novel. It is present as a superior society in the sense that one would expect for a novel to be considered utopian. The women of Herland have no poverty, no war, and almost no crime or disease. Their primary focus is on the rearing and education of their daughters, and the whole society works in concert to improve its base of knowledge and then to impart that knowledge on to the next generation.Much of this is clearly meant to satirize modern society of the time the work was written (and it provides criticisms that remain just as valid today). But many of Gilman's ideas about education are quite well thought-out.Gilman's women of Herland are descendants of a mutant (although that specific term is not used), capable of reproducing by parthenogenesis and having only female offspring. The author gives enough scientific and historical background to at least make the society's origins plausible in the context of a fantasy adventure novel. The three protagonists spend much of the first few chapters debating the argument that there must be men hidden somewhere before they finally come to terms with the true nature of their hosts.From there, they embark on a path of romance and eventually marriage, all of which is condoned by the society of Herland, who are interested in the possibility of a return to a gendered society. In Gilman's sharpest bit of satire, she has the women assuming that they must be missing out on some great benefits by having only one gender in their society, even as her male characters must reluctantly admit that there is little that the outside world has to offer to Herland.The ending follows a fairly predictable path, at least in terms of the resolution of the major plot points. There were a few interesting surprises in the course of wrapping things up.The overall tone is witty, but never truly bitter. Even the male chauvinist character is given a sympathetic treatment, and Gilman does a good job of conveying her ideal of what a society can be if people were to treat each other well and to work toward a higher standard of education and compassion.Rather than an outright condemnation of our society, Gilman gently reminds the reader that society could do better. And she serves it up in a story that is entertaining and amusing."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Oh, this ones just all types of insane fun. Written near a century ago, Gilman has her 3 male protagonists crashland an early plane into a secret uptopia where men don't exist.And what a wonderful world it would be, too. Gentle, highly evolved, all needs met, no pain, entirely communist (you can't even raise your own kids there). No icky sex (babies are born when a woman WISHES super hard for one). The women of Herland ease the men into their blissful way of life, the men come to realize what utter simpleton pigs they are (including realizing sex is awful and subjugating) and likely happiness for all, but Gilman never quite finished it."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"A beautiful and thorough examination of utopia populated entirely by women, through the prism of an intelligent and educated young man. The writing is engaging and entertaining while managing to present the philosophy of the author convincingly. The only shortcoming to the ideas presented in the book is that no reason is given as to why such a utopian civilization would develop simply due to the lack of any men.Most entertaining is the behavior of the women of Ms. Gilman's utopia. In stark and glaring contrast to contemporary feminism, the women of Herland deify motherhood, adore children, and are shocked to horror at the very idea of abortion; androcide is unthinkable, even as punishment for a crime. Indeed, an important book to history and philosophy."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Back in 1915 when HERLAND was written, women were widely considered weak and uncreative and had the sole responsibility of taking care of home, family, and being socialites. So, when 3 young American men in the novel encounter a country comprised entirely of women, they look everywhere to find out where they must have hidden their men. Of course, being emperialist men, they think it should be easy to conquer and subdue a country of women. However, they are looking at these \\"women\\" through the eyes of their own culture, not realizing their full potential as \\"humans\\". These are women who have such little land to support their people that they've only kept and cultivated food-bearing trees like most people would cultivate a garden and who have learned how to have children without men. Some women! Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote this novel after leaving her own husband and home, going off to prove that women are as capable as making a living for themselves as men are. I can only imagine the stir this book must have caused among the feminists of the day. Gilman has written a very interesting book with only one minor flaw. She keeps on building the reader up to this \\"big thing\\" that the women of Herland evidently have in store for the men who have dropped by bi-plane into their perfect little world. It turns out to not be such a shocking thing after all and pretty obvious in fact. Despite this slight transgression, the book is superb.

The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree.

Okay, so Herland was written in 1915. It's dated, but Gulliver's Travels is not dated.Two main areas are so wrong the misinformation gets in the way, and the reader is trying to make it right, but they can't:Some principles of agriculture are the same over time. Even at that time, potato blight blew in from far places and killed all the crops. Today, ambrosia beetles can fly in and transmit deadly fungi into avocado trees. But in Herland such things don't exist. The second law of thermodynamics is universal, but in Herland the forest soil continues to accumulate and to be enriched.The second area that's all wrong is parthenogenesis. The premise is that all reproduction is by parthenogenesis, resulting in all females. This is impossible in mammals. At least one sperm nucleus is required to initiate the second stage of meiosis in eggs, so they couldn't get a viable ovum. Further, birth control in Herland occurs by having a feeling. A candidate for congress was recently defeated for suggesting such a foolish notion.I found it tedious reading. I thought her point about the stereotypical ways in which many (not all) men view women was well-taken. I thought it was astute at that time to realize that if the courtship dance between males and females is off key, the mating doesn't take place. I thought her case for acceptance of a more three-dimensional woman was well-founded. But I sure wouldn't like to live in an all-female society.

A wonderfully written book about three men who enter a strange world populated by women only.The story of how the two sexes view their roles as male/female are intriguing and point out many focal points that theorists argue about: men controlling women, women being mothers, and the power between the two and how they survive in society.I highly recommend this book, it's an smooth read that applies more to today's world than it seems possible!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Anybody who truly studies the historical situation surrounding this book, beyond the scope of feminism, will find the avenue towards the kind of Eugenics that even Teddy Roosevelt and his wife, as well as a large part of society had started to engage in. A Utopian view, which controlled who could have children--a cleansing of American Health, in other words--became a cultural goal. We're not talking about condoms or birth control pills here. We're talking about the idea of WHO is the right person to have children--and if those unwanted people have unwanted children, then those children are generally undesirable too, genetically. A good book on the use of Eugenics during this period would be well worth it.Charlotte Perkins Gilman had incredible gifts, and won much deserved respect for her short story/half-memoire, The Yellow Wallpaper. I highly doubt she and many of the \\"good\\" women who wished to reform society into a more feminine and nurturing (and also more equal) refuge for all humanity would have ever guessed what can come from a book like Herland. The overall picture, in hindsight, is truly frightening. Add an influential writer or two, a few politicians, and soon you have those small county or local museums across the country eventually owning up to what has been a long-forgotten Eugenics movements practiced in their local communities by well-meaning reformers.On a nationwide scale, these \\"good women\\" were not just focusing on prohibition and temperence or suffrage, but also trying to sweep up the scum and keep them from breeding. Talk to a well-educated Biologist about the history of Eugenics in the United States and you will begin to see how people went from spaying women of perceived \\"low-character,\\" to making sure those who were poor, low on the pole, or handicapped would not be able to marry or reproduce. Nor was that the beginning, nor was it done with consent, nor was it entirely humane.... Human rights were made more and more fragile in favor of a Utopian principle, and with a lot of churchy-womanly (and manly) zeal.Granted, Gilman never used the word \\"Eugenics.\\" Gilman's book shows a fanciful world wherein men have not existed for quite some time, and where women can just \\"have\\" a baby when the magic is right or whatever....yet, this makes for a lot worse than wishfully innocent early feminism...it makes for another detail in her book that is QUITE disturbing: the idea that only some women are GOOD enough to be mothers, to even BECOME mothers. In this book, those women who just wouldn't be the best mothers naturally just \\"know\\" and decline the possibility...only to become co-mothers and caregivers to the other mothers' children. It takes a village to raise a child, but these villages won't let you have one. Sure, this sounds wonderful to a jaded person in our society who thinks only of overpopulation or the terrible abuses against unwanted children by horrible undeserving parents....It sounds wonderful...until a class of college students starts to ditch intellectual rigor and just downright idolize the book. What Gilman's good thoughts invoke is something that cannot be managed without unrestrained and callous social control and abuses that would overwhelm any good that would have been done. I'll get to my point soon..For me, it was terrible to be so disappointed in a woman and writer so well-loved.Bring up Eugenics and how determining reproductive rights and a person's worth could spawn a mainstream American movement that then INSPIRED the policies of Eugenics the Nazis began to use not long after..and you may find a lot of angry classmates or students, but it is still the truth. Irradiating the genitals or ovaries of Jews to keep them from reproducing, euthanizing the handicapped, the elderly, and the mentally ill...and finally deciding which race of people is more fit to live...that is what happened. Yes, it was the mass outpouring of a grass-roots movement that was invented HERE. Racial Hygeine, Class Hygeine, Cleaning the Health of America, etc..somehow the cleanliness of America seems less because it became so much more in Germany. We can wonder what might have happened HERE given extenuating circumstances. A nation that has already perpetrated mass-genocide and cultural \\"cleansing\\" with the Native Americans couldn't be that far away from what happened in Europe.Granted, Gilman didn't do these things. The policies in the book are elemental to this type of thinking, however. Disposal of the potential or even lives of people regardless of their gender or class or race all becomes a touching point here.Because of these surrounding factors, this book is less inspiring and more repulsive every time I think of it, for years and years now. What seemed like a little innocent piece of quaint feminism with a thin shellac of revolutionary spirit, was little more than another launchpad for discrimination. It supported MORE discrimination against women, and people in general, and for that reason I can only think of this book as a time-capsule of cattle fodder. Do I blame Gilman? Hell no. None of us are innocent in our own times..but that doesn't mean we should set up Herland as an eternal classic. As an author, she endorsed a place where choice was virtually removed and society just fell into line. It has all been thought of before and will be again.Please get informed, and fast, before you go off the deep end with the book. Enjoy it, but with a big pinch of informed salt.Utopias are just that...and to create one usually involves mass sacrifices by SOMEBODY.

This story of men trapped in a female only society makes it seem as though women are better than men (which could be the authors opinion?)

It is a great measure of the human soul that we have these books. The spur us on to better ideals. Sadly, we have abandoned these, replacing them with the ugly dystopian literature, and are worse of.\\"Herland\\" is unique in that it is feminist utopianism. It is so off-beast that I was excited to read it. All of the classical cannon of Utopian Lit is all male: Plato, Moore, Bellamy, and so forth. I was curious about what insights Gilman would have.Sadly, I felt left down.First of all, having so many expectation for a book, and then being let down forced me to look deeper at what was going on. I had to reexamine my assumptions and expectations.I realized that so much Utopian Lit is the same: people getting together, decided to stop being fools (in the Biblical sense of the word), and actually doing what then should be doing. Part of templette involves uniform clothing, large mess halls, centralized planning, and the un-Biblical open marriages.Gilman covers all of theses, except the open marriages, which I will later cover. In fact, there was nothing really new in this book. This is not to discredit it, but to to convey the epiphany I had while reading it. The utopias all have common elements, with minor modifications.The problem with Gilman's book is in the virgin births to perpetuate her Amazon society. This dues ex machina fatally shifts the story form Utopian Lit to mere fantasy. All Utopian Lit must, of necessity, be atheistic. Otherwise, it becomes religious social philosophy.There are some other problems, some of which come from outdated science. For example, genetically, all the women would be identical, and the environmental conditioning would not change them. Gilman has them with different features (p. 76, 78), a genetic impossibility.Another problem is the centralized planning without omniscience and omnipotence. \\"The best laid plans of mice and men . . .\\" We cannot control nature, predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or predict hurricanes. Herland has none of these. It is a peach of an Eden, but detached from the real world.Centralized planning never works. We have limited knowledge. And even if we know something, we have limited capacity to change things. We have Murphy's Law, entropy, and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Couple all of these with the Butterfly Effect of our ignorance and impotence, and it is a wonder that anything gets done at all.I so not want to get into Praeto's 80-20 Law, except to mention that all utopianists, except the American Founders, completely ignore this principle, Gilman not excluded.Most confusing is the birth control alluded to in Chapter 6 (p. 60). If pregnancies are virgin, are they spontaneous, and if so, how does one control them? This all comes back to the fact that this book is essentially fantasy, and not utopian.Sometimes Gilman gets downright ridiculous, as in mentioning that babies do not cry (p, 88). I understand the miracle eugenics and \\"negative eugenics\\" (p. 59), but this is ridiculous. Crying is not an annoyance, but serves several purposes, and is the root of communication.The religion is a disappointment. It is just Social Gospel, but no power. It has virgin births, but no Virgin Mary.Another problem is the nature of evil. Gilman notes that \\"They had no theory of the opposition of good and evil\\" (p. 87). That smacks of Nietzscheism, and is fundamentally at variance not only with the Laws of Logic, but also common-day experience.By virtue of creating a Herland, she is setting women in opposition to men. That is , she believes that society of Amazons is good, and mixing it with men is evil.Aristotle said,\\"There are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be and not be, and say that it is possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be and not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most certain of all principles . . .\\"\\"If all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time are true, clearly all things will be one. For if it is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything, the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras. For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true. And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras, \\"all things mixed together\\"\\"(Metaphysics, Book IV.4)Herland is not Eden-it is a Fool's Paradise. It is not practical, relies on a dues ex machine to function, and naive. The most corrosive ideas is that men are not only unnecessary, but the chief cause of the problems in the world. This is unabashed sexism, and ignored the fact that men are out there, and have things to contribute. This is as radical as any male chauvinistic nonsense. Changing the genders does not confuse anyone.If we were to implement Herland, what would be Gilman's final solution to the Man question? She does not say-perhaps for the better.Gilman is a pseudo-utopian. This book is not utopian, but more of feminist fantasy, which is just as bad a the male fantasies seen on cable TV. I recommend this book merely as a literary curiosity, and not as a blueprint."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This is one of my favorite books, one of my all time classics.

If you really detest men and you haven't a clue how males think or how real societies operate, you might like this story. However, if you have even one foot in reality, you'll find it childish to the extreme.Author's assumptions1. Men are the root of all evil.2. Anything men can do, women can do better (including writng utopian fantasies).3. Men are unnatural, unnecessary, unattractive, unreformable, and unrepentant.4. Sex should be non-existant.5. Science and society works out just the way you want it. (See Kendal Hunter's prior review.)6. The reader has boundless time to vest in useless novels.It's important to keep in mind that the book and its ideas were coming into print just as the seeds of Nazism and Hitlerism were planted and being cultivated. Clearly the author's ideas would not have been out of place in that era of eugenics as a way to build an ideal society. Furthermore, in her book, the author glosses over a myriad of 'unpleasant' details fitting of a nazi utopia:1. The book contains more than a hint of socialist Aryan one race, one ideal elitism.2. Birth control (!!!) is hinted, which by definition must involve some form of abortion.3. Capital punishment is hinted as this 'utopian' society's way of getting rid of undesirables.4. Women would be identically featureless, classless, and (apparently) humorless. By definition, parthenogenesis is not unlike cloning at the ovum level, so all women would be identical, excepting mutants.5. It left me wondering if even crying babies was too much to be tolerated in this society.I struggle not to be too hard on a novel nearly a century old, a blueprint for a feminist, socialist utopia devoid of men and apparently anyone else unlike the author. If this were a book about a utopia about race, we would condemn it to purgatory. However, since it only trashes men, we 'liberal women' are expected to swallow it reflexively. Unless you are a woman who pulls out her vibrator whenever you think about killing off men, I can't imagine who the audience is expected to be or why this tale was resurrected.A number of good science fiction authors have addressed this same topic with superior stories and I would recommend any one of them over this tale that should have remained buried in the trash heap of time."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I got the book in a timely manner and it is in adequate shape"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The title of Gilman's novel may be a bit misleading. The novel is described as a feminist novel. Yet, this is not exactly acurate. The absence of men in the utopian society may seem extreme to some, and it is. This is how Gilman makes her point. She does not create a world without men because men are terrible creatures who have corrupted the world. The utopia which lacks men is a clean peaceful place, excelling in every way American society fails. But, it is neither the absence of men nor the presence of women that faciliates this.Gender, in this novel, is symbolic for the most part. Gilman does separate the two genders to destroy steroetypes, but also to establish a concrete difference between the two worlds. The male world is not bad, and the female good. The world in which people are defined by others and limited to these defined roles is bad, while the world in which people are free to grow without being defined or compared to others, and are able to see the oneness of all people is good.Comparing Herland to the reader's own world, Gilman begins destroying gender based stereotypes. Because there are no distinctions of gender in Herland, nor any superficial characteristics which accompany gender, Herland women take on the roles of all people without considering any limitations. These women are strong, agile, nurturing, intelligent, cooperative, and able to rely on themselves. They are not &quot;typical&quot; females. As Gilman explains through the male character Van, &quot;Those 'feminie charms' we are so fond of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to the real fulfillment of their great process&quot; (59). In the same way, stereotypes about men can be discredited. Such ideas have been made up to help people deal with the differences between men and women. Gilman shows the reader that if people stop basing their identities on what others want, they will no longer be slaves to limitations. They will be free to discover their true selves and will allow others to do the same.Gilman shows readers that men and women are distinct people, but reminds us that they are people first. This can be seen when Somel, a woman of Herland, innocently questions a male visitor, &quot;But surely there are characteristics enough which belong to People, aren't there?&quot; (89). Focusing more on these characteristics, those belonging to &quot;People,&quot; allows humans to fulfill their personal potential without fear of jealousy. The women of Herland are able to live in &quot;such universal peace and good will and mutual affection&quot; (99) because &quot;they lacked the sex motive and, with it, jealousy&quot; (99). The women of Herland are free and equal because they are secure enough in themselves to offer and accept help for a joint cause, the betterment of their world. All readers, men and women alike, can learn a great deal from this humanist utopian novel."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman was arguably the most important American author of the women's movement in the early 20th-century. In addition to editing a newspaper, &quot;The Forerunner,&quot; she wrote &quot;Women and Economics,&quot; one of the first studies of the role of women in the economic system. Gilman also wrote a number of utopias: &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot; in 1911, &quot;With Her in Ourland&quot; (1916), and her best-known, &quot;Herstory&quot; in 1915. In &quot;Herstory&quot; Gilman creates a homosocial (one-sex) utopian society made up entirely of women in which the culture, political system, and families are the result of having women as the basis (instead of merely stemming from the absence of men). However, while other American utopian novels, most notably Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward 2000-1888,&quot; were standard reading for decades, Gilman's &quot;Herland&quot; was pretty much forgotten until it was rediscovered in the 1970s. Even after four decades Gilman's satire was seen as still speaking to the conditions faced by American women.Following the conceit first used by Sir Thomas More in writing his &quot;Utopia,&quot; Gilman's &quot;Herstory&quot; tells of three American explorers (male, of course), stumbling upon an all-female society in an isolated mountain valley in a land far away on the even of the first World War. Since they find this strange land to be civilized the explorers are convinced there must be some men hiding someplace, and set out to find them. As they search high and low for the male of the species they learn about the history of the country, the religion of motherhood, and the other unique customs, while trying to seduce its inhabitants. Many generations earlier the women had found themselves separated from the human race, with the men dying off. The society evolved, organizing itself around raising children and living in harmony with their surroundings. In the end, the three mail visitors end up falling in love with three of the women and are essentially converted as naturalized aliens.&quot;Herstory&quot; is less science fiction than many of the utopian novels written during this period, and clearly its primary value is in terms of its provocative commentary on gender roles in the United States in the early 20th-century. Not surprisingly, Gilman questions the roles assumed by men and women in the &quot;bi-sexual&quot; society by showing the relative perfection achieved in Herland with its uni-sexual society. What Gilman sidesteps, of course, are the issues of sexuality: the women of &quot;Herstory&quot; are asexual beings, although they are capable of parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction). Also, by talking about these women as being descended from good Aryan stock she raises the specter of racism as well. But clearly Gilman's purpose is to provide a critique of the social order of the day, using humor as a way to mask her telling barbs and to provide her unorthodox views of gender roles, motherhood, individuality, privacy, and other issues. Then there are the parts where the inhabitants of &quot;Herstory&quot; are amused and horrified to learn about the conventional aspects of courtship, marriage, families, warfare, labor relations and even animal husbandry in the &quot;real&quot; world.Because &quot;Herland&quot; is essentially a novella, running only 124 pages in this unabridged Dover Thrift Edition, it is fairly easy to work it into a class looking at 20th century American utopian literature or the women's movement. In many ways, although it is not as well written, &quot;Herland&quot; is a much more provocative critique of women in American society than Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; or Marge Piercy's &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time.&quot; &quot;Herstory&quot; also stands out because it is a true utopian novel, written at a time when the dystopian emphasis was about to redefine the genre of utopian literature."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Obviously, many people who read this book -- including most of the reviewers here -- clearly misunderstood Gilman's tone and objective in writing \\"Herland.\\" The purpose of the book is NOT to say that women are better than men in every aspect of life, or that women can survive without men. Indeed, the inhabitants of Herland realize that without males, their society is incomplete, which is why the three young women are encouraged to court the three male visitors. Gilman portrays two of her three male characters sympathetically and intelligently, and even the chauvinistic one is portrayed as intelligent, just misguided.Gilman has two purposes, neither of which is to show the 'inferiority' of men. One, she wishes to show what a society would be like if everyone were treated equally. Two, and related, she wishes to show what society were like if people put the greater good above their individual goals. In that sense, Gilman's society is not socialism but more like anarchism -- there IS no central government; Herland operates like a large utopian family, in which everyone's role is equal and everyone has a very important role in society. No one's role is more important than any others, be they male or female.The reason for the Herlandians' physical besting of the men is to show that women are only 'weak' because they are sheltered, and in turn are sheltered because they are weak; also, while the Herlandians were natural women living in the natural world, the men are essentially 'sheltered' by technology (all of them being specialists in an area) and thus are not physically trained as the women are. It's like a female Olympic runner beating a male who runs for his college in his spare time.Of course, the book has flaws -- the utopian society of course, is without chink or problem, and Gilman ironically venerates traditional aspects of women, casting them into the stereotype of communal, compassionate, sacrificial mothers. The veneration of 'motherhood' almost religiously is hypocritical, as if every woman desires to be a mother. Predictably, no woman in the history of Herland seems to have a problem with denying self for the greater good, or the lack of tradition, or the taking away of her own children for communal rearing. For that, I have to say that Gilman -- while trying to deconstruct the typical notion of a woman -- inadvertently BUILDS it by assuming that all women have these characteristics naturally."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Like most utopias, Herland hasn't aged well. What sounds like heaven to one generation seems more like hell to another. What makes this book most interesting is its artifact status in the evolution of feminism.Most modern-day feminists would, I believe, be horrified to be plunked down in Herland to spend their lives: a world without coitus, where motherhood is the end-all and be-all of a woman's existence. There is no Sapphic hanky-panky going on among the inhabitants of this uterine utopia; the very concept of sexual pleasure is foreign to these ladies. Where feminists once wanted motherhood without sex, today they are more likely to want sex without motherhood.In addition, Herlanders are unabashedly pro-life and horrified when the idea of abortion is raised. A woman's right to choose is as unthinkable in their world as a topless bar would be.On the other hand, there is plenty of it-takes-a-village-to-raise-a-child; every inhabitant of Herland is a career woman; and when the men raise the issue of their wives taking their names, the brides-to-be scornfully refuse.As a political manifesto, Herland cannot be taken seriously in the modern world, yet it maintains its importance both as historical artifact, illuminating the thought of the early 20th century, and as evidence that -isms are not static but constantly evolving."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Have you ever wondered what our world would be like without testosterone? Herland gives us some insight into such a hypothetical world. What would the crime level be like? How about wars? Rape? All of these terrible things are often initiated by men. Although a female-only society would probably be much less utopian than Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland, it is still interesting to speculate. Even the late Dr. Richard Dehann, a doctor and Bible teacher, speculates that original sin is inherited through the father; so maybe Ms. Gilman's land is not so far-fetched. It still makes interesting reading. If you are interested in female-dominated societies, check out Suzie McKee Charna's Holdfast Chronicles, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Free Amazons of Darkover, and/or Joanna Russ's Female Man."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This book was assigned reading for me back in college 12 years ago and I have been thinking about ever since then.

Scientific and curious by nature they plan a mission to fly over the country in a plane to investigate further only to be captured and held prisioner in &quot;Herland.&quot; While captive they are tutored by and taught to speak the language of the inhabitants. Once they have mastered the language they learn that their captors do not mean them any harm, but rather want to learn from them about the outside world as they have been cut off from it for 2000 years by their natural barriers. The men learn from the women and the women learn from the men. We see how different life could be in a society ruled and inhabited only by women.As a utopian or fantasy novel, this one is outstanding. There were parts I liked better and was more appreciative of now that I am older than when I first read it, and others that had me thinking &quot;as if!&quot; If you can get past the whole parthenogenisis premise its an easier pill to swallow, but this time around I wasn't buying it. I also found the over zealous religious tones near the end to make this short novel drag out far too long.All in all I am glad I re-read it and encourage anyone who hasn't to do so."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The premise is interesting enough: after a combination of man-made and natural catastrophes in a remote area, only a handful of women remain alive. Through some miracle, one woman becomes parthenogenetically pregnant - without normal fertilization - and civilization is rebuilt.But without men.The story opens 2000 years later, after the culture has flourished and stabilized, when three men of very different temperaments arrive. This brief story sketches the Edenic society. The women have their entire country under the most intense cultivation, and it is lush and productive. The women have a stable population, and a rich culture built around progress, peace, and single-minded devotion to the creation and care of the next generation. That is the cental axis of Gilman's world. Religion and everything else revolve around that.The women themselves, through Lamarckian and social evolution, have become strong, wise, happy, and oddly sexless. They seem not to have discovered the happiness of physical affection, especially when separated from procreation. I find it odd that there is not even a hint of that physical intimacy in this otherwise attractive world, even though the women could easily share it between themselves.Of course, one of the men commits an outrage, and they are banished back to the evil outer world - Eve casting Adam out of the garden, this time. Nearly nothing is said about the economy of this world, and just a little about their system of justice. As utopias go, it's a bit one-sided and bland, with one chilling exception. In the very last sentences of the book, there is a hint that their justice can include capital punishment.

It is boring, overly expository, dry as dust, and most importantly, didactic. It is didactic in the same way your history teacher who spoke in a monotone is didactic; you end up hating the delivery so much that whatever's being said gets tuned out along with the noise. It doesn't help that Herland is a vastly inferior knockoff of such nineteenth-century fantastic-journey novels as Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, James DeMille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder, or Doyle's The Lost World. All three of those novels had the same generally socially conscious bent as does Herland, and held up a dystopian land to our own to show us where our own civilization is lacking. But all three of them (even Poe, who despised the novel form and never wrote in it again) had a basic understanding of the structure of the adventure novel and how to keep things moving while passing along their message about what's wrong with society. Gilman lacks this facility, and what's worse, she's of that strip of author who feels that, in order to make sure the message is clearly heard by the reader, she must go out of her way and add a clarifying sentence. After all, the reader is far too stupid to pick up on inferences.The popularity of The Yellow Wallpaper and the obscurity of Gilman's other work cannot, of course, be dismissed as understood after reading only one of her other works. But Herland certainly doesn't have me straining at the leash to go looking for anything else Gilman wrote. Uniformly awful. (zero)"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"In her novel of a positive utopia made up only of women, Gilman gives us a vision of what perfection would be like, if only the inevitable power, money and sex did not get in the way of things. In Herland, there are no men thus eliminating the sex motivations. And they live a highly socialized communal life within which most of the problems of modern society have been conquered or mastered.The ladies of Herland have been isolated from the rest of the world for about 2000 years and during the early part of that period all the men in their society were killed or died off. This left a society of women only. To go on, they developed the ability to have virgin births, (in the modern wild turkey this exists today and is called Parthenogenesis, where in the absence of male turkeys, they may produce eggs that turn into female chicks) through an unusual biological quirk. But all the offspring are women.Throughout the book references and allusions to Edward Bellamy's famous positive utopia book \\"Looking Backwards\\" are evident. Yet Gilman's treatment of the topic is fresh and interesting in that the element of sex is removed from the utopian environment. In addition, the concept of the story is that 3 men happen to find the utopia and this allows Gilman to engage in a long discussion with those men and the women of Herland; comparing their worlds.Interestingly, even though Gilman wrote the book in 1915, not much seems to have changed. There is still injustice, greed, hate, love, war, peace and poverty. The book is a virtual wake up call to all societies, especially the Western Developed countries that there are yet things to be done in this world.The book is recommended to those who are interested in a vision of a better world. While Gilman's vision is an impossibility, as was Karl Marx vision of perfect Communism, nonetheless, it gives us a real reason to think on the bright side of life, as it may yet be possible to achieve."},{"Title":"Angel Tears","review":"A compelling and emotional book from beggining to end!

This book demonstrates the character traits that a real warrior should make a part of his being. It gives one the ideals to aim for in his life as a martial artist and a warrior. I consider this a martial arts classic. Although this is not my favorite translation, Sadler does a good job with the translation.This book is a quick and easy read, but for such a short book it contains a huge amount of wisdom and instruction for anyone who is seeking to live the warrior lifestyle. You can pull many gems of wisdom from this book that will serve you well whether you are a martial artist or just an average everyday guy who want to live a life of character, integrity and honor. This book is useful for one and all. I even use it in teaching my students in history class. I highly recommend reading it and putting the information it contains to use in your life.Bohdi Sanders, author ofWarrior Wisdom: The Heart and Soul of Bushido"},{"Title":"Code of the Samurai","review":"This is a 16th century treaty of Daidoji Yuzan, first published in English in 1941, that is a collection of the regulations of Bushido. Originally compiled as a training text for young samurai, the Code details the \\"honor system\\" necessary for quality \\"service\\".The book is divided into 3-parts, containing 43 sub-chapters dealing with a broad range of subjects such as morals, ethics, duty, thrift, weapons, bravery, respect, shame, reputation, service, theft, laziness, and death to name a few.It is written in typical samurai style, \\"One who is a samurai, even though but a small retainer, certainly ought to provide himself with a suitable instructor and study the traditional military arts so that he knows all there is to be known on the subject.\\" This is a historical masterpiece, but is certainly not a history book full of stories. If you are interested in warrior philosophy, this is a good start."},{"Title":"Code of the Samurai","review":"I was only going to give this 3 stars, until I remembered that it was never intended as a history book. It is a genuine historical example of the Samurai's code of conduct as perceived by one of the most respected of his day.It's dry. Though a very short book it feels long. It does, however, give a handful or three of insights that will make you reflect for a few minutes, then sit back and say, &quot;Ok, I get that now.&quot; In other places the justification for certain views will seem like a desperate stretch, or even childish.Even regarding that dryness and those few less than impressive explanations, I have to keep reminding myself that this is not &quot;literature&quot;, it is an ancient instruction manual that was highly read and highly respected by the people it was aimed at. If it was good enough for them to to live by, it's good enough for me to respect in its proper context.I didn't enjoy it, but I did learn from it. In fact, I've been through parts of it several times, and likely will go through them again.So, if you're looking for a snappy read on medevil Japan, look someplace else. If you just want a glimpse into an important sub-culture of that society, grab this book."},{"Title":"Code of the Samurai","review":"I came across a copy of this book sitting in a drawer where I used to work. It is a fantastic read for anyone trying to understand the Samurai culture. I understand that some business leaders were actually asking their employees to read this book so that they could become more effective in their jobs. The influence of the Zen Buddhist in the culture of samurai was strong. Probably this book would have been better sold as a book of \\"Zen\\" for the warrior within us all. As it is; it is a great read for anyone trying to improve themself, or understand the code of those Samurai."},{"Title":"Freedom Express (Wingman)","review":"I loved the way the author described the Freedom Express and their Howitzer appropriatly named the &quot;Big Dick&quot;. Towards the end when the Freedom Express really looked like it was not going to make it was probably the best part of the book. And having the Ten Miles to Hell just added to the action. I think the author ended the book great with the last second cavalry charge by the 101 Airborne. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves the action to last to the last moment and the suspense to be killer."},{"Title":"Beauty for Ashes","review":"If you like Grace Livingston Hill, you know you're going to get a dose of religion in the story and this is no exception.

He is saved by two peasants who raise him as their own son.

But when a child is born from the king and his sister, the great sorcerer Merlin prophesizes that the child will one day kill his father. He commands the king to have every male newborn in the kingdom sent out to the sea where they all will die (or so they should have). The boat ran aground in a small bay in the sea miles away from the kingdom. A poor fisherman married and childless stumbled upon it one day when he was bringing in his catch. Appalled by the sight of 40 dead infants, he was ready to push the boat back out to sea when he caught sight of one living child, starved and barely alive. He brought the child into his home and pushed the boat back out to sea. Knowing that if his wife knew he was one of 39 other dead babies she would have been heartbroken. His wife believes that the child was a gift from Lyre, the god of the sea. Six years later he is a young boy, loved and cherished by his parents, believing that Lyre had given him to his parents. But one day, his whole idea of who he is was shattered like a thin wine glass dropped onto a wooden floor. A women rode on a great grey charger out of the Forest Perilous to the family. Never seeing a horse before, the child was entranced and not worried in the least bit. The lady took the young boy from the family without the use of force as the fisherman knew that this would one day happen. She rode off with the boy into the forest where she told him his name was Mordred. This began the life of the young boy Mordred who would be a knight, an adventurer, and possibly a murderer."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"This tale is intruiging. Springer writes in a way that captures the reader's attention. It feels almost as you are in Camelot with Mordred and Arthur. This read is definitely one that will have you reading it in one sitting."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Can you beat fate? That's the central question at the heart of Nancy Springer's excellent novel I AM MORDRED, and it never makes for anything less than a thoughtful and engrossing read. Springer's Mordred is not born bad but everyone else--most of whom know his supposed destiny before Mordred himself--thinks he is thanks to Merlin the Magician's well-known prophecy that Mordred will one day rise up against his father, King Arthur, and murder him. But are Merlin's words infallible? Desperate to put the lie to the prophecy, young Sir Mordred sets off on a quest to make his own destiny and discover elusive happiness. Springer imbues her protagonist with a unique empathy, and it's impossible not to identify with Mordred as he struggles to forge his own identity and cast off the prophecy's dark shroud. Springer is no less deft with the other Arthurian personalities who interract with young Mordred, and her portrayals of Mordred's famous half-brother Gawain, Nyneve, the bold Sir Pelleas, Morgan le Fey, and King Arthur himself are all handled with expert dexterity. This is not a feel-good novel, however, and the conclusion is open to more than one interpretation. Nonetheless a highly recommended adaptation of a vital piece of Arthurian lore, and one which ought to be particularly well-received by its target teenage audience."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I usually don't read fantasy books, but wow, what an amazing book! It was extremely well written. Merlin cursed Mordred before his birth, the son of King Arthur and his half-sister, Merlin prophesizes that he will kill his father in battle, so Arthur tries to kill baby Mordred before Mordred kills him. In order to make sure that Mordred was killed, he sets all newborn boys out to sea to die. Mordred is not killed, however. A fisherman and his wife take him in. Many years later, Murdered finds out who he is and is taken away from the fisherman and his wife. He goes to live with his mother, Morgause, and her husband and five sons. When is older, he goes to Camelot to become a knight of Arthur. Mordred is disappointed in Camelot; his father doesn't acknowledge that Mordred is his son. In fact, he doesn't seem to care about the Prophecy Merlin made about Mordred, either. And at court Mordred is a loner. Who wants to be friendly to the boy who will kill their Great King? He runs away from Camelot. During this he starts to go crazy. He has mixed emotions about his father, a voice inside his head tells him to hate Arthur; while Mordred tries to tell himself he loves his father. He tries to change his destiny, and finally, crazy from the voices inside his head, he kills Arthur out of desperation. He is driven to do what he was fated to do.

As I have already said, WOW!!!!"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"From the very day Mordred was born, he was fated to kill King Arthur, father and uncle, for he was the son of the King and his half-sister Morgause. Merlin convinced the King to put his son and 39 other boy babys' out to sea and he did. As fate begain, Mordred was the only baby alive when a fisherman found him. Even later Mordred was discovered by Nyneve, who probably was the only one who cared about him and took him to his mother. Nyneve was afraid of him being in the had of Morgan la Fay, who would wish King Arthur ill. His mother didn't like him, nor did her husband, King Lothe. It is there that he finds the truth of his true heritage. All Mordred wants is the love for the father he has never known. When Mordred is old enough, he sets out to Camelot to seek his father's love, and for him to admit that he is his son, but it doesn't happen. He is shunned by most for the prophesy by Merlin and also because of this, he shall never know love, for he is feared.

This book puts you into the life of the 'evil' Mordred, and shows how maybe he was a normal boy, except for being hated because of the prophecy, and how he dealt with it. It's very well written, and though sad, it is definitely worth your time to read it."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"This is the one of the well-written and enjoyable books about Arthurian lore. It is about Sir Mordred of Lothian, son of the Very King Arthur and his step-sister Morgause. Even before Mordred was born, the wizard Merlin prophesied that Arthur would have an evil and unnatural son. He predicted that one day the king would be killed in battle by him. As Mordred grows up, he must live with the fact that he must one day carry out his fate. I really liked this book. Each character is thoroughly believable and realistic. Unlike nearly every other book about him, &quot;I Am Mordred&quot; takes a close look at not the treacherous villian, but the human side of him in this unforgettable tale from Camelot."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I became fascinated by Mordred after reading 'The Winter Prince' by Elizabeth Wein (a book I heartily recommend), and have been reading every book about him that I can get my hands on. 'I Am Mordred' came across as OK when compared to those other books, but it wasn't great.This book is about victims. Mordred is portrayed as a confused, innocent teen who fights half-heartedly against his fate. Women are also portrayed as victims. Not just some women, but all women. This annoyed me. 'Poor Mordred,' Nancy Springer seems to say. 'Poor, poor women.'It is my opinion that Nancy Springer was fighting too hard to get us to like Mordred. He could do no wrong. I think I would have liked to read about a more bitter, less confused Mordred, who truly tried to fight against the prophecy made about him. Nancy Springer could have written about someone who was not perfect, but still likable. I would have sympathized more with someone who showed initiative, even if he turned out to be a victim anyway.I did like the portrayal of King Arthur, and the book was well-written, and even moving, though it was simplistic in its own little way, with Good!Mordred, Brutish!Men and Poor!Women. There were a few Medieval Urban Legends thrown into the mix as well, but otherwise, the Arthurian world is described nicely.The ending was satisfying and convincing, and probably saved the book. All in all, I give it three stars. It's not long, and it's quite interesting."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"In the story I am Mordred, by Nancy Springer, a new side of the Arthurian Legend is revealed. The reader will learn not just about Mordred's (son of King Arthur) betrayal, but also about his youth. Springer stipulated a fair job on restoring the legend and guides the reader through Mordred's lifelong quest to earn Arthur's approval.I am Mordred demonstrates a different retelling of the classic King Arthur tale. Springer's version is quite unique, and introduces characters such as Mordred's fishermother and fisherfather, who raised him almost from birth, Nyneve, who brought him to Arthur's kingdom, Camelot, and many other characters. In the story Mordred has to prove fate wrong, and unite with his noble father. The book is split into four parts, The White Shadow, The White Stag, The White Falcon, and The Raven... all different periods in Mordred's life.I thought the story was decently written, however it was not one of the better books I have read. Some points in the story were dull and others were interesting. I would recommend this book to an older age group. 13 years and up would be about right. Some parts of the story were confusing and would lose a younger readers attention."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"It had seemed like a good book when I had started reading it, but, no, it wasn't, and for a lot of different reasons. The first (and probably the most annoying) is the way the author sets this character up: in a good story, you'd want to make your audience sad when they die. When Mordred died, I was very happy. When Arthur lived, I was disappointed. When Mordred didn't die, I wondered what the point of the story was. To make everyone hate Mordred? Um, that's already happened, Miss Springer. The second, is its details, which were not only boring, but pointless. The third, is that I couldn't stop reading it. Really, I wanted to rush this over to the nearest recycling center, but the book won't relieve you of its awfulness. If ever you concider this book, DON'T READ IT! I'd never read a bad book until I read I AM MORDRED."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"IT wasn't that this book was poorly written or that it was totally bad. It's just the author has taken both heros and villians and turned the tables completely around.In all the other books I have read, Mordred is an evil, treacherous villian no better than his half sister, the witch Morgan le Fay. Here he is portrayed as merely confused and scared. I for one am also scared. We have lost the boundry between good and evil and when that boundry is taken away people begin to really think good is evil and evil is good. And when that happens, total anarchy ensues.I highly recommend that you DO NOT read this book as well as it's counterpart \\"I am Morgan Le Fay\\". THe philosophy is too dangerous to get involved in.HOwever, if you're looking for a great story from Camelot I highly recommend \\"KIng Arthur and His KNights\\" By ANthony MOckler. I have read many king Arthur books and by far this is the best out there. At least someone can get the story right!"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"One of the most enigmatic and mysterious characters of Arthurian legend is Arthur's illegitimate son, Mordred. Unfortunately, he is also one of the least explored. In a market flooded with preachy, badly-written Arthuriana, \\"I Am Mordred\\" shines like a rare, dark gem.The book opens with King Arthur sadly setting dozens of newborn babies adrift on the ocean. Several years later, we see a young boy living peacefully with a fisherman and his wife. Their happy lives are interrupted when a woman named Nyneve rides in to bring Mordred back to his biological family, the royal family of Lothian. However, they are not pleased to see him.He soon finds out why: he is the product of incest between King Arthur and his half-sister Morgause, and is destined to kill his father someday. Shocked by this, Mordred goes to Camelot and soon begins craving his father's love and acceptance. He is also terrified of the prophecy that he will kill Arthur, and does everything he can to fight it. But can he fight his destiny, or only fulfil it?This is probably the best book I've read by Nancy Springer, a dark, beautiful, suspenseful and very sad novel. It's very rare to find an inspired Arthurian novel with any new material, but she pulls it off by creating a new Mordred -- this is not the monster who wants to kill Arthur for no reason, but a confused young man who only wants to be loved by his father, while knowing he is doomed to destroy him.One of the primary themes is whether a person is \\"born bad\\"; Mordred has, in his lifetime, done nothing wrong. Yet he is treated as a pariah by the people around him. His loneliness is broken only by Arthur and by Mordred's dog, Gull. While traditional Arthurian legends seem to be based around the idea of Mordred being evil because of his incestuous conception, Springer simply breaks those ideas apart. Nobody is simply born to be evil. Destiny and fate are some of the items that are also explored: Mordred seeks a way to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, but risks fulfilling it through avoidance.Mordred is an incredibly appealing character. He's merely a shy, introspective teenager who has been shunned by his relatives and by others in Camelot. His desperation is present on almost every page, as is his isolation, but Springer makes it sympathetic. Nobody will want to say \\"just shut up and quit whining\\"; rather, they'll be hoping that Mordred can somehow beat the prophecy, while knowing that he's all but certain to fail. Arthur is a good supporting character, surprisingly complex. Springer portrays him as an essentially good man who committed a terrible crime in an effort to save himself and his kingdom, and who regrets it. He wants to love Mordred as Mordred wants to be loved, but is as afraid of the prophecy as Mordred is.Springer's writing is descriptive and evocative; it's a little flowery, but not too flowery. She has an excellent sense of buildup and suspense, that grows as the book progresses. The first and last chapters are written in third-person style, which may seem like a jolt when most of the book is written from Mordred's perspective; however, it becomes clear why this is necessary.I would not advise this book for younger children. There's no objectionable content in it, but a great deal of focus on incest and the social stigmas attached to children born of it. The overall storyline is rather dark and occasionally violent, and Mordred's perpetual struggle against fate is a very psychologically intense storyline that may upset smaller children. Mature 9-12 kids and all teens ought to be able to handle this, and all the subtle undertones and nuances.You'll be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful and original Arthurian book published in recent years. \\"I Am Mordred\\" is an amazing addition to anyone's library, whether they are a fan of Camelot or not."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"One day you're just this normal little kid and the next you find out that you are the son of a king who tried to kill you.

So king Athur killed all of the baby boys of that year, well Mordred survived. He grew up and became a knight of the round table and served Authur until that fateful day, when the prophecy was supposed to come true. Read this book to find out what happens to Mordred. This book is probably one of the saddest books that I have ever read. It is also one of the best written books that I have read. The suspense of it kept me right on the edge of my seat the whole way through. To see Mordred's fate unfolding right in front of him will live you breathless at times.

A real page turner."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I think this book was the greatest. It sucks you in and makes you want to keep reading.

I am so glad I did because I think it is even better than Morgan le Fay, although I do recommend both books.Cursed from the day he was born, Mordred must live with his awful fate that he will, one day, be the one who kills King Arthur of Camelot. Mordred is the bastard son of Arthur and his half-sister, Morgause--the evil product of incest. To try to avoid fate, King Arthur tries to kill Mordred, along with hundreds of baby boys, but Mordred, of course, survives. Mordred survies to live with a fishermen family before one day moving to live with his \\"mother\\" Queen Morgause of Lothian. There, he is raised as one of her sons, and when he turns fifteen, he is sent to King Arthur, as all young lads are. He learns more about his horrible fate, and although he hates his father for trying to murder him, he cannot help but feel for this noble man the king, and struggling between his soul and fate, Mordred tries to save King Arthur and himself. Mordred is so much more well-rounded, and he's a character that readers can empathize with. Readers will read as Mordred struggles with his inner \\"demon\\" so to speak and his loving, tender side. The Lady of the Lake, Merlin, and Morgan le Fay are only a few of the characters that come alive in this portrayal of Mordred, and they play very important roles in Mordred's story. It is lyrically written, one of the better Camelot books I have read. It is a little short, but still a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Before I read this book, I had never read any stories just about Mordred. I love Arthurian lore, and this is a great book portraying Merlin in a new light."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"\\"I am Mordred\\" Is a book retelling the afamed story of Camelot, the hero king Arthur, his beautiful queen Guinevere, and his trusted knight Lancelot, along with his witch sister Morgan Le Fay and Merlin. Mordred is shown in a new light as Nancy Springer shows him as a boy growing into a grim fate. Hated by the kingdom, his name whispered through corridors, all fearing him even as a baby. I really felt everything he was going though and recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I originally took I am Mordred out from the school library under recommendation from the librarian. I did not think it would be any good, but as soon as I read just one chapter into the book I was hooked. I again ended up reading it twice during the renting period and again twice the next year. NO matter how many times I read about Mordred and his faithfull companion Gull, I am not bored because, no matter how many times you read it, it is just a good book."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"How would you feel if you were destined to kill the greatest king that Camelot ever saw? What would you do if that same king were your very own father? These are the two things that Mordred, son of the wise and noble King Arthur, must live with all his life in this enchanting novel. All of Mordred's life, his name has been the most feared in Camelot. When he was born to King Arthur, Merlin, a wizard, prophesized that Mordred would kill his father. The people believed this and to prevent his death, King Arthur was forced to put his baby in a boat and send him off to sea. However, Mordred miraculously survived and when he was six years-old, then living with a fisherman and wife, he was taken to his mother, Queen Morgause, King Lothe, her husband and king of Lothian, and their sons Gaiwan and Garet. However, Lothian does not feel like home, mostly because he is never called son, so he decides to go to Camelot when he is 15. About a year before he is due to leave, his brother gets mad and tells Mordred about Merlin's prophecy. After he hears this, Mordred decides to try and fight his fate. In Camelot, it feels a little bit more like home, but not completely. He still is not called son. When Mordred is knighted, he goes on a quest and finds Merlin. The wizard, now in bird's form, shows Mordred how he will kill Arthur. Mordred returns to Camelot more determined than ever to fight his destiny. The book I Am Mordred was mostly good. One plus was all of the plot twists. However, some of them were a bit confusing. Another plus was adding a more magical touch in the story of Camelot. Normally, all you hear about is Merlin and dragons. I think the addition of magical trails, castles, and sorceresses helped Nancy Springer a lot. Although the plot is difficult, kids from grades five to nine would like it. I think it is the kind of material that young teens might enjoy. For these reasons, I give I Am Mordred by Nancy Springer a four out of five stars."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I loved this book !It is not only for adults ,i am 14.

If you like fantasy and magic you will like this book. ~Angela(Wilma's daughter)"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"If you like stories of adventure, suspense and magic, I am Mordred is the book for you! I am Mordred is exiting, adventurous and filled with suprises. The book is about Mordred, the son of King Arthur. The story is told by Mordred. The story begins when Merlin predicted that king Arthur would die at his only son's hands in battle, and that son would take the throne. Because of this, when Mordred was only a baby, he was sent out into the sea in a small boat to die. He survived and was found by an old fisherman. Mordred lived in a small village with the fisherman's family. When he was 6, a sorceress named Nyneve came to take hima to Lothian for his safety.Nyneve wanted to help Mordred,. She had been melins apprentice, but then mastered him and imprisoned him. She wanted to show the world that Merlin was nothing but a trickster, and that his phrophecy was just a lie. She left Mordred at the castle in Lothian. As Mordred grows, he learns about his past and his terrible fate. When Mordred turned 15, he went to Camelot to become a knight and serve King Arthur.All Mordred wants is for his father to love him. After he is knighted, he goes on a quest to fight his fate and save his father, whom he both loves and hates. Nyneve helps him along the way. The journey is full of adventure and danger, but if you want to find out what happens, you should read the book. I thought the book was great, and I had a hard time putting it down. This book is one of my favorites and I give it five stars. I would recommend it to everyone who loves adventures and suspense."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"This book was a lot better than &quot; I am Morgan le Fay&quot;.

I've always loved tales written of Camelot, especially those in relation to Morgan Le Fay.I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good read as well as an imaginative look at Camelot and the way fate cannot be escaped."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I've read the book twice, once as a teen and now again as an adult. Both times I finished the book wetting it with tears.the story not only questions fate, but how should one meet the fate if it cannot be changed. It is perhaps the only Arthurian book I know of that portrayed Mordred in a positive light and explored Mordred's character in great depth. It also turned many characters around: such as making Merlin more of a villain and Nyneve (Nimue) a good character, and the brave knights more like brutes and the \\"cowardy\\" Mordred more like goodness.Mordred is the character that is \\"fated\\" to be evil. But is he? He did not believe it and fought for it in every way. Until it utterly defeated him into acceptance. But in the end he triumphed in every way. The ending of the book is a bittersweet ending but also can be seen as a happy one. It is the only book that ends with Arthur surviving death that I know of, but many could seen it as Mordred's final assault on the horrible and unfair fate that he was born into.The book is short but very heavy. Springer's writing style is captivating in that she did not need to make a book long such as the Mists of Avalon to give you a vivid adventure and making points come out; she makes each interesting scenes short and grasping, and with each chapter your heart wrenches in sympathy with Mordred and what he is going through.advise: definitely grab a tissue box when you are reading it."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I Am Mordred, by Nancy SpringerIn \\"I Am Mordred,\\" Springer recounts the life of King Arthur's illegitimate son, the son who will kill him. Mordred's typically gotten a bad rap or been ignored in Authurian stories, and Springer takes a different approach and tries to show what led to him killing Arthur.Because Mordred was conceived by Arthur and his half-sister, he was considered morally evil as soon as he was born. Springer examines Mordred through the lens of today, where most people assume children are born innocent. In this book, Mordred is an ordinary teen, struggling to come to terms with learning who his parents are, sibling rivalry, and the feeling that he doesn't quite fit in.I thought the premise was interesting, but the book doesn't stand out much for me. It's a book I read, momentarily enjoyed, and forgot a few days later. I'd recommend this for fans of Aurthruian tales, or anyone interested in Mordred.2/5."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"This book focuses on Sir Mordred, Arthur's only son to his sister Morgana. It is a worthy read for would be Knights of the Round Table. In Excalibur, it is Mordred who causes Arthur's downfall to a final fated duel. In the process, he kills most of Arthur's knights single handedly or with the aid of his own minions of evil. A so so look at Artur's son. I rented it at a local library."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Nancy Springer creates the most sympathetic \\"bad seed\\" character in Mordred. His tale of trying to fight his fate is intriguingly horrible and sad. Mordred finds love--in Nyneve as a mentor, in Gull as a companion, in Lynette as a possible love. And all of it is lost because of his curse.When Mordred and Arthur discuss their entwined fates and Mordred says, \\"What have I done?\\" the result is heart wrenching. By this point in the novel (Part Four) it has become abundantly clear that Mordred is a good soul, a fighter, someone to connect with and care about. And yet, he has no control over how his life will turn out.The death of Gull is one of the most upsetting deaths in all of literature. Mordred's one true companion, Mordred's only friend. When he buries her beautiful whiteness under the dirt, the starkness of the white/black contrast is fantastic.Cheers to Nancy Springer for such a powerful tale that always leaves me emotionally changed after reading."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"WOW! I am a huge Arthurian legend fan and know a good deal about it. This is my favorite book!However, I would not recommend this book for anyone who is into the whole 'King Arthur's so great' and/or 'Mordred was born evil.' No one was born evil, and if your father tried to kill you because HE screwed up, you'd be ticked off, too!I am a fantasy writer myself, and I found this book absolutely amazing! Springer showed that Mordred was NOT born evil, and that he tried to fight his fate. I like to think that if Mordred had lived, he would of been like this.The whole book is amazing- and the end is so sad! I'm not a sentimental person and I cried (in school I was reading, so that was just great :-)People, you need 2 read this book!"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Interesting to have a story of just Mordred and why he became what he became..."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I liked the book even though half way through you know the ending.

The characters are very well written and there is always a lot going on. In fact, I couldn't put the book down. Towards the end of the story I felt as though Mordred was someone I knew in real life, and in fact, I wept for him towards the end. He fulfilled his destiny, and what a sad destiny it was.The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because, I felt as though the story could have been a bit longer, just to detail a bit more on Mordred's experiences in life. Wonderful book though!"},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Most people familiar with the Arthur legend know of the father-son conflict between Arthur and his illegitmate son, Mordred, a product of a one night stand with Morgause, Arthur's half sister. Because of the unfortunate events leading up to his conception, Mordred is seen as being born evil, predestined to do harmful acts. The wizard Melin phrophesizes that Mordred's fate is to kill his father and destroy Camelot. Thus Arthur tries to kill Mordred when he was a baby, yet Mordred is saved by a fisherman and his wife. When young Mordred learns of his true identity, he rides to Camelot hoping to become a knight and finally get to know his famous father. Yet Camelot is not what Mordred had hoped for. His father, Arthur, doesn't even so much as acknowledge him and the affection that Mordred hopes Arthur would show him is nonexistent. Mordred becomes a loner in Camelot and soon begins to hear voices in his head telling him to fulfill his phrophecy. Mordred, longing for Arthur's love and acceptance, would do almost anything to cheat his destiny, even selling his soul.I Am Mordred is one of the best works on Mordred I have ever seen. He is one of the most misunderstood characters in the myth and the preconception that he is evil because of the circumstances of his conception is quite unfair. Springer tries, and effectively, pictures Mordred as a young man trying to fight his destiny, yet the more he tries, the more closer he comes to fulfilling the fate we all know happened. The reader feels very sympathetic towards Mordred, yet sits there unable to save him. In the end you realize that Mordred was not what the famous Arthur authors wrote him to be, born evil, but instead a boy that needed love and attention from a father he so wanted acceptance from, but in the came up empty. Like I am Morgan Le Fay, this book is more of a physcological work that raises new questions to previous assumptions. I definitely recommend this book to all fans of Camelot. It is one of the best."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"Mordred was born destined to kill his own father, the great King Arthur. Merlin prophesied that fact; it was his fate.

The reader fights along with Mordred, throughout the whole book, to try and save his life, as well as his father's. It is a very emotional ride as Mordred fights with his inner demons and tries to change his destiny. It's hard not to feel bad for Mordred through his struggles.

This book never had a dull or boring part in it, I couldn't put it down. Nancy Springer wrote this book very well and really put the complex King Arthur stories into a more simpler, kid-version story. If you're looking for a good, quick, fantasy book, this is the perfect one."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I Am Mordred is a fascinating and exciting book. It begins with a young boy, about nine years old. He lives with his adopted family who found him in a small boat at sea. He lives his life happily until Lady Nyneve comes and takes him to his true mother, Queen Moragause. On the way to his mother and step-father's castle however, he learns who his real father is and, what his fate is. Foretold by the magician Merlin, it was said that Mordred will kill his father in battle. Not only is it a heinous crime to kill but Mordred's father is none other than King Arthur. The book continues to show how Mordred tries many times to save himself from the scornful eyes of the entire country and also save his father from this fate. Mordred gets very little help on his journey. He only has Lady Nyneve, his faithful dog Gull, his brothers Gawain and Garret, and lastly the king himself. However, they all help him at some point. For instance, Nyneve helps him escape from Morgan Le Fay's castle, Gawain and Garret train Mordred to be a knight, and Gull helps him to face his fears and accompanies him through out his journey. Lastly King Arthur helps him to relieve the pain of his life.The book is full of revenge, such as Gawain and Garret killing their father's murderer. The book also has several points of betrayal, an example being Mordred's aunt. Morgan Le Fay trapping him in her castle.Mordred is the main character in the story. He only wants people to not judge him and to be able to settle down and live his life peacefully. Nyneve wants almost the exact same thing only with one crucial change; instead of people not judging her, she wants to be an equal to the men of the court. Gawain and Garret just want to serve King Arthur and King Arthur wants to please everyone. By putting all of these characters together, Nancy Springer has achieved a high place on my respected authors list.Historically, the book itself is only semi-accurate. It shows fighting with swords as illustrated on page 83 \\"Gawain swung his sword\\". It shows what the main form of transportation at the time was horses as shown on page 78 \\"Pellinore sent his charger into the courtyard\\". It shows many of the beliefs that were common at the time such as the king being able to heal the sick. But it introduces magic at a very early point. By magic, I don't mean pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but more like shooting lightning out of your hand and killing someone. Fairly early on in the book, Mordred learns to scry. Scrying is a form of magic in which you can see what other people are doing and where they are. Later on in the book someone turns in to a bird then disappears. Someone also has their soul stolen.I feel that this book is aimed at more sophisticated readers who are prepared for anything. The book requires some endurance to read because often there is lots of boredom followed by lots of excitement in a repeated pattern. The book can also be very emotional, especially during the final chapters. Also the book gets quite violent, so young readers beware.I truly enjoyed reading \\"I Am Mordred\\" and I think that you will too."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I listened to \\"I, Mordred\\" as a recorded book (read by Steven Crossley). I checked it out of the library not expecting much -- how could someone write a sympathetic \\"autobiography\\" of Mordred, the man who destroyed Camelot? But it was actually very engaging and plausible, within its fantasy history. And Crossley's reading was excellent.Warning: possible spoilers ahead for those who like to discover a book's characters for themselves through reading.As one who enjoyed T.H. White's classic Arthurian novel \\"The Once and Future King,\\" I found it interesting to read a completely different take on the characters. Arthur is so noble he's almost a figurehead here. Guinevere and Lancelot barely appear as characters at all (the main story ends without telling its well-known conclusion in detail). Merlin the wise advisor is extremely unsympathetic if not evil, and Nyneve (sp), the sorceress who enchants and imprisons him, is good. (There's a little feminist thread running through the novel as well.) Gawaine is coarser and bloodier than in TOaFK, and Gareth is essentially a carbon copy of his brother, a complete departure from the beautiful, gentle Gareth in TOaFK. Pellinore, who was an amiable clown in TOaFK, is a loathesome brute in \\"I, Mordred.\\"The story covers only the first two years of Mordred's time at Camelot, and the device that is used to explain how this sensitive young man came to be capable once and for all of such calcutated evil is a little (but just a little) weak. But all in all this was a compelling book to listen to and it succeeded well in painting a sympathetic portrait of a man whose good will and best efforts could not change his fate."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"I am Mordred is the story about the life of Mordred of Lothian. Mordred's life has always been filled with sorrow. It all started when he was a baby. The great King Arthur put Mordred, along with many other babies, into a carrier and set it adrift in the ocean. Miraculously, Mordred did not seem to perish like the other babies. When Mordred grew older, he was taken to meet his \\"birth parents\\", the King of Lothian and his wife Morgause. His life didn't seem to change. In fact, his mother always seemed to neglect him and he was always being teased by his two brothers. Mordred finally realizes the reason behind his mistreatment when his brother Garet reveals to him that he's King Arthur and Morgause's child born of incense destined to kill Arthur. When Mordred finally leaves his home at Lothian to receive his training as a knight in Camelot, he is warned by his brothers that he can never mention that King Arthur is his father. However, that's the only thing Mordred wants from his king, to be adored as a son and not a nephew. As King Arthur starts to grow on him, Mordred starts trying to avoid his fate by going on quests. Though, fighting his destiny gets tougher for him everyday when he is constantly being reminded of people's expectations of him by the Blind Harper's raven.After reading the sensational I am Morgan le Fay, I decided I just had to read I am Mordred. My favorite parts of I am Mordred are the scenes when he is accompanied with his faithful brachet hound, Gull. I liked these parts of the story because whenever Mordred was with Gull, she always took his mind off his problems. I was glad Gull was given to Mordred because Nyneve and she were the only people who ever showed their love for Mordred. I'm one of many who believe that the only thing anyone needs is love. All Mordred wanted was for King Arthur to love him as a son. I don't even want to think about how terrible Mordred's life would have been if Gull was never in his life, or if Nyneve never showed him what love was. However, I do often wonder how Mordred's life would have been if Arthur had listened to Nyneve and showed his love towards Mordred.I am Mordred was very depressing, but it always kept me wanting to read more. I enjoyed many parts of the book, but what I mainly disliked about it was the ending. It was well-written, but it was so depressing that I was glum for the remainder of the day. I was disheartened because it was only after the book when I realized how grief-stricken his life was. I'm more fond of I am Morgan le Fay only for the fact that it dealt with fairies. Other than that, I believe both characters are similar to one another since they both had a chance to change their destiny. Fate only takes you so far, but it's up to you to make the move which can determine what is to follow."},{"Title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale from Camelot","review":"The writing in this book is like seductive, captivating music which lures one in.

Kwitny's research is exhaustive and his even handed way of presenting his findings is exemplary of fine journalism. The implications hatched in this veritable can of worms will have net-sleuths busy for years tracing the myriad references to the numerous associates of Nugan Hand who vanished into the night only to surface again in the Irangate scandal.

Even though some of the principals are dead, nobody has been held accountable for the myriad of crimes that have occurred abroad. With the lack of support rendered by the U.S. government (especially the F.B.I.), it makes one wonder how \\"former\\" some of these players really were.

Goals and objectives of each subsection of each chapter (88 in all) clearly lay out key concepts, vocabulary and reading strategy. Key concepts and new terms embedded in text are shown in bold. SI measuring units are used exclusively. The end of each chapter includes a sample laboratory, a Study Guide broken down by key concepts and vocabulary; Assessment and Understanding Concepts, Critical Thinking, Concepts in Action and Standardized Test Preparation.The text has an added chapter 13A, California's Resources and Natural Hazards, to meet California Science Standards. Ancillary materials include: Test Bank CD, 22 x 28 cm transparencies covering the whole text, VHS & DVD Discovery Channel \\"Field Trips\\", a \\"GEODe: Earth Science CD\\" - reproducing most of the 800-page text. Excellent NSTA SciLinks and other web resources make the text web interactive.Rocks are treated systematically using color, texture and composition. The treatment of soils is archaic and weak. Appendix I includes \\"World Soils\\" but only discusses 10 of the 13 soil orders. Clouds receive minimal treatment and readers should make use of GLOBE (www.globe.gov) protocols and learning activities. El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) omits any mention of the Southern Oscillation. Meteorology graphics are excellent. Climate only includes K&ouml;ppen and omits Thornthwaite, Mather & Feddemas' Climatic Water Budget Analysis. Climate and discussion of water both omit evapotranspiration and soil water-holding capacity. The confluence of the Sacramento & San Joaquin Rives and San Francisco Bay is called a \\"delta\\" while it is actually an estuary. Astronomy is well treated in 4 chapters, however, Pluto is called \\"Planet X\\" when 2004 discoveries identify Sedna as the next planet beyond Pluto. Map scale gets one paragraph with no discussion of Representative Fraction (RF).The section on Science Skills is very good including basic process skills, experimental methods, safety, reading and study skills, graphic organizers, math skills include scientific notation, data tables, histograms and circle and line graphs.While many science texts constantly increase in thickness and content each year and instructors and student race to cover more and more material, the 800 pages here have a \\"just right\\" feel. When used with student-generated Cornell notes, AVID techniques and hands-on laboratories, this helps provide a solid foundation for an introductory course in Earth Science.Future editions will greatly improve by alignment with other standards: AAAS Project 2061, GLOBE, Math, National Science Education Standards and TIMSS."},{"Title":"Dating Game #3: Can True Love Survive High School?

Its the type of story most girls in juniorhigh believes is going to play out as her actual life or something similar to it when she gets to high school.One thing I like about how Natalie wrote the book is for each chapter she offered a horoscope for the character she was talking about, which foreshadowed whats going to happen next in the book. I also liked how she made an effort to make each of the characters totally different from each other, with their own (the characters) trials and tribulations.However I felt like I've read this book a million times over so nothing surprised me.Overall only the person reading the book can most best decide how they feel about the book.

Each book provides enough background information on thecharacters so that you can pick up the last book, which I also read,and it will still be an excellent read, as well as understandable.This book is full of unsuspected twists and turns that just keepadding to the excitement.

Madison's mother has written an autobiographical play that is being produced, and she wants Madison and her younger sister to portray her in it. Madison is not thrilled, to say the least. Lina hopes to start something with Dan at a party, but begins to realize that perhaps he is not the best choice for a teenage girl.As with the first two installments, Standiford's strengths are her characters and humor. Readers will be able to relate to Holly, Madison and Lina, and the situations in which they find themselves. This series continues to be a humorous and realistic look at life in high school.--- Reviewed by Melissa A.

The story is a modern spy thriller with a unique twist. -SPOILER- In Russia there is a small plateau populated by a Warrior race. A very narrow path leads up to their country, easily defended. Any visitor must play the \\"Terrible Game\\" -and- survive, before they can interact with locals. The game involves multiple contests of horsemanship, archery, wrestling, and swordsmanship with the hooked swords. In 500 years...none have survived.

First, he must win the \\"Terrible Game\\"."},{"Title":"The Terrible Game","review":"Do NOT judge this book by the movie \\"Gymkata\\" which was loosely based upon it. The book \\"The Terrible Game\\" is epic in scope involving in part a Soviet parachute assault on the tiny country of Burlanke (which is surrounded by Soviet territory) and the Game scenes involve hundreds of competitors. The premise is that outsiders must compete in a series of events while being chased by hundreds of warriors who are free to kill them at certain stages in the competition. The winner is granted whatever he desires. The book involves an American agent who participates in the game with the hope that by winning he can have a US nuclear base built there. The movie updates the book ie \\"Star Wars\\" program defensive weapons in the movie vs. nuclear missile sites in the book but is a pale comparison at best. I first read the book as a child and was very happy when I was able to obtain a copy a few years ago."},{"Title":"The Terrible Game","review":"Can't find this book?

D.","review":"I recently re-discovered this book after reading it some 20 years ago. I was amazed at the parallels between the Han lifestyle and our own growing dependence on the internet for our commerce and entertainment. Knowing that the story was written in 1919 makes the predictions even more startling. The idea of &quot;gangs&quot; supplanting family life in America is also strangely prophetic. As to the story itself, what a fantastic tale of American ingenuity overcoming incredible odds! The triumph of the forest-dwelling Americans over the slovenly, city-dwelling Han is at once an inspiration and a cautionary tale. I'd say this seminal &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; tale is far superior to the pulp science fiction which followed in its footsteps. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in early 20th Century sci-fi, or anyone who just likes a good yarn."},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A. D.","review":"This is one of the few books I drag out every couple of years and dive into. While lacking starships and space battles like its modern adaptations it's packed with solid ideas about man, civilization, its decline, war, and core characters that deliver. It's not long, just 196 pages, but it's crammed with quick action and a fast moving story so you won't be bored. Plus you'll never be bogged down with 10 pages of exposition trying make the science fit the story. Come on, take the ride. Again and again."},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A. D.","review":"Forget the Television series. *This* is Buck Rogers. Thrown forward into an Earth of the distant future ruled by the evil Han empire, Rogers enlists with a group of American guerrillas to overthrow the oppressors. It features great early s-f devices--airships, anti-grav belts, and the like. Very reminiscent of ER Burroughs' &quot;Barsoom&quot; novels. Great fun, a great read."},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A.

He awakes to find American under occupation and leads the fight for their freedom."},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A. D.","review":"I first read this book in childhood, and then several times later over the years. It is a great example of early 20th century sci-fi. More interestingly it sheds some light on the outlook and attitudes of the early 1900's and American national identity in particular. The crude stereotype of the Han 'anti-Asian' sentiments disguised by the possibility that they were 'mutated' by some aliens who crashed in Asia. The god given right of the white Americans to re-ascend from barbarism and take their rightful place as top dogs.Having said that, the book seems more naive, rather than xenophobic in it's representations. I suspect this is more to do with the time it was written than anything else.I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the history of Sci-Fi, or who just enjoys a good old-fashioned tale."},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A.

D.","review":"Armageddon 2419 A.D. (1928) by Philip Francis Nowlan - 98 pages - rating: 5.5/10This story never gets into outer space. The plot surrounds the struggle of Americans fighting a guerilla war against invaders who have taken control of US soil hundreds of years earlier.The name \\"Buck\\" as in Buck Rogers never appears in this book. The characters name is actually Anthony Rogers. He is referred to only as \\"Rogers\\" throughout the story. The name Buck was introduced in subsequent graphic novels to presumably improve marketing appeal.It is interesting to read this short novel to gain a historical perspective on the origins of science fiction adventure. Although entirely straightforward the writing style itself is not particularly engaging or exciting. The term \\"flat\\" best describes the result. I read this book primarily for research reasons.Much to my surprise the sequel entitled \\"The Airlords of Han\\"(1929 - 102 pages) which was included in the same volume, was quite enjoyable (7.0/10). The two stories are integrated into a single novel of 195 pages, 17 chapters, without any indication as to the point at which one novel ends and the second begins.Overall I enjoyed having read the 2 stories although one could say that while The Airlords of Han would be enjoyed by anyone who likes early science fiction adventure, the original Buck Rogers story itself (Armageddon 2419 A.D.) should be saved for readers under 12 years of age.Claus Kellermann2006 March 26Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"The Book of Literary Lists: A Collection of Annotated Lists, Statistics, and Anecdotes Concerning Books","review":"A very rich book filled with unusual literary facts in abundance.

Of love and the inability to express it but from afar and embracing the anguish and tumult of it all for that is life! Mann knows the struggle, the mark of Cain as Hesse put it, and offers a guide for those with little dust in their eyes and comfort that you alone my friend are not mad and that the madness is not bad but nothing merely there to embrace and see. I highly recommend this short story for the artist in us all."},{"Title":"Tonio Kroger","review":"In this short novella, more so than in his other works, Thomas Mann parades his artistic pretensions with navet&eacute; and inadvertent honesty. Oh, how the poor artist has to suffer, oh, how he must suppress his feelings in order to arrive at an artistic end-product, oh, how he has to put up with the conventions and inconveniences of surrounding bourgeois life. As thoroughly bourgeois as the man next door, whom he nevertheless sneers at, Mann contrives a tale both silly and flawed. In between the lines, he confesses to homoerotic tendencies, making sure to stay well within a well-honed bourgeois sense of decorum.To all this there are but two intriguing aspects. First there is the suggestion that Schiller's \\"Don Carlos\\" admits of a homoerotic deconstruction, which however is not conclusively explored, and is introduced more as a hint or a tease. Then there is the line, \\"God damn the spring! ... It is and always has been the ghastliest part of the year\\" Written in 1903, this is very likely the source of T.S. Eliot's \\"April is the cruelest month...\\" written in 1922. Mann has Tonio deliver the spring-damning line to the cardboard character pompously named Elisabeta Ivanovna --- somebody seems to have overdosed on Tolstoy and the other Russians --- while his Anglo-American \\"disciple\\" follows up, eleven lines down from his own April-complaint, with \\"Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\\" Quite appropriate company, if you think of it."},{"Title":"Tonio Kroger","review":"I Found this story to be the tale of a self-indulgent, self absorbed, and truly arrogant man. Tonio Kroger is an unhappy soul who hides behind the claim of being an artist. How can one put down and demean the people he wishes to be like? Tonio is the victim of poor self esteem that could be easily escapable if he would only see that he is the cause of all his &quot;suffering&quot;.

There are poems that are interesting and clever that have housewife appeal such as \\"To the Happy Wife With a Fatal Flaw\\" which begins \\"A wife who lost her shopping list\\". There are competent poems that appeal to the poet-artist crowd such as \\"Ephesus\\" which includes the lines \\"I remember you with Gibbon / with an armlock on philosophers / dragging me home from empty talk\\".

This is a not-so-subtle push for HIS classes. We all know that authors of such books make very little in royalties.

Simply as a piece of written work, Maclean writes an absolutely inspirational novella. As his introduction indicates, part of the motivation for writing his stories came from wanting to preserve a decent sense of parental identity for his children. This intention comes through in Maclean's A River Runs Through It as he uses first-person narration, which evokes a story-telling quality about the work. The reader is made to feel as though the story is truly a personal recounting of significant life events that reveal something about the main character's past concerns, how he came to some sort of resolution about those concerns, and of course, explain a few things about his identity to his listener.The way in which Maclean connects fly-fishing to family values and also to spirituality is beautiful. Norm, the main character of the book, has such an attentiveness to beauty and feels such reverence for his brother's angling ability, the reader is unable to separate the idea of fishing from an appreciable means to well-being. Time spent fly-fishing is quality time for the male members of the family, and it is especially revered by the two brothers, Paul and Norm, as they go out to the river as adults, no longer with their father. It is while fishing with their father that they learn spiritual truths, and these ideas are carried with them, in perhaps slightly different interpretations, into every expedition. A conflict arises when the respectful attitude the brothers expect at the river is difficult to arouse in others.What's interesting is that the brothers do not converse much during these outings. They are not there to lounge and chat. They are truly there to practice their skill, and they do so in separate sections of the water. The conversations that they do have are slight and perhaps a bit obscure, but meaningful. Maclean does a wonderful job presenting the methods by which male communication is relayed and interpreted. His ability to present men as dually sensitive and proud is commendable.Another thing that Maclean does well is maintain his readers' participation in the story. His explanation of fly-fishing mechanics, which does not at all distract from the story, prevents the reader from feeling detached from a possibly unfamiliar experience. In fact, a moderately involved reader will find himself or herself agreeing with the opinion that fly-fishing is the only respectable form of fishing, and will scoff together with Norm at the use of worms and \\"poles\\" rather than flies and \\"rods\\".As the story develops, it becomes apparent that one of Norm's main concerns is his ability to be helpful, and that his attempts are frustrated repeatedly. Discover what Norm learns about his concerns and responsibilities, and find out about some other provocative characters within this tale. It's a short, enjoyable read with an inspirational effect."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Having originally read A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT years before Redford's film or the recent hipness of flyfishing, I find myself still drawn to Mr. McLean's haunting and rich story of love, loss, and acceptance of the realities of life. It is not a &quot;book about flyfishing&quot;, but rather uses fishing as framework for defining and illuminating the passage of time and the connectedness he shares with his world and those he knew and loved. One does not need to know anything of fishing to appreciate this monumental work. From the oft quoted opening lines...&quot;In our family...&quot; to the final paragraph, which, by the way after several readings still makes me cry deeply, I find this book to be filled with joy, pain, loss, love, and most importantly art, which never comes easily. Get beyond the fishing thing and experience the immense depth of this one man's life."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A River Runs Through It is a story of the heart of a man and the passion for life that runs through all men. Some of us may not be aware of this when we look at our lives of struggle and mediocrity. Others may say this is a dreamer's attitude. Norman Maclean shows us how it is as natural as a river, and as powerful as a fist . This book is about men, and growing into manhood. It uses the river both as metaphor and as the dramatic backdrop for a life of a man. It is written as if every word was distilled to its purest essence, and reads as a drink of the finest wine. I read it sentence by sentence and went over many passages simply to savor the view and the feel it created in me. Read it and treasure it and give it to another man you may care about."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"If you only read three books in you life they should be &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. Norman Maclean is a wordsmith in good company with Dickens and Steinbeck. I am sad that he didn't start writing until later in life so there is not much of his work around. There is a lot detail in the book, some say too much. For me that detail mixed with a touch of sarcasm is what separates a great writer from a good one. Its the kind of detail you might hear if Mr. Maclean was in the room telling you the story in person.A word about the movie. The movie screenplay is reasonably loyal to the book and where it was not, the director of the movie made an effort to pay tribute to the author. The movie is great to but to experience all that Mr. Maclean has to offer, read the book too. The short stories in the book are also great and sometimes funny. Three good stories in one book is a great deal."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I went into this novel having already seen, and enjoyed, the movie. I had travelled to the area of the country that it was set in several times, and I had been fly-fishing while out there. But I was struck by how the book was still able to move me. Maclean's eloquent descriptions are able to come as close to transporting the reader to the place being written of as any novel I have ever read. You don't have to love the mountains, fly-fishing, or your little brother to like this book. But if you try to understand what these things meant to Maclean then you will get much more out of this wonderful work."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean has written a wonderful, deceptively simplistic novel that contains a moving thematic focus.A River Runs Through It is the story of the relationship between two brothers who, through a communication barrier, become the source of each other's opposition in life. This novel seems simple in that it contains a very simple conflict - one brother versus another. However, this novel is ambitious because the main characters within the dramatic and thematic focuses of the novel are not the same; the two brothers are the opposition to each other on both levels, serving the opposite purposes within the thematic and dramatic reading of the novel. Consequently, Maclean greatly increases the emotional conflict in the work.Paul is the main character in terms of the dramatization of the novel's themes. His actions are those that drive the novel forward; he desperately needs Norman's help, yet cannot communicate these needs. He is the center of the inciting incident, in which the sheriff contacts Norman about Paul being in jail. Paul is in serious danger and the rising action builds the suspense of whether or not he will receive help before it is too late.Norman is the main character on a thematic level. His ability and willingness to extend a hand to his brother is questioned. He battles an inner conflict that is instigated by the inciting incident. An outsider, not his own brother, knows that Paul needs his help; Norman first cannot see this, and then battles himself throughout the thematic rising action about how he should approach his brother.The lack of communication between the brothers is a huge part of the novel. Evidence for communication barriers between more than just these two characters can be found throughout the work. Pay attention to these barriers. You will see how the emotions involved in the novel make it flow as smoothly as the river itself.One of the novel's greatest strength's is the language; the beauty that is brought to the page by Maclean's endless sensory images and vivid descriptions of the setting bring this novel to life. The setting, the Montana countryside, becomes a character in the novel and is juxtaposed with the conflict. Though nature is portrayed beautifully, the nature of the two brothers and their relationship plays a detrimental role in the work. Maclean savors the moment with the immense amount of detail he provides, allowing the reader to feel as emotionally connected as possible to his characters and his novel.Maclean further appeals to our emotions in the narration of the novel. This novel is told as a flashback of Norman's point of view. Norman Maclean wrote this novel in order to cope with his feelings of guilt and regret. His love for his brother really shines through this novel.You will be captivated if you let yourself."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Growing up with a fly rod in hand and chasing wild brook trout, I knew I had to read this book. The book kept my attention and I finished it in one day. Now that I've read it six more times I've learned to appreciate the beauty of the novel. It has now become my all time favorite read."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I like the way Norman McLean handles the relationship with his brother. It is so vivid and genuine that I can almost see how things happen in front of my own eyes."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I have been a fly-fisherman since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. I was never able put down my thoughts on Fly-fishing, in the way I wanted to, or the way it meant the most to me. Norman Maclean explained everything perfectly, right down to the statement. &quot;If I hook a big one, how the Hell am I going to land it.&quot; I laughed until my sides ached when I read this, and I still smile when I think about it. Thanks for putting my thoughts on paper Mr. Maclean."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean happens to use his muse, fly fishing, to relate the intricate and subtle nature of one man's relationship with father, mother, wife and brother. Time worn, biblical themes are set down in everyman's terms and after 100 pages a boy (however old) will surely examine his relationship to those people most important to him. After numerous readings the story continues to roll the rocks in the river, revealing more of the words. I, too, am haunted by waters"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Who knew fly fishing could be so close to a religious experience? Actually, I might be doing Maclean a disservice...Who knew fly fishing could be a religious experience? Well, through Maclean's beautifully written novella the lines between religion and this peaceful pastime are blurred. But don't let your disinterest in fishing push you away from Maclean's artful exposition; instead embrace the work and the tale of two brothers who find peace and companionship in the rivers of western Montana.A River Runs Through It is a mere 104 'chapterless' pages that flow as quickly and gracefully as those waters where the boys find their peace. Maclean's exposition of the beautiful country is absolutely mesmerizing, painting wondrous landscapes in your mind with his poetically picked language. Sometimes authors can delve too far into that created world, leaving their characters unpolished in a world of realistic, splendid beauty, however, Maclean's efforts only further your understanding of his characters as they are so greatly influenced by their natural world. The landscape acts almost like another character, influencing the lives and actions of the other characters, and rightfully necessitating its major development. Yet the major development does not end with the vast landscape. Norm and Paul are both dynamic creations who draw the reader in and hold him tight as you get a glimpse into their lives, relationship, and religion.Fly fishing holds all of the key elements of life for the boys. It is religious in that it serves as a guide and anchor in their lives, yet it also spurs competition, challenge, and solidifies battered relationships. No matter the harsh realities of life, the alcoholism that plagues Paul, or the inadequacy that eats away at Norm, fly fishing provides guidance, simplicity, and peace in their lives.I never would have guessed that a fishing story could apply itself so well to the trials of life, letting the reader come away with a greater appreciation for the simple things while opening his/her eyes to the complicated bonds of brotherhood, family, and love. Enjoy this beautiful novella for its exemplary exposition and touching glimpse into the lives of two brothers, two disciples of the rod and water. You owe it to yourself and to Maclean to broaden your spiritual boundaries, not to mention really enjoy a wonderful story."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"goo"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"&quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; is my all time favorite book. It's the kind of book that leaves you hungry for more. I encourage you to check it out."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Having never seen the movie, I have a difficult time envisioning how they put this story onto film. I found the title story really well-written and very compelling. You find yourself rooting for the brothers and wishing the father could still fish like he used to.... the whole religious experience. The other stories were a little less compelling ... but did give insight into a lost way of life."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"There is something about this novel that felt like reading a classic novel that had been passed on for generations. Maclean gives a story that has so much purity to the relationships between his characters, and there is definitely a sense of innocence within the text.The story is based around the relationships of father and son, and brother to brother. Between these two relationships, Maclean explores the tribulations that come within a family, and the challenges of wanting to protect a loved one compared to having to let them make their own mistakes. Maclean has an excellent handle on conveying the true emotions that come within a bond such as these, and it gives and very honest sense to the story.The lessons given to the characters of the book take on the medium of fly fishing. There were times when these sections seemed very lengthy. But once they can be gotten throughm the reader is given a great reward by Maclean's natural ability to tighten a story and use very exact and straight forward language. This is a novel that shows a contemporary reader that we have masters of the English language all around us.I would recommend this book to anyone. It gives a very strong sense of place as well as excellent characterization. The sense of place is what makes the book have a bit of a romantic feel to it, though it revolves around the challenges between family men and their friendships.Maclean show that even when you love someone with eveything you have, you still have to let them be and make their own decisions.This book asks the questions that can be applied to many relationships between not only family members but also friendships.It is an excellent read."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A River Runs Through It and Other Stories is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of Norman Maclean's classic autobiographical novella of a generational, family love of fly-fishing that borders on religion. The river itself is a metaphor for how life flows onward, and the interconnection of all things. In addition to the Maclean's timeless classic, two more of his stories are performed on audio for the first time: \\"Logging and Pimping and 'Your Pal, Jim'\\" and \\"USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky\\". Smoothly narrated by network television actor David Manis, A River Runs Through It and Other Stories is an excellent addition to public library audiobook collections, sure to be enduringly popular. 7 CDs, 8 hours."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"i think that maclean has done a good job in describing fly fishing. it really inspired me to try it sometime. it seems to make fly fishing sound like a relaxing sport... it conveys many moods. i got a point of view from living in the woods, the mountains, etc.. roughing it.. and i realize how much harder it is than living my good ol city life. it didn't usually get boring but too much description about fly fishing got me confused at times but other than that, it was clearly understandable and readable. i'm glad i chose this book for my honors english reading... it was more of &quot;lesiure&quot; reading than &quot;forced&quot; reading."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"probably my favorite story. i'm learning to fly fish as soon as possible. has the gripping prose of cormac mccarthy but is more entertaining. very cool"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Having seen the movie some years ago, I was anxious to read this book for a book club review, and I have come away wishing I had never seen the movie, for the book is so far above it as to make it trash in all its physical beauty. Having kept my studies basically to European literature, I am now in mid-life finding all these wonderful American authors. I think this is one of the best books I have ever read about human relationships, and MacLean's descriptive style of describing nature is superb. This is definitely on my re-read list!"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I never received this item. I contacted the seller and they refunded my money."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A River Runs Through it is the work of a lifetime and the most powerful comcentration of the english language in one place that I have ever read. MacLean wrote it towards the end of his life, and in reading it you get the feeling that he spent most of his life carefully choosing each word in this short novella. I routinely pick it up and read passages from the middle of it, as one would read the bible. It is to most books as demi-glasse is to beef broth. MacLean packs so many powerful ideas into such a short space; and every reading brings out more. The novella is much more like a poem than a novel. The rythym of the language flows and eddies just like the Big Blackfoot River that is at the heart of the story. Ultimately my advice is to read it, and to read it out loud. Reading it makes me proud of being human."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A River Runs Through It is a novella that takes the art of exposition writing a step further by using vivid imagery to describe the scenes in which the main characters spend most of their time: the rivers of Montana.Due to the amount of exposition writing when first beginning to read this novella I felt as if I may have, mistakenly, picked-up a newer version of Moby Dick, a book I did not enjoy. However, I soon realized that Maclean was not trying to teach the reader how to fly fish as Melville attempted to teach the readers of Moby Dick to hunt whales. Instead, Maclean is simply describing the art and precision that accompanies the sport of fly-fishing, I was able to sit back and let the river run over me.This novella is a wonderful reminder of the simplicity of another time when families lived close to each other and there was always an outdoor retreat where families could heal their wounds while becoming one with nature. The art of fly-fishing is the sanctuary in which Paul, Norman and their father heal their wounds and bond as men.Fishing, in the Maclean family, is depicted as having the ability to reunite the family. No matter how long one brother has been absent from the family the River is able to smooth away all those months and years of betrayal. Not only is the River where sibling rivalry plays out, it is also the setting of brotherly love. The characters have an intimate language constructed within their fishing techniques that is obvious from the first images of fishing that Maclean shares with the reader.The two brothers, Paul and Norman, were raised loving two things outside of family: God and fly-fishing. They grew-up with a love of fly-fishing, which surpassed most other things in the world. Paul, the more advanced fly fisher in the family is graceful and majestic in his technique on the water. He is also the brother who gets into trouble with alcohol and gambling addictions that often land him in serious trouble. His brother, Norman on the other hand is a steady, married man that although he loves fishing, he has realized that growing-up and becoming a man is important, hence he has other responsibilities that do not allow him to fish all his free time away.This novella is crafted not only around the art of fly fishing, but also around Norman's dead-beat brother-in-law Neal and Neal's hatred of fly-fishing. Neal is a troubled man whose sister and mother are simply trying to get him on the right track. These well-intention women feel that sending Neal out fly-fishing with Paul and Norman would help Neal turn his life around. Although their intentions are noble, these women soon realize that fly-fishing may not be the answer.I absolutely adore this novella. I have never seen the movie and I prefer to keep it that way. Movies are never as good as the original novel and I would hate to ruin perfection by seeing Hollywood's rendition of fly-fishing in Montana. I encourage you to read and enjoy this novel while attempting to understand the deeper meaning that Norman Maclean is trying to share with you, the reader. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman MacLean's A river Runs Through It is a moving story written in lyrical prose. Yet I have to give it only four stars because the &quot;other stories&quot; included in the book really pale in comparison.A River Runs Through It has all the majesty and beauty of the American West written with the deep emotion and reverance MacLean attaches to fly-fishing (he compares it to religion). The other stories (&quot;Logging and Pimping&quot; and &quot;USFS 1919&quot;) relate to MacLean's experiences working in the Montana Rockies with the Forest Service, and for some reason did not move me as the former story did. His relationship with his brother in A River Runs Through It particularly spoke to me.All of MacLean's stories are good, but it is MacLean's easygoing narrative, vivid prose and almost spiritual way in which he turns a phrase that makes this book so special. It is an outstanding example of modern American writing, and should be read for such - not fishing."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A River Runs Through It...&quot;Eventually all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.&quot;Norman Maclean captivates the reader using turbulent and smooth recollection, which flows as peaceful as the story setting. Maclean describes a romantic notation, which could compare to Twain's writings, of floating down a river and observing life as it passes by. Maclean keeps the river as the median of the story, and all life revolves around it. Living life and writing about it later gave Maclean more understanding and an advantage to tell his tale. Maclean uses proverbs and lessons of life make the story easy to understand and relate to. Never before have I been so black in the face and ecstatic to get back into fly-fishing. Maclean uses such vivid images in his writings; it makes the reader believe they are at the graceful Blackfoot River of Montana. The story has the same simple solitude and loneliness of life that Hawthorne places on Hester in The Scarlet Letter. Both stories have a loss of innocence in realizing that life still perseveres, no matter what they do. A River Runs through it, is a book for all, not just fly fisherman. Maclean's visions and thoughts will astound any person who enjoys the beauty and glory of life. Growing up, under the reign of Presbyterian minister, made the meaning of life much more difficult to grasp. Maclean's uses ironic literature to create a world outside of everyday life as in The Catcher and the Rye. Maclean would be considered, one of the greatest writers of his time but had he not wrote the story until he reached his biblical allotment of seventy years. Coinciding with watching the movie, this book easily places far more dramatized images, than one filmmaker could ever imagine. I truly believe that Norman Maclean is haunted by waters."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean began writing late in life, passing away not long after penning this extraordinary piece, depriving us of his gift just as he arrived. The book is actually three short stories but the focus is clearly on the novella \\"A River Runs Through It\\". On the surface, the title story is his recollections of his father, a Presbyterian minister, and his troubled but talented brother, with whom he fished. Set in the Montana of Maclean's youth, he paints exquisitely vivid and beautiful word pictures of a land and water and family now gone. At the core is the frustration of the often-futile attempt of trying to help another or trying to save a loved one from their self-destruction. There are passages here which are as wonderfully written as anything in English. Not a page passes without discovering a superbly crafted gem. \\"So it is...that we can seldom help anybody. Either we don't know what part to give or maybe we don't like to give any part of ourselves. Then, more often than not, the part that is needed is not wanted. And even more often, we do not have the part that is needed.\\" \\"It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.\\" Throughout the tale, his life, his religion, his family, his fly-fishing are metaphors, each for the other. And the words of each are heard in the waters and stone of the rivers. He is haunted, he tells us, by waters. I am haunted by his words which approach poetry."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I have read this book twice now, and plan to read it several more times through my lifetime. It is a powerful book that speaks to a person on so many different levels. I saw the story the first time... I saw the art the second. As others have said, this book is not about fly-fishing per se. It is about the powerful bonds between family members."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This book evokes a pastoral time and sport with wonderful imagery and genuine affection. It took Norman Maclean most of his life to write this and it seems he chose every word with great care. Rocks in the river are&quot;from the basement of time.&quot; Readers will be &quot;haunted by waters&quot;."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Like many, I was very impressed with the movie, and did not know until recently about the book (or actually story) it was based on. I was introduced to it by an article in Montana Magazine, where I found that the author had carried on a correspondence for many years with Robert Utley, the historian best known for his works on Custer. Apparently MacLean tried for many years to write a Homeric tragedy about Custer, but was never satisfied with his work. It was not until he retired, and finally got down to writing about the simple things, that he was able to find his niche as a writer. To my mind, he succeeds beautifully. His descriptions and turns of phrase are all carefully thought out. At times he puts me in mind of Hemingway, only a little less sparse. It is truly sad that he started his writing so late, with a little more work, I feel he could have become one of our great writers."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Most people probably come to this story having seen and liked the Robert Redford movie. I had anyway. What's astonishing is how wonderfully it holds up. Maclean's words read beautifully right up until the haunting final paragraph. As poetic a writer as I can think of--except, perhaps for Louise Erdrich.Don't listen to reviews that urge you to skip the sections on fly-fishing. I've never fished a day in my life, but to skip these sections is to miss some of the funniest parts of the story--and to miss how Norman, in trying to understand the river, is really trying to figure out his relationship with his father and brother."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Set in Western Montana and amongst some of the finest fly fishing rivers in the state, Norman Maclean tells the tale of one brother's alcoholism and the other brother's inability to help. Through the activity of fly fishing Montana's rivers, Maclean's story unfolds.I favor this book for three reasons. One, Norman Maclean places you in the heart of his characters. Furthermore, since the names in the story point to an autobiographical tale, Norman Maclean places you in his very own heart. The narrator and main character in the story, Norman, pains over reaching out to his brother Paul. Paul, a talented and well-known fly fisherman in Western Montana, shows all signs of alcoholism. From entering the bar at 10:00 a.m. to heavy financial problems, I feel Paul's weakness amongst his strength in fly fishing. The dialogue between the two brothers' illustrates a cry for help from Paul, but challenge in the eyes of Norman. Both men want to stick with what they know best--the great rivers in Montana, the correct fly on a smoldering day, and the smiles of Scottish women as they bring home the largest fish. Instead, each is faced with a real situation, the inciting incident, where one morning consists of Norman driving Paul home from jail.Secondly, the story carries deep thematic question: communication, competition, and responsibility. Norman battles communicating with his brother in a non-critical manner. Instead of an open-air conversation, Norman and Paul are healed by the waters of the Big Blackfoot River. Each man fishes to his ability while basking in nature's offerings. The men are knowledgeable about their hobby and challenge one another upon every outing. Paul sets his minimum of fish caught in a day at ten, while Norman stops when comfortable. Paul is known in Missoula, Montana as the finest fly fisher around. The idea of competition lurks. In addition, responsibility is addressed as Paul cannot understand his responsibility for himself. Drunken and bruised from repeated bar fights, what is one to do?My third reason for enjoying A River Runs Through It lies in Norman Maclean's poetic format. I quote from page 47, &quot;The storm came on a wild horse and rode over us.&quot; As a reader, I never wanted the description of Montana, fly-fishing, and the characters to end. Never having fly fished myself, I ended this novel with a great desire to experience the technique and beauty Norman Maclean presents. From the cast to the catch, the author's combines fishing with the rush of the river and front of a storm. Maclean's style and tone exemplify a peaceful song played over and over.If you are in search a dramatic tale packed between two brothers, I would look elsewhere. The plot is simple and often relatable to personal situations. Norman Maclean probes his readers to look into their own well-being, leaving the feeling of serenity and gratitude.Maybe the most important thing Norman Maclean does is write this book. He tells the story of his brother with whom he shares love, Montana, and fly fishing. I can almost guarantee you will feel Norman's emotions. This book is a reward to read."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This book was a touching story of a youman growing up in Montana.

Don't miss it"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This is the type of book I look at as more a work of art than literature. Although the two can be intertwined, Norman Mclean takes the simple premise of the bond between a family and especially its brothers made permanent by fly-fishing and creates an artistic collage about the two. Admittedly, although I am not a fly fisherman, the sport can be quite beautiful to watch. Mclean is able to translate that beauty onto the page. He then effectively compares that beauty to the inner workings of his family. One warning, if you have seen the movie and have the same expectations for the book, beware. The book is not so much a linear story as a picture illustration of one family's relationship represented by fly-fishing."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I found Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It a labor, but certainly worth the effort. The book is more of a novella, actually, as it is very short (104 pages in the University of Chicago Press edition that I read). But its seeming brevity is very deceiving.When I first flipped through the book and saw that there are no part, chapters or breaks of any kind, I was put off to say the least. So I certainly sympathize with the fear and loathing a reader can feel for a book with nothing but page after page of block text. But the unwieldy structure goes incredibly well with the book's style of storytelling. The tone rather personal, almost like the relation of a memory to an audience of one. And, since the author and the narrator are named Norman, there is some evidence of the book being at least semi-autobiographical.But I thought that the simple, \\"no frills\\" structure of the book served another purpose as well. For, contained within the plain pages is a seemingly plain story about a just as seemingly plain conflict. Norman cannot help his younger brother, Paul, with, well, anything (but most notably his reckless lifestyle).But this conflict is far from simple, and most of its complexity is conveyed through the book's discussions of another seemingly simple act, that of fly fishing, The brothers take several fishing trips together throughout the book, and it is in the descriptions of these trips and their events that Maclean reveals the staggering complexities of the relationship shared by the two brothers, especially in the context of the traditional, fraternal dynamic of the older brother helping the younger brother through his trials.The landscapes are reverently and beautifully described, as the land and river are a part of the boys' family and almost seem like characters in the story from time to time. And the intricate scenes of fishing for which the land serves as a fitting backdrop are eloquent, lush and understandable for the non-fisherman. Though it is far from a non-stop thrill ride, the dramatization of fly-fishing is most definitely compelling, and presents the subtle themes nicely.I also found this to be a very moral book. Fishing is described as being right next to religion and family. And, since the conflict is projected through the decidedly reverent lens of fishing, moral undertones become clearer and clearer as the book progresses. It brings to mind the concept of a sort of reckoning for Norman the character (and, perhaps, Norman the author as well) with what he sees as his failures as a brother.There are really no twists or turns in A River Runs Through It, and no shocking and explosive ending, but it is a very sincere book that is complex in its faade of simplicity. I highly recommend giving A River Runs Through It a try. It is certainly not as easy a read as it would appear, but the reader is definitely rewarded for his or her toils."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"A story about the one that got away, the brother, not the fish."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"In reading The River Runs Through It,for an assignment for English Comp. class for college,at the age of 52. I found that the book was slow and dull in the beginning ,but picked up with interesting reading, and I couldn't set the book down, untill I had finished it.As I read it for the second time, I could see alot more to the book then the first time and could relate to the family almost as if it were mine in growing up. It was the first book I had read in years, and would recomend it to any one who likes to read.There is so much more to the book the second time reading it, that after reading it I want to read more books along the same line."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"YES! This book gets better every time I read it. After reading it 5 times through, I feel I'm about ready to head out and do some fly-fishing!

Ever since i first read this book, my life has changed. Im starting to pay my taxes, my family life is great, and i have more friends than ever. Every month i go out and by a new copy of the book, acting as if i've never read it before. If i could give this book more than 5 stars, i sure would.

This semi-autobiographical book reflects that sense of love and nostalgia in glowing, incredibly beautiful language.Frankly, this book ought to be used to illustrate GREAT writing. The words are simple and clear, but they are filled with great wisdom, warmth and humanity. In a little over 100 pages, MacLean transports us to a different time and place and yet illustrates the timelessness of a family's love for each other and their environment.MacLean may have been &quot;hunted by waters,&quot; but I think it's hard not to be haunted by this book. Whenever I feel stressed out or depressed, I pull out this book and re-read it. It's a balm for my soul every time. I can think of no higher praise. Thank you, Mr. MacLean."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I listened to this book on tape while driving across the great American West. Later, I watched the video. I'm not sure I read the paperback, but I probably did. It's been so long.I'm not going to go into what sort of person Norman Maclean was, other than an incredibly talented writer. I just want to get these words down for the record.This is the story of a Montana family, but more so, it is a story of Life, the great gamble we are all born into. Some of us win, some of us lose, many of us just end up in that gray middle. But this family is gifted. For one, they live among the stunning backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. That is better than most of us manage to do.There is the preacher father, who is an avid fishermen, two sons; one, a college professor (Norman Maclean?), the other a gambling addict, who is later killed because of debt. Then there is the mother tying to hold the family together, not that there are that many centrifugal forces in action, other than those exhibited by the narrator's younger brother, the gambler, who is a bit of a wildman, if you will. His name is Jesse.All I can say is if you have any sensibility at all, you will love this read. I will leave you with these words, taken from the end of the book. The preacher father is alone, fishing on the great Blackfoot, hoping a fish will rise...............\\"Now, nearly all those I loved and didn't understand in my youth are dead, even Jesse. But I still reach out to them. Of course, now I'm too old to be much of a fishermen and I usually fish the big waters alone, although some of my friends think I shouldn't.But when I'm alone in the half-light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big Blackfoot River and a four count rhythm and hope that a fish will rise. Eventually all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops and under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.I am haunted by waters.\\""},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Arrived as described, book is in great condition. The book is fantastic, tells the story of fly fishing in the American West."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This is a handy edition of ARRTI. It also includes other Mclean stories and features the marquee still of the Redford movie, featuring Brad Pitt (as Norman's brother Paul) illustrating his technique of 'shadow casting'. The novella (we would now probably call it 'creative nonfiction') is wonderful and far less linear and uniformly autobiographical than the Redford film version. The two complement one another very nicely, the novella providing wonderful anecdotes and the film spectacular images. ARRTI, considered as fiction, is a rare bird. It is actually a georgic mystery. The georgic is a hard pastoral, how-to form, in this case discussing the manner in which one does fly fishing (and sees it in the context of art, grace and faith). The mystery is twofold. Norman's brother Paul dies a violent death, which remains unsolved. Equally interesting, he stands as the center piece of Norman's memories, his mother's favorite son and the one described by his somewhat stern Presbyterian minister father as 'beautiful'. For all of his skill and beauty, no one fully understands him. We learn the details of his life, his behaviors, his skills and his attitudes, but he remains a mystery, even to those who should know him best.The narrative is 'realist' in its details, its setting and its (sometimes salty) language, but it is also scrupulously literary, as befits the work of a lifelong English teacher, one of the famous 'Chicago critics' in the 1950's. The book drops references to Izaak Walton, to Wordsworth (particularly the famous 'spots of time' passage in The Prelude) and, most importantly, to the Johannine logos. All of these references add up to a subtle and serious system of underpinnings for the straightforward narrative, one which all can enjoy.Very highly recommended (as is the Redford film, with the director doing strategic voice-overs)."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Honestly, the movie is pretty true to the book, except for the addition of Maclean's romantic interest and some minor timing adjustments. The movie was so well done that I'd recommend renting it. However, if you're more of a reader than a watcher you'll enjoy the book. Maclean is a poet. Like Hemingway, his language is powerful and piercing in its simplicity. Easy and enjoyable Saturday afternoon read."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Exquisite and pure as wood, or water or anything that is solely itself. A simple story of life, two brothers, family, passion and water but as we all know none of that is simple. Rich in nuance and tenderness, quietness and rage; the river and the life. Norman Maclean says in 160 pages more in the spaces in between the words and the things the characters do not say, than most authors say in 500 pages."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"There is a certain amount of spirituality that exists in a family tradition. Love can be expressed simply by the act of doing something together in ritual fashion. Not a word needs to be spoken, nor do hugs or physical expressions of love need to be passed.In A River Runs Through It, fly fishing goes hand and hand with Religion even in the family of a Presbyterian minister. Norman Maclean writes this novel as much a study of the spirituality of fly fishing as it is a study of the bond between the men in Norman Maclean's family. The relationship between Paul and Norman is both complicated and simple, as is the fishing they take part in. The fishing is almost a metaphor in this story. While the brother's use their fishing trips to relax and heal the everyday pains of life, it also is an expression of love for eachother.An important theme of this novel is the fact that the main character, Norman is always trying to help. He seems to know that there is nothing he can do to help his brother but not to try helping would mean that he is giving up on Paul. The character of Paul is charasmatic and alluring, but leads a very dangerous and careless lifestyle. The most touching scene of the novel is when the tables are turned on Norman as he realizes that it is Paul who is trying to help and make him feel better. Unfortunatly, nothing the brothers say or do for one another can change what will happen in the end. Like his son, Norman's father asks, &quot;Do You think I could have helped him?&quot; Because this is a question Norman has tried to answer his entire life, he has no answer for his father.The novel is tirelessly beautiful, written as naturally as a story is told, as there are no chapters or indications what so ever that the narrative voice pauses. The lengthy discourses on the actual physical nature of fishing are less than intriguing to the unknowledgable reader until they are inevitably drawn in to the spiritual union that the phyical act of fly fishing creates with spiritual aspects of brother hood.I have absolutely no hard criticism for this novel. It is beautiful and powerful in the most subtle of ways. Having brothers, I was often reminded of several personal experiences by this novel. I think it is probably hard to write about what brothers share on a spiritual level. Maclean has given us a lovely expression of love for his brother (assuming ofcourse that this work of fiction is in fact based on reality), probably more than was ever said in life. The protagonist and his brother share an unbreakable bond that they express through fishing. Maclean uses the imagery and emotion in the fishing scenes to evoke the love between the brothers. The outcome of the book is told in a subtle, gentle voice that eases the reader to the knowledge that what happens is inevitable."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Set &quot;at the junction of two great trout rivers in Western Montana&quot; in the early 1900s, A River Runs Through It is a beautiful tale about a family whose connection to fly fishing is almost religious. Fly fishing is such an inextricable part of their lives that each member of the family can be characterized by their relatioship to it. The reader quickly recognizes that this extended metaphor is a divine fit; telling the story in any other way would rob it of truth.The narrator in this story, Norman, grows up fly fishing for trout with his younger brother, Paul, and father in the Blackfoot River in Montana. Norman and Paul aren't ostensibly sensitive guys; they grow up in a rugged evironment and consider themselves fighters. In truth, though, they care deeply for each other but have a bond that is very fragile when words are introduced.The conflict arises when Paul starts getting into trouble with the police and people to whom he is in debt. After bailing Paul out of jail one night, Norman realizes that he must find some way to help his brother. The major problem is that the two have never been good at communicating or expressing their feelings. Norman doesn't know how to address the situation and fears that saying the wrong thing may offend or hurt his brother and push him away.The one important thing that they do share is their love for fishing. So in an attempt to help his brother, Norman takes Paul fishing. It is while wading in the Blackfoot that the river draws them close and shows them how they connect.In addition to being a story about relationships and communication, this is a tale about how the people closest to us are often enigmas. It's about finding the river that connects relationships and using it to come to understandings. And it's about creating fictional stories from true ones in an attempt to get at the truth.If you are interested in poetry and simple truth, reading A River Runs Through It will make you want to buy a fly rod and head out to the nearest stream. I have never encountered a book which brings such magical beauty to a sport or hobbie. What's more is that this activity draws meaning out of the story like a ten pound trout pulls line from a reel."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean, seemingly a realist writer with the ideals of a dreamer, has really touched me with his words. In 'A River Runs Through It' he manages not only to touch us with his own story and view of the people around him, but has incorporated the most endearing people into his story. He gives us a bit of insight into those people and what exactly makes them tick. It's a book about Montana, a book about brothers, fishing, preaching, life, and a book about loving those who we dont' always understand. And getting to know those people a bit better... and seeing that they may not always understand us. I really loved it."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Maclean's beautiful novel centers more around pure emotions than fly fishing. His story only uses fly fishing as a basis for a more important intention, describing the relationship between a pair of brothers. What I find incredible is the skill with which he weaves his story. The feelings which seep from his story are paralleled only by real life. I cannot help but pause at every new emotion and marvel at how it is so similar to those that I have felt. If you are lucky enough to recognize someone you know in his story you will probably discover something about them in this story, and you will definitely find out more about yourself. While fisherman will be drawn to this story I recommend this to anyone who is passionate towards anything."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean began writing late in life, passing away not long after penning this extraordinary piece, depriving us of his gift just as he arrived. The book is actually three short stories but the focus is clearly on the novella &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. On the surface, the title story is his recollections of his father, a Presbyterian minister, and his troubled but talented brother, with whom he fished. Set in the Montana of Maclean's youth, he paints exquisitely vivid and beautiful word pictures of a land and water and family now gone. At the core is the frustration of the often-futile attempt of trying to help another or trying to save a loved one from their self-destruction. There are passages here which are as wonderfully written as anything in English. Not a page passes without discovering a superbly crafted gem. &quot;So it is...that we can seldom help anybody. Either we don't know what part to give or maybe we don't like to give any part of ourselves. Then, more often than not, the part that is needed is not wanted. And even more often, we do not have the part that is needed.&quot; &quot;It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.&quot; Throughout the tale, his life, his religion, his family, his fly-fishing are metaphors, each for the other. And the words of each are heard in the waters and stone of the rivers. He is haunted, he tells us, by waters. I am haunted by his words which approach poetry."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"When, several years ago, I started reading a lot of fishing books, one title kept cropping up in other books. Every author seemed to defer to A River Runs Through It; it was universally acknowledged to be the greatest fishing story ever written. I dutifully sought it out and read it. I'm sure everyone has seen the movie by now, so I won't be giving anything away when I confess that Paul's death upset me so much that, on that first reading, I hated the book. It was like Old Yeller and the MASH where Henry died and Brian's Song all rolled into one. Returning to it better prepared, I simply enjoyed it for the language and for the bittersweet family story it relates and I learned to love it. Then, in 1992, Robert Redford brought the story to the screen and the beauty of the scenery and some terrific performances, combined with the large chunks of narrative taken directly from the book, resulted in one of the better movies of recent years and cemented the book's place in the pantheon of great American stories.Amazingly, Norman MacLean, who taught English at the University of Chicago for 43 years, did not publish this book until 1976, after retiring from his teaching job in 1973. I don't know whether he had worked on the story throughout his whole life, as was the case with the posthumous bookYoung Men and Fire, but the final product has such beautifully sculpted language, that it would not be hard to believe that it is the end result of four decades of effort. Here is the famous opening:In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing. We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in western Montana, and our father was a Presbyterian minister and a fly fisherman who tied his own flies and taught others. He told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen, and we were left to assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.And, of course, after Paul's death, Norman's father urges him:Why don't you make up a story and the people to go with it? Only then will you understand what happened and why. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.And the story concludes:Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach out to them.Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and some friends think I shouldn't. Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that fish will rise.Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.I am haunted by waters.And in between these memorable passages, MacLean unfolds a timeless story of fathers and sons and brothers and their often futile attempts to understand one another and the way in which sport can provide a tie, sometimes the only tie, between them. You will be haunted by the affecting story and by MacLean's crystalline prose in this very nearly perfect book.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Norman Maclean's beautifully written autobiographical tale has become one of the classics of American literature. Some of the many powerful themes running through the story include the struggle for grace represented by the art of fly fishing, the ebb and flow of time, and the idea of family.It is the examination of family that is perhaps strongest. While the relationships between father and son, mother and son, and husband and wife are all dealt with, it is the filial duties and relationships that are ultimately the centerpiece of the story. It is Maclean's haunting by what happens to his brother that makes the novel what it is.Barry Moser's illustrations are superb and are a compelling reason to own the hardcover addition. The movie version was well done and did justice to the novel."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This tale of two brothers, their family and their passion forfly fishing and the Montana outdoors, causes me to have conflictingemotions: on the one hand, it inspires me to try to create my own work of fiction, while on the other hand, it causes me to despair of such an undertaking, as any attempts I might make will be clumsy and lackluster compared to McLean's novella. A friend, who was an English major in college and actually buys large quantities of those slightly oversized, artsy paperback works of fiction that sell for $14, recommended this book to me. She is an exceptionally bright, well-read individual, who has never had a thought in her life of taking up fishing as a hobby, yet her description of this book is 100% accurate. She told me that A River Runs Through It was the most beautifully written piece of literature that has ever graced the English language. I could not agree more.After finishing this work, I can only wonder with amazement why this short book was not required reading for any of my various English classes in my past. We read Hemingway as an example of powerful, concise writing, yet compared to McLain, our good friend Ernest appears effete, odd and uninteresting. Read some of the other reviews (discounting the several obviously juvenile ones, every single discriminating adult gave this novella five stars) and the adjective that is used most frequently, and most appropriately, is &quot;beautiful.&quot; McLean achieved perfection in this work. Read it and you will feel enriched."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Do not ignore this book simply because you may not have an interest in fishing. This 104 page story does consecrate a considerable number of pages to starkly poetic descriptions of fly fishing (lovely, haunting descriptions of men standing in Montana's Big Blackfoot River, attempting to achieve something great in the half-light of a rocky canyon), but this story is not about fishing. It is about two brothers who vaguely understand that--much like a river--life takes its own twists and turns and cannot be stopped by man. Life cannot always be understood in an intellectual sense, but sometimes it can be appreciated in a visceral one, and perhaps we can pull moments of brillance from it, just as a fisherman might pull a beautiful trout from a river. Maclean gives us his life and his heart in this story, and it is impossible not to be touched by his emotions. Everytime I read this book I learn something new, and as I plan on reading this book many more times to come, I suppose I still have a lot of learning to do."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I've been so disappointed in recent times hearing those who've gotten \\"too caught up in the fly fishing details\\" of A River Runs Through It, to appreciate the novel. There are two reasons for this. The first is that few authors are ever able to take their own unique worldview-their own social context, value structures, etc.-and to so aptly apply them as a metaphor for looking at the world. The second, (having nothing to do with any knowledge of fly fishing on my part), is the grace with which Norman Maclean relays such a personal, pertinent piece of his life to the reader.The book is certainly not about fly fishing. It is a bittersweet and awe-inspiring look at a family so thick with love and pride that they are made unable to help one another when their help is needed most.Within the body of the novel, Norman, (both author and narrator), seems to systematically explicate every relationship he has. The traditions handed down by his mother and father to he and his brother are obvious. Norman is certainly less inclined to fill the traditional man's role than is his brother. Both Norman and his father are set apart from Paul in this regard.Paul, of course, is an example of the artist: the beautiful, raw, unrefined master of his domain. One of the largest recurring themes in the book-the idea of man's fall from grace, along with ensuing human suffering-echoes mournfully throughout the novel. Both Norman and his father seem to watch the artist, Paul, as though they were all-knowing spectators in life. They can both tell where things are going, and can see the artistry and skill of the movement from afar, but are helpless to change the momentum of the game. Paul is beautiful, perfect in humanity perhaps, but beyond the aid of his family, and, in that sense, doomed.This idea of continual admiration followed by resignation to a sort of pre-ordained destiny is reiterated throughout the book. It is tied to religion, fly fishing, nature and art-all of which are seemingly inextricably woven as one defining social reality. Because of the roles women play within Norman's world, along with the inadequacies of those individuals who might otherwise be able to connect with Paul, it becomes clear that all responsibility rests on Norman's shoulders.In the end, this book is about regret, but further about resignation. Resignation to beauty, art, the natural progression of the world and to the inevitability of human nature. All of us live in a world both as romantic and clandestine as Norman Maclean's in some way. We must praise him, however, for capturing his so well, and for so faithfully observing the truth of a world he will never give himself credit for knowing mastering. If A River Runs Through It is Maclean's tribute to the brother he was never quite able to reach, perhaps by reaching us, his regret might be reconciled."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"In the great speed of the western world one would not think that such things existed. Give this book to any of your pals and see the calm that comes over them. This book is an American Classic. Though very small it abounds with wisdom and soul. At the risk of heresy I state that all American men should read this book. It puts the male sensitivity into perspective and might help some of us find that sensitivity."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"One of the ten best works of fiction written in the English language, this book, but particularlly its title novella, takes the reader not just on a trip through the world of fly-fishing, but through the trip of life. Maclean's work tackles the difficult question: how does man relate to the world around himself?Maclean's work is not just the culmination of an author's hard work, it is the culmination of a lifetime of experiences, rolled over in his mind till the full meaning of those experiences is understood.One need not enjoy fishing at all to appreciate the stories of this masterpiece. In fact, it could be argued that it isn't even about fishing. It's about love, art, faith, doubt, charity and all the other myriad things which infest the life of ordinary man.The University of Chicago Press does not publish fiction works as a rule. It's worth the time spent reading to find out why they broke that rule with Norman Maclean"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"The story, the life's lessons, the metaphors, the prose, the poetic descriptions of life, fishing, nature, relationships, human weaknesses, and feelings that are related in this book are simply amazing and beautiful. I cannot begin to give this book the praise that it deserves. This is a book that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This is one of my all-time, top five favorite books. I love the way Norman Maclean strings his words together, the way he makes writing about fly fishing and family a ballet of words. I laughed and cried and found myself reading more and more slowly as I approached the end of the book. (It's always a sign of a great story for me when I don't want the book to end.) I will reread this book at least once a year."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I recently reread this wonderful book. I had remembered the lyrical and stirring fishing scenes, with the artistry of the younger brother, but I had forgotten the equally compelling story about family relationships and life in Montana. The writing is as clear as a fast running stream, and the illustrations in this edition, particularly of the fishing flies, fit the mood of the book and make it even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"This is a beautiful, haunting book that will live within you well after you finish the last page. Sure, the movie was lovely but could not compare to the lyrical grace of Norman Maclean's words. I only hate that he started his craft so late in life (or at least was published so late in life) and that we didn't get to enjoy more of his work before his death. I read A LOT of books, and this is one of my alltime favorites, among the top 5 and definitely a classic. I give it as a gift to my reading friends. While it's about fly fishing, it's not about fly fishing; it's about so much more -- life, family relationships, living in the moment. I would never have touched this book except for the recommendation of Pete Dexter, a fine author himself, who profiled Maclean in an Esquire article some years ago. If you can get your hands on it, it will give you some wonderful insight into the person Maclean was."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Most reviewers dwell more on the detailed information MacLean discusses about fly fishing in Montana in his early years. However, I was touched by the nature and the nurture I read in this text. As a minister with two sons having similar temperments to the brothers (Norman and Paul MacLean) I found traces of my life in the story of this one family. There is a deep sense of the holy in this work that merits further exploration. I am blessed and haunted by waters."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Maclean shows us indeed that A River Runs Through It. It just goes to show how important spending time with family is, and what better way than fishing. No matter what troubles come, none can't be washed away down the river to purify the soul. A very powerful message is sent through this story, don't miss it. The best literature I've ever read."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I am from Montana. I was trout fishing before I went to school. This book captures extremly accurately what life was like in Montana during this time. The fly fishing depicted was very much a reality then as it is now. As I travel this country, I have never found a place more beautiful, nor the fishing better than in Montana. For anyone who loves to trout fly fish and loves the outdoors this book is a must. GOOD FISHING!"},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"I fished when I was a boy but stopped when I grew up.

Not only because I love the outdoors, but more importantly, beacause of its beautiful language and how it describes the sometimes distant and difficult family relationships in his family. The last page of text in a &quot;River Runs Through It&quot; is so hauntingly beautiful, that I will never forget it. I could only turn the page and say - wow."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"Another astoundingly beautiful book by Norman MacLean. I first read Young Men and Fire, then watched the movie A River Runs Through It, and finally the book by the same title. I cannot describe how beautiful the book is except to say that I laughed, cried, and became much more tuned to the world and how all things in life are essentially related back to the earth. Don't be afraid to read it, it is well worth your time!!! Amazingly, the movie was wonderfully true to the story with some exceptions."},{"Title":"A River Runs Through It","review":"OK, so he only has a few. What many reviewers have left out is the extraordinary humor in the story.

The cover is full color and glossy and the inner page is a nice, heavy, textured paper. This gives the cookbook a very expensive, quality feel to it.Each recipe in Country Bob's Cookbook is featured on its own page and is written in easy to read large type. There is a beautiful decorative border around each page which makes the recipe stand out. The cookbook has 96 pages and four chapters in total. The chapters are appetizers, soups & snacks; grilling, main dishes, and desserts. I also love that scattered throughout the cookbook are verses from the BibleThe recipes all look fantastically inviting. Each one uses a Country Bob's product in it as expected except for the desserts. The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow and the ingredients lists feature items that can be easily found at any grocery store. Many of the recipes use pre-packaged ingredients like canned soup or packaged corn bread mix so they are perfect for the cook looking for time saving recipes. I prefer not to use many pre-packaged foods but could easily substitute homemade alternatives in each recipe.If I had to choose my two favorite recipes, they would be the Hot Reuben Dip and the Slow Cooker Orange Country Chicken."},{"Title":"The Original Country Bob's Cookbook","review":"The above is just a sample of the delicious recipes included in this book. You'll find recipes for everything from Wingettes to Country Bob's Chip Dip in the Appetizer section. There is Sour Cream Slaw Dressing and Cucumber and Tomato Salad in the Salad section. And Foil-Wrapped Chicken and Grilled Chicken-in-a-Pocket in the grilling section. Most of the dishes are made using Country Bob's All Purpose Sauce, which I've used and love. The flavor blends of this sauce adds the perfect touch to anything from baked beans to meatloaf. And I can't wait to try their recipe for Country Bob's Steak Taco in the main dish section.I made the above cake and have to admit that I did make 3 changes. I used butter instead of the margarine and I used black walnut flavoring instead of the butternut. My reasons? I always bake with butter and I had no butternut flavoring so I substituted using the black walnut. My only other change was that I baked mine in a tube pan instead of 3 cake pans. Again, my reason? I just like to bake cakes in tube pans. But I still ended up with 3 layers. I simply slice my cake creating 3 layers. The cake is not only beautiful but the taste is wonderful. And the recipe, as well as all of the recipes I've found in this book, is simple.If you would like to see a picture of my cake, visit my site [...]"},{"Title":"The Original Country Bob's Cookbook","review":"\\"The Original Country Bob's Cookbook\\" is a wonderful cookbook utilizing the fantastic products from Country Bob's!

This is a sturdy cookbook, a relatively slim hardcover with an attractive, simple layout that makes it easy to decipher the recipes.The cover says \\"Christ is our CEO\\" and there are bible quotes sprinkled liberally throughout the book. I'm only uncomfortable with this sort of thing if I feel there's been a bait-and-switch: i.e., I open a product that looks perfectly non-religious and find that I'm being preached at. That isn't the case here. The writers of this cookbook are perfectly open and honest about their religious leanings--right down to that aforementioned note on the cover--and there isn't an air of attempting to preach to the non-believer, which I appreciate.My one complaint about the cookbook is easily explained by the fact that it was created for a company's products and presumably not written by an experienced cookbook author. It misses some small nuances that tend to have a disproportionately large impact on the usability of a cookbook.For example, a recipe for chip dip doesn't list chips in the ingredients list. A recipe for cheese balls (meant to be spread on crackers) doesn't include the crackers in the list of ingredients. Hamburgers don't mention buns or any optional fixings in the ingredient lists. I know this seems unnecessary to people who are unfamiliar with cookbook-writing; it's obvious that you need these things, right? But when someone makes out their grocery list they often copy things down from the list, and if they're in any kind of a hurry they might miss something that isn't written down. You don't want to get most of the way through cooking your hamburgers only to discover that you've forgotten to buy the fixings.I have to admit, these are good recipes. I think my favorite was a recipe involving chicken breast and lemonade concentrate. Chicken isn't my favorite ingredient, but I ate that dish until I hurt. (Ohhh... memory pains....) However, I did sometimes feel that as much as I enjoyed the recipes, the balance of ingredients was just slightly off. The cheese balls were quite good, but it was hard to actually taste much of the sauce in them; a little more would have been nice. The pumpkin delight (no, the desserts do not use the sauces!) was quite delicious, but overly sweet (and I do not say that about many things).If I were to take this simply as a cookbook and compare it to all the other cookbooks I've ever used, I'd give it a three out of five because of those missed nuances that make things harder on the cook. However, for a cookbook meant to showcase a product I'd give it four out of five, because frankly for that kind of cookbook this isn't an unusual issue, and these recipes make delicious use of a wonderful product. I'll compromise and call my rating 3.5."},{"Title":"Dangerous Pursuits","review":"I like Alanna Knight. She is an easy and entertaining read.

Blamey has written a book which looks at why in the early history of Australia this is only part of the story.In the late 18th Century a number of European countries knew that a large landmass existed south of what was to become Indonesia and that parts of it looked as though it was good agricultural land. The reality was however that there was no particular reason to colonise the land. Blamey explains why in some detail. The reason relates to the economics of the time.Australia was an immense distance from Europe and the only reasons for colonising it would be if there were goods to trade. To move people there to farm staples such as wheat was simply not economic considering the price of transport. The sorts of goods, which were attractive at that time, were those produced by local natives and which could be traded for European goods. Australia at that time was inhabited but its natives were hunter gathers who did not produce large volumes of exotic goods. For that reason most European powers ignored the continent.England however developed a problem after the American Revolution. That was a surplus of convicts. Prior to the revolution England had exported convicts to America as labourers. This meant that she did not have to pay for the cost of guarding or feeding those convicted of crimes. With the loss of the colonies the number of convicts in England began to explode. England decided to set up a penal colony in Australia as a means of getting rid of the convicts and also perhaps to be able to use the flax and pines which grew on Norfolk Island to provide naval stores.A large number of convicts were sent to the colonies and they developed some subsistence agriculture. This was not a great success and the colonies were not self sufficient in food until the 1840?s. What developed was a network of settlements that were part of a prison network. Sydney cove and Hobart took most of the convicts and places of punishment were set up for those convicts who continued to commit offences at Norfolk Island and Port Macquarie.Australia might then have simply stagnated as a sort of Devils Island except for a number of developments. The first of these was the discovery of large numbers of whales close to the coast. In the early 19th Century whales were the source of lighting (Europe was illuminated by whale oil lights until the commercial discovery of kerosene), material for making soap and perfumes and lastly whale bone was an important ingredient of women?s clothing. Whale products were valuable and the costs of transportation did not destroy their profitability. The second development was the growth of the market for wool. Australia turned out to be a country ideally suited for raising sheep. Whilst sheep started to spread through Australia, European demand started to skyrocket. This was in part due to a decline in European wool production due to using sheep more for meat production.The development of whaling and sheep herding occurred far ahead of the spread of lawful authority in the country. Men of capital would arrive in Sydney buy sheep and head off into the interior of the continent. They did not purchase land but simply put their sheep on it. Farmers in Australia have developed the name ?squatters? as a result. Within twenty years most of the Eastern seaboard of Australia was occupied by sheep farmers who hired convict labour to tend their herds. Wool was moved to river ports and then to major cities to be shipped to Europe. At this time the population of indigenous people started to fall catastrophically.Blamey explains the process in a simple entertaining and clear way. It is no surprise that his history won an award for Australian literature. He then goes on to talk about the development of the railroad and the use of clippers on ocean routes and how they shaped the development of Australia. The book is interesting as it provides an innovative an interesting way of narrating history mixing up the economic and causative factors and breaking free of a dull chronological record"},{"Title":"Tyranny of Distance","review":"Almost every history book, whether on France or on China, takes a certain period, then sketches out, in greater or lesser detail, the main characters and events of that epoch. Better history books also concentrate on economic trends, movements of ideas and people, cultural styles and artistic creativity. Some historians write on a period through the life of a particular historic personage. History writers that march to a different drummer are scarce, perhaps because of the requirements of publishers and promotion committees. Geoffrey Blainey is one of a small band indeed.Those familiar with contemporary Australia will recall the heaps of scorn poured on this gentleman by all kinds of people when he made some public comments against Asian immigration. No doubt these were unfortunate, but they do not in any sense take away from the quality of his work (which is free from racist remarks). THE TYRANNY OF DISTANCE takes geography as the main \\"character\\" in Australian history---that is, the fact that Australia is so far from the colonizing country, Britain. Blainey opens with a discussion of isolation. Instead of establishing colonies along a seaboard, as they did in America, the British founded \\"limpet ports\\", clinging to the vast continent at the very edge. While the early settlers in these widely-separated ports needed to import all forms of equipment from Britain, there was little in the way of cargo for the return voyage, neither wool nor gold weighing much. Thus, there was not much incentive to send ships to the distant continent. The story then turns to whalers, gold seekers, and the rising necessity to manufacture many items locally since importing them was too slow and too expensive. Why didn't this beautiful, resource-rich land attract more settlers like the USA ? Mainly, Blainey argues, because of distance. The long-lasting \\"assisted passage\\" plan (government paying for immigrants' voyage) came into existence when the other kind of \\"assisted passage\\"---sending convicts, tapered off. The second part of the book examines how Australia tamed the tyranny of distance through steamships, railways, airplanes, and through the other developments of the 20th century. This well-researched book is written in a most readable style, in fact, it is hard to put down. There are 5 useful maps and many interesting illustrations. If you would like one book that gives you an idea about Australia's history, that tells you why it was never just \\"another America\\" (and never will be), I strongly recommend THE TYRANNY OF DISTANCE."},{"Title":"Tyranny of Distance","review":"Reads like a Paul Johnson history book. Lots of interesting insites to Australia (for the non-Australian). What could be argued as the most important date in Australian history? Answer: July 4, 1776. When the U.S. declared independance England needed a new place as a penal colony. The next interesting question is why Australia - the other side of the world. I picked the book up several years ago in Sydney and enjoyed it on the plane rides. I've recommended it several times to Americans visiting Australia."},{"Title":"A Plethora of Polyhedra in Origami","review":"Fans of John Montroll's other books will know that he tends to follow a fixed set of ideas. These are that the paper should be square and that only one sheet should be used. Outside of a few basic shapes (cubes and pyramids mostly), the use of a single sheet in creating polyhedra is not very widespread. Montroll uses this book to show up that it needs not be the case.Montroll shows how a single sheet of paper can be folded into more complex polyhedra including skeletal forms.These models all follow a basic pattern of precreasing the paper to isolate the polyhedron's sides, and then collapsing the paper into the 3D model. Very interesting techniques, and Montroll seems to get the largest possible solid from the paper, but the single-sheet design does lose something in solidity. Many multi-piece models are very strong, but that is not the case here. However, if you like geometrics but could not bring yourself to fold 30 to 180 pieces of paper for a single model, you will love this book."},{"Title":"A Plethora of Polyhedra in Origami","review":"For a long time the folding of polyhedras and other variations is dominated by modular origami, a category of paperfolding that models are assembled by many units of the same form. Such technic has been developed into a wildly splended state, for example, see books of Lewis Simon or Tokomo Fuse. However, in this book Montroll still insists on his long-time philosophy-- one single square paper, two hands, nothing else.The best part of this book, in my opinion, is the 5 Plato polyhedras plus the 5 sunken Plato polyhedras, all folded by a single square paper. This is a succint approach, although not new. And the intrinsic beauty of these models explains everything. Other parts of this book are fair enough, for example, prisms and other models are relatively new compared to other polyhedra origami books.Since every model is folded by one square, it seems that we can not hope to have some super-complex models. After all, the special symmetry structures of polyhedras do hinder the design of the folding-- in order to keep symmetry it will waste too much paper. So it is a pity for those super-hard-model-addicts.BTW, I am happy that after so many years Montroll finally comes to Mathematics!"},{"Title":"A Plethora of Polyhedra in Origami","review":"Although folding polyhedra is not my favourite, nevertheless I do indulge in it.Most of the polyhedra are folded as modulars. John Montroll folds them using a single square. Quite a challenge since most of the models are not simple to fold.Models in this book include tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, decahedron, double diamond hexhedron, triangular dipyramid, pentagonal dipyramid, hexagonal dipyramid, heptagonal dipyramid, triangular prism, pentagonal prism, hexagonal prism, sunken platonic solids and many others.I prefer folding polyhedra using modular techniques since they end up much more colourful. In this book polyhedra are folded using a square and hence only in one colour.At the end of the book, Montroll gives suggestions on how to expand on the techniques he uses in this book to create your own one piece polyhedra.Yes, I recommend this book for polyhedra enthusiast."},{"Title":"A Plethora of Polyhedra in Origami","review":"I really liked this book because it explains how to do all of the complicated folds. It also shows you a picture for each step so you can see what to do. I do not think that beginners should start with this book because some of the folding steps are a little hard to follow."},{"Title":"A Plethora of Polyhedra in Origami","review":"This origami book is interesting, and it contains many unique ideas. The models can be very elegant if folded well. That being said, it is almost impossible to fold them well, as most of them are extremely difficult to fold accurately.

It is a true original which should eventually find a respected place in every medical, science, and law library, every drug and med-device company office, (and for savvy biotech investors too) hospitals with IRBs conducting clinical research, all government offices that have oversight on health matters---and in the hands of of every patient rights and consumer advocate organization, as well as investigative health, medical and science reporters. I write this as a medical journalist of 42 years experience, and as co-founder of the National Women's Health Network. On a great many occasions, the behavior and the decisions of FDA have struck me as puzzling and unfathomable (although, on the whole, I still retain an abiding respect for the agency, which impacts daily on so many aspects of our health and welfare.) With Dr. Parisian's book I am starting to grasp how the FDA really functions. WHAT THE BOOK OFFERS. Nothing like it has previously existed, no single reference has explored the entire FDA as one structural entity, looking at the overall process of product regulation, and evaluation of clinical trials. The science surrounding FDA's past and present activities includes discussions of such wide-ranging issues as patient treatment,&quot; off-label &quot;use of prescription drugs, veterinary products, vaccines, food safety, milk, genetic engineering, cosmetics, testing of military personnel, informed consent, IRB, BSE and Mad Cow Disease. There is quick reference to legal issues regarding FDA''s regulation of medical products, as well as chapters on FDA's history and development and a good index with fast reference for finding cited regulations.

It is well written and an enjoyable read - for a first class history of the House of Hohenzollern what more could you ask for."},{"Title":"The Soldier Kings: The House of Hohenzollern","review":"\\"Prussia was hatched from a cannonball,\\" so Napoleon is supposed to have said, and no European dynasty or nation has been so completely the product of the character of the individuals who were its leaders as Germany was under the Hohenzollerns. From their origins in the early 12th century, the Brandenburgs were a relatively minor family on the fringes of central Europe; before Frederick Wilhelm, \\"The Great Elector,\\" in the mid-17th century, there was a tendency in the wealthier courts of Europe to laugh at them. His great-grandson of the same name was the first king of Prussia whose title had any meaning, but still he wasn't taken very seriously by other crowned heads. But his son, Frederick \\"the Great,\\" changed the rules of the game and from 1750 on, Germany became an important player in European dynastic politics. With England under Hanoverian reign, Prussia had an in with the growing British empire and when Wilhelm I became the first Emperor of Germany in 1871, the newly unified nation became a superpower -- at least until 1918.How did the family manage this rise to power? Their lands had few natural resources or geographical advantages and the German states had been disunified since the death of Charlemagne. Nelson, a non-academic historian raised in a diplomatic family, undertakes in this sprawling volume to identify the origins of \\"Prussianism\\" and the methods by which it was applied over several generations to an every-larger area of German-speaking Europe. The story as he tells it combines political and social history with more traditional biography, since the Electors of Brandenburg created their new world in their own militaristic, autocratic, often arrogantly tyrannical image. His approach is methodical and his style is both scholarly and readable, so working one's way through this narrative should leave one with a heightened interest in the nature of Germany monarchism and a lengthy list of additional reading to pursue."},{"Title":"Scent of Water","review":"This is a beautiful book about depression and friendship and grace.You wouldn't think a book where the story revolves around the moments of depression of the original owner of a home would be a good story.

Born in 1900, by 1918 and the end of World War I, so many eligible young men had been killed in the war that a large portion of that generation of women were unable to marry. This issue has been the subject of a full-length book -- whose title I have misplaced -- a book that mentions Goudge several times, as one of these spinsters-despite-themselves.)Moreover, the old lady had suffered from intermittent mental illness, which in the book is not diagnosed, but which causes troubling dreams and delusions, and leads her to live a life that is very socially isolated.As the story unfolds we discover how, despite her disabilities, the old lady has slowly developed a deep, simple faith that sustains her in her loneliness, and struggles with mental illhealth.Parallel with this, the woman who has moved to the country finds unexpected connections with families in the neighbourhood, including a family with young children.One special item connects both stories, and links with the children who visit.The old lady, sometimes almost childlike in her ways of thinking, had made a collection of small objects, doll's house size -- a collection of \\"Little Things\\".She finds consolation in collecting, and contemplating them.They also help her connect with young children, in her own time, in earlier years.The Little Things similarly fascinate the current visiting children.Many of the characters face crises of doubt conflicting with their relationships, hope, and faith.I am reluctant to add much more detail, as this is a book that should NOT have its plot spoiled.Eventually the book offers the same consolations -- existential and spiritual -- as Camus' \\"The Plague\\", and T.S. Eliot's \\"Four Quartets\\".Very highly recommended.Let me add the following.The Scent of Water is a modern non-historical romance -- \\"romance\\", for want of a better term. Fifty-year old Mary Lindsay, unmarried ex-school teacher, and high-level government executive in London, is surprised to find that a very elderly cousin, also called Mary Lindsay, has died, leaving her a country cottage in the village ofAppleshaw. Only once, as an eight-year old, did Mary visit her Cousin Mary in the country. But suddenly, remembering that visit, she decides to retire early, and goes to live in the cottage. There she not only meets a wealth of village characters, but discovers much about herself, falls hopelessly in love, finds a faith in a Christian after-life she had never previously believed in, and discovers why her Cousin had similarly fled London and chose to live her adult life in the country. Much of this may seem little more than cliche village soap opera. But that would be a wholly superficial judgement. Mary's experiences in the village, like those of Cousin Mary's, are as deep as anything in Graham Greene's The End of the Affair or A Burnt-Out Case, for example.Without giving too much away, Cousin Mary suffered all her life from bouts of insanity -- perhaps schizophrenia, or manic depression -- when she would feel overwhelmed by feelings of despair, a terrible sense of being trapped and crushed claustrophobically, and being isolated from all other people. Her only comfort came from hard-won Christian willingness to submit to her illness when it struck, trusting that it would pass. And, having meet young Mary, she resolved to live so that she would leave as much as she could to her young cousin when she died. All of this is slowly revealed when Mary moves in to the old house and begins to read Cousin Mary's old diary. (Goudge herself suffered a nervous breakdown in her thirties, and there was a recurring streak of \\"melancholia\\" in her ancestors.) Cousin Mary's saintly silent suffering resembles that of Miss Mary Montague, the very old lady in The Dean's Watch. We also discover that the village was once part of a Cistercian monastery, and Mary's house (or some part of it) was the infirmary. In the old church there are still carvings from William the Hunchback, who suffered from his physical disability and despaired, until a vision saved him on the brink of suicide, when he became a monk with a crippled saintliness. The village and Mary's house seems haunted by the monks and their singing and prayerful love.Mary herself comes to terms with memories of her wartime romance with a naval officer who had been killed in action before they could marry. She deals with the unhappiness of the adopted child of her backyard neighbours. And she helps another neighbour, a writer, blinded in the war, transform his career and salvage his childless marriage. Much else happens as well, gossipy soap opera things perhaps, except for the underlay of living memories of the monastery, the renewing power of the natural world, and the honesty and freshness with which everyday human character and experience is presented. Mary also recovers Cousin Mary's \\"little things\\", a precious collection of tiny objects, such as a transparent blue glass tea set, \\"a host of miniature treasures, fairy things of of silver and gold, jade, pinchbeck, glass, ebony and ivory, all so small that only the eyes of a child could fully perceive their glory\\" (Chapter 1, section 2).In just this way William Blake claimed to see heaven in a grain of sand. Extending the metaphorical significance of the clocks and watches in The Dean's Watch, Cousin Mary kept her grip on sanity and the real world by accumulating these tiny treasures, or by receiving some of them as gifts of love from the people she knew in the village.John Gough -- Deakin University -- JAGough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Scent of Water","review":"It was a little hard to follow, and really a little depressing.

H. Newman is without doubt the most elegant, eloquent, and persuasive argument yet for the belief in God by any Christian philosopher. Despite its 19th-century origins, it remains one of the most modern of Christian philosophies yet. Gone are all references to Aristotle and Aquinas and their antediluvian methodologies of a priori logic to \\"prove\\" the existence of God and why it is supposedly \\"rational\\" to believe in such a God.In its stead, Newman uses the Humean methodology of a posteriori inferences that lead one to believe that the \\"uneasiness\\" one feels (another Humean concept) about certain disturbances of the mind/soul that are attributable to the indwelling, or natural inclination, of the \\"conscience.\\" From this natural inclination (again Hume) and by rational inference (Hume again), Newman posits step by step, and from different angles, that it is only a natural logical inference to assent to the belief in God. But it is the a posteriori experience of \\"conscience,\\" not some a priori \\"proof,\\" that leads the way.Don't be put off by the rigorous prelude of the first-two chapters; they give considerable detail to the methodology Newman intends to use, which again is empirically oriented, not a priori logically deduced. The reading after that is a breeze, containing absolute wonderment at the level of perspicuity, rhetorical advantage, and logical nuances that infer God's existence from natural inclinations. It was, and remains, a revolutionary approach, and is a worthy work to include in any Christian's library."},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"Of great interest for anyone interested in the way in which the debate between rationalism and faith squared up in the early years of the 19th century"},{"Title":"An Essay in Aid of A Grammar of Assent","review":"John Henry Newman (1801-1890) was an English Anglican cleric and a leader of the Oxford Movement; he converted to Catholicism in 1845 and eventually became a Cardinal. He wrote many influential books, such asApologia Pro Vita Sua (An Image classic),The Idea Of A University: Defined And Illustrated,Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, etc. This book was first published in 1870.He states that \\"These so-called first principles, I say, are really conclusions or abstractions from particular experiences; and an assent to their existence is not an assent to things or their images, but to notions, real assent being confined to the propositions directly embodying these experiences.\\" (Pg. 69) Later, he adds, \\"A dogma is a proposition; it stands for a notion or for a thing; and to believe it is to give the assent of the mind to it... It is discerned, rested in, and appropriated as a reality, by the religious imagination; it is held as a truth, by the theological intellect.\\" (Pg. 93) He asserts that \\"Theology may stand as a substantive science, though it be without the life of religion; but religion cannot maintain its ground at all without theology.\\" (Pg. 109)He argues that \\"by believing the word of the Church... every Catholic, according to his intellectual capacity, supplements the shortcomings of his knowledge without blunting his real assent to what is elementary, and takes upon himself from the first the whole truth of revelation, progressing from one apprehension of it to another according to his opportunities of doing so.\\" (Pg. 131) Later, he adds, \\"Therefore we may be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.\\" (Pg. 184)He notes that \\"It is the mind that reasons, and that controls its own reasonings, not any technical apparatus of words and propositions.

It is, therefore, a very important work not only in terms of understanding Husserl's own philosophy and the development of phenomenology but for anyone who is interested in the history of philosophy in the twentieth-century. It is a challenging work. Husserl's style is dense and somewhat dry and technical. You have to read very slowly and be prepared to re-read sections over and over but the result, if you have the patience, is very rewarding.It is important to realize that Husserl's road to phenomenology began with the goal of grounding the objectivity of logic against the doctrines of psychologism (the doctrine that the laws of logic are based on empirical facts of psychology and are, therefore, relative to the species homo sapiens). The first section of this book is a really devastating critique of psychologism. This is important because phenomenology is often criticized for its subjectivism and its supposed lack of objectivity. Husserl's goal in this work is to ground the objectivity of logic against all forms of relativism (especially species relativism and the relativism that Husserl believes is inherent to Kant's philosophy).Psychologism views logic as a technology of thinking, judging, proving, etc. and, therefore, believes it needs to investigate these phenomena, which are psychological phenomena, in order to work out a correct technology which would insure that we make correct or true judgements. Husserl writes, \\"Theoretically regarded, Logic therefore is related to psychology as part to whole. Its main aim is, in particular, to set up propositions of the form: Our intellectual activities must, either generally, or in specifically characterized circumstances, have such and such a form, such and such an arrangement, such and such combinations and no others, if the resultant judgments are to have the character of evidence, are to achieve knowledge in the pointed sense of the word\\" (33). This view seems to imply that this is a merely empirical question, namely: what form must our judgments take to possess the property of self-evidence and knowledge.Husserl ultimately overcomes this view by distinguishing between the sense of an expression and the act of expression itself. The sense of an act of expression is ideal and is not a real part of the act in question (this is the distinction between noesis and noema). Logic, in Husserl's view, is not concerned with the acts of judging, thinking, proving, etc. but rather with the ideal laws relating to the sense of concepts like Truth, Proposition, Object, Property, Relation, Combination, Law, Fact, etc.; concepts which, in Husserl's own words, \\"represent the categories or constituents out of which science as such is essentially constituted\\" (51). Husserl points out that all forms of relativism which base themselves on the notion of a \`subjective truth', or a truth that would be true for one person, or group of people, or one species, but not true for another, involve themselves in contradiction by using the word \`truth' in a way that is contrary to its sense and meaning. According to Husserl, laws like the law of noncontradiction \\"have their roots in the mere meaning of truth, that from these it follows that talk of a subjective truth, that is one thing for one man and the opposite for another, must count as purest nonsense\\" (47). People who believe that it would be possible for there to be beings that would not be bound by logical principles like the law of noncontradiction (who believe that these are merely empirical facts about our own thinking) will either believe that such beings understand the words \`true' and \`false' in our sense, \\"in which case it is irrational to speak of logical principles not holding, since they pertain to the mere sense of these words as understood by us,\\" or, \\"such beings use the words \`true' and \`false' in some different sense, and the whole dispute is then one of words\\" (48-49). In other words, anyone who uses the word \\"truth\\" and means the same thing that we mean when we use this word will be bound by the same logical laws as we are since logical laws relate to the sense of these words.Logic is merely the expression of the laws relating to these ideal meanings. It is similar, in this way, to mathematics. Husserl points out that mathematics is grounded in acts of counting, addition, multiplication, etc. but no one views mathematics as being grounded in the psychological study of acts of counting, addition, and multiplication. Mathematics relates to the objects of such acts which are not real parts of the acts themselves. The same is true of logic in Husserl's opinion. While thinking is carried out in acts of judgement it does not follow that logic is based in the psychological study of such acts but rather in the ideal correlates of such acts.Where Husserl differs from logicians like Frege is in his attempt to trace the ideal meanings of logic back to sense-bestowing acts of consciousness (though this is not a return to psychologism because we are not concerned with these acts in their empirical reality, or the causal mechanisms that give rise to them, but in their 'essence', i.e. in the aspects of these acts which would remain the same for any consciousness which was intentionally related to the same objects or meanings however different they may be from us in an empirical sense). \\"Phenomenology,\\" Husserl writes, \\"lays bare the \`sources' from which the basic concepts and ideal laws of pure logic \`flow', and back to which they must once more be traced, so as to give them all the \`clearness and distinctness' needed for an understanding...of pure logic\\" (86). In order to examine the sense of terms like Truth we must trace them back to the sense-giving acts which constitute them for consciousness though we will not be viewing these acts in their empirical reality as I have said (hence avoding psychologism) but will instead be viewing them in the pure generality of their essence. This leads Husserl to his notion of \`eidetic phenomenology' in which the essences of various types of acts are grasped. The analysis of these acts reveals certain ideal possibilities and impossibilities in regard to the possible intuitive fulfillment of the intentional objects presented in these acts. These are certain ideal laws which apply a priori to our acts of intuition and signification (though the realm of signification is wider than the realm of intuition and is definied by purely logico-grammatical laws rather than laws of possible intuitive fulfillment which simply means that we can conceive things if they follow certain grammatical laws that could never be possible objects of intuition, i.e., a square circle).The move back to phenomenology, and to consciousness, is ultimately what distinguishes Husserl from Frege and is what ultimately led to the Continental/analytic divide in philosophy. It is not enough, according to Husserl, to simply elucidate the ideal meanings relating to notions like truth; it is also necessary to inquire into how these meanings can be \`given' to subjects or to consciousness. As Dan Zahavi writes in his bookHusserl's Phenomenology (Cultural Memory in the Present), \\"If one wants to understand ideality, one ultimately has to return to the conscious acts in which it is given\\" (13). It is not enough for ideality, or the ideal laws of logic to exist, we have to know about them if we are going to talk about them at all. Zahavi again does a good job of summarizing this, he writes, \\"Even if it is impossible to reconcile scientific objectivity with a psychological foundation of logic, one is however still confronted with the apparent paradox that objective truths are known in subjective acts of knowing. And, as Husserl points out, this relation between the objective ideality and the subjective act has to be investigated and clarified if we wish to attain a more substantial understanding of the possibility of knowledge. We need to determine how the idealities are justified and validated by an epistemic agent\\" (11). This leads Husserl to his analysis of various acts and the modes of their intuitive fulfillment and leads him to a widened notion of intuition which includes what he calls \`categorial intuition'. This was one of the most influential aspects of Husserl's early work and had a direct influence on Heidegger.Husserl sums up his views fairly well towards the end of the work when he writes, \\"That a piece of sensory stuff can only be apprehended in certain forms, and bound together according to certain forms, that the possible transformation of these forms is subject to pure laws, in which the material element varies freely, that the meanings to be expressed are likewise limited to certain forms, which they can change only in prescribed manners, if they are not to lose their expressibility - all this does not depend on the empirical contingencies of the course of consciousness, not even on the contingencies of our intellectual or common-human organization. It depends on the specific nature of the acts in question, on their intentional and epistemic essence\\" (371). In other words, any intellect that can be intentionally related to a sensory object (to take one example) will be bound by the same laws that determine our own understanding in relation to such an object (and since the object and act are correlative one cannot change the act without changing the object). This means that even a divine intelligence would be bound by the same logical laws as we are (contra Kant).In summary, this book is a really important book and is essential reading for anyone interested in Edmund Husserl, phenomenology, or the history of twentieth-century philosophy. Anyone who is critical of phenomenology should read this work; if nothing else it will illuminate the motivations that led Husserl to develop the method of phenomenology in the first place."},{"Title":"Logical Investigations, Vol. 1 (International Library of Philosophy)","review":"The reprinting of J.N. Findlay's translation of Husserl's *Logical Investigations* (in an attractive and reasonably affordable paperback format) was one of the more welcome events in the recent history of Anglo-American publishing; this was the book which started the intellectual 20th century off with a bang -- Freud's *Interpretation of Dreams* was not widely read until much later -- and it still contains much of value. It is \\"generally understood\\" that Husserl's work is irrelevant by the contemporary standards of both analytic and \\"Continental\\" philosophy, but on a considered view of intellectual history this is wrong: in fact, the philosophical doctrine known as \\"anti-psychologism\\" was nowhere as effectively expounded as in the *Prolegomena To Pure Logic*, the first \\"book\\" of the *Logical Investigations*. There's a reason for that. Husserl's expository prose there is lucid and compelling, even in fact (as he admits) in contradistinction to the rest of this rather massive book; the six studies which follow seem today to be by turns antediluvian and futuristic.Prior to *Logical Investigations*, Husserl published a \\"Philosophy of Arithmetic\\" which one G. Frege found fault with; Husserl whole-heartedly accepted Frege's criticism of his too closely tying logic to psychological concomitants and completely redesigned his approach to ideal matters. Husserl now had an entire \\"Third Realm\\" of mathematical-logical entities to relate to the human mind, and took over a thousand pages here to explain their interrelatedness. Husserl no longer has an \\"economy of thought\\" reaching lowest common denominators; instead, he re-examines the empiricist accounts of theoretical behavior in Locke and Hume, as well as more recent writers, to 'trouble-shoot' where the problem lies.Ultimately, Husserl's extrusion of empiricist problematics results in a cathedral-like picture of the human mind, which sorts through an infinite array of formal-ontological types to 'dial in' a particular concept; I would suggest his massive introduction here to the concept known as \\"intentionality\\" (introduced some years before in Brentano's *Psychology from an Emprical Standpoint*) is essential grounding for analytic philosophers of mind. The *Logical Investigations* show what happens if you simply allow there to be a type of intentional content for every thinkable thought without Meinongian hypostasization; in a way this early phenomenology of Husserl's is like a matrix for all Twentieth-Century thought, and well worth a look for all those confronted with \\"master thinkers\\" they can't quite grasp."},{"Title":"American Indian Studies: A Bibliographic Guide","review":"This simple bibliography compilation gives little to no other information.

They are not necessarily what you can expect to pay in this exploding collectible field in 2000, but it will give you some idea of what to expect.The book is not the be all-end all of plastic collectibles. As the title of the book states, it does not devote itself to Bakelite or Celluloid or any other one type of plastic. You will need other references to find out more specifics like what type of plastic you are looking at, how to test for the material, how to spot different designers etc.What it does have are pictures of a wide range of objects including bangles and earings typical in most books, to purses, eyeglasses and even collectible childrens pieces.Order this book and enjoy the fun of collecting!"},{"Title":"The comics: An illustrated history of comic strip art","review":"First published in '74, Robinson's THE COMICS -an informal history of the newspaper comic strip- stands the test of time better than most formal histories attempted in the years since. The book's format (no strip represented with more than one or two examples) allows Robinson the elbow room to go beyond simply recounting a chronological series of high points. Where the Bill Blackbeard anthologies concentrate on generous continuities of landmark strips (and these books are terrific as well), THE COMICS covers more terrain. All of the acknowledged Grand Masters are paid appropriate homage, but in addition, Robinson covers dozens of little-known or forgotten strips (Etta Kett, Willie Doodle, Rusty Riley), single gag-panels, and even a chapter on foreign comics to close out the book. His text is refreshingly down-to-earth and devoid of snobbery, yet always respectful of the various creators and always reverential to the form itself...no doubt due to Robinson being a toiler in the same vineyards himself (among others, the very funny CLASSROOM FLUBS & FLUFFS). He makes no claim for the book as an encyclopaedic reference work, yet this is as comprehensive and carefully-researched a history as you're likely to find, even a quarter-century later. Certainly they whip the tar out of the better-known Maurice Horn titles. Perhaps the best facet of THE COMICS is Robinson's uncanny knack for describing the various styles of the artists with startling accuracy in a sentence or two. Each of his analyses on the rendering techniques of McManus, Gould, McCay, et al, is a small revelation: quick, precise and dead-on. (A born cartoonist, even in prose form.)...."},{"Title":"The comics: An illustrated history of comic strip art","review":"This is a great addition to a library that follows the inception and advancements in the comics and antimated venue."},{"Title":"Touch the Dawn","review":"Chelley Kitzmiller's interpretation of the legend of Joaquin Murietta, the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; of the old west, is one of the best books I've ever read. It has everything a romance reader (or an American History buff) could wish for, with passion, intrigue, historical tidbits, delightfully independent heroine (who is not still in her teens, thankfully) and handsome, magnetic hero. And best of all, Kitzmiller writes it with a skill and talent that is rare in a first novel. It's a real page-turner and definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Mirrors of the Soul","review":"Set in the Carolina colonies in the 1690's, Mirrors Of The Soul is a profound novel about a fugitive and a young woman, both caught up in dire and desperate times.

At best, it is a book about renovation not restoration. &quot;The hubcaps 'appeared to be chrome' so we re-chromed them&quot; is not a restoration statement but that of a hack. There is nothing on research (color matching, decals, creating missing parts, and so forth) and his examples are an endless repetition of the same theme of sandblasting . . . blah blah blah. He can't even tell you how to restore a serious dent or bend in the metal. The author does not seem to be a restoration expert but a writer about restoration. There is padding in the form of photographs of collectors. Tin plate models are really not covered in any depth yet these are the most difficult to restore. The list of suppliers of parts is pathetic. Don't waste your money. It is not even worth a 1 star rating."},{"Title":"How to Restore Classic Toy Cars, Trucks, Tractors, and Airplanes","review":"If this book is supposed to be a how-to book as its title states, it falls very short.

By the reaction I got when I gave this to her, I would have thought I had just given her five dozen real roses and not just a calendar with pictures of them! BTW, the roses pictured in this calendar are beautiful, but the beauty to me is that we can finally keep track of all these special days!"},{"Title":"Deep in the Heart of Texas","review":"This stupendous book is vital to the collection of anyone who appreciates great literature and considers himself a bibliophile. A collaboration by the Scholz sisters -- Suzette, Stephanie and Sheri -- this gripping non-fiction account reads like a Pulitzer-winning novel. Consider this excerpt:\\"Johnny picked Loni up in a white stretch Cadillac wearing a coyote fur coat. He had on cream-colored, snakeskin boots and there were rings on all his fingers. Crowning him was a brown suede cowboy hat with a falcon feather in the band. When she opened the door, Loni went into shock.\\"This was from the chapter discussing the ethics of the Bikini tests, the first hydrogen bomb trials in the South Pacific, and included some superlative speculation about reconciliation of quantum mechanics with the unified field theory. In another chapter, we find:\\"One morning, Greg called Zee. 'I'll pick you up in ten minutes. Meet me out in front of your apartment.' 'Where we going?' 'Shopping.' \\" There ensued a trip to Neiman Marcus in Dallas, and a luncheon wherein several solutions to the Middle East difficulties were proposed, examined, dissected and evaluated, and afterward they tried on swimsuits.The girls were unique in their associations with major world figures, and they were not shy with their opinions. Criticism of Jane Seymour and Morgan Fairchild, for example, was profoundly stunning: Seymour was \\"rather aloof\\" -- and of Morgan, they wrote, \\"I had never seen so many layers of heavily aplied makeup in my life. It looked as though it would have taken a chisel to get it off.\\"Personally, I almost wept when I read their observation, \\"Football is a wonderful game, with the action and excitement and the uniforms and all.\\" This not the sort of thinking that manifests itself in ordinary people, and the Scholz sisters were anything but.Deep in the Heart is a must-read for anyone striving to become a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader, a gloves-off report revealing that it's not all glitter and mascara. But these women prevailed, nay excelled, and the world is a better place for their efforts.

Or if you live in Texas and experienced any of the subject matter then it might hold your attention. However compared to great books it just can't be ranked any higher than the one star I give it. It is reassuring to know that these girls managed to have REAL lives eventually."},{"Title":"Deep in the Heart of Texas","review":"Forget the sarcasm in the other review. This is actually a very poignant and timely book that exposes how exploitive, greedy, manipulative and cold the dark side of American culture really is. The gals in this book go through a significant amount of hardship - emotional and mental pressure, ruthless mind games, blows to their self-esteem, missed opportunities - for the &quot;honor&quot; of being the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. The things the team manager and show business subjected these gals to is both surprising and amazing.It's also about how these sisters' devotion to each other, their friendships on the squad and their own sense of personal character allowed them to carry on through all that to become successful and content in their lives. That point can be inspirational - even when caught in the nasty gears of pop culture America and its want to exploit a pretty face for its own gain, they were still able stand tall at the end of the day and shake it off.This is a worthwhile book to read, if you can find it. It's timely and interesting even today, and I'd suggest it to anyone who'd want to see what the inside of show business can really be like: a far cry from the glitz and glamor the industry would have you believe it to be."},{"Title":"Yankee lawyer : the autobiography of Ephraim Tutt","review":"Even a pretty close examination (see my review of the 1943 edition) of Yankee Lawyer does not readily reveal that the Autobiography of Ephraim Tutt is a work of fiction.Train cleverly repackaged his pre-war Saturday Evening Post stories, added a touch of judicial gloss and sprinkled in some genuine citation to the reported appellate court authority. The result is a captivating portrait of law practice in the first half of the 20th century.As Tutt himself might have noted, Train's fiction contains more truth than do the facts deducible from the admissible evidence.In an age where the lawyer's craft has been replaced by clerical skill in mining the depths of the Westlaw and Lexis databases, Mr. Tutt's critical musings on the nature of law and the future of justice are prophetic, presaging much of what the law indeed has become."},{"Title":"Yankee lawyer : the autobiography of Ephraim Tutt","review":"This book arrived in excellent condition.

The Yankee lawyer is advertised as the autobiography of Ephraim Tutt, a fictional character."},{"Title":"The Early Modern Papacy: From the Council of Trent to the French Revolution, 1564-1789 (Longman History of the Papacy)","review":"One of the ways that Trent opened up the papacy to claim more power was in its giving the pope the authority to interprit the COuncil as he saw fit. This forms the basis of the author's challenge that the Papcy grew in strength between the period of the Council to the French Revolution. THis is a welcome review of the past work on the subject, since it gives the universal scope of the papacy and moves it beyond the local Italian politics.Wright shows how the various popes worked within the contexts of their political and ecclessiological confines (College of Cardinals), balancing the history out more than others. While not always successful, the papacy did achieve centralized power in the West. Wright also shows that the papacy received support from the laity, an often overlooked key to its power (power from the people).Highly detailed, maybe too much so for non-scholars, this book is the best one stop reading for an understanding of the origins of the papacy in the modern era."},{"Title":"Fairy tales of Ireland (A Four Square book)","review":"I treasured this book as a child when my grandmother gave me a copy on my first solo trip to Ireland at age nine.

I've now read all but one of the Hannay adventures (this one, plus &quot;39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Mr. Standfast&quot;) and thoroughly enjoyed them all. &quot;Hostages&quot; moves a bit slower and doesn't have quite as much &quot;local flavor&quot; as the others; but it's a fine book, with much to recommend it and much to remember.I enjoyed especially the respectful portrait of Hannay's wife, every bit as smart and tough as he -- quite surprising in an era (and culture) that I had assumed would be somewhat chauvinistic -- and a real relief from other spy stories in which the women simply scream helplessly until The Man comes along. Mind you, I have no political agenda -- and indeed am quite conservative about gender roles; but I just find it so much more sensible and realistic when women characters act like human beings!&quot;Hostages&quot; is also remarkably prescient about the onset of WW2, and how Hitler would try to rule the world not merely through brute force but through propaganda and mass hysteria. There is also some fine thematic development here, esp. the notion that a spy mission may achieve &quot;success&quot; without &quot;victory.&quot;But the best thing about the book is its final chapter; as in &quot;Standfast,&quot; &quot;Hostages&quot; has a split climax; the main conflict is resolved about 35 pages before the end of the book, and then there's a further, more nitty-gritty, down-to-earth duel at the end. Fantastic!These books are great for folks looking for good old-fashioned adventure like James Bond, but without the girls and the violence.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The three hostages,","review":"This is Buchan's fourth novel featuring Richard Hannay, hero of The Thirty-Nine Steps, and if you can pretend you are a somewhat naive reader in the 1920s and just sit back and enjoy the ride as if it were an old movie serial, you'll probably enjoy it very much. The story is set after World War I, with Hannay settled down, married and with a son. Manipulative evil still prowls the world, however, and Hannay's old spy boss Bullivant calls him out of retirement to deal with one threat in particular. As you can guess from the title, there is hostage-taking -- three times over -- and enigmatic clues to decipher and underlings to ferret out. Espionage jack-of-all-trades Sandy Arbuthnot is in on the action, as is Hannay's wife Mary, and an old wartime acquaintance of Hannay's makes an appearance as well. Admittedly, portions are melodramatic and hokey by today's standards, but it's still a rollicking good read, right up to the final confrontation between Hannay and his nemesis du jour."},{"Title":"The three hostages,","review":"The story is pretty good, but paying 4 dollars for an ebook that is filled with the same errors and lack of pagination as the free Project Gutenberg version is ridiculous. What a waste of money..."},{"Title":"The three hostages,","review":"I have enjoyed many of John Buchan's novels: The Thirty Nine Steps, John McNab, Huntingtower (especially amusing), The Island of Sheep. But this Richard Hannay novel is rather strange, involving the use of hypnotism as a means to gain political power. Most of his novels are rather far-fetched, but fun. I'd give this one a miss though. Really out-there!"},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Heroes","review":"William J. Bennett and Michael Hague, having teamed together to produce the national bestseller \\"The Children's Book of Virtues,\\" now offer up \\"The Children's Book of Heroes,\\" which celebrates heroic deeds, both historical and fictional, as appropriate inspiration for children. Certainly it is interesting to see the dozen-plus heroes, from Christopher Columbus and Jackie Robinson to the legendary Sir Roland to a young girl named Tashira, who are presented in this volume.People might be surprised as to how few religious and political figures are included in this volume given that Bennett is the editor. For the former there are just the Biblical story of \\"David and Goliath,\\" the story of \\"Father Flanagan\\" of Boys Town, and \\"Mother Teresa\\" as the epitome of the modern-day heroine. The only political figures, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, appear in episodes well before they each became president with \\"A Prayer at Valley Forge\\" and \\"Honest Abe\\" respectively. However, one of the better aspects of this book is that some of the stories and poems are not about famous people but rather about a mother (\\"About Angels\\"), dads (\\"Only a Dad\\"), and even how kids can be heroes by putting themselves on the line for someone they love (\\"The Hero of Indian Cliffs\\") and showing moral courage in order to avoiding temptation (\\"Our Heroes\\").Because of my academic interest in mythology I was especially interest in the two classical myths that were selected. The story of Theseus and \\"The Minotaur\\" is given as an example of doing the right thing even when afraid of danger while the story of Oedipus and \\"The Sphinx\\" is used to remind us that heroes use their brains. This is certainly an interesting pair given what happens to each hero after their defeat these monsters: Theseus and Ariadne never make it back together to Athens and as for Oedipus, well, you probably know what happened to him once he became king of Thebes.\\"The Children's Book of Heroes\\" does indeed present a diverse collection of role models, which at the very least, should expand a child's notion of what constitutes a hero. Each story begins with a brief comment on what the particular life lesson is from that story, for example Jackie Robinson represents \\"keeping your cool and doing the best you can in a bad situation,\\" which arguably present values that transcend the ideological spectrum."},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Heroes","review":"Bennett has edited another fine book that introduces young children to values and charactor while making reading interesting.This book of heros combines mythical and historical figures with everyday folk (moms and dads) whose actions and charactor speak to the better values that should be taught to children. The book is fairly accessible to ages 4 and 5 -- the gist of the story will usually be understood and there are enough new concepts / words to prompt meaningful discussion.

As a panorama of the many faces of heroism, the anthology works well dealing with duty, physical bravery, inspiration and integrity.There were instances where the audio quality of the presentation tended to be a bit uneven, especially the difference between the volume of the musical breaks and the performers' readings.Mr. Bennett's introduction, targeting the youngest readers, seemed redundant for older readers. The delivery by the female performers lacked some of the strength and vibrancy of the male performers.Even though excellently performed by Mr. Scott, &quot;A Prayer at Valley Forge&quot; was by far the weakest of the stories. Strongest among the stories were &quot;Knights of the Silver Shield&quot;, &quot;The Minotaur&quot; and &quot;David and Goliath&quot;.Despite some minor problems, the collection offers a good variety of stories that touch on the same moral lesson. Children should find it entertaining and instructional, while adults can enjoy the storytelling skills of fine performers retelling well-remembered tales."},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Heroes","review":"These books (part of a set)...are best in hardbound...rather large, not thick, but large...which my children love.

Using this book while studying scripture hand in hand, I was set free from bondage, not only in regards to the tithe but in many areas of my life. Once freed from the devils stronghold I could see the subtle control of ungodly forces (thought they appeared godly at the time) at work in my life. Let me say this one thing. Having been raised in the church and saved for 30 years I had NEVER believed in the tithe because it is a lie, but I chose to remain silent for the most part until I purchased this book. Now, having real FAITH I follow the sciptures teaching and give cheerfully as G-D has prospered me. Furthermore, I give where there is a need with G-D's people. I do not help build brick buildings, with coffee shops and gyms. Church, whoever tries to control your purse sting will eventully try to control your heart. Get back to G-D, HIS WORD and quit trusting your soul to an ice cube with his hand out. G-D First, Marriage Seconds, Children Third and then the Church. There is an order in G-D's plan and if you are out of HIS order, the chances are someone else is controlling you, your life, your home and your children. G-D's way is (Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, my yolk is easy and my burden light. Thank G-D and Thank you Mr. Johnston. To all the ugly and negative responders, I have no response except to say this---G-D's children will know and love the truth and you will be wasting your breath. I have no other book besides the Holy Bible-KJV to suggest you read on this subject because it is complete and easy for any lay person to read and best of all theologians can read and understand it too!

The Religious always asked How Do You Stay Open? To which The Author always replied \\"Have you ever heard of a thing called FAITH?\\"The Author is well known by most major Ministries around the nation and the World. From Benny Hinn, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, to Jan and Paul Crouch. (All are in the Book)The book Lie of the Tithe has been offered to every Major Minister and Denomination for examination in the Nation to Prove it to be in error. To this date, NOT one theologian or Denomination has been able to disprove the books solid biblical truths.The book Lie of the Tithe is more about faith than Money. Every reader reports dramatic changes in their Faith. More Intimacy with God and more freedom to experience God in a Real way are the Two Main Changes.NOT one person could produce one Scriptural basis for Paying Tithes or Offerings as taught by today's Leaders.Many &quot;Church Leaders&quot; have offered the Author large sums of money in an effort to buy his silence.

It will wake you up from that stale pew you sit on every Sunday. Every Minister, Church Leader who preach Tithing in there Church, better buckle your seatbelt when you read this book. It will change your life. You will be on your knee's asking God for forgiveness for the foolishness of your wrongful beliefs that was taught to you. If you are willing God will remove the blindfolds from your eyes that you have been wearing for so long. Listen to R.Johnston the Author of the book.

It will probably make you angry once you realize how far scripture has to be twisted to come up with what is called tithing today.

I knew it was wrong and the author proves every Pulpit Lie that I or YOU have ever heard.This is a MUST read book over all others. I cannot express the deep gratitude I feel to the author for boldly standing in this generation and speaking the TRUTH. It is true that you will know the truth and the truth shall set you FREE.

I have known of Copeland for years and his teaching on tithing is for the benefit of the tither not so his ministry can get the \\"big bucks.\\" As for Roberts, he has always taught tithing as \\"a seed I sow, not a debt I owe.\\"This author takes upon himself the mantle of Judge and Jury and pronounces these men as false prophets deserving of nothing better than a janitorial position somewhere. Don't believe me? Read this book.While the book does contain some factual information, too much of it is buried in a sea of vitriolic statements against the above-named ministers. It is not scholarly due to this fact. A far better book would be \\"Beyond Tithes and Offerings\\" --scholarly, grounded in factual information, and most importantly, done in a spirit of love.I encourage you to study the topic of tithing as I believe it is mis-taught by many in the modern church. But while you are studying, you owe it to yourself to get the best books on the subject and this is not one of them.Two stars only for the informative parts, ZERO for all of the rest.

I think the author would be well to hire a great editor and to restructure it some, because the info (if you're willing to get past all the righteous indignation) is very strong food for thought.The handling of Malachi, the tithe of Jacob, etc. are done nicely, but not succinctly. I made myself read this and am glad I did.Do I tithe? Not 10%, and never to churches that are more interested in building a building or pseudo-missionaires that are more vacations than letting spiritually mature people share their faith through witnessing and work. Sometimes I give more. Sometimes I give less. I no longer feel \\"guilt\\" when the plate passes around, because I know the Scripture that supports the decision I've spent much time praying over."},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"This book is by far the worst written on the subject of tithing. The author covers the same information over and over again. The result is a book that could've been written as a two page pamphlet that would've covered everything the author knows about the subject. Tithing is definitely not a mandate for the Christian, but if you buy this book expecting to be able to convincingly argue against tithing with anyone possessing a high school education, you'll be sorely disappointed. Don't waste your money on this poorly written comic book. Instead, get your hands on a copy of \\"Tithing in the Age of Grace\\" by Joel Parker or \\"Beyond Tithes and Offerings\\" by Michael and Mitchell Webb. Both books offer rewarding reading and will equip anyone with the ability to oppose tithing from a biblical basis."},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"As a pastor of a large church I was shocked when I read this book. For years I knew that tithing was wrong and yet I continued to practice it on the congregation. I was shocked because the author NAILED me right in the heart with my own religious hypocrisy. The Holy Spirit had convicted me for years that I was wrong to practice the law on the children of God. I knew it but did it anyhow.If there is a real Prophet from God in the land today this man must be him! The book put me on my knees and I still weep when I look back at the years I spent building what I wanted and not what My Father wanted. If I could do one thing it would be to sit down every pastor in this nation and make them read this book.I have released the congregation from the bondage of tithing and we are now on a journey to find God like never before. The book is blunt and to the point. Not a heretic or hypocrite is spared by the voice that comes from these pages. It should be that way and may God grant us more men like this Prophet.

Tony P."},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"First I would like to say that I personally believe that tithing was nailed to the cross like every other practice under the law the problem that I have is Rick Johnston's presentation and utter hypocrisy. Repeatedly in the book he refers to the readers and some people that tithe as goats. Apparently it has never occurred to him that some people tithe out of ignorance not because they are not saved. He talks about various preachers and televangelist promoting the prosperity gospel. He talks about Dallas Theological Seminary and that he turned down a job to preach at a church for 50 grand a year. Yet on his website Rick Johnston has his own Damascu$ Road Mini$try $chool Online 10 sessions at $129.00 bucks each that's almost $1,300 total plus shipping and handling. Seems to me he is making far beyond the 50 grand he turned down. He said he wrote this book so he could free Christians from the lie of the tithe. If he was really wanted to free Christians this \\"reformer\\" would quote 1 Peter 2:9. If you are a Christian you are a priest, AND JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY HIGH PRIEST! I just saved you $1,300 bucks. I also got a free Benny Hinn video with the book. At the beginning of the video he tries to get you to purcha$e other videos books including one where after giving the title says this series is so important that \\"I can't even reveal the contents to you, you will have to order this\\" If you say this is powerful information, and the fact that Christians should help one another why are you withholding the contents? Paul didn't sell Galatians or any other of his books. Yet Rick Johnston is. When he could freely give it over the internet. Anyone who claims to receive a word from God but won't tell you about it unless you buy it is EVIL! HE IS A LIAR! I couldn't help but think while watching the Benny Hinn video false prophet exposes false prophet. Their are some good parts in the book like when he questions the institutional church, but this is no different from any other false prophet that has a few good nuggets of truth besides even Satan is transformed as an angel of light.

I disagree with some of his remarks and the way he calls pastors who do tithe in there church as a Pulpit heretic and etc..... Heretics attack essential christian doctrine. This is not an essential.

According to Galatians 3:14 This was so the blessing of Abraham may fall on the Gentiles. God answers prayer because of His own goodness and faithfulness.

Your payment was made in full for every necessity in your daily life .. it is called Grace. Grace means unmerited favor. You got this when God saved you threw Jesus.

Ya eaten in the presense of the LORD in HIS house. Well read your bible Dueteronomy 14:22-26 its right there,you may have to dust it off though.It was GOD instituting communion with HIS people and blessing them for it. I wont say much more the book is a very necessary read. Much of todays push to tithe is for money not obediance to GOD. The tithe was and is Old Testament.We as Christians should have very giving hearts as we have the heart of HIM who gave it all. But the tithe, leave that at the Cross or follow the whole law! No pick and choose here. The author points out what money was collected for in the New Testament and this too if thougtht out is a real eye opener.The Church has strayed as you will see if you carefully study this book and GOD's word.GOD has blessed me incredibly so and HE has changed my heart towards money. I rule it and not vice versa and Giving is an essential part of showing money whos boss. A cheap christian is an oxymoron lets keep it that way.

However think what Christianity might be like if we acted as the author wishes us to. We would probably have splintered small churches throughout the world; probably no U.S.A., no J.S. Bach; no Cathedrals; no Mozart; no art; no widespread moral authority; in short probably just scattered groups here and there. With all of the deconstruction of morals and heritage being replaced with garbage, I will accept an element of &quot;untruth&quot; in order to protect our Western European based civilization with all of it's diamonds of inspired creation. The Church is the bulwark that stands against the encroachment of all manner of deconstructionist practices arising in music, theology, history, education and politics. I think God would be especially pleased with some of the great churches in America and their use of money. Granted, there will be human error and greed in all enterprises, however I will spend my time hitting the politicians who want to steal our wealth before I will the church, and I would sooner be taxed by the Church than the government.

On several occasions, I have written to Rick in an effort to get him to read and consider my conclusions about the subject of tithing. Until now, his only reply has been, \\"Have you read the book?\\" This review is proof positive that I have, indeed, read his book. I only ask that he do the same for me and read my book, Should the Church Teach Tithing?, and review it just as critically as I have reviewed his work. I did not intend to review his work to anger or discredit him.. If we who agree that tithing is not for the churchcannot dialog among ourselves, then how can be expect those who differ with us to dialog with us. Unlike Rick, I always welcome sincere dialog about everything I might write or say. Yet, since this review was first circulated, Rick has ceased all contact with both myself and other very close friends who share his basic premise.Page 12: AGREED: I agree that \\"tithes were never money.\\" However, Rick never goes to Leviticus 27 and Numbers 18 to elaborate this point. Tithes could only come from an Old Covenant landowner or herdsman inside the borders of Israel under the terms of the OldCovenant (a point he mocked). Although all of the tradesman occupations existed in Israel, they were not included among those who were required to tithe.Page 14: AGREED: Deuteronomy 12:6 is quoted to prove that vow offerings, freewill offerings,and firstborn offerings were brought to the temple. He could have bolstered this fact by also quoting from Numbers 18 and Nehemiah 10:35-39.Page 16: DISAGREE: Rick says, \\"The actual tithe was taken to the temple by the tither and was eaten in the presence of the Father.\\" This statement only refers to the second tithe which was brought to Jerusalem for festival sharing. Omitted are Numbers 18:21-24 and Nehemiah 10:38 which assign ALL of the FIRST tithe to the Levite servants of the Aaronic priests and is to be brought, not to the Temple, but to the Levitical cities. Unlike the second, \\"festival\\", tithe of Deuteronomy 12, this first tithe was not immediately eaten.Page 17: QUESTIONABLE: When Deuteronomy 12:12,19 is quoted that the \\"Levite has no portion,\\" we are not told that he received the greatest portion of the tithe in exchange for having\\"no portion\\" and for his servant service to the priests.Page 23: DISAGREE: Rick's understanding of Deuteronomy 14:22 concerning only tithing the \\"increase\\" and only on an \\"increasing scale\\" is difficult to understand. The key to this text is \\"year by year,\\" not \\"increase.\\" The \\"increase\\" is re-calculated every year. For example, if a farm produced 100 bushels one year, then the first tithe would be 10 bushels. If, the following year, the same land only produced 80 bushels, then the first tithe would only be 8 bushels. The Roman Empire reaped 10% of the food crops and 20% of the fruits EVERY YEAR from conquered nations as spoils of war. Also, if a piece of land MAXED out at 100 bushels one year, are we to conclude that no tithe is expected if it never exceeds 100 bushels again? Finally, if the tithe was used to feed the Levites and the needy in Israel, what would they eat during times of drought if nobody brought food because they had no \\"increase\\" from previous years? The tithe as comparable to a \\"tax\\" to support the theocracy. What would happen if our nation did not require taxes when the economy had a downturn? Rick's use of the term \\"increase\\" is not clear to me.Page 24: DISAGREE: Rick says, \\"We will also prove that the early church practiced this spiritual principle of tithing only on the increase.\\" Until Cyprian became influential in North Africa (circa 260-300 AD), tithing was not a doctrine of the early church. Even Cyprian's false teaching did not endure. However, from Acts 15, Acts 21, and all of the book of Hebrews, it can be deducted that the Jewish Christian Church in Jerusalem never stopped supporting the Temple with whatever tithes they might have accumulated.Page 26: QUESTIONABLE: Rick says, \\"Nowhere in Scripture are we ever told to tithe while your life is on the decreasing scale.\\" Again, I seriously doubt that this is true. Tithing was COMPULSORY LAW; it was not freewill, or of the heart! Other than the \\"increase\\" text in Deuteronomy, there is absolutely no hint that either Law-abiding or Law-enforcing Israelites were concerned about whether or not there was any \\"increase\\" from the previous year. The king collected his tax-tithe in order to run his government (1 Sam. 8:14-17); David and Solomon collected tithes in order to use the Levites as political employees (1 Chron 23-27); Hezekiah collected tithes as part of his political reforms (2 Chron 31); Nehemiah sent officers with the Levites and priests to collect tithes at the point of a sword (Neh. 10-13). If the land produced any kind of harvest at all, it was considered an \\"increase.\\"Pages 30-31: DISAGREE: Referring to Deuteronomy 26:11-13, Rick says, \\"The tithe never went to the temple.\\" Again he confuses the second tithe with the first tithe. Nehemiah 10:35-39 proves this to be partially in error. After receiving the WHOLE tithe in the Levitical cities, the Levites, in turn, were required to send a \\"tithe of the tithe\\" to the priests. Both Levites and priests brought portions of the tithe with them to the temple when they served their rotation per Second Chronicles 31:15-19 and Nehemiah 12:44. Unfortunately he does not expound much on Malachi 3:10 which is explained by Nehemiah 10:38. Nevertheless, Deuteronomy 26:11-13 is a discussion of the \\"third year tithe\\" -- not the first Levitical tithe.Pages 30-31: DISAGREE: Rick says, \\"The tithe was not to be stored up for possible hard times in the future. In fact, quite the opposite was taking place. The storehouse was emptied in order to keep the tither living a life of faith; in total recognition that God alone was to be their sovereign source of provision. (pg 31) We will also see this principle in the New Testament.Imagine emptying your accounts every three years and giving your surplus to the needy within your city. Imagine starting over at ground zero every three years.\\"Deuteronomy 26:11-13 does NOT say that! Every farmer had his own \\"storehouse,\\" or \\"silo,\\" at his farm. Every year he gave a first tithe of his increase to support the Levites and priests (Num. 18). Every year he also gave a tithe of what remained when he attended the many religious festivals to \\"eat and rejoice\\" before the Lord (Deu 12 and 14). Every third year he removed yet another tithe of what remained and \\"laying it aside\\" at his own front door for use by the needy and Levites (Deu 14:28-29; 26:12-13). [Note: some combine the festival and third year tithe.] The point is, the text does not say that the farmers EMPTIES their personal storehouses every third year! Israel was a land of many famines, very little irrigation, and infrequent rains. Abundant tithes in good years fed the nation's poor in lean years. Also, since every 7th year theland rested and no tithes were collected, logic tells us that the \\"third year\\" tithe would most likely fall on the 3rd and 6th years. If the storehouses were emptied on the 6th year, then the nation's economy would collapse on the 7th year. Instead, God promised a double harvest on the 6th year.Pages 32-33: ??????: Rick seems to identify the \\"New Levites\\" as modern day pastors and teachers who collect \\"tithes.\\" By doing so he completely misses the very important doctrine of the \\"priesthood of believers\\" and its connection to tithing. When tithing entered in Numbers 3 and Numbers 18, God removed the priesthood of the \\"firstborn,\\" delayed the priesthood of the \\"nation\\" (Ex 19:5,6), and cursed with death any who dared \\"come near\\" as a priest. Conversely, when God implemented the priesthood of believers, removed the curse, and commanded all believers to \\"come near,\\" the purpose of tithing was no longer valid. The Church has taught the lie that the Pastor, or Preacher, has replaced the Levitical priesthood which causes most believers to ignore their own priestly functions.Page 48: DISAGREE: : Rick says, \\"This priest, Melchizedek, is the first to appear in all of Scripture.\\" Although this may be the first formal use of the word, \\"priest,\\" Melchizedek was NOT the first priest found in Scripture. Every offering made from Adam to Abraham was made by a PRIEST. Abraham built altars, offered sacrifices, and called on the name of Yahweh as a priest everywhere he went. Archaeology and history reveal that every large city in the Semitic world was ruled by priest-kings such as Melchizedek. Abraham offered to Melchizedek because he was passing through his lands with war booty and observed very common tradition concerning spoils of war.Pages 48 and 50: DISAGREE: Rick says twice, \\"No other priesthood would ever touch such filth as the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah.\\" In Numbers 31:21-30 the Levites and Aaronic priests receive spoils of war. Spoils of war were almost always collected and used as one of the main sources of revenue to maintain the Temple. \\"Spoil\\" occurs 118 times in the KJV.Page 51: ??????? Referring to the rescued persons from Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 14,Rick says, \\"It is not significant that Abraham paid tithes; what is significant is that thispriesthood accepted them.\\" First, ALL priesthoods in the Bible gladly received spoils of war booty. Second, Melchizedek did NOT receive, or keep, ANY of the PERSONS. They all returned to Sodom and Gomorrah and their sinful lives. Although Rick's intentions are sincere, his comparison is not valid. Third, if we agree that true biblical \\"tithes\\" are always only food, then we cannot use our own principle to define what Melchizedek received as true biblical tithes.Page 89: VERY GOOD: \\"If they speak publicly in the name of God, then let's have them open the book publicly and prove their doctrine on tithing.\\" We all know that pro-tithers are almost all cowards when it comes to defending their bank accounts.Page 107: DISAGREE: Rick says, \\"Tithing was an intimate act directly between the tither and God. There was no middleman\\" Although this may be true concerning the \\"festival tithe\\" and the \\"third year tithe\\" of Deuteronomy, it is not true concerning the first Levitical tithe of Numbers 18. The great majority of Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference books distinguish between at least two different kinds of tithes. Surprisingly, I have also found that at least half of them are CORRECT about the DEFINITION and purpose of the tithe. It is a shame that the pastors and preachers do not read their own church's official dictionaries!Page 109: AGREE: Those suffering in Malachi 3:5 are suffering because PRIESTS had robbed God. Rick does not deal with Malachi 2:10-17 and should read my discussion of those texts. Although 2:11-12 mention Judah and the rest of the nation, they are \\"third person\\" because, as Rick says, God never STOPPED addressing the priests in the book of Malachi.Page 123 (cf 107): ????? Rick says that Malachi 3:8-10 reveals that the priests sinned by not giving God the glory due Him. Although this is the end result of any professing believer who refuses to obey God, I think that the obvious reason that God cursed the priests is because they were THIEVES.Page 139: DISAGREE: Rick includes Dallas Theological Seminary in his condemnation of churches which teach tithing. Although one may or may not agree with the remainder of its theology, most Dispensational schools like Dallas and Moody do NOT teach tithing and are very outspoken against tithing in their printed material!Rick begs for open debate concerning tithing with tithers, but refuses open debate concerning tithing with those who agree with his basic premise."},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"This book is everything it says it is! After reading it I no longer feel compelled to ever Pay Tithes Again. As I read it I became Angry at the Lies that Have been told to me from the Pulpit and on Christian.The Author wastes no time in Confronting the Heretics of Our Day. Somehow I feel the Saint's that have gone before us are shouting Glory at the Truths within this book. A true Word from God to the Men of this Generation!I purchased this book after reading the reviews and feel that someone that wrote a review must have been offended in their Religious Traditions!This book will set you Free! Not one stone is left unturned by the Author and His style and Humor are down to earth and understandable.I thank him and hope to meet him one day! This has changed my faith forever!Robert Glass"},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"First of all, let me say that my perspective on tithing is akin with this author's in the respect that tithing is an Old Covenant ordinance that was expired by the cross of Jesus. The New Testament Scriptures are not silent about how the believer is to discern the use of finances. Our Lord Jesus is the most wonderful example of giving there has ever been. I preface my comments here with this just so you know that I am not criticizing this book because of its position on tithing.The problem with this book is its severely critical, bitter and slanderous nature, not to mention one of most sloppily arranged works I've ever read. It is clear that the author has a mighty chip on his shoulder and is, sadly, unable to present a simple examination of the Scripture on tithing without resorting to carnal, immature methods of bad-mouthing, name calling, gossip and un-Christ-like behavior. This book severly lacks any attitude of Christian love.I have corresponded with the author, seeking to give him the benefit of the doubt, hoping I had somehow mistaken his heart and intentions. What I discovered was that this man is even more contentious and lacking love than I presumed after reading his book. I requested some of his teaching videos and read several of his articles and continued to engage in conversation via e-mail.When I sincerely questioned some of his perspectives and requested Scriptural answers, he became outraged and offended and, instead of answering my questions, simply retorted with, &quot;you know nothing about hermeneutics or proper Bible translation...&quot; Apparently Rick is the only one qualified in this regard because every question I posed to him was rejected with the same argument.I talked about human fallability and asked if he could remember a time in his life when he was ever wrong about something that he once thought he was right about, until the Lord opened his eyes. He quickly responded with, &quot;No, I have not been wrong and I Am not a man like you suppose...&quot; Notice I capitalized &quot;I Am&quot;. That is exactly the way Rick repeatedly refers to himself in e-mail correspondence; &quot;I Am.&quot; Whether it's intentional or not, I cannot say for certain, but it happend consistently and his unwillingness to admit that he has ever erred speaks of loud concern to me and should to everyone considering purchasing this book or reading and viewing any other materials by this author!In one e-mail with the author I made the remark, &quot;I have missed it and fallen short many times but the Lord is merciful and continues to Father me, correct me, counsel me and comfort me and move me ahead.&quot; To which Rick replied, &quot;You sound like a dog licking his wounds.&quot; I share snippets like this to alert you to the loveless attitudes that rule this &quot;brother.&quot; Don't be infected by it. Pray for him and let him alone.Rick also boasted that where he will be remembered in history is among the ranks of the great reformers like Luther, Wesley and Huss. When he became agitated with my questions he repeately remarked, &quot;Grow up! I speak the truth! I have asked that your manner of foolish speaking not be charged to your account,&quot; and then would tell me that the Lord just told him I was to watch tape 5 of his teaching series.From a theological perspective, Rick's book is one of the worst presentations ever put into print. The only positive note I can offer is that there were some segments of the material that were well-stated and thought-provoking. The problem is that the &quot;good&quot; is hard to focus on because of all the distracting &quot;garbage&quot; which includes a lot of &quot;circus art&quot; cartoons intended to slam various televangelists that Rick has a problem with - these, of course, are not specifically related to the subject teaching of tithing, but are clearly part of a duel agenda Rick seems to have in this book. In fact there are some ministers mentioned by name with a derogatory comment but no explanation of how this relates to the subject or anything else. He'll just name someone and then say, &quot;false prophet,&quot; and it doesn't matter if you know who he's talking about or whether he has any source to verify his accusation, you are just supposed to take Rick's word for it.In my opinion, save your money, steer clear of this horrible piece of work and be on your guard about this &quot;brother.&quot; I am not a propontent of institutional Christianity, I'm not a big fan of TBN or a lot of the popular televangelists, and I personally don't believe in tithing, but Rick has taken things to a ridiculous extreme that leaves behind the character of Christ and Christian love. Despite the rare occasional good comments pertinent to the subject of tithing that are presented in this book, I am still giving it ZERO stars.Instead of this title I highly recommend Dr. Russell Earl Kelly's book on the subject, &quot;Should The Church Teach Tithing? A Theologian's Conclusions About A Taboo Doctrine.&quot; Russ is an accomplished theologian and his book feature's one of the best, if not thee best, examination on the subject from a biblical and (early church) historical perspective.

I have never found in my life a more complete Word on tithing in all of my years of study. The use of proper biblical hermeneutics astounded me.I have invited the Author to come to our church to help us walk out the profound truths I have discovered. I would recommend that every True Pastor read this book. I found that it has changed the dynamics of my faith and Christ has become real in our services again.With several degrees in theology I was ashamed that I had been so ignorant about taking man's Word instead of what the bible really says.

I must say that nobody 777 must have been offended in some manner. His review is entirely inaccurate. While the book is confrontational it proved to me that what most Christians have been told about tithing is an out right Lie. The book not only nails the pulpit and the Televangelist on the head it uses every scripture on tithing in the bible.I got the book in the after noon and started reading after supper and could not put the book down. At 2:30 A.M. I had to go to sleep. The presence of the Holy Spirit was strong when I read it. The profound Truths leaped off of the page into my heart.I had always questioned the money practices of the church and television but had never taken the time to study the matter for myself. I thank the Author for being so excellent in his studies and making this book the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I am now reading it for the third time and the Truths keep coming. I see more each time. I think someone needs to do a critique on nobody 777 he seems to be the very religious people the Author speaks about.Bill Williams"},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"This book, Lie of the Tithe, had the potential of being a very confrontive, compelling investigation of the subject of biblical tithing, but missed its mark by far. While the book has its moments and some very good thoughts are presented at times, the whole of the book is crudely shrouded in a dark cloak of slanderous comments against sincere Christian leaders, as well as continual judgmental remarks of &quot;hypocrite&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;liar&quot;, etc. and many direct, harsh and blatant slams against a number of Christian denominations.Rather than simply presenting the Word of God, the author continuously resorts to name calling, finger pointing and pointless sidetracking arguments which are precisely critical in nature.The order of topics are sloppily scattered throughout the book and most of the teaching is presented from the author's expanded and opinionated explanation of selected verses rather than a detailed, precise presentation of Scripture and commentary offered in love, words seasoned with grace and edification.The author, in many cases, also expects the reader to just take his word for certain things rather than explain them in detail supported by fact and Scripture. The primary message the author is attempting to convey (concerning specifically the tithe) often gets lost in the midst of the pointed, critical comments and sarcastic cartoons which distract the reader and actually present an attitude that one may easily consider to be opposite of what the author would have you to believe he is preaching as being true Christian behavior.As previously mentioned, there are a few good nuggets hidden amidst the rubble (surprisingly good in fact) but the whole of this book will never be taken very seriously by anyone other than people who are likewise as critical and angry as the author appears to be. The author boasts that &quot;this is the one book your pastor hopes you never read...&quot; Rightly so as it is a horribly presented piece of work, severely lacking the attitude of Christ's love in its presentation. Don't even waste time trying to share this awful book with your pastor... it will hit his trash can before you leave the room. A much better recommendation for study on the non-tithing perspective would be the book &quot;Beyond Tithes &amp; Offerings&quot; also available through Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"The entire book could have been condensed into 20 pages if all the hatred, bitterness and name calling were left out. The author takes GREAT liberty in assuming things! Statements like, \\"Your pastor is involved just as much, if not more than the televangelist\\", are spilling out of the book on virtually every page and of course can't be substantiated at all. It's really a shame because the book has the potential to transform a persons entire outlook, unfortunately it didn't do that much for me. If you're really looking to explore the subject I would recommend a different author, or perhaps just research the scriptures for yourself. - Tom"},{"Title":"Lie of the Tithe","review":"I read this book a few months back and over time it just ate me alive. I could no longer \\"pass the plate.\\" The author is solid on his biblical knowledge. I could not find error or prove it wrong on one single point. I read the other reviews and they are not telling the whole story.I was offended to find out that I was a hypocrite. I spent many nights asking God to forgive me and to heal the people in our church from the errors of my ways.I became convicted that I had lied to myself on purpose because I was afraid that if I told the truth I would loose my church. It reached a point with me that I could not live with myself any longer and I admitted to God that I knew tithing and the collecting of money from his children was WRONG!I told the church we will no longer do this as it is evil in the sight of God. To my surprise we have made it and the Holy Spirit is doing a NEW WORK in our church.I cannot thank R. Johnston enough for being the servant of God in the manner he has been. I spoke with him and he encouraged me and offered his help anytime that I need it and that has been a few times now.EVERY PASTOR needs to read this book. It is a Prophetic Word from God to the Body of Christ.

The Prose Lancelot went on to become the centerpiece to the massive Vulgate or Lancelot-Grail cycle of romances which spanned the tale from the arrival of the Grail in Britain all the way to King Arthur's passing.This version, however, is centered solely on the youthful adventures of Lancelot - how he was raised in the magical Lake, came to Camelot to be knighted, fell in love with the Queen, and made a name for himself while in her service. It covers the discovery of his name and his intense friendship with Galehaut, a man who literally gives up everything to secure the friendship of the title character. This early version of the story ends with Galehaut's death, and is not linked to the begetting of Galahad, the quest for the Grail, or the eventual fall of the Round Table.The other drawback is that, in order to keep the edition inexpensive enough to meet the needs of the student, those segments of the romance not directly concerned with Lancelot (including a large number of adventures of Gawain, Hector, and Bors) are dealt with in short summaries rather than full translation.However, until the full cycle is available in an expensive paperback series (the full Lancelot-Grail cycle was recently translated by a team of scholars, headed by Norris J. Lacy, as Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles in Translation, but only in hardcover at an outrageously scholarly edition price) this will fill the need for at least a taste of the original Lancelot story."},{"Title":"World War One: German Army (Brassey's History)","review":"This is a great book for those who are interested in the German Imperial Army.

But before that the emphasis was on the German Army of the Imperial period from 1870s to 1918.Though much of that material is now gone due to the ravages of the last eighty some years and the surviving bits are mainly in museums, some occassionally comes out of an attic or dusty cellar trunk when great grandad's property is sold.This book will be essential to anyone who has a rational plan for collecting this material. It is a distillation of the German Army's Order of Battle,and wartime histories, and contains tables, lists, and detailed descriptions of all the insignia and orders of clothing worn and the individual equipment carried. Other works should be consulted for the details of small arms, ordnance, and aircraft. This book focuses on the individual soldier.As with all the books in this series I have seen, the use of color plates and the large magazine size format combine to make it a pleasure to peruse and consult again and again.

While she is stricken by a death early on in the play, it is her heart and soul which throughout the story is subject to her own mania. She is an insensed woman, in the stereotypical Italian thrust, full of big gestures and deep longing. Also a devout Catholic, her spiritually gut wrenching journey is tied very much into the Virgin Mary.Without dealing with what happens and why and who it happens to, this is very much a Williams play. A widowed woman, yearning for a life that is gone, sexually frustrated, emotionally wracked. There is also much symbolism, in particular Catholic symbolism, and spiritual superstition. Serafina's sexually blossoming daughter is where Serafina once was, and this provides for conflict, but the sub-plot here is not great, and the majority of the play is Serafina's wild twisting from love toward love, with the gamut in between.\\"Snatching the eternal out of the desperately fleeting is the great magic trick of human existence.\\" So says Tennessee in a terrific short essay called The Timeless World Of A play, which opens the book."},{"Title":"The Rose Tattoo (Signet 1236: Movie Tie-In)","review":"Rose Tattoo is a lengthy play, full of vibrant characters, adventuresome, physical action, interesting storyline and definitive settings. In addition, there are several themes, depression, withdrawal, lunacy and filled with symbols, the tattoo, the silk, the clock, bananas, etc. The play is perfect for the stage. Like any Tennessee Williams play, you need to read it again, in order to grasp the entire Williams style, to find the themes and symbols that further connect one to the story and characteristics. In 1952, the stage play earned a Tony Award.Much has been written about Tennessee Williams' women known as the \\"mad heroine\\" with Blanche Dubois,A Streetcar Named DesireLaura Wingfield,Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie (Broadway Theatre Archive)etc., and clearly, Sarafina delle Rose, a voluptuous Italian widow who seeks to find comfort again.Williams is very detail oriented in his character descriptions and stage settings.The play takes place in the South, near New Orleans. The time is the present, (early 50s) that spans from one evening and quickly moves to 3 years later.As the story opens, Sarafina Delle Rose is waiting for her husband, Rosario to arrive from his job. We don't get to meet him, but we learn through characterization was that he was handsome, thick black hair, and made plenty of money driving a banana truck, hauling \\"something\\" underneath the bananas. But Rosario was murdered, burned in the truck. Sarafina is in denial about her beloved Rosario, she speaks well of him. Through the many other characters, we find out more unpleasant news about Rosario.It is in the next three years we learn that lunacy and absurdity have defined Sarafina's behavior, her strange idiosyncrasies, her withdrawal, her stubbornness, and, wanting the same for her now 15 year old daughter Rosa.Then, she meets a younger man, Alvaro. Compare it with the film version,The Rose Tattoo, which is usually never as good as the original play ....

Even so, TATTOO is no longer considered among William's \\"essential\\" works, and although it has been revived now and then over the years the large cast and complex set makes stage productions few and far between.The story is set in an unspecified town along the Mississippi gulf coast (the characters reference Pass Christian and Biloxi as nearby), the play centers on Serafina Delle Rose, a passionate Sicilian woman, who lives with her husband in an Italian enclave; while her husband drives a truck, she works as a seamstress, and the two have a beautiful daughter named Rosa. But within a few minutes of the play's beginning, Serafina's husband is dead and she, pregnant, miscarries. She begins a downward spiral into a mixture of depression, religious hysteria, and superstition that threatens Rosa's happiness--and ultimately demands that Rosa live her own life in the same despair and isolation.Rosa rebells, but more significantly, Serafina makes the discovery that her late husband was unfaithful to her. She also meets Alvaro Mangiacavallo, who has an unexpected series of similarities to her late husband: he drives a truck, he is of the same body type, and he is of the same passionate nature. These events have the effect of exploding Sarafina out of her depression and back into the mainstream of life.Like most Williams plays, THE ROSE TATTOO is rich in visual and verbal symbolism and allegory; unlike many Williams plays, the play ends on a positive note, with Sarafina ultimately electing to embrace life. But in comparison to such masterworks as GLASS MENAGERIE, STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, it seems loosely written, more of a prolonged character study than a cohesive, unified play. Recommended: lesser Tennessee Williams is almost always first rate in comparison with most other authors of his generation; even so, not quite among the first rank of the author's output.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Composing Music with Computers (Music Technology)","review":"This book is relevant to several different audiences including computer scientists, mathematicians, and AI researchers. However, this book is most directly aimed at musicians/composers who are interested in algorithmic composition. The book artfully introduces computer science and mathematics concepts to those with music backgrounds, and then also explains some music concepts to those with a more technical background. Some composers will never have a need to compose algorithmically, no matter which tools they have, and others will see immediately how to employ algorithms in their work. For those in the middle,Composing Music with Computers is an essential guide. That said, the book may have been even more valuable to such readers with a greater range of worked-out examples.Throughout the body of the text,there are helpful illustrations with musical material provided at every appropriate juncture. These illustrations tend to be short and didactic, however, rather than elaborated and evocative.The most useful bridge between theory and practice is provided by chapter 7, a group of three case studies showing in greater detail how musical material can be derived from algorithmic techniques. In particular, the case study, titled \\"From content to form\\", shows how to generate chordal material using a collection of generative modules and then to shape that material with a group of \\"moulding rules\\". For example, Moulding Rule Two states that '\\"all ascending sequences. . . of notes are slurred in order to form an articulatory unit\\". At the end of the discussion is a measure of music for six instruments, complete with articulations, that clearly demonstrates the musical potential of the formalizations that are the subject of the book.Beyond that, the accompanying CD-ROM includes many applications for algorithmic composition in full-blown or demonstration versions. These include Roger Dannenberg's Nyquist language, the OpenMusic programming system developed by G&eacute;rard Assayag and Carlos Agon at IRCAM, a prototype of Music Sketcher, an algorithmic composition tool designed by Daniel Oppenheim and his colleagues at the IBM Computer Music Center, and several others. There are entries for both Windows and Macintosh platforms, with documentation and supporting material. The CDROM alone makes the book well worth the investment for a serious study of algorithmic composition. With this toolbox, readers can immediately test their ideas using established and relevant software.This book addresses a field that is widely practiced but little described: probably the closest equivalent is Phil Winsor's \\"Automated Music Composition\\", published in 1989. Not only is the book needed, but it is exceptionally well-written and, above all, clear. Composers, student or otherwise, will find a valuable resource for ideas, software, algorithms, and their underlying mathematics. This lucid and scholarly text will be read not only by computer musicians, but by everyone with an interest in the artistic possibilities of technology."},{"Title":"Composing Music with Computers (Music Technology)","review":"I am neither a musician or a computer programmer by trade but have a strong interest in both topics.I have been looking for just this type of book for a couple of years now.

This is definitely an example of her ability to do so, although not one of my most favorite works by her, it is a very absorbing tale, rich with detail, lust, and the suspicion of unrequited love. Here, the heart-breaking tale of the half-goat, half-god, Pan is brought to life. Pan has always been happy. He is loved by both the gods and the goddesses, satisfied with frolicking about with the myaids of the wood which he lives in. His father is Hermes, of the winged slippers, Hermes, who guides the dead to Hades, his mother, a nymph whom he has never met, who abandoned him with his father at birth. Pan is joy. Pan is playful. \\"Perfect Pan\\" say the maiyads. \\"Pan of panic\\" says his father. Pan is happy, yes. Until he meets Igphenia. Igphenia is daughter of a king and queen, only she is really the daughter of Helen, of Troy. Igphenia, who knows as much about herbs and plants, if not more, than Pan himself. Igphenia, who is a mortal. \\"Never fall in love with a mortal,\\" the goddesses tell him. \\"There is too much pain.\\" Yes, Pan's story is one of pain. He meets her in a field, where they talk about herbs, sharing new remedies with each other. And then she goes, back to her mother and father, and he cannot stop thinking about her. And later, after another accidental meeting, he is even more infuatuated with her. In his mind he denies that he is in love with her, in his mind and his mouth, yet he is. Pan of Pain. In the end, he proves his love, his deep love, more than a simple infuatuation, when he makes his ultimate sacrifice for her. This is a lovely book with a horribly sad ending, an ending that will stay with you long after you read the last words."},{"Title":"The Great God Pan","review":"Donna Jo Napoli is famous for her retellings of fairytales; from Rapunzel (\\"Zel\\"), Rumplestiltskin (\\"Spinners\\") and Hansel and Gretel (\\"The Magic Circle\\"), but she's also done a couple of Greek myths as well: \\"Sirena\\", and this, \\"The Great God Pan\\". Taking inspiration from two mythological mysteries: the fate of Iphigenia (the king's daughter sacrificed in order to ensure safe passage to Troy) and the goat-legged god Pan (of whom Plutarch wrote: \\"the great god Pan is dead!\\") Napoli attempts to fill in the gaps in the stories.Here Pan is presented as an innocent and carefree young god, who adores his father Hermes but whose mother is a mystery. He is happy roaming the countryside and sporadically spending time with the gods, till his life changes forever. He meets the young princess Iphigenia and cannot seem to get her out of his mind - especially when he begins to hear foreboding prophesies about her.Napoli weaves in other myths, giving them her own personal touch: the story of the nymph Syrinx and the origins of the syrinx instrument, the death of the healer Asclepius and of Orion, and the musical tournament between Pan and Apollo. Told in rich descriptive language, Napoli tells a bittersweet tale about these two individuals, which fits in well with her established canon of retold tales. To be honest, it's a little forgettable, and quite nearly as good as some of her other books, but is an interesting enough read for a rainy day and a particularly good book for those wanting to read up on their Greek mythology. Napoli tells a sympathetic story without taking away the inherent darkness and mischievousness found in many of the tales (something that other authors often do), and - as was her goal - fleshes out the lives of both Pan and Iphigenia."},{"Title":"The Great God Pan","review":"i have to admit, like all of Donna Jo Nappoli's books, she takes my breath away. on some of the latest comments i cannot agree.honestly, this is one of the top three (in my opinion the other two are Sirena and Beast) As someone who has had a passion for disney, fantasy, mythology and fairy tales, i am at a shortage of words to describe what this small book did to me. I am 17 yrs old; and i can honestly say if you are a fan of this authors work, this book must be read despite other comments. I find The Great God Pan entrancing, magical and absolutely incredible. I cried halfway through it and continued till hours afterward.I highly recommend it for those who like stories with plots and intelligent details with stomach butterflies.PLEASE READ IT!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great God Pan","review":"this is a tale of love between the Great God Pan...dear lovers of mythology,... and Iphigenia, who was sacrificed by the Greeks to appease the gods so that they would bring up the winds needed to sail to Troy. We've only read two of Donna Jo Napoli's books so far, this one andSirena, but they were both wonderful retellings of ancient myths (in this case both greek myths). She is definitely worth reading.kyela,the silver elves"},{"Title":"The Great God Pan","review":"It is said that the gods and goddesses of Greek and Roman mythology mimic some of the best and worst faults of humans. Donna Jo Napoli liberally illustrates this idea in this riveting tale which takes us back to a time when gods and goddesses ruled the earth.Donna Jo Napoli has given a three dimensional quality to this charming story in which Pan, the god of the forest plays the central role. The story is written in first person and Napoli peppers her narrative with clever dialog and tirelessly records Pan's thoughts and emotions as she tells her story.The major stories of Pan from classical literature are incorporated into this book, although Napoli uses literary license to to weave those stories together to form the story of the life of Pan. The story of Pan's interaction with Psyche in Apuleius's The Golden Ass is here, as well as the story of King Midas and Pan, and Syrinx and Pan, both from Ovid's Metamorpheses. The stories are altered, however. For instance, we see Pan weep over Syrinx's transformation into a tree, and Napoli describes Pan's thoughts of Psyche in less than sympathetic terms.Napoli incorporates Pan into the story of Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, who appears in Homer's Iliad as a sacrifice to Artemis at the beginning of the Trojan War. The incorporation is clever, but students of the classics may find fault with this rearrangement, as well as the startling final conclusion since it is not reflected in classical literature. Still, it's a fun book for anyone whether they're interested in classical mythology or not.The story is readable and the print is fairly large, but I would recommend this book for high school students and above since these stories reflect some mature situations that are inherent in the retelling of many classical myths."},{"Title":"The Great God Pan","review":"I've read some of the author's other retellings and was a bit disappointed with this one. We meet Pan, the half goat/half god who basically flits around the woods with other mythical creatures all day. It isn't until he meets Iphigenia and falls in love with her that his life really seems to have a purpose. People with any background in Greek mythology know that Pan had a curse placed on him upon birth that he will never be loved in return. His quest to find Iphigenia again then seems a bit fruitless to the reader, but what we don't realize is that he may be able to save her from her father's mission to sacrifice her. This book needed more detail. I felt it was lacking in some other areas as well, as the plot meandered quite a bit. I did like how the author included a family tree at the beginning so we understood how everyone was related however."},{"Title":"Japanese Kimono Designs (International Design Library)","review":"This is a small collection of some black and white examples of kimono.

I did not expect it to be so small, but I think it was because all the paper copies my instructors give me is a large piece of paper. None the less, I think this book is a helpful anatomy book, since it explains what the artist needs to know and is good for the basic review of muscles. Bridgman does a good job of breaking things down and making it easy to see the underlying structure.

Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I have nearly ten anatomy books and this is the one I grab for most when I need to solve an anatomy problem while drawing or sketching.For the most part, Bridgman first simplifies complex anatomy problems into simple structures before exploring the muscle patterns into more complex detail. This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible.For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's actually *GREAT* for enthusiastic beginners. It has a little bit of *everything* depicting anatomy construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an *excellent* reference for all working artists.This is the book that really turned me on to the genius that is Bridgman. At first glance it may not be immediately impressive, but flip to page 167 for a quick look at his cubed-construction of the head. It's Bridgman's brief but effective treatment of cube-construction in this book that really, really impresses me. Many books *mention* cube-construction for heads; many books show a brief picture or two. But not many show it with the precision & detail that Bridgman conveys in just a few short pages. It deals with figure construction mainly in its parts- for full-figure movement, check out Bridgman's Complete Guide, or his less overwhelming Bridgman's Life Drawing. Constructive Anatomy begins with hands, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the book. (Bridgman's 100 Hands is much, much better.) Arms are next and they're easily among Bridgman's best, although not all the drawings are crystal clear. Many of the BEST drawings in Bridgman's Complete Guide are taken from this book, and his depiction of arms here is definitely among them. The shoulder & neck briefly follow, and are above average in their depiction. Then it's time for that excellent section: the cubed-construction of the head. It's only a FEW pages- I don't want to oversell it. But in my opinion at least, it's worth the price of the book. Individual features follow: eyes, nose, ears and mouth are simply & accurately treated. This is a more *in-depth* book than Heads, Features and Faces- which is mainly a simple introduction to the basics. Maybe the BEST section in Constructive Anatomy involves the Torso. He describes more in a few pages than most books ever do- and with a precision & beauty that few seem to match. The pelvis, legs, knees, feet & toes finish this truly excellent work. If anyone's overwhelmed by Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is a simple & effective choice to make- Highly Recommended!In short- Along with Book of a Hundred Hands and Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is currently in my Top 3 by Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"One of the few books that I constantly refer to in figure drawing. Although the content was written way back in 1920, the concepts are still as valid then, as now.The simple pencilled illustrations provide easy guidelines as to where one muscle stops and another begins. This enables one to draw a muscly figure with a few lines and shapes to show bulk and depth, especially with comic book illustration.Finally, the price is perhaps as great a drawing factor as the content. Some comic book artists swear by Geoge Bridgman's books. You might also want to try some publications by Jack Hamm."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out. When I bought this this book, I thought I knew a little about human anatomy. Well, put it this way, I was wrong! This book is PACKED with anatomy! Thanks to it, I've been getting alot better. Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"In fact, I can safely say that this really is the most important book on artistic anatomy one can learn from. Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.----------1: The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough. Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part. Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.2: The anatomy isn't really exaggerated. Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another. If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click. The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.3: This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\" If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style. Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.4: I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this: \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\" Don't do that. It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click. Once you learn the fundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings. As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"---With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together. It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons. Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at. Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout. I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff. This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this. Like I said, take your time."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.Pros:As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.Cons:Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. For an anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"this book is a tragedy. great book, but publication quality is zero.don't buy a reprint.get the original."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.The other reason I love this book is the price. It's small size makes it very easy to carry around too.I feel I've improved tenfold since I've purchased this book on making my anatomy look more real."},{"Title":"Yankee storekeeper","review":"Yankee Storekeeper is an autobiographical book about running a general store in the olden days, covering related topics ranging from shoplifting and undertaking to religion and secret societies (the Grange).The author was raised on a farm and left home at an early age to work in a store, and eventually owned and ran two stores.

But because of the cost of the Treo, I felt one was necessary. My thought with the Treo was that it's large enough and I don't want to add any more bulk to it. I had a hard time finding a \\"slim\\" case for it and originally purchased a silicone \\"jacket\\". That was okay, but it really picked up dust and just looked and felt sort of cheap. Then I found the Sena case, and although it was expensive, it's completely worth it. It's slim, protective, and allows for full function. The only complaint that I have is how stiff the leather is, but it's leather so it will break itself in soon enough. So basically, I have no complaints. This case is amazing, and it doesn't take away from the appearance or function of the Treo. I recommend this product to any Treo owner, I can happily say it's perfect!"},{"Title":"Hasretinden Prangalar Eskittim","review":"The Sena LeatherSkin case is similar to the company's MagnetFlipper Case but without the flip lid. As with other skin cases, the front of the case is open, however every manufacturer makes decisions about the tradeoffs between protection and usability. Some choose to cover the entire front of the case with plastic; other cases such as the S650 Skin case cover the central control buttons while keeping the keyboard and screen exposed, while still others cover the screen but not the keyboard. Sena chose to maximize accessibility to all features.In terms of the front of the case, I think Sena got it right by keeping it simple. Everything is exposed that should be: screen, navigation buttons, speaker, even the status light. There is a cross bar of leather between screen and buttons. People with large fingers may find it annoying because you have to press with just the tip of the finger or fingernail on the home, menu and up buttons. The crosspiece gives a bit more protection and stability to the case and is an appropriate design choice.The advantage of this type of case is that it looks and feels good without adding much to the Treo. It may offer some protection in case of a fall, though the screen is the most vulnerable. You would have to step up to a flip lid design to get that sort of protection. At least you can slip a screen protector over the screen.Although the snap closing over the top does hold the Treo in place securely, it seems to be at odds with the slim form fit design because it creates a small bulge in the back of the case. Because Treo owners tend to be enormously finicky, this may be enough to turn some off of this particular case.The Clip version of the case uses Sena's ratchet beltclip design. The case ratchets every 45 degrees allowing for full 360 degree rotation. Like most belt clips, the Treo is released from the clip with a simple push on the top of the clip. The clip itself fits belts 1.5\\" wide. The clip is basic plastic and it is certainly not thin. The Treo rides too far off the belt. The case side of the mechanism, although plastic, is stitched firmly in place on the back of the case.NOTE:Smart-Gamer is the authorized seller of this brand, other seller banned by Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Hasretinden Prangalar Eskittim","review":"sterling123 is *NOT* selling this case. What he actually sent was a cheapo piece of vinyl crap, no explanation offered. Hopefully, Sena will decide to sell the cases here directly soon.Case is slim and elegant, doesn't interfere with the use of screen or keyboard. If you want to protect the screen when you're not using it (this case doesn't, which is why I only give it 4 stars), Sena also makes one with a flip-down cover -- because it flips from the bottom instead of the top, it's a lot less dorky-looking than the usual sort. Ideal if you carry it in a handbag or belt pouch and don't want a lot of added bulk or weird-feeling rubber."},{"Title":"Following Jesus in the \\"Real World\\": Discipleship for the Post-College Years","review":"In this visionary work, Richard Lamb provides a rare and long-needed treatise on what it means to take a Biblical foundation in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and turn it into the practical choices of how to spend your life.

These are minor points, however. No book can cover everything.All in all, this book is a wonderful resource.

Lots of Plot,humor,suspense and action in it.FBI Agent Jake Donnelly just found out is beloved Aunt Sophie left her property and millions to her bull dog Muffin. Jake will inheirit after Muffin's long healthy life. But if Muffin gets put to sleep or a accident the place will go to Leanne Crosby pet shrink.Jake is not happy that he has to take care of Muffin. Muffin is not a happy dog and now he has to spend two weeks at the pet spa that Leanne Crosby owns. Jake thinks she is running a con. So he had his partner check up on her.Leanne Crosby is a widow who's husband left her a lot of money. Her pet spa used to be a prison with tennis courts,golf course. It has a hotel and cabins 3 restraunts, pool.I have never thought of the idea of going to a pet spa but now I have different view.especially about pet shrinks I could use one.Leanne is beautiful and she does teach Jake a lot how to make Muffin happy and by thier playing together is gives them both exercise and fun. Leanne is ready to fall for Jake when Jake's partner drops off his fiance at the dog resort.It is really his witness who keeps getting found by the bad guys. They can't tell anyone else who she is till she testifies they need to keep her safe thier must be a traitor in thier office.

I do have a rule against reviewing an unfinished book but.......this at 50% is just grinding on my nerves. A few have already mentioned the sudden switches in plot and characters without any spacing at all. Totally inexcusable even for a bargain. And the supposedly romance stuff is painful and excessively redundant......makes my teeth hurt. Love dog stories except for 1 kind, so I may stop just in case author has plans to off the dog! I do NOT recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"If not for some serious, and I mean serious editing issues, I would have liked this more.

But as for the story, it was amusing and I loved the dog.....a bit sugary, but heck, that is what dessert is all about."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"Only because of the issues I am having did I rate this only three stars. If it had been COMPLETE I would have certainly given it five stars. I am mostly enjoying this book BUT there have been many places where sentences are not complete and then it goes to another paragraph. This is very annoying and distracting. Hope this will be addressed before it is sold again. SOMEONE with editing experience needs to go through this Kindle edition and fix these issues.Otherwise, it is a completely enjoyable and funny story."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"FBI agent Jake Donnelly had a tough childhood, but he had a sanctuary with his Aunt Sophie. She was kind, patient, and loved him, and he grew to love her and his uncle very much. For years, at the end of her life, Aunt Sophie tried to fix him up with Leanne Crosby, pet shrink and owner of a dog spa where she would vacation with her bull dog, Muffin. When Aunt Sophie passes away, she leaves her entier estate to Muffin, to make sure he is well cared for during the rest of his natural life. Jake, of course, is awarded Muffin, and then eventually the estate upon Muffin's death, as long as he accepts the dog. Jake does not, under any circumstance, want the dog, and says so. Until he finds out that if he doesn't take the dog, Leanne Crosby, whom he thinks may be a quack and a rip off, will get Muffin and inherit the estate upon his death. He decides he will take the dog to keep his Aunt Sophie from being swindled after she is gone. He learns of a final provision. He must take Muffin for a mandatory spa vacation, 2 weeks a year.This story had me laughing from the very first pages. I very much enjoyed the humor, and the way Muffin was given character and played a role in the plot. The sparks eventually fly when Jake and Leanne meet and they try to resist them, because they both have troubles trusting each other. It is a warm and touching story of how man falls in love with woman, and man falls in love with his dog. There is action and adventure around every corner, and don't forget the romance. When a book can make you laugh and touch your heart too, you know it is a winner.I highly recommend reading this book.

Even his favorite piece of property, the cabin he grew up in, on the lake. Which is all he really cared about anyway. And to make matters worse, his aunt wants him to be Muffin's caretaker. How does a tough FBI agent deal with this ordeal? But deal he must or turn over Muffin, and the inheritance, to a dog shrink. So Jake grudgingly takes ownership of the long suffering canine and learns he must take Muffin on his yearly two week vacation at a dog resort. Ridiculous as it all is, Jake has to abide by the will, but he is not happy....until he sees the lovely spa owner.LeAnne Crosby owner of Happy Hounds, loves Muffin and is very happy to see him on his arrival. She is instantly attracted to Sophie's nephew and sizes up the situation between man and dog. And knows she must help them, as Sophie loved these two males dearly while she was alive. She patiently and tenderly coaches Jake on how to care for his dog. And happily watches as the bereaved animal reluctantly starts to respond to his new owner. But all does not go well...within days, LeAnne is shot at and Jake takes her and Muffin away from the resort for safety. They spend precious time together in the cabin and naturally their love and passion for each other grows. Jake starts to deal with some emotional issues from his childhood with the love and help of LeAnne. Sigh!This story was delightful and touching. Although the shooting and fleeing from bad guys was an important part of the story, it did not overpower the humorous element.

There's also no indication of plot change - I'm not sure if it's written this way in the actual book form but one minute you're reading about Leanne at Happy Hounds and the next minute Jimmy (the bad guy) is speaking - it was very confusing and frustrating - so much so that several times I thought about just quitting the book but I stuck with it. I like Trish's characters well enough and the story line even though some of it was a bit unrealistic and the writing could use a little \\"cleaning up\\" - all in all a cute story and really you can't beat the price (it believe it was free when I got it)."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"Trish Jensen is AWESOME!! I have enjoyed all of her books. I often laugh out loud while reading her books."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"This was an OK story, but I almost stopped reading because of how irritating several things became. First was the switching from one set of characters and a scenario to another set of characters and a different scenario within a chapter. No blank line or set of stars or chapter break to indicate this was happening. In the beginning when I didn't know the characters well yet, Jake and LeAnne would be talking to each other. Then the next line would have Jimmy talking to his boss. After a page or so, the conversation between Jake and LeAnne would start up right where it had left off. I kept thinking, \\"how did Jake become Jimmy, and why is Jimmy's boss calling him Bunny? I thought the dog was named Muffin, not Bunny!\\" I don't know what kind of literary device you would call this, but I think it's a very bad one. This didn't happen just once, or twice, or three times, or four or five times. It happened for about 3/4's of the book. Really irritating!Second irritation was that Jake and LeAnne were both supposed to be adults in their mid-thirties, but Jake especially acted more like a horny teenager. LeAnne was almost as bad. It ruined every scene where they were supposed to be interacting normally to instead have long explicit descriptions of what Jake wanted to do with LeAnne sexually (only he didn't, - he just thought it).A final irritation was the dog Muffin. I really like dogs and I believe they are usually cute and smart, but Muffin was just so extremely portrayed that it was pretty unbelievable. If Muffin liked something, he would yip; if he didn't like something, he would snort. And Muffin supposedly understood all spoken conversations so that when Jake or LeAnne didn't want Muffin to understand what was being said, they would S-P-E-L-L a word so as not offend Muffin. An English bulldog really isn't that cute and certainly not that smart, but despite his apparent super-dog status, I kind of got to appreciating his frequent snorts! Muffin does one unusually bad thing when he bites an innocent child--his super highly developed \\"intuition\\" should have stopped him from doing that, wouldn't you think?Finally at about the 3/4's point, the book got going and I enjoyed the final resolution. I once had a teacher who only used two comments when grading something. It was either \\"Good\\" or \\"Could be better.\\" In the case of this book, I think \\"Could be better\\" is an appropriate comment!"},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"The book was ok and I did finish reading but was a little too predictable and not always believeable.

It was sweet and the growth of understanding between these two was fun to watch.* Jake Donnelly evolved.* Although there was lots of internal dialogue about sex, we did not spend a great deal of time in bed.Cons of this book:* There was LOTS of internal dialogue about sex.* The human romance was so predictable, it didn't really grab my interest. This was a romance/mystery, so I accept predictable in that we know HE and SHE will wind up together in the end. That wasn't my problem. It was their lack of flaw. Their lack of flaw was pretty much spelled out each and every time the two met. Ad nauseam.* HE was physically perfect. He was the bad boy of every woman's fantasies. Strong of jaw, broad of shoulder, full head of hair, breathtaking eyes, manly, muscular, tall, the best FBI agent in the business, heroic, uber-wealthy (but of course the money was unimportant to him), made of steel except for his soft as mush, injured little boy inside just waiting for the love of the right woman. He was reluctantly aware of how drop-dead gorgeous he was, but only because no woman had ever said no to him, until SHE came along, so he was forced into concluding he had some physical allure.* SHE was so physically perfect that he couldn't breathe around her. She was also completely pure in motive, chaste in spirit, innocent, highly intelligent, not a mean bone in her body, generous to a fault, uber-wealthy (but of course the money was unimportant to her), and naturally, completely unaware of how drop-dead gorgeous she was.* Neither had a flaw except for the hurt others had done to them which caused them to mistrust. Sigh.(Why are none of these men rough and ruggedly attractive because of that \\"je ne sais quoi\\" certain something about them? More like a Steve McQueen kind of guy. Why are none of the women attractive in a normal way that cleans up real well? The kind of people that get better looking as you get to know them because they grow on you by being intelligent, interesting, colorful and of good character? Give them some flaws writers, even if they're just quirky ones! JEEZE, I've NEVER met a perfect person, nor would they interested me if I did.)* The writer is unfamiliar with segue. I suggest she study it. Her lack thereof was so bad that there was a point about 10% into the book where there was a change of cast, location and topic that was such an abrupt non sequitur, I called Amazon to give them a heads up that there was some sort of paragraph scrambling going on they should fix. To my embarrassment, it turns out that's what the author does. Please, at LEAST start a new paragraph. Don't just drop it in without warning. Once I got the hang of her odd style (oh, Editor where art thou?) it eventually quit throwing me off.It is well worth reading for the developing relationship between Muffin and Jake. That story-line is wonderful. Everything else is just run of the mill filler. It was worth the $1.99 I paid for it as a Kindle Daily. It is NOT worth $7.69."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"I really enjoyed this...I'm a huge dog lover and thought Muffin was great!

Love my Kindle and the ease of buying books like this."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"In Trish Jensen's latest, &quot;Against His Will,&quot; we have the unlikely Combination of Jake Donnelly, FBI Agent, a bulldog named Muffin, Bob and Scooter (the T-Shirt guinea pigs-trust me, you have to read the story to get the scoop on these two), and a lovely doggie psychologist, LeAnne Crosby.Tough Fibbie that he is, Jake wants nothing to do with Muffin until he finds out his beloved Aunt Sophie has tied his inheritance to his care of the dog, and that in the event of his default, all reverts to the lovely LeAnne. Quickly, we find out why Jake is so emotional about one of Aunt Sophie's properties. He's also suspicious about LeAnne's occupation and her up-scale resort for humans and their canine owner. Certain that she's fleecing the unsuspecting, he decides to play along with the terms of the will if only to debunk the doggie shrink. What evolves is one of the most entertaining stories I've read in a long time as Jake and LeAnne at first circle each other warily and then break down and admit their attraction for each other.The book had me laughing and, in the end, crying. It was one of those books I wanted to go on for another 300 pages or so *just* so it wouldn't end. My heart went out to Jake and how important his Aunt Sophie and Uncle George were to him. And I loved LeAnne for her ability to get 'close' to him and help him.I don't know of a better way to spend a couple of summer days, and if Amazon would let me, I'd give &quot;Against His Will&quot; a 6-star rating. I can't recommend this one highly enough and I'm looking forward to Ms.Jensen's next release."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"...it's changed my behavorial habits. Normally, as a member of the Brotherhood, I wouldn't be caught dead reading romantic fiction. Because Trish is so talented, and has a way of making these stories both believable and funny, I now find myself openly seeking her work out in the bookstores I patronize.Buy this book - the premise is creative, the characters believable, and you'll understand why Trish is the Brotherhood's favorite (and only recommended) romantic fiction author. She must have some Southern blood in her somewhere...."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"Special Agent Jake Donnelly isn't having the best year. His dear Aunt Sophie, with whom Jake had spent his wonderful childhood summers, has passed away...and left him a most peculiar bequest: guardianship of her beloved bulldog, Muffin. Her very WEALTHY bulldog Muffin. So when man and mutt meet face to face and it isn't love at first sight, what's a Special Agent to do? Find LeAnne Crosby, that's what!--even if it doesn't sound like a great idea at first.Trish Jensen weaves a rompingly-funny, heart-tugging tail [er...tale] of romance and laughter as we follow Jake Donnelly through the peaks and pitfalls of pet parenting. With the gorgeous and brilliant Dr. Crosby to help him fall for man's best friend, and with hit-man Jimmy 'The Bunny' on his tail, Jake Donnelly is in for quite a vacation indeed!Fetch this book home and curl up on the furniture with it. It's absolutely a must read!"},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"Okay, it's cute. Cute story, cute characters, cute cute cute. There is even a cute bulldog named Muffin. Cuteness overload.But is it hot?Weeelllllll .....Jake Donnelly is an FBI agent who inherited some money and property, including a beloved mountain cabin, from his Aunt Sophie. Actually, Jake didn't inherit anything. Muffin, an overindulged bulldog accustomed to spending two weeks of his summer vacation at a dog spa, inherited the whole thing. When Jake learns that he is muffin's designated caretaker, he also discovers that the mountain cabin can be his - provided he takes exemplary care of Muffin. So it is that Jake winds up at the dog spa with Muffin, where he encounters comely dog psychiatrist LeAnne Crosby. He views her with suspicion and disdain, suspecting that she might have tried to fleece his aunt. And a pet psychiatrist? Seriously?LeAnne realizes that Jake is suspicious of her, but that does nothing to dampen her desire for him. Or his for her. They sniff around each other (GET IT?), pushing and pulling against their attraction. And then a witness Jake and his FBI partner are protecting shows up, and some bad guys show up, and we have a different chase on our hands.The subplot is just a ridiculous farce. It's almost as if Trish Jensen knew it was silly, but she couldn't stop herself from including it. The reason for it becomes quickly apparent (let's just say that it might involve that cabin in the woods), but you can't help but think that there would have been a more plausible way to make that magic happen.Oh, yeah. The magic. The sex scenes are ... cute. A lot more cute than hot, let's just say. After all the teasing, I wanted a bigger payoff. The sexy times definitely fit in with the rest of the cuteness of the book, though, so if that pulls your engine cord, then you will love this book.A word about the cover: what is up with THAT? An apple with a bite out of it? I don't recall apples being a central motif of this thing, nor is there an Adam-and-Eve theme going on. That cover is a head-scratcher.Published on cupcake's book cupboard. @VivaAmaRisata.Thanks to NetGalley for the preview."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"This charming book kept me company on a business trip, and was I ever glad I had it!

Only read 31% of this book and had to ask myself why was I wasting my time on such an insipid story.

Don't waste any of yours on this book!"},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"Stupid, silly, not worth my time.

It was a little difficult to keep track of the scene changes, though, because whatever formatting change (probably a blank line or three) indicated scene changes completely disappeared in the Kindle book, making the chapters rather dense and confusing as single buckets of undifferentiated words.As an example:...she was trying to tempt him.\\"How in Hell did you lose her again?\\"After mature consideration, and carefully reading through the surrounding text, one discovers that the scene and characters have changed to a different set entirely, but it's extremely irritating to have to work so hard for what ought to be a light read.Whomever she paid to convert this book from its print format should be ashamed to have done such shoddy work, and the author really ought to get her money back."},{"Title":"Against His Will","review":"...this is another gem from her.I loved 'Stuck With You' and this is just as enjoyable.

Jake Donnelly's beloved aunt has died and instead of the cabin in PA that he wanted, she has left him her bulldog, Muffin. With Muffin comes control of her $20 million estate -- but there are stipulations, one being he has to spend two weeks with Muffin at a doggy spa. The FBI agent had other ideas as to how to spend his summer vacation but knows this is the way he will eventually obtain what he wants. He doesn't expect to fall in love with the owner of the doggy spa,LeAnne, an animal psychologist. In fact, he is skeptical at first wondering how in the world this elaborate place was paid for. There is action, too, when his partner at the FBI decides that a trial witness whose life they are trying to protect would be well-hidden at the spa with the Jake.

This book adds a very needed overhaul to the implant technology for SR. The authors went through great detail to cover all areas of 'cybertechnology' which had been previously covered in SHADOWTECH and CYBERTECHNOLOGY and made them better balanced and playable. In addition to updating the previously published 'technology', it adds many new systems as well as explains some of the most debated and controversial game rules. The book is very well laid out and most references made to other SR books are very well cross-referenced. A must for any Gamer that wants to keep up with the SOTA. It surpassed many of my expectations."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"This 3rd Edition book is great! The revisions to the rules that they've made in here make things so much easier and so much more interesting! There are no more unfair advantages (well, some maybe, but less). And it's much more mage friendly. All of this is VERY good. And the additions are cool, too. The balance tail, for example, looks cool and is functional, too! All you 'Runners out there, GET THIS BOOK, it's worth it!"},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"Although packed with all sorts of useful information, nifty 'ware, and cool equipment, Man &amp; Machine continues the latest FASA trend of fairly flavorless material. As a reference book, this is excellent... well cross-referenced, covering a great deal of information previously availiable only after searching through multiple volumes, and well clarified and thought-out. For the toymonger or the street sam in the group, this is a must-see. However, don't expect any shadowtalk here, folks, it's strictly rules and equipment."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"...and some that do.Man &amp; Machine is the &quot;tech&quot; book for Shadowrun, Third Edition (SR3). It replaces Shadowtech and Cybertechnology, and collects all the myriad bits of cyberware, bioware, and chemicals into one easy-to-use volume. There is no Shadowtalk, as this is, primarily, a rulebook.What's in? There are extensive discussions on cyberware and bioware, including a revised way of combining the two that reduces the interaction considerably. While I'm not entirely happy with that, I can see the reasoning behind it. An entire new category of equipment, nanoware, is included. It's not the all-powerful nanotech of transhuman science fiction, but it's at an appropriate usefulness for a technology still in its infancy.We also have chapters on chemistry and pharmaceuticals, from thermite and fuel-air explosives to new cocaine derivatives. There are also rules for cybermancy, and a brand-new section on medicine, surgery, and healing for the game.What's good? Actually, the single best thing about the book is the chart detailing EVERY SINGLE PIECE of personal enhancement in the game. It's almost like the nigh-deity-like chart from Fields of Fire. The contents are uniformly of fairly high quality, and it's very useful. It re-introduces bioware (which skipped SR2 entirely, save from using Shadowtech), and adds decent other material and rules, which are always good if they're filling a hole (as they are here).What's bad? Not much, really. Just little individual bits...like the fact that cyberlimbs are, by and large, useless. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that having a lot of marginally useful cyberware isn't very good. The major part is revealed in the designers' notes...where they discuss what they decided caused Essence loss...and then proceeded to ignore it for a lot of items. Their definition was nervous system interaction...which is all well and good, but bone lacing and peg legs have no nervous interaction whatsoever, and therefore should not cost Essence...at all. And, I'm still a tad peeved that almost all of my SR2 characters would go into massive system shock and die upon conversion.All in all, though, it's still a good book, and nigh-essential for anybody playing a Shadowrun game."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"(Dito my review of Cannon Companion) Crammed full of info, new gear, and clarifying/expansive rules this sourcebook is a must have for those interested in cyberware, bioware, all new nanoware, what is does for you, how it works in you, and how to fix it when it breaks (and with the new rules, it breaks a lot). All of the above plus extensive sections on Cybermancy, Chemistry, Damage, Healing, and Surgery. Following other recent trends in SR products, M&amp;M has misspelled words, and misaligned columns, has broken away from good old Shadowland postings, and refrences you heavily to other books forcing you to fork out the Y and own four different sourcebooks in order to understand a certain game mechanic to its completion. While those not gifted with photographic memory will possibility find the huge amounts of new rule varitations and expansions cumbersome, it is always a pleasure to figure out what it takes to build a friggin' ambulance in the Shadowrun future."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"Welp, in keeping with 3rd edition FASA dumps the slick look of the older books and goes for pure game mechanics. It's basically a compressed version of Shadowtech and Cybertech with very little new stuff thrown in. So, if you own all the gear books for 2nd edition don't even bother picking this up, it's just as easy to look it up in them. The tables within the pages(not in the back) are misaligned and the descriptions are not up to par at all with the old stuff."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"While a good idea they have way too much stuff. Who in their right mind would ever need almost 160 pages of rules and equipment. While adding far more depth and volume they added so much that using the book is a little tedious at first. Also they mad eit so that unless you are a street sam or cyber-monster yuo will never need this much ware'. Also who giver a rat's a-- if you fart in a public place you don't need bioware to prevent it and ant GM who uses that to penalise their characters should be drawn and quartered. SHadowrun is designed to be free flowing while this book covers a lot of holes in SR3 it also slows character creation and game play.All in all not bad and worth your money but be ready for an info overload."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"I really like this book and since I've read both the english an the german version I must say I prefer the german one. This is mostly because the german translators included shadowtalk in it (and real fun stuff by the way). What I don't like is the shock rules. I think it's overpowered. This book is definately worth a buy for all those cyber- and bioware junkies out there. Quite some new stuff and mostly really cool."},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"the new rules for cyberlimbs (and torsos and skulls) and the bioware clarifications gives that fourth star but the new stress rules are bit too sluggish and well, a bit stupid at some points (stress on intelligence and willpower?) the new nanoware is quite nice but you need too much gizmos to keep it working the new cybermancy rules and preview are very enlightning about what cybermancy really means and how it works the new chemistry stuff is also nice but as usaul the really effective compounds is impossible to get your hands on-too many useless and only because its &quot;cool&quot; gear(eye guns cyberfangs cyberhorns cyberguns balance tails etc.) and too many stuff they just put there so you will have somthing to drool on-"},{"Title":"Man & Machine: Cyberware (Shadowrun (Fasa Corp.))","review":"There's lots of goodies in here.

However, I feel the section on cybermancy needs some discussion. When I first read about cybermancy in the Cybertechnology sourcebook I felt that the book did an excellent job of making cybermancy sound creepy, dark, and dangerous. Which it should because a cybermantically treated character will have to do lot of role playing to do their character credit. While Man and Machine has all the game rules necessary to use cybermancy I reccomend you take a look back at Cybertechnolgy to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the practice if you intend to use it in your games."},{"Title":"DRAGON GATE","review":"The book is a detailed study of the university examination systems in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. As Zeng astutely notes, \\"The history of exams is a history of an institution, a system. On the other hand, this system is not an empty shell, but a structural order governing human behavior and consciousness. In that sense, what we have been studying is a key behavioral pattern, the history of the pattern, and the power behind that power\\". This book is an excellent introduction to what can be called the \\"culture of exams\\" in the Far East. It is a badly needed sourcebook and rare history of a topic which encompasses such diverse subjects as history, education, politics, and religion. Zeng is quite good at delineating the precise influence of Japan on the exam systems, general historical trends in the development of these systems, and the social roles that the exams serve.There are, however, several drawbacks to the book. Zeng's writing style is often quite dry and sometimes awkward, and in certain sections the book is not very well organized. Finally, at $... US, quite pricey. But these faults do not ultimately detract from the importance and novelty of this study."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"and life is too short.

Zane has outdone herself."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"There was no departure from me and this book. Zane did it once again. Without a doubt, this was one of her best novels. And, she just continues to get better. I'm anxious to see what the future holds for this talented author and I can't wait. Anything by Zane, Mary Morrison, Brenda Thomas, Brenda Hampton, Eric Jerome Dickey, and Carl Weber are excellent reads."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"What a crazy story? What a cast of characters? What a mother? And that set of friends who are trying to help? What a tremendous amount of emotional baggage we carry around, with the help of various friends and past lovers who just can't seem to get out of our lives.Haven't we all looked at someone, been attracted and for whatever reason did no followup. Anybody that good looking must be attached. Or what can I say that doesn't sound too dumb? Or, I'm just plain afraid.And what an author that can bring this story to paper in one of the funniest, sexiest stories of the year. It's a masterpiece of what can go wrong in the dating game.The ending required the ending commentary. A good novel should tell more than a story. It should leave you with some thoughts. Afterburn certainly does that. There are a lot of cliches that fit but that would be telling.I'm glad to see that there's a sequel coming, these characters are too good to just drop."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I picked this book up on this past saturday (Jan 29), I began reading it. I was caught up in the characters from the very beginning. I hated to put the book down even to cook or take my children where they had to go. This monday morning, I got totally into the book and I completed the whole thing. The writing was excited. The way the characters mixed with each other. You could see yourself in the at least one of them. I dont want to spoil it for anyone, you have to get this book and read it. And Zane, please dont keep us waiting for part 2. If it is anything like the beginning, I will be taking the whole day off from my family to read the whole book. Keep entertaining us...Keep showing us, what we can have, if we only look into our hearts."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"It has been a long time since a book has brought me to tears.

Extremely insightful."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Oh my god, I was starting to worry about zane thought she forgot about much we love her books. But this book was definentily worth the wait! I couldn't put it down. this is a book that makes you laugh & and cry you feel every thing the main characters feel. but don't get it twisted this is Zane's best book yet. if you are a Zane reader like I am i suggest you buy it as soon as u see it. don't wait until another time cause you don't know what your missing,and once you start reading it its a rap.i'll say it again if you love zane books buy it, trust me when i say this book isn't like any other book she has ever written.Now i just have two questions for all those who have read the book already( and i'ma try to say this with out giving away the book) can some one please tell me where a sista can find a yardley brown? cause you sure can't find guys like that in new york! but this question is a little bit deeper and like i said before i'm not tryna give away the book so if u got the answer to my question plz email me @ kia62180@aol.com. does any one know who Solitaire Baker-Reynolds might be? because i think i got an idea who she might be i would like to discuss it if ure intrested. just write me back"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"REVIEWJan 2005I thought NERVOUS was good, but AFTERBURN takes the cake. People who think ZANE is just a flashy commercial writer had better wake up and notice that this girl has an uncanny flair for positive messages and moral wisdom wrapped up in sexy, seductive packages with a lot of heart and very deep thinking.I wish people would stop giving away the ending, because that alone proved that ZANE is moving into a new realm of her art. She is pulling us into a world of introspection and soulfulness to show us that it's love that really counts and that we should savor every moment.Life is to be lived, not wasted.This is a MAJOR COMEBACK for Zane, because she's had a few clunkers in the last two years (NERVOUS being her best book IMO). This book surpasses NERVOUS and it's because of those two titles that I consider ZANE to be just a little bit more than a commercial pop writer. Her work has depth and it breaks the mode on black women's sexuality.I totally recommend this book."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"As usual Zane did not disappoint with her latest novel. Although I was under the impression that this book would be related to both \\"Addicted\\" and \\"Nervous\\", I was not disappointed with this new set of characters. This story just flowed and was such and easy read with some \\"laugh out loud\\" characters thrown in for good measure. Although I am a sucker for a happy ending, I was touched by this books' ending, because although we don't like to deal with it, death is a part of life, so I appauld Zane for deterrring from the norm."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Meet Yardley Brown, a D.C.

In this story of love and life, these two meet after so much time wasted thinking both are to good looking to be single.When Yardley first laid eyes on Rayne, he thinks she is too good to be true and single so only observe from afar. Rayne takes notice of Yardley, but thinks the same of him. Both have dates and relationships from hell, until one unforgivable accident takes place and leads Yardley to just throw caution to the wind and ask Rayne on a date.

So if you have not read it yet, I highly recommend you do. It's not your usual Zane full of \\"steamy sex scenes\\" but it is a story of love, relationships, family and friendship. I won't give the message away, but pick it up if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"My first Zane book was easy to read and I devoured her chapters full of hot sex and adult romance. However, I detested the ending and wished Zane had not tried to mimic non-fiction themes into a really good piece of fiction writing.If I wanted a lesson on relationship behavior or to be preached at, a novel being sold as \\"erotic literary fiction\\" is not where I turn to first.That's also why I purposely do not read Oprah approved fiction because I know these books can't just be about happy people doing happy things. No, someone's gotta be miserable or die but most of all, the reader's emotions have to be pulled at by reading about misery and suffering leaving us in tears. There's always a lesson to be learned, moral or otherwise.I really could have done without the dose of reality seeping into my fatasy erotica. Without it, the book would have gotten five stars. With it, it gets 4."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Afterburn is a sensual love story. The main characters, Rayne Waters and Yardley Brown have both been searching for true love for a long time. Yardley is the only child of two very centered and loving parents. Yardley, however, just can't seem to find a woman who is faithful.Rayne is the only child of a mother who has a serious drinking problem. Despite being raised in a dysfunctional household, Rayne appears to have survived her circumstances, but she too, is unable to connect with that special someone. Until she meets Yardley.In typical Zane style, there are humorous scenes that have you laughing out loud and of course there's steamy sex, but there's a simple yet important message in Afterburn: Life is precious and tomorrow is not promised.Zane has taken her game to the next level."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane has done it yet again!Zane perfectely weaves a tale of love found and lost, while teaching a valuable lesson that \\"tomorrow is promised to no one.\\" In doing so she introduces a cast a memorable characters - Rayne, Yardley, et al and takes us on a ride throughtout their relationship's ups and downs. This book is not so much a \\"erotic\\" tale, but a sensual love story that will leave you wanting more!I can't wait for the follow-up to this book: Solitaire: Afterburn 2. I'm sure it will live up to it's predecessor."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Finally, a Zane novel with a plot. I absolutely loved this book, although I was sad at the end (don't want to ruin this for people who have not read it yet). I was so disappointed in Skyscraper, I vowed to never buy another Zane book again. But, she redeemed herself with Afterburn. It has a plot, real, developed and interesting characters, sex scenes were vivid and real, not raunchy or repeated. I was starting to get bored with the sex in many of Zane's books. They just seemed to be the same scees with different characters. But I just loved Afterburn. I loved Yardley!! (the main male character in this book) Hell, I wanted him for myself. And I thought the part of the book with the brother of Rayne's hairstylist and the scene when Rayne and her mom met Yardley's parents was HILARIOUS!!!!! Nonetheless, I think I got the author's point in this novel. Live each day as if it were your last.....tomorrow is not promised. I think Zane did a great job with this one and I have recommended this book to my book-reading friends. Good job! Can't wait for Afterburn 2."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Damn, This book was so interesting, it was really worth the wait.

But I very well understood the message Zane gave in this book.While reading Afterburn I laughed (because I'm goofy), and I cried (because I'm sensitive.) But I literally boo-wooed cried at the end.

It was a very beautiful story with a rather unexpected ending, but that's life."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Hands down, Afterburn is one of the best love stories I've ever read. The love affair between Rayne and Yardley goes down in my memory as something that stands as one of the few novels that will stay with you for a long time.Although there are a few other authors out there that will write novels equally as riveting or perhaps even better, so far, I have not read that book.I highly recommend Afterburn if you're looking for a true love story that will take your breathe away."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I thought this was a beautiful love story. I am glad the characters weren't stereotypical black people. I am glad Zane used characters who were educated and successful black people. I liked the chemistry between Rayne and Yardley. I did sense that everything was going too perfect in the last few chapters for it all to come out right. I wasn't expecting it to go down exactly as it did, but I was close. So tragic! I really wanted everything to come out perfect, with a glimpse of Yardley and Rayne's life together in the future. I wasn't feeling the last chapter, but I suppose that's life. I guess I will have to read Afterburn 2 to find out what happens next. I appreciate the author's message, and it really makes me want to cherish life, and my loved ones."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This is the first book by Zane I have read.

Thank goodness she has had a steady friendship with a childhood girlfriend Chance that kept her normal. They went to college together.Yardley has problems throughout the book with relationships also. But hangs with his childhood friends still also.The book doensn't bring these two together until they are almost thiry. But by then they are ready for a real relationship."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have to say that this book is EXCELLENT. I read it in 2 Days. Iwas so wrapped of in the Rayne character because she reminded me of myself. Despite the sad ending. I feel that character the most.

I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I was surprised to see that Zane wrote a book with some substance. Not to say that she is a bad author but her books seems to be about sex and only about sex without too much a story line. In the beginning Zane was the bomb and then she fell off. (Sorry to all the die hard Zane fans......)Well, Afterburn is an exception to the rule. I was overwhelmed by the plot and the turn of events at the end of the story. It didn't leave me too thirsty for part 2, so I will say I might read it and I might not. If it happens to pass my hands then I will, if it doesn't then I won't.Later!!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane has did it again!!!!!

ZANE'S #1 FAN"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Great book with a surprise ending!!!Zane took my by surprise with this book. The book takes us through the lives of Rayne Waters and Yardley Brown. The book opens with an important line. \\"Things don't happen when we want them to happen; they happen when they're supposed to happen.\\" Rayne is living a drunken mother and Yardly's friends get him a prostitute for his 16th birthday. Skip ahead years later, and Rayne works at a bank, and Yardly has his own chiropractor practice. He always sees Rayne when he makes his deposits at the bank, and is trying to muster up the courage to speak to her.Some of the names in this book were a little ghetto fabulous. Boomqueesha, Conquesto? Rayne is always dealing with money borrowing drunk mother. Rayne at one point dates Boomqueesha's brother Conquesto. Conquesto is an excon who has no money, and does not wash his hands after using the bathroom. When Rayne goes out on the date she ends up paying for everything.Yardley gets a call from Roxie a girl he had a major crush on in high school, but could not face after having the prostitute for his birthday. Rayne Waters a distant memory with Roxie back in the picture. Yardley tries to date Basil, but the church boy is not trying to have any hankie pankie.Yardley decides to set his sights on Rayne when he catches his best friend Felix having sex with Roxie during a superbowl party at his house. Basil and Rayne end up being platonic friends nothing more. Rayne is not having much luck with the men. She meets Kahlil Henderson and turns out he is on the DL. Just used her to pass himself off as a heterosexual man.Yardley and Rayne finally meet. Rayne does not want to mix business with pleasure, but Yardley is relentless. Roxie keeps trying to get back in Yardlie's life and he has no intention of every being with her again. She can't be trusted, and he is not wanting anything to do with Felix. Felix knows that respect has to be earned again.Rayne's mother shows up unexpected and a 3 day stay turns into a 3 week stay. Rayne is ashamed of her mother. If I had a mother like Rayne's I would be ashamed too. There is a hilarious scene where Rayne's mother shows out during a dinner at Yardley's parents. I know that Rayne wanted the floor to open up and swallow her up. Yardley is the kind of man every woman wants. A Gentleman!!! I just wanted him to appear right before my eyes. There was a love scene so passionate in the book between Rayne and Yardley is brought tears to my eyes. It was amazing!!!!The book was more character driven, then lust driven like Zane's past books. The book reminds you everything won't end in a happy ending. Because life is not always a happy situation. Sometimes you have to deal with grief and sadness. I'm looking forward to the second part of this book. Afterburn was a lot better than Skyscraper."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Zane's novels' and even though this one was a page turning from the begining just as all her other books, I was totally disappointed in the ending. I read her books to take me away from everyday life. I did not expect her book to hit me over the head with a brick, with such a dissapointing ending.I'm sure some readers may have enjoyed the ending to this book but compared to her other novels I was truly upset at how Zane was able to get you so interested in Raynes character, and then knock her off in the end. Again I see the wasted time everyday in life and I did not like thinking I had a good book in hand to read and take me away from the real world only to be given a sermon at the end of the book. Hopefully any furture books of this type will have a warning for her faithful readers who have come to expect a certain kind of novel when picking up one of Zane's books at the bookstore."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I'll admit before i read this book sometimes i would catch myself taking life for granted and do certain things and saying \\"well i have my whole life to do this or that\\", but after reading this incredible book i've learn that death doesn't have an age limit. This book taught me that the lord has his way of showing he's capable of taking anyone despite their gender,size,color and age.

But it has definitely makes me appreciate life and love the people in my life more than ever...and I knew that was the point that Zane was making and she did."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This book was AWESOME. It was juicy and had TONS of drama. Twists and turns kept me turning the pages. The only thing that could have been better was the ending. When I read It, my jaw hit the floor but the book was so good , that the end almost ruined it. The ending would have been great for another one of her books but this one was good as is. It was almost as if, she wrote the entire book, finished it then went back and added the rest. BUT it is worth the read. I read it in two days."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Many of us walk around day after day being consumed by life's little dramas and end up missing out on some of the more important things like love and companionship. Not to mention the folks who are mad about irrational things and those who are consumed by insecurities that prevent them from going after their heart's desires. These people are just wasting time. And that is the theme Zane focuses on in her latest release, AFTERBURN.Rayne and Yardley eye each other at the bank where Rayne works on a daily basis, but it is months of wasted time and outrageous dating shenanigans before they finally hook up with each other. Once they do, though, it is a match made in heaven and they both realize how futile and empty their lives were without each other. Zane also examines the twin forces of friendship and betrayal, commitment and temptation, and faith and doubt through an ensemble cast of friends and family.Zane has provided her readers with an exceptional plot infused with some of the most erotic sex imaginable. This is my first time reading one of her novels, and while few authors live up to the hype surrounding them, Zane actually surpassed my expectations. Her work is thoughtful, hilarious, sexy, and inventive. I look forward to more of the same from her in the future.Reviewed by Kim Anderson Rayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane is by far one of the best writers out here. I love the erotica in her stories but this story was something truly to think about. Zane trys to make us realize that tomorrow is not promised to any of us and we need to live each day as if it is our last and try to love and get the best out of life.Yardley and Rayne were a special couple. Yardley was the PERFECT example of a TRUE man and how a man should treat a woman. I loved the way Yardley treated her and her mother (despite all her mothers issues).I truly hope that there are man out there like Yardley but I haven't come across him yet....a man with a good job, nice car, penthouse, values, can make you wet just by talking to you and just overall loving you to the fullest.All thru this book I was saying \\"man, I wish it was me\\".But I was really surprised in the ending and I can't wait till Afterburn 2!

I highly recommend it, not only is it an excellent read but it's written with purpose."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane has once again done her thang delivering the tastefully sizzling, descriptive, sexy AFTERBURN! First, I would like to commend her on her creative characters, imagination and expressing the importance of friendship. I'm a faithful fan that appreciates that each main character in each book share the common factor of having a strong friend to lean on. Yardley was every woman's fantasy being respectful, handsome and having much skills in the bedroom. Rayne in my opionion one of the more relatable main female characters created thus far. She's beautiful, young, successful and proudly full figured. The two of them went through their share of unsuccessful relationships before finding true love within each other. This book delivers so many impactful messages such as be careful who you trust, true friendship is treasured, know the people you date,true love can be found, timing is everything & LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST. The jaw dropping ending is an unexpected change that has me drooling for the sequel \\"Solitaire: Afterburn 2\\"."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have to say that this newest addition to my Zane library(I have all of them) is the best. I absolutely fell in love with Yardley Brown. All the characters are wonderful and I can only imagine being Rayne growing up with a mother like Arjay a self proclaiming whore!!! Although I was a bit upset with the ending I see why Zane had to take it there to get her message across about not wasting time. We all tend to worry about the what if's instead of focusing on the here and now and what feels right at the time and Yardley and Rayne did just that, wasted time. But they made it through it all until....Now I can't tell u everything!!! All I can say, Afterburn is funny,sexy,and definitely Zane's best work yet!!PS Raoul is even mentioned in this one, and who can forget Raoul!! Looking forward to Solitaire:Afterburn 2!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane has done it again, created a masterpiece. This novel took you through the characters' struggles, growths and realizations. I really luved this book. It totally surprised me at the end. I am looking forward to the follow up to this. I laughed, I cried, I blushed, and really enjoyed the read.I especially enjoyed how Zane shared some of her life experiences at the end. Keep 'em coming Zane."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I absolutely cherished this new addition to my Zane collection. In true Zane form, she weaved together her talent of comedy and her unique flare for the erotic while tranforming her ending into a drama filled yet meaningful reflection of life. I have to say , I didn't expect her to take the turn she did but I came understand.Keep in mind, Zane readers, this book will tug at your heart strings and you my even find yourself laughing out louf, fantasizing and even crying. But, you will come to see that this is on of Zane best works to date."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This is the first book I ever read from Zane and I must say I am not disappointed at all. This is a book to have. It has drama, sex and love all wrap up in one. This book was glued to my hand for entire day. I laugh and I cried (seriously cried)I could not believe it after all the hell these two when throught, it was so sad how is ended. This book give hope to those who believe in love, soulmate and the one. If you dont believe in those, I still suggest you read it, it will change you. Absolutely love this book and will read it again."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"That I wasted my money and time reading such a poorly written book. Cliched characters, situations, relationships and story line. I couldn't like the two main characters because I thought they were underdeveloped therefore lacking the depth for me to want embrace them. I felt no real connection between them. Additionally, I kept waiting for the crescendo, it never came.My first and last Zane book."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Wow. I truly did not expect the ending of this book. I was so mad, and upset, and angry at what happened at the end to cause such devastation to the otherwise love-filled story. However, at the very very end, I started to like the book again because it ended with mystery. When the next one comes out, I'm definitely going to get it.Great book. Just don't get mad at the end, and stop reading it... finish the book! Its well worth the read."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This book was extremely fab-u-lous and i actually cried because it was so emotional.

The story was cohesive, well plotted and fluid. It's in the top 3 of books I've read this year!Congratuations Zane!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane sizzles this time around, giving her readers a softer side of erotica with \`Afterburn'.Rayne Waters and Yardley Brown have no idea what lies on the road ahead. Their story begins on opposite ends of the relationship spectrum. Fifteen-year-old Rayne lives in Birmingham, Alabama, growing up with a brutally honest mother who spares no details when it comes to men, while Yardley, living in White Oak, Maryland, celebrates his sixteenth birthday with a prostitute paid for by his boys, and this is only the beginning.We watch the two of them grow over the span of thirteen years, living in different cities, attending different colleges, all while experiencing the trials and errors of love. It brings heightened suspense to readers when the two of them wind up as professionals working in the Washington, D. C. area. Zane gives us an omniscient view of their lives as being so close, yet so far away. Even while living and working only minutes from one another, they still endure the hit and miss torture of finding someone on the D.C. dating scene.Although the plot is obvious, readers can relate to Rayne and Yardley's story, watching them grow up through their teen years, and as adults, the element of bad timing in their lives builds anticipation.Zane plays matchmaker as the two have a chance encounter setting them up for romance, causing a sigh of relief for readers filled with as much anticipation as Rayne and Yardley. Zane authors a story about the bumps and bruises of love, confirming that if we look around, we may find someone searching for the same thing right under our noses.M. L. Sanders, ReviewerLiterary Essence Views"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"\\"Wasting time\\" was the moral of this story and how we all do it. Yardley deserved true love because he was one of the MANY men out here who get overlooked daily. (yes, he had plenty of material possesions and was still overlooked)Rayne was one the typical black females who felt her family history determined who she was. Us as women do that quite often. When all was said and done it was about love and the time wasted before it was proclaimed. Afterburn meant to me...following all the pain we now have love. Short lived."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This is one more book by Zane I truely enjoyed. I finished this book in a little over a day. I couldn't put it down. I was surprised with the ending, and of course I cried. Zane, you did it again!!! I am ready for the next book!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Whenever I pick up a Zane book, I think awww sookie sookie now, let's see what she's got for me this time!! Once I began to read this story, I noticed right off the bat it wasn't like any of her other ones. I was a little dissappointed but kept reading anyway, and I'm glad I continued to read. It's a very touching story and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. It made me take a look at my life and re-evalute the importance of my loved ones. I hope the story will do the same for you. I'm ready for part II."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane does it again. The book is truly interesting and very well written. A step up from the usual..It wasn't all about sex,sex,sex but the book actually had substance to it.. You will not put this down. I read the book in 7 hours..didn't even stop to take a bathroom break.Just purchase it,,you will be glad you did.Smooches."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane really outdid herself on this book. In writing this book, she has crossed new boundaries and took her readers to places that she's never took them before. This book really shows her talent. If you are a Zane fan in any form...this is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Well before reading \\"Afterburn\\" I was told by a couple of friends that it was a great book but it was SO DIFFERENT from some of Zane's past novels. I only read \\"Addicted\\" but I basically knew Zane's writing style and I couldn't wait to jump into the book. Once I started reading \\"Afterburn\\" I could not put it down. Not only did this book make me laugh out loud but it made me cry out loud as well.Im not going to summarize the story line because its so much depth in the two man characters Yardly and Rayne. Their love story is exciting, funny, and unexpected all at once. Zane wanted to make a point to NOT WASTE TIME and she did with the ending of the book. This book is now one of my favorites and Im sure after you read it'll be one of your favorites too.PS I cant wait for \\"Afterburn 2 Solitaire\\"!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I absolutely loved this book. This is now one of my favorites, if not THE favorite. The story was far from predictable and it had everything; humor, drama, a little saddness and a strong message at the end. I couldn't put it down even if I wanted to. Zane is a genius and I love her works. For all Zane fans, even if you're not, this is definitely a must have. I can't wait for part two."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Lately, I have been the oddball when reviewing some of the books that are SUPPOSED to be so hot. I was not at all impressed with this book. I think this novel was meant to be on a much lighter and serious note. It isn't sex and drama filled as Addicted, Nervous, or the others. I haven't been reading alot of reviews in detail because I don't like to know what is going to happen. Well, I thought Zane's novel should have been more exciting. To be honest, and I hate to say it because I love Zane, I didn't even want to finish it. Zane and Brenda Hampton are my favorite authors, but Afterburn just isn't cutting it!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"i loved the book. i read it years ago but it is one of my most memoriable books by zane. i cried in the end of this book. i'm just hoping that she continues with the second version i would like to see happiness and love found for him. my thing is why are people getting upset after the read these books. this [...] happens everyday in the real world, does it bother those critics then? maybe but the thing is it's easier to criticize the author of the book, but not their own mate who maybe doing some of these same things in these books. it's life get over yourselves and find something better to do. or is it that zane has opened some of your own doors and you feel like her stories are exposing you. deep down everyone has a freaky sexual side to them. some are ashame to admit it and others are all out with theirs. either way i enjoy her books and will continue being a faithful reader"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Rayne Waters is a African American woman who's looking for a man that she can keep because the men that she had relationships with are mostly treating her like she's a play toy.Yardley Brown is a man trying to find true love in everyway possible because he had been through a lot with women because they think they can use him for what he got.I felt that the book Afterburn by Zane is powerful. It made me feel like I was a part of it somehow. It made me really think about how good God is to me for giving me another day to breath to live on his earth and it made me realize that life is too short and if you have a change to make everything right you should go for it because life is too short.I think Zane wrote the book so that you can understand the good and bad about relationships and love everything about the book is very interesting because it relates to stuff that happens in real life. The words he uses in the book is very powerful. The characters are so interesting at playing their parts because because they're real they state facts about everything you go through when you're in love, the ups and downs that we as people go through in life."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Rayne, a perfect size sixteen, has been unlucky in love. Instead of being overly concerned about her weight, she feels that God blessed her \\"with the extra weight and it was meant to be.\\" Her self confidence still can't save her from one dating disaster after another. Rayne doesn't think she'll ever find someone to settle down with.Yardley is looking for more than just meaningless sex. He wants a relationship, but so far real love has eluded him. That is until he steps into his local bank and sees personal banker Rayne with her \\"healthy physique and legs for days.\\" Both find themselves physically attracted to the other but assume each must already be involved with someone else. Circumstances finally bring these two together and a relationship begins. But can the relationship stand the test of time, resurfacing exes, family, and personal baggage?Zane has taken it back to the basics with her latest release. Afterburn focuses more on substance than the jaw dropping sex we've become accustomed to. But no need to be alarmed Zane fans, there is still plenty of her signature erotica. Afterburn offers more than simply an entertaining read. It clearly has a message that is effectively delivered through an unexpected turn of events. Job well done.Reviewed by Toni Macfor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have read almost all of her books. I did not believe that she could top \\"Addicted\\" which is my favorite book by her. I was glad to see more emphasis place on the story line then in her previous novels. The story line and the main characters in the story have a magnetism that will grab you in and won't let go until the last page. Zane has once again done her thing delivering the tastefully sizzling, descriptive, sexy AFTERBURN! Like I said Zane has defiantly put a lot of creativity into her characters and she had also expressed the importance of friendship throughout this book. I'm a faithful fan that appreciates each main character in each book.Yardley was every woman's fantasy being respectful, handsome and having much skill behind close doors. Rayne is beautiful, young, successful and proudly full figured. The two of them went through their share of unsuccessful relationships before finding true love with each other. This book delivers so many impact messages such as: being careful who you trust, true friendship should be treasured, know the people you date, true love can be found no matter how frustrating it may be in your life, timing is everything & of course LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST. The jaw dropping ending is an unexpected change that had made me anxious for the sequel \\"Solitaire: After burn 2\\". The ending is a complete shocker that will leave you with mix emotions of anger, sadness, and amazement. It will leave you wanting more, which Zane is good at doing. The ending story line of this book is a genius marketing technique for her next book. Highly recommended especially for Zane fans!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"After vowing to never read another Zane book, I couldn't resist the urge and bought Afterburn. After reading the first chapter, I knew this was not the typical sex-laced, erotica extreme, Zane book; it was much more. Afterburn is actually a romance novel.Yardley Brown, a chiropractor, has a deep yearning for a woman he's only seen - Rayne Waters, a bank administrator - but never had the pleasure of formally meeting. It seems each time he made up his mind to introduce himself, he was sidetracked. And vice versa for Rayne. In their minds they are anxious to meet, but each just know the other is taken simply because they look to good not to be. Talking about judging a book by its cover...Timing is everything. It seems the relationships Yardley and Rayne have attempted, with others, suddenly end on a sour note. This leaves both of them single and available to date each. The hardest step is always the first step...and the rest is history, with a lot drama in between.Zane put her writing cap on and put out what I consider to be her best book to date. She expertly intertwined her erotica with a love story and pulled it off nicely. Thank you Zane for toning it down."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I must say hats off to you again Zane. Another well written novel. I was taking completely off guard by the ending to be honest I never saw it coming. I cried my eyes out I couldn't believe it but your words at the end explained why it ended like that so it was cool. I would also like to say that i'm truly sorry for all your loses.Back to the book Afterburn this book has given me something special to take on with me in life and thats to live my life the best I could and to stop holding on to the love that the Lord has given me to give to others especailly the ones that i love.Thank you Zane this book wasn't really page turner like Nervous, Addicted or my favorite Shame on it all which I can't wait for part 2 to come out but it was good and had a very well put message in it.GO GET THIS YOU'LL LOVE IT AND LEARN FROM THE STORY WITHIN IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have to admit that I am not the biggest Zane fan, but I think she did an excellent job on AFTERBURN. The only other books I've like by her are ADDICTED and the BREAKING THE CYCLE set of short stories. Is it me or is Zane becoming a little more issue driven? Hmm...I won't rehash the plot, but it is basically a love story involving Rayne Waters and Yardley (forgot his last name), and all the circumstances that occur to help and/or hinder the relatiionship (friends, relatives, past lovers, old deep hidden emotions, trust issues, etc.). This is one of the few times I've seen Zane really get into some deep character development. I wasn't expecting that. Then the ending will either make you mad or make you cry. (I was on the verge of tears myself). Definitely wasn't expecting that. Zane also delivers an exceptional afterword to the novel. Seems like she wrote this story with some type of moral in mind. An erotica novel with a real moral to the story? Imagine that...If you liked ADDICTED, then you will definitely like AFTERBURN!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Sad to say that this was not one of the best books that I have read from Zane. Although I know that there will be a second book, I think this one should have ended a little better than it did. Don't get me wrong I still think that Zane's a great writer but, with all of the back and forth in this title it could have been better. I'll just have to wait for the next book to see if my opinion changes and this thing comes together.R/DJS"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This was my first Zane book and I loved this one. I could not have chosen a better Zane book to be my first. This book is about true love and it teachs a very important life lesson on love and wasting time. Life is too short and don't waste time with things or people who pose to be insignificant. The book gives me hope that true love does exist and to take advantage of it. However, this book did not end the way it should have. It has an unpredictable and unexpected ending. Afterburn made me cry, laugh, and love. I recommend this book to anyone that is contemplating reading it, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Okay - I'm a huge fan of Zane, no doubt, but what were you thinking when you wrote the ending of this book!! I felt cheated! I actually thought - what a waste of energy these two characters went through during this entire book! Frankly, I was so perturbed I didn't even read the last chapter(s). I absolutely quit reading after I realized I was reading the part where her best friend was reading her eulogy. I thought - NOOOOO! She's suppose to wake up from a dream or something! What is this! What happened!! I am so disappointed with the ending. It really broke my heart. I love your work Zane but this one was a low blow! I'm sure other readers will agree! ...but waiting for your next book no less!

Great concept though...."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I loved this book, probably one of my favorite books of all time. It evoked so many emotions out of me, but what really upset me was the end of the novel. I love Zane's work for about 6 years now and I understand that in this novel she was trying to teach a lessons, but there could have been other ways to do that.

I've even read both of the Sex Chronicles; but none of them... with the exception of Addicted... were so much fun for me to read! I mean, the characters, the settings, the emotions that they conveyed were totally up to par. It was really a page turner. I was sort of pissed at the end. Read it and you'll see why. I call first dibs on the sequel!P.S., if you're under sixteen, I don't suggest you read it. It does have some sexual content not suitable for kids.P.S. II, big ups to the lady. She put in madd work on this piece and deserves her props; however, the only question I have for Zane is why? Why Rayne? Why?"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"You'll Love the book but it has a Bad ending though.

Both are scared to love but are willing to see where it brings them. This book is filled with love, laughter, happiness and sadness.

I can't wait for the continuation.."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I loved the book, loved it, till the end, so unexpected turn of events, and it wasnt welcome.. YOU HEAR me? Not welcomed. And so soon in the book for him to find a new love after the death of his true love. I liked rayne wayyyyyy better than yardley, and I cant believe Zane outed her in a single paragraph. Im more than pissed. And even though supposedly 2 years passed between her death and yardley meeting that new woman (whatever her name was) It was actually only a few pages. DIdnt give the readers any time at all to adjust. Im a stubborn type person, so I will not be reading part 2. Loved it up until the end."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I've heard many people say that they're crazy about Zane's books. Yet, I fail to see why. I'm not into black erotica, but since Zane seems so popular I decided to give her a try.Her story was okay. It was a fast-paced narrative that I managed to read in one day. And, I like the fact that she didn't stereotype many of the African-American's in the book. The majority of them are educated and are goal-oriented; that surely was a plus!!!Yet, her characters were boring. She didn't flesh out their personalities enough.Also, she failed to string along just the right active verbs to create any imagery in my mind.She names several streets throughout the Washington, D.C. area which doesn't tell me a thing, since I'm not familiar with D.C.And, there was entirely too much sex for my taste. It seems like every situation, every conversation evolved around sex. Couldn't just one bit of narration, or dialogue not inlcude sex?Many of the characters seemed like sex-crazed animals, and not human beings..."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"In this story about living every moment to its fullest, Zane once again proves that no one else can do erotic fiction quite as well. Rayne Waters and Yardley Brown are basically skating through life. They're both dating, but haven't found the right person. They're both working, but looking for more meaning in their life. They both have an interest in each other from the moment they notice one another at the bank at which Rayne is employed, but neither of them wants to be the one to make the first move.Zane spends the first half of the novel letting the reader get to know these characters. Giving insight into their lives, motivations, and how they became the people they are today. The second half is the love story which had me rooting for Rayne and Yardley the entire time. My only problem with this book was the ending, and while Zane's commentary at the end of the book explains her reasons for doing what she did, I'm still not okay with it. Afterburn is a hot, romantic love story as only Zane could do it. My only warning is that you should be careful not to hope too much for a happy ending, because you can't always get what you want."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"AfterBurn was an amazing love story written by Zane. It was inspirational and very motivating. I read the book wanting just the erotic stories, but I finished it with so much more. I knew Zane was of God. His prescence was felt. \\"Life waits for no one.\\" The ending was upsetting until I read her ending comments so please read her comments when you finish this book. Her books are not just sexual they are motivating. If you have God inside of you, you can get a positive message out of every and any book you read.

The way that Zane describes the characters in this book makes you feel like you really know them. There is never a dull moment and it makes you want to turn the pages faster to get to the next part.

It started off with a brief background for both the characters and went from there. It would've been nice to get a peak at some of the relationships from their pasts, since it seemed as if they were factors later on in the book. Some parts seemed really drawn out & others seemed rushed, so the flow of the book was a little awkward. I was really upset with the ending and not a fan that there's a possible part 2 out there! The plot was there, the delivery wasn't the greatest & if there were errors, they were minor."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane used an excellent storyline to get her point across in Afterburn. She showed us how the characters spent their coins, some quite foolishly too until they ran out. The ending of the book kept it real too, because those endings can hit us no matter where we are in life and whether or not we still have things to do.

Keep them coming Zane!!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"She has toned it down this time, but i could not put this one down. I fell in love with the characters.

You can't put it down."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Zane's novels, and this is possibly the best of them all. With characters we can all relate to, as well as the usual relationship shenanigans her books are known for, Zane seeks to share a profound lesson: tomorrow is never promised & we all should seize the moment. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Zane adds another level to her writing in \\"Afterburn\\" which follows Yardley Brown and Rayne Waters through a few difficult situations. I won't give away the end but this story will leave you with food for thought. Life is short so live today to the fullest since tomorrow is not promised."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"honestly in my opinion i think this is one of Zane's best piece of work ever. This book brought out so many emotions within me and i honestly never though a book could have that effect on me, but it did. Afterburn makes you realize that most people take life for granted, and stresses the fact that we shouldn't because you never know how much time we have to live on this earth. Great book and a Great message. Its a must read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"For this to be the first time that I read a \\"Zane\\" book, I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was a lot of sex going on in the book, I thought the narrative gave a very inspirational lesson: Live life for today!!!! I am looking forward to see what Zane has in store for Afterburn 2."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I always enjoy getting started in a new Zane book. I know I'm always going to love it and this didn't disappoint. She is such a good writer and has used a good mix of love, drama, sex and humour here. The story lines are never totally deep, but they always get you hooked and you can't put them down. I loved Rayne (hated her mother) and really totally loved Yardley. He seems to be every girls dream and her characters are most of the reason I enjoy her books. This is an easy read - I did it in under 2 days. You'll enjoy it if you have loved her other books, and don't blush easy. Go get this now."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This one was not one of Zane's sexiest novels, but it was very good. I think the ending will surprise a lot of people, it surprised me. This one didn't have as much heat in it as some of her other novels which is what she is known for. But if you want a good story that flows, I say get this one, you won't be disappointed. The characters are developed really well, and they keep you interested. If you are looking for the \\"sexual\\" Zane concept, you may not want to get this particular one, her other novels have more heat."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This was the absolute best book Zane has written I thought that Addicted was good, but this really showed that Zane is capable of writing books about something other than soft porn books (Nervous, APF and the Chronicles). I loved the end and then hated it at the same time. I became drawn into the characters wanting to know more about them as I did when I read 'Addicted'. I loved the lesson that she included at the end, something that is almost non-existant in most books that have I read. Overall this book was great great great and if ya have not read it then this a must read."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I was reluctant in purchasing this book as I'm not a big fan of AA erotic fiction. I must admit I was quite wrong this book really showcases Zanes' writing skills. This book was a great a story, it really puts into perspective the meaning of life. I outlook on life is forever changed. KUDOS to you Zane!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best books every by ZANE. While reading this story...I couldn't keep the book down. I took it with me every where. I read it in two days, but coming to the end it literally had me shed a few tears. I felt as if I was the character in this book. Zane you keep writing...because I will definitely keep reading."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I've been hooked since the first novel that I read from ZANE Addicted I guess you can say that I am ADDICTED as well. I've gotten to the point where I'm not even interested in any other author, SHE'S INCREDIBLE. I could relate to her latest book AFTERBURN so much with being a 35 year old single female thinking that there is no true love out there for me. I read this book when I got up in the morning and reading it was the last thing I did at night before falling asleep. As a matter of fact I will be going to pick up her new book this afternoon from the store because just like I said before I just can't get enough, I'M ADDICTED."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"For me, this was a great read. I became so caught up with Rayne and Yardley that I thought I was watching a movie. I love the way Zane set the storyline up giving past experiences and showing how the two picked up so much \\"baggage\\". This was a great display of the versatility of Zane's talent and I was impressed once again. I can't wait to see what she has for us next in the sequel."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Although I love what Zane does with her erotica, in my opinion she's slightly overated. Her erotica has become a little bit banal in my opinion and a lot of her love scenes are cheesy.But I think she's at her best when she writes a story driven book like Afterburn. This may be the first book of hers that I read that is totally believable, and I have read them all. We all can relate to this book in one form or fashion. From relatives we wish we didn't have to friends doing us dirty to having your eye on someone for a long time before a word is ever spoken between the two of you.I think this book shows that Zane has a little bit more range than I have previously thought and is much more talented than I gave her credit for."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have read all of her books. I did not believe that she could top \\"Addicted\\" which was former my favorite book but she has. I was glad to see more emphasis place on the story line than in her previous novels that place more emphasis on the erotism. The story line and the main characters in the story have a magnetism that will grab you in and won't let go until the last page. The ending is a complete shocker that will leave you with mix emotions of anger, sadness, and amazement. It will leave you wanting more. You will definitely leave the book an anxious feeling to buy her next book. The ending story line of this book is genius marketing technique for her next book."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This book was good and definetly had a message about living life to the fullest. However, I don't think that this story was a good example of the message that she wanted to project. I think Zane spent too much time setting the scene in the beginning. This book doesn't really get good until half way through it. The middle is spicy, but the end is over in less than 2 chapters, so it's basically like...slow, good, is that it? The book was pretty predictable except for the last 2 chapters. Yardley's close freind Felix got away with a little too much, and although I think that she wanted Yardely to have a forgiving spirit, I think she created his character a little too passive when it came to Felix.Not all bad...I loved Rayne & Yardley's character and could relate to Rayne's life in this book."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I LOVE it when Zane writes her short erotic stories. I have not been a fan of her novels...until now. Afterburn was hot, great plot, unexpected twists, and characters that I love to hate. I still think she is at her best when writing her short stories, but I will definately look forward to more of her novels."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Yes, I am a kid, a 12-year-old kid. Imaginably, this is my first time reading a novel by Zane. I read a lot, and I didn't have any more library books left, so I picked up my 16 year-old brother's library book. I was immediately engulfed in it, and I am currently reading Addicted by Zane.Afterburn is about Yardley Brown, a successful chiroprater in Washington, D.C. Every week he brings in his deposits and spots the lovely Rayne Waters (Lovely name). Zane looks deep into their pasts and describes their rocky relationship, especially the head-banging sex.This book comes to and unexpected turn and I did indeed cry. Zane has wrote a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I loved the book so much! I could wait to get the cook and when I got it it took me 3 days to read it...I loved the characters Rayne and Yardley!! I was into the book from start to finish. I wasnt too happy on the ending and I am anxious to see how the sequel turns out. This book gives us the important lesson: dont take anything for granted.Live life to the fullest and dont waste time. If you want something go for it and dont waste time wondering...I hope you all enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"The story line is average. Definitely not Zane's best work. The author states at the close of the book that her choosen ending was to show that tomorrow isn't promised to anyone. I however, felt that Zane injected hopelessness in this story. The message I got was if your life starts off diifficult you're going to have an horrible ending and there is no joy in the morning."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"The plot of this book is quite simple. Girl dreams of prince charming, prince charming rescues girl, they fall in love and then - poof!In any other case this book would've been a complete monotonous bore. But Zane strays away from her usual erotic tale and produces this heartrending love story.The point is in this novel Zane sends a very important message out to her readers. Life is best led if lived to the fullest. Everyday we hear sayings like this. But I feel that this novel was one of the best ways in making this message read loud and clear. I can't wait till the sequel!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"GREAT. Zane writes wonderful, colorful, realistic novels. I can't wait for part II. This should be made into a movie showing how black love really is. Zane keep up the good work. I will always be a fan!!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"Yes, Zane has done it again.

I loved the book. It is really great. Let's me see me through another set of eyes. I enjoyed it tremendously."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I have to admit that I am not the biggest Zane fan, but I think she did an excellent job on AFTERBURN. The only other books I've like by her are ADDICTED and the BREAKING THE CYCLE set of short stories. Is it me or is Zane becoming a little more issue driven? Hmm...I won't rehash the plot, but it is basically a love story involving Rayne Waters and Yardley (forgot his last name), and all the circumstances that occur to help and/or hinder the relatiionship (friends, relatives, past lovers, old deep hidden emotions, trust issues, etc.). This is one of the few times I've seen Zane really get into some deep character development. I wasn't expecting that. Then the ending will either make you mad or make you cry. (I was on the verge of tears myself). Definitely wasn't expecting that. Zane also delivers an exceptional afterword to the novel. Seems like she wrote this story with some type of moral in mind. An erotica novel with a real moral to the story? Imagine that...If you liked ADDICTED, then you will definitely like AFTERBURN!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"This book is SOO timely; not necessarily because of the boy meet girl theme, but because in this book, someone dies and it sobers you; Just this year alone for me, I have known seven people to die. Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"For real Zane has out did herself.

I could identify with the characters, like I'd actually grown up with them and then you go give that ending??????????

Zane can you release Afterburn 2 already... I'm itching to see what YB does next!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I think this was an excellent book. All the the steaminess you would expect in a Zane novel but also a very good lesson that tomorrow is not promised. Although i wasn't too thrilled about the end of the novel, i was glad that there was an opening left for a sequel which means another Zane book for me to fall into!! One Love"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I really liked Afterburn alot. It was different than most of Zane's books which I thought was good. My bookclub read this book last month and 8 out of 11 members were disappointed with it but I think it was really good and touching. It made me very emotional although the ending was unbelievable to me. Zane fans will really enjoy this one and I can't wait for her next book to be published."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Afterburn. Zane did an great job letting you get both sides of the story.I'm sure there are couples out there like Rayne and Yardley. I think Zane did a wonderful job with all the other relationships that were in this novel as well. I really respected how Zane portrayed the mothers of both Rayne and Yardley. I also know that most women have at least one true friend that they can go to without being judged or talked about behind their back and I loved how Zane put that into this Novel. I am a little weary about how perfect Yardley was in this novel because I could see his feminine side showing sometimes. Yardley was almost too perfect. While reading I actually felt like I was Rayne. The ending was a little shocking but it made sense to me at the same time. This is one of those novels that you can't put down. I read it in 2 days. Way to Go Zane! I look forward to the sequel. I hope it comes out soon because I like to read them back to back. Happy Reading everyone-KMARSHALL"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I loved this book!

I read it a week ago and I'm still thinking about the book. If you wanna read a real down-to-earth true love story - This is the way to go. This book made me laugh, cry and made me put alot of my love life in perspective (It got that deep!)Anyways, the summary of the plot is already stated and is true to the book - I cant say i'm lookin forward to the 2nd book cuz i cant and dont wanna see yardley with anyone else!!"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"As an avid book reader, I am a HUGE FAN of Zane. I don't care for short stories, by anyone, but I have read most of her novels. After reading this one, I was a little disappointed.I WAS NOT A BAD BOOK!!!...It was simply Ok!!!NO SPOILER ALERT! This review will not ruin for those who haven't read it yet!!!Zane is one of my favorite authors, thus far. I am thinking that because I have such high expectations for her, this was a little harder to swallow-being an average book. Zane ranks among the best authors, for me. I'm sure readers will enjoy the book-in totality, but the ending to this book, compared to her other novels, left much to be desired. There was something OFF about this book.Additionally, although she was able to connect me to the characters and the story(a sign of a good author), it WAS NOT classic \\"Zane\\" material. The books didn't force me into the existence of relishing a good story line AND stimulating and creative sex scenes. It was just another book!! I'm not quite sure what she was going for, but I lost her (Zane) in this novel.Finally, I am not sure why the book was titled, \\"Afterburn\\". I didn't see the connection between the story-line and the title. Go Figure!!RECOMMENDATION: Get the book and read it because it has a good/decent story-line. It stresses the importance of why one should live life to the fullest. However, if you have read other books by Zane, then please prepared yourself-This Is Not Her Signature Work!! This is not a steamy, good, exciting and page-turning novel. It's just a good book.**NOTE** Do not get this book if you are majorly sad or depressed about something, especially if you are hopeless about finding true love. This book will sink you in the hole!!Zane, you are still my girl! I will get the sequel, \\"Solitaire\\", because I love what you do, and I pray there will be redemption in that book!3 1/2 Stars From Me!!Blessed \\"Serious\\" Book Critic"},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"I LOVEEEEEEEEEE this book!!!!!!!!!

Anybody can write like this."},{"Title":"Zane's Afterburn: A Novel","review":"It's not a bad book but you don't really get what's going on until the end of the book. I think there's a lot of empty spaces in Rayne's life. The book jumps from the time she lost her virginity at 17/18 to her life as an adult around age 27/28. That's a ten year gap and we all know in ten years a lot can happen. Rayne don't trust relationships, not even with her best friend since 3rd grade, but the author never explores why she doesn't. The reader doesn't have a good understanding of Rayne's life with her mom its assumed. In a nutshell, it's one of those books that don't hold your interest so you put it down often and when you pick it back up you have no idea what's going on so you have to read back a page. Of course you finish the book just because......

Whilst the FATWA is now infamous for its severe impact on Slaman Rushdie, the world knows little of how much these \\"religious\\" edicts govern the humdrum lives of ordinary Muslims.Shourie discusses at length some quite hilarious and often crass cases that the Muslim clergy give direction on. For instance, (a) a mouse falls in water, is the water OK to drink? or can it be used to wash? What if it was a fly in butter? (b) a she goat has been abused by a man, is the meat of this goat Halal (like Kosher)? (c) under what circumstances can a man remarry a woman after he has divorced her? (d) if a man says \\"Talaaq, Talaaq, Talaaq\\" three times to his wife, is this form of divorce irrevocable? etc. Shourie also goes on to expose the narrow, sectarian, male dominated ideologies that drive these law makers.This is the height of Philosophical discourse to which the intellectuals of Islam rise. The book is excellently researched in that it makes copious use of original references from the Islamic catalogue of \\"religious literature\\". Admittedly, the focus is on the Islamic ideology of the various schools of thought (surely a misnomer) of the Indian Subcontinent, but then no one in the rest of the Islamic world has come forward to say that this literature is not representative. Even more serious is the vitriol and venom that the various Islamic groups pour on each other. This is only exceeded by their utter contempt for the \\"unbelievers\\". This is an excellent book - it is a MUST READ, especially in conjuntion with Ibn Waraaq's \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\".Readers should look forward to the the \\"progressive\\" followers of Indian Social Science and History - like Romila Thappar, Irfan Habib, Bipan Chandra, to name a few, to step forward and decry this book as \\"the rantings of a Hindu fascist\\" The fact is that these people do not have a leg to stand on. More pertinently, the \\"intellectuals\\" of the \\"true faith\\" are silent on the matter too; surely that speaks volumes for the integrity and accuracy of Shourie's research.Well done Arun Shourie. Keep up the great work."},{"Title":"World of Fatwas: Shariah in Action","review":"This book is a MUST READ people!I loved it!At first I was a skeptic, so I looked up the verses and his claims, and sure enough, this book is right on the money. Ver accurate and an eye opener."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I first read this book, at my friend's insistence, in 1995 while away on a vacation weekend. For the whole weekend I walked around with it under my nose- simply unwilling to put it down. It was the first paperback romance that I had read and I was, quite frankly, not expecting to find any substance to it - feeling superior as I did, to the kinds of people, who I imagined must read this frothy frivolous type of \\"literature\\".( I'm sure other romance readers are familiar with this condescension from those who would never be caught reading a book of this genre.) To my chagrin, I found the book completely fascinating, and for quite some time afterwards, my thoughts returned to the lead characters, and to the images formed from the many intricately detailed descriptions depicting that terrible time in European history. And so, five years later, on the reissue of Surrender to A Strange, I find myself highly recommending this book. In fact, I give it the highest recommendation. This recommendation does not, however, come without warnings:First of all, be prepared to be disturbed. The macabre evil images of shocking cruelty; of horrific degradation suffered by so many, at the hands of the confused masses gone mad - these images of the most base despicable actions of mankind .may not put you in a light-hearted mood. Are you ready for this darkness?Secondly, be prepared to not immediately like the young heroine. While she, Jacqueline, is admirably strong-willed, brave and dignified from page 1, she is also unattractively haughty and her self-assured belief that she is a superior creature endowed with noble virtues because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing is sure to irritate many readers. But for me, this allowed a most interesting development of character to take place and so added further richness to this moving story. By the latter half of the story, we find the heroine's thinking about \\"the filthy common peasant\\" and the vulgar profit-driven bourgeoisie profoundly altered. Jacqueline's testy and passionate relationship with the magnificent wiser and older hero, plus her encounters with a common street urchin bring her a new understanding of what makes people decent, worthy and honorable. And in learning this lesson Jacqueline's true and glorious colours are ultimately revealed. Brilliantly done.It is also possible, that some readers will not approve of Jacqueline's desperate need to avenge the wrongful deaths of her father and brother - because it means abandoning perhaps forever, her two young sisters. This obsessive need for revenge seems unconscionable to us, as most of us have not been raised to believe, as the noble classes of that time were, that vengeance and honor -killings were obligatory actions, duties of the highest order to family, country and king. These days most of us admire those who are strong and compassionate enough to \\"love thy enemy\\", and who fight for causes, not with bloodshed, but perhaps using the passive-resistance style of say, Mahatma Gandhi. Not so then. In my opinion, a good part of what makes this story so worthwhile is Karyn Monk's understanding and portrayal of the very different views of honorable behavior that existed in society at the close of feudalism in Europe.A final warning to the reader who may take this book to a public place to read, - beware the first love scene! Here are images so tantalizingly exquisitely erotic, that you would be well advised to read them in a setting where any sighs or heightened color in your cheeks are not noticed by passers-by! It is testimony to Karyn Monk's superb finesse as a descriptive writer that she can create such a moving vicarious experience for her readers' pleasure. I imagine that the obligatory love scenes required by this genre of story, could be easily turned farcical by the wrong choice of words (think of the stereotype of the sex scenes in such books- all heaving bosom and rising manhood - often ridiculous). Ms. Monk's portrayal, on the other hand, is pure poetry. Enough said, I recommend this book to anyone who wants a challenging worthwhile story to read. See for yourself. I predict it will leave a lasting impression."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"When a (romance) book comes on the market written about the French Revolution, it usually written from the perspective of England and their struggle against Napoleon, or some sort of spy thriller, again written from the perspective of England or the victors. Once in a while we will stumble upon a book set in New Orleans about a displaced French aristocrat, but very rarely are we introduced to the French view of their Revolution or to the period of time known as The Reign of Terror. Granted, this is not a very romantic setting, with all the death and what we think today of as nazi-like paranoia against your fellow \\"citizen\\". Thousands upon thousands of people were killed in the name of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Karyn Monk takes this time period and weaves a wonderful tale of two lost souls. It is not easy to balance the darkness of the time period and the classical happily-ever-after ending of a romance, but Ms. Monk succeeds.Jacqueline is a spoiled elitist, who nevertheless learns and grows throughout the story. I always find character development to be key in any good book, and Jacqueline definitely develops. One might not agree with her thoughts and views, but is given the opportunity to see why she thinks like she does and how she rises above her beliefs to truly be \\"noble\\". Armand, our \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is motivated by his own demons (as most of our romantic heroes are), but this doesn't detract from his character. He is a master at disguise and uses his various \\"counterrevolutionary\\" contacts (which are convenient though never truly explained) to help him rescue the unfortunate victims.The secondary characters, Jacqueline's sisters, Philippe, Nicolas, and various others, add even more depth and interest to the book. I have but a few criticisms. First, the amount of times, and with seeming ease our hero and heroine escape prisons and France. If it were so \\"easy\\" more people would have done it. Ms. Monk gives a great description of a prison wardens thoughts and worries with overcrowding and rushed paperwork. This is terrific insight on how tired and over-worked the bearocrats were, but doesn't allow for such ease of escape for two such wanted people. I also didn't like how characters seemed to appear and then we hear nothing about them. What happens to Jacqueline's ex-fianc&eacute;, to Justin and others we meet along the way? This is a great book so don't miss reading it!"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This has to be one of the most fascinating stories I have read. It had me engrossed from the first page.Surrender To A Stranger takes place during the French Revolution. The heroine, Jacqueline, is convicted as a traitor to the new Republic of France and sentenced to death at the guillotine. She is rescued the night before her execution by the hero, Armand ,and whisked away to England.I liked how Monk uses vivid description of France during this bloody reign of terror. The history was accurately portrayed, but be warned that it is somewhat disturbing. The bloodthirsty visciousness of the french population can be quite difficult to read at times. In other words, this is not a lighthearted read.Also, the heroine does not begin the story as a very likable person. She is sheltered, spoiled and very classist. However, she does change as the story moves forward. As they say, live and learn and I believe that Monk did a terrific job of developing the heroine's character.The romance is everything one could want in a story. Romantic conflict, sharing, passion and adventure. I also liked how they are not portrayed as these perfect people. They both have some issues they have to deal with which they help each other through.All in all, this is a beautifly written story that I am glad to have read."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Jacqueline is a spoiled French aristocrat languishing in the Conciergerie prison when she is rescued by the \\"Black Prince\\" and taken to England against her will. Yes, I said \\"against her will\\" because, oddly enough, she wants revenge against the man who destroyed her family more than she wants to be reunited with the little sisters who need her in England.Imagine the \\"Black Prince,\\" a half-English, half-French, Scarlet Pimpernel-type, who goes to a great deal of trouble disguising himself and thinking up elaborate rescue schemes that could easily land him a date with Madame la Guillotine, finding his efforts actually REJECTED by a young woman only hours away from execution!Frankly, in his shoes, I would have left her there and saved my efforts for a more grateful recipient.Even after her reunion with her sisters proves to her how much they have suffered and how much they need her in their lives, Jacqueline is scheming to return to France to kill Nicolas, the man who caused the deaths of her father and brother and the loss of her home and wealth. Armand, the \\"Black Prince\\" himself, refuses categorically to take her, and rightfully so.But then she comes up with the idea of getting him to take her to France on the pretext of rescuing her fianc&eacute;. It's not that she loves the guy or anything, although she doesn't like to think of him in prison; what she really wants is to have a go at killing her nemesis, Nicolas.This is a very long book and rather than go into all of the details, let me say that both Armand and Jacqueline, portrayed as being clever and brave enough to outwit the French revolutionaries over and over again, repeatedly fall into obvious traps and repeatedly have to find innovative and frankly incredible ways to escape the bloodthirsty mobs. They both seem to be inflicted with a death wish. Armand's motives can be explained by his guilt feelings following a terrible family tragedy. But Jacqueline's don't ring true.For one thing, why does she blame all of her problems on Nicolas? He's a villain, to be sure, but doesn't she realize that losing her family and her wealth was inevitable? Aristocrats were being imprisoned and executed and their estates and wealth confiscated without any plausible reason. Nicolas's betrayal may have expedited the process, but the outcome would have been the same even without his participation.Has Armand truly been cured of his self-destructive behavior? Will he be a faithful husband to Jacqueline when he wasn't with his first wife? I'm not convinced of that.It bothers me that the hero and heroine supposedly speak to each other in French when there isn't even a smattering of French anywhere, other than names of people and places. (But that's the natural prejudice of a French teacher.)It bothers me that the hero asks for the heroine's virginity as payment for his rescue services. . . and gets it.It bothers me that the hero is looked down on as a commoner by Jacqueline when his mother was the daughter of a French marquis.It bothers me that the character of the \\"Black Prince\\" is so similar to the Scarlet Pimpernel, from his elaborate disguises to the ship and valiant crew to the incident where the villain's guards are replaced by the hero's men dressed in their uniforms.But what bothers me most of all is it suddenly started me wondering if the Scarlet Pimpernel truly lived happily ever after with Jane Seymour or whether he continued his daring rescue operations in spite of their happy marriage. Oh rats!"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"SURRENDER TO A STRANGER is a enthralling story of passion, love, and intrigue. Karyn Monk weaves a rich, vivid tapestry of the Reign of Terror, seamlessly combining historical detail with intense drama, adventure, and breathtaking romance. Jacqueline and Armand are compelling characters, richly drawn and developed, who must grow and change and come to terms with the past in order to embrace their future. Jacqueline's transformation from a spoilt, arrogant aristocrat to a woman of compassion is extremely well done. Readers might not like her at first, but they will fully understand her actions and how she rises above the lessons and training of her childhood to become a truly noble woman. Armand's change from a reckless care-for-nobody to a man who hopes for a future is less drastic but equally complex. The secondary characters add depth and texture to the tale. Karyn Monk's SURRENDER TO A STRANGER is a fast-paced, fascinating, and riveting story of two lost souls and the healing power of love."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Surrender to a Stranger is a good romance novel that captures the era of the French Revolution. Although the beginning is strong and the characters interesting, the plot development wears thin once Jacqueline discovers what has happened to the &quot;Black Prince&quot;(those who have read this novel know what I mean...hint: it's towards the end.)As a fan of her work, it's sad to see this labeled as one of her &quot;new&quot; works because she has truly developed as a writer since its original publication---it's evident in comparing this to her more recent published novels.There is no doubt in my mind that Karyn Monk is a good writer, however Surrender to a Stranger lacks the excitement and drama of her other novels: The Witch and Warrior, Once a Warrior. If this is your introduction to Ms. Monk's work, try her other novels to see if you'll like her style and characters."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This book was great. While it certainly was different from the other Karyn Monk novels I have read, I thoroughly enjoyed the historic detail and suspense that the book offered. I have read this book twice already, and, while I generally like books that are more light hearted than this, I enjoyed the strength, passion and commitment of the characters, as well as the rich detail of the french revolutionary setting. I have suggested this book to several of my friends who tell me they are enjoying it."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This book is a wonderful read, filled with fascinating historical detail, action-packed adventure, and a very moving love story. Karyn Monk has created an unforgettable hero and heroine who are both strong and determined, yet flawed by their backgrounds and the opposing beliefs of their times. I really liked how they both had to grow and change before they came together at the end of the book. &quot;Surrender To A Stranger&quot; should not be compared to Ms. Monk's &quot;Warrior&quot; books, which are lighter and more comic. This is a beautifully written, richly detailed historical novel, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a more serious, passionate love story."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This was my first Karyn Monk book, after reading all the others it is my favorite. Written well and such a great storyline."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Surrender to a Stranger.Karyn Monk weaves a richly patterned, vividly hued tapestry.Scene after scene, historical detail is combined effortlessly with the intense drama of adventure and breathtaking romance.I particularly liked the character development of the heroine who changes from a spoilt, lofty individual to one who feels compassion and admiration for others regardless of their station in life.For one who seeks out historical epics, I found Karyn Monk's story a quick and easy alternative. I look forword to the next escape!"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Next to The Rebel and THe Redcoat Surrender to a Stranger is the best book ever written by Karyn Monk. I was practically pulling out my hair it was so suspenseful. I also appreciate how the author paints a clear picture of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. The characters Jacqueline,Armand,and Philippe truly touched my heart. I dare anyone to have a negative opinion about this book."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This book is by far the best book I've read by this author (I've read all but one which is out of print). Set in the chaos of the French revolution, the hero continuously risks his life to save members of the french aristocracy who are imprisoned and awaiting death. Eventually he rescues Jacqueline whose love allows him to deal with his past tragedy. The author does a great job of painting a literary picture of France's era of strife."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Very well written novel. I enjoyed the book a great deal. The writer's use of language lets you visualize both the characters and the events around them. It was a little predictable, but a good read nevertheless. I have read far worse. This will be an author I follow. She can only get better!"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I read alot of romances.. and at 5.99 and up.. Im starting to have to get more picky.. I had put Karyn Monk on my list of authors to follow.. but like the previous reviewers found this book to be very disappointing. In fact, not worth the money. The heroine has very little to recommend her, the plot just plain boring..and you do question why the hero is interested! Lets hope this work was just the result of a couple of bad months, and her other works are more typical.."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I have read all of the other review and they have really captured this book well. I had to add my 2 cents only because this is perhaps the best book I have ever read. (Well, tied for best anyway). The writing is superb. The story line is compelling and twists and turns. The characters are tormented, selfish and then courageous and self sacrificing. The emotions run the gamut. I do find some of the French Rev. graphics disturbing but those were in fact true. It is unbelievable that such atrocities occurred in our wonderful world at any time of our history. The characters were fully developed and I loved the addition of Phillipe to the story. If you read one book this month, let it be this one. It's remarkable. Great job KM.( &quot;The rebel and the redcoat&quot; is an amer rev story by this author which was also excellent. &quot;The Prisoner&quot; was also enjoyable.)"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I count it fortunate that I read Karyn Monk's later books (Once A Warrior and The Witch &amp; the Warrior)before I read Surrender to a Stranger. If I hadn't I would never have read any of her other books. This story was so lame. First I couldn't stand the &quot;heroine&quot;. She was selfish and stupid. She is bent on revenge even if it means leaving her only two younger sisters alone. Then when she thinks she has her revenge she doesn't even make sure it is complete. The hero falls in love with her and I can't figure out why. He is like the Scarlet Pimpernel in saving people from the guillotine. His only shortcoming seems to be falling in love with selfish and absurdly stupid women. I read this with hope it would get better but it never does. I think I am being overly generous in giving it two stars. But if hadn't had some interest I wouldn't have been able to read it through. If only to see what really stupid thing she would do next."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of assuming this was a new work by Karyn Monk - only the cover is new. It took less than one chapter for me to realize I was once again reading a book which was about ten years old. A book I never bothered to finish because it was quite boring. Karyn Monk has the ability to become a superstar in the romance world but only if her publishers refrain from insulting her readers intelligence by reprinting her earlier work and labelling it as &quot;new&quot;. Save your money &amp; valuable reading time. If you are a new Karyn Monk reader try Once a Warrior or The Witch &amp; The Warrior. If you liked either of those books pass on this one and wait for a truly new Karyn Monk book."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"What a passionate and exciting historical novel this is! I was completely engrossed by the dangerous escapades of Armand and Jacqueline. In the backdrop of the bloody French Revolution, Armand St. James wittingly and willingly rescues and transports innocent aristocrats from the guillotine in Paris. He puts his own life in danger countless times while trying to give life to those who are about to be executed. And one of the victims he rescues is Jacqueline Doucette, a spoiled but resilient daughter of the former duc de Lambert. Armand is instantly captivated by the courageous and spirited beauty who was about to be sentenced to death. Her only crime being that she tried to protect her family from the revolution and having aristo blood. Although the magical attraction and passion draws them to each other, forces beyond their control keep separating the two. Jacqueline's undying vow to seek revenge and Armand's tragic past that haunts him each day.Ok, you'll have to read the book to find what happens and let me tell you all 485 pages are totally worth it. I wanted more. This fast paced book kept me up late at night and had me gripping the book throughout. Ms. Monk developed a wonderful heroine and a devastatingly sexy hero that merges from ashes of the revolution to be triumphant. With intricate plots that jump back and forth from France to England. And of course, I learned more about the French Revolution, from an aristocrat's perspective.I did have a few questions after reading the book, however. Like, what ever happened to Marquis de Biret? Did Seraphine ever speak again? Did Antoine really die?Overall, I enjoyed this book immensely and can't wait to read rest of her books."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Karyn Monk. I have read all of her books. If I had started with this one though, I would never have read her other books. Her heroine is a selfish, stupid person who somehow attracts the hero. I found her to be totally unlikeable. I kept reading this book hoping it would get better. (Remember I read all her later books and loved them.) This book never does. The heroine has twin younger sisters that she leaves to go after the murderer of her parents. Not caring that if she dies, she leaves her sisters orphaned. When she finally is able to 'kill' the murderer she doesn't even make sure he's dead! This book disappointed me on so many levels."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I wanted to tell you that I ADORED this book. I think it's my favorite Karyn Monk book (and that's saying a lot!) so far.I loved this book so much I loaned it to a friend and didn't get it back. This may be one of those books I have to keep buying over and over. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"SURRENDER TO A STRANGER is one of the very best historical romances around. It reads like an FX (remember that wonderful movie of a master of disguise?) taking place during the French Revolution. Jacqueline has been taken captive by the French rebels who are summarily sentencing to death anyone who was an aristocrat. She fully expects to be guillotined at daybreak. Instead, an old man shuffles into her cell at night, and helps her escape. Jacqueline learns she has been rescued by the Black Prince, who helps spirit French aristocrats away to England. Their trip to England is fast-paced, full of adventure, and superb plotting as Ms. Monk dresses her characters in disguise after disguise to avoid being caught. The romantic tension bet. Jacqueline and her Black Prince is wonderful. It's the terrific, timeless plot of how two people thrust together in a highly tense situation fall in love.This book first appeared in 1995--hats off to Bantam Books for releasing it again now so it can find new fans!I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Truly a wonderful book, and one of the few romance novels I've ever read that could be called a classic. Worth tracking down even if it is out of print."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"This is what a good novel is- good plot, great characterizations. I read alot and get tired of those trite books that proceed in a typical pattern. This is a great story and I love Karyn Monk! I also love Judith McNaught and Gaelen Foley, who also write with a depth missing in other romance novels"},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I love this book. I do not have time to read a lot of romance novels, but I love history mixed wit romance and that is what this is. I could not put the book down from the moment that I read the opening paragraph.The character, Jaqueline, is such a strong character and I love the developement of her relationship with Armand. They both realize in the end that they have to stop chasing the ghosts of their pasts and in the end they help each other do that.It's truly a riveting tale to say the least, packed with detail of the French Revolution that I love. I'm a great lover of history,and the blend of it with the romance was great."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I have read all of Karyn Monk's books except the latest and I love her writing. This book is no exception. I loved Armand with his many talents and intelligence. Was thrilled when she let Jacqueline grow and mature away from her snobbish upbringing. I bought this book not only because I enjoy her writing but I had to have it, as a keeper, for the cover as well. I wish more publishers would acknowledge the models or at least acknowledge the illustrator. Frank Accornero is one of the best along with Jon Paul and I love their work as much as the books. Now I hope a sequel is in the future as I would love to know what happens to Phillipe, Seraphine especially and Suzanne too."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book, I found it thrilling and suspenseful. I couldn't put it down. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. Karyn Monk is a truly gifted author and I am really looking forward to seeing her become a superstar. I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Surrender to a Stranger","review":"Having read Ms. Monks other books I was very disappointed with this one. Try as I might I could not like the heroine. She was not only spoiled but stupid. Throughout the first half of the book she constantly refers to her being from a privilaged family as &quot;god's will&quot;. She even goes beyond being naive and believes everything she is told which ultimately puts the hero in danger. If you want a good Karyn Monk book try reading &quot;Once a Warrior&quot;. The characters flow together and you actually feel like your part of the story. My second choice would be &quot;The Witch and the Warrior&quot;. Good supernatural storyline."},{"Title":"The Un Security Council and Human Rights","review":"This book is now only available in hardback. However, it is most certainly worth it. The intricate relations between the UN Security Council and the whole machinery of UN human rights treaty implementation and treaty monitoring are explored, with excellent results. The book is also extremely well documented, well written, and offering the author's views which however do not impose themselves on the objectivity of the subject. It is a book I would recommend to all those interested in the subject, and it is - to my knowledge - the only major successful study on the relations between that specific UN body, namely the Security Council, and the complex UN human rights machinery."},{"Title":"The Un Security Council and Human Rights","review":"Though a good book on the history of the role of Security Council in different countries it lacks the introductry chapter on What Security Council is for and its objects and some theory in reference to its position in the UN."},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"I'd be the first to say that this not the kind of book I would typically pick up to sit down with.

I look forward to the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"This charmingly simple book spoke volumes to me about the dangers of a disorganized life, and brought to mind several practical applications. If I don't hang up my clothes every night, my bedroom is soon an unworkable mess. If I don't take care of my mail (and other paperwork) diligently and often, it soon becomes overwhelming, and I can't find that piece of paper I really need. If I don't spot-clean the kitchen and baths (almost) every day, things get disgusting quite quickly, and germs can grow. And the list could go on. It's so refreshing to see a simple, highly useful truth presented in such an engaging way, and I look forward to the next \\"lesson.\\" Way to go, Gina!"},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"At my age of 61 years young, Gina Greenlee's delicious book has put chopsticks in my silverware drawer.

A true Gem!!!"},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"Who knew that paying attention to inanimate objects could be so powerful? In \\"Paperclips\\", Ms. Greenlee has humorously and quite consciously given us a roadmap to sorting through the habits we all develop when faced with discomfort. Reading it again and again gives the reader a fresh way of envisioning life's way of offering opportunities to grow."},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"Cheaper Than Therapy sparkles with unexpected turns of phrase and delightfully inventive illstrations while it delivers its wise message. I was drawn to the authentic voice of author Gina Greenlee from the very first paragraphs of her candid introduction to the punch of her last sentences in this beautifully crafted book. Anyone can identify both with the problem of procrastination and with the solution. With the help of the creative, animated drawings, learning the lesson of how to deal directly with life's problems is such fun that we wish all learning could arrive in such a captivating package. I can hardly wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"Gina Greenlee wastes no words in making her point. With a sparseness reminiscent of Haiku, CHEAPER THAN THERAPY: HOW TO KEEP LIFE'S PROBLEMS FROM BECOMING BIG ONES takes you deep into familiar territory. That's because what Greenlee calls \\"the lesson of the paper clips\\" is what our mamas and daddies taught us, but we keep forgetting: handle \\"it\\" now so \\"it\\" won't handle you later.Seems way too easy, right? Precisely Greenlee's point as she reminds us that the simple approach is still the best. Requiring no cute outfits, nary a potion, mantra, sermon, nor even a bible verse, CHEAPER THAN THERAPY still reads like the gospel it is: Each of us has the power to untangle life's predicaments and a big hand in preventing them altogether. And doing it once pretty much guarantees we can do it again...and again...and like it!David Schulz's beautifully illustrated graphics lend the perfect touch of whimsy to this trip inside ourselves and cleverly reinforce the book's message. You'll never see a paper clip the same again.CHEAPER THAN THERAPY is as much a gold mine for individuals who prefer self-help as it is for small or large group trainings in work settings committed to building problem-solving (and prevention) skills.Buy a book for yourself, one to loan, and ten to give away. I did...twice."},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"A truly elegant little book!

I might have saved 49 years of procrastination and taking the easier but less satisfying paths through life which, in time, caused a multitude of larger problems that I had not bargained for. But it's never too late to learn. I am very much looking forward to Gina's next book!"},{"Title":"Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones","review":"For procrastinating personalities, Greenlee's book is sheer perfection. It's so appealing and quick to read that it's a great thing to pick up while postponing something else. Then, when you read it, it really hits home without being preachy or judgemental. It's a real joy. Great for team leaders or company management to give to staff and great for staff to give to team leaders and management. It works for the old and the young. It's a classic.

In her first effort as an author, she tells the story of 3 friends, Martha, Flower, and Sarah. Martha is the product of a dysfunctional family. Her father was the village Vicar (Minister) and revenge against him has been her motive for living. Flower is the duaghter of hippie parents and yearns to be a successful stand up comic, and Sarah has a successful career. Billy is Sarah's boyfriend, who has anger-management problems and needs to be \\"sorted\\" according to Martha and Flower.We follow Martha through her last two months of pregnancy as we wonder, along with her, who fathered her child. We see Flower struggle to hold her own doing her stand-up routine in various London clubs, only to discover that one of the hecklers in her audience is stalking her. We see Sarah and Billy in their relationship issues, and various attempts at interventions by Martha and Flower. As serious as these problems are to each woman, Brand's deliciously wicked observations make them laughable and believable. The vignettes with Martha's mother are hilarious.If you are not familiar with the English way of life, you may find yourself on the internet looking up various terms -- such as \\"council house\\" (public housing). However, if you don't get hung up on those little details, you will find this a fun, easy read."},{"Title":"Local Schools of Thought: A Search for Purpose in Rural Education","review":"This was an easy reading book that provided purpose to our pursuit of educating children.

The techiques are very detailed so you can learn from a book and a partner to practice."},{"Title":"Chinese Grappling: CHIN-NA, Vol.1 (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"Chinese Grappling: T'ien Shan P'ai Chin-Na, The Grappling Art of Self-Defense, Volume 1 by Willy LinThis book is about specialized grappling hold and joint-lock techniques found in many of the asian martial arts. No particular style or school of martial arts has recognized claim as founder of these techniques. But, for now forget the name of the styles and the names given to the techniques by the styles. Examine the techniques and variations of the techniques. Then, take note of the assault scenarios in which they are applied. If you compare the applications and execution of these techniques from one style to another, you should see that they are all basically the same in principle and execution. Some Jujitsu schools or styles teach these techniques early in the course of a beginning student's instruction which is as it should be. Other schools, for whatever reason, choose to withhold instruction of these techniques until a student reaches some intermediate or advanced level of rank and claim that these are advanced techniques. Well, they are not advanced techniques because anyone can learn them.These techniques are valuable for learning self-defense because successful application of these techniques against an assailant forces the assailant to recognize that a continuation of hostile actions will result in a continuation or intensification of pain the assailant will experience by being trapped in the technique and may even result in a serious injury to himself. Intense pain becomes the persuasive medium to cease hostile actions.Therefore, these techniques should be learned by all beginning martial art or self-defense students as a way to perhaps prevent an escalation of violence at the moment an assailant initiates an aggressive act. This book covers the techniques at a beginning level and should not be thought of as providing answers to all situations for all individuals. It is simply a start. The author of this book also wrote a second volume to this subject of Chin-Na. If you read both books and practice most of the techniques to as many scenarios of assault as are covered, you will have some ability to defend yourself in common assault scenarios. But, the person practicing must keep in mind that it is still just a beginning and by no means complete.** Shotokan Karate students who practice the katas empi or wansu can see the real application of the first move in the kata when they perform the so called down block as they drop to one knee on page 114 and 124 of Volume 1 where Willy Lin demonstrates a simpler variation of this technique to deal with an assailant who grabs the neck or chest or lapel. He uses this technique to trap the assailant's arm or throw the assailant to the ground.** On pages 90 and 91 of Volume 1, Willy Lin uses a move found in Karate katas heian or Pinan 5 to free himself from an assailant who grabs both of his wrists.If you find this information useful and you find that you like the book, there are several other instructional books and videos on Chin-Na available on Amazon or thru popular martial art magazines. Also, Willy Lin, as I already mentioned above, has written a second volume on this subject which you can also find on Amazon.Other sources which include coverage on the same subject of holds and joint-locks include the following:Chin-Na: The Grappling Art of Self DefenseISBN: 0897500954Comprehensive Applications of Shaolin Chin Na: The Practical Defense of Chinese Seizing Arts for All Styles (Qin Na : the Practical Defense of Chinese Seizing Arts for All Martial Arts Styles)Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na DVD (1st Edition-YMAA)Dr. Yang, Jwing-MingAnalysis of Shaolin Chin Na, 2nd Edition: Instructors Manual for All Martial StylesChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12Small-Circle Jujitsuby Wally Jay ISBN: 0897501225Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and Armlocksby Wally Jay ASIN: B0001NJ9KIAiki-do Videos by Sam Combes ASIN: B0002KQQ4C ASIN: B0002KQQ4M and ASIN: B0002KQQ4WShorinji kempo;: Philosophy and techniquesby Do Shin So"},{"Title":"Chinese Grappling: CHIN-NA, Vol.1 (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"About 3/4 the book consists of stretches exercises and wrist grab releases.

That processing is a search for structured signals that could be a message from extraterrestrial civilizations and my children have seen the images on my computer screens and have asked questions about it. While I have explained most of the theories about extraterrestrial intelligence, I also went to our community library looking for a book for them to read. This is the one I found.The level of writing is just right for children whose age is in the early double figures and the coverage is surprisingly thorough for 32 pages. Images drawn from many areas are used to reinforce the text, and they are appropriate and effective. My only objection to the material is the section called \\"The UFO Mystery.\\" Not because there is any support for the theory that they are piloted, but because there is no coverage of the serious difficulties interstellar travel presents. One additional paragraph regarding the enormous distances and power requirements of moving from one star to another would have been appropriate.I generally liked this book and my children learned a great deal from it. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn the basics of what the search for extraterrestrial life involves."},{"Title":"Lapin Plays Possum: Trickster Tales From the Louisiana Bayou","review":"Sharon Arms Doucet brings three &quot;trickster tales from the Louisiana bayou&quot; to life in this marvelous collection of Cajun, Creole folklore.

Its not everyday that you can pick up a book and find no profanity in it. This book was written and is set in the 1960's. The Book is centered around the main Charactor Gillian Bellemy, an heiress waiting to become of age to obtain her fortune. Someone is out to kill her and take her fortune. Jim Trevor is there to protect Gillian and find out who is doing this to her. I found this book to be suspenseful and had just the right amount of romance. For an older novel, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"THREE ADVENTURES GALAPAGOS TITICANCA THE BLUE HOLES","review":"For most people any one of the three separate adventures to; The Galapagos Islands, Lake Titicaca or the Blue Holes of Belize and the Bahamas would have been sufficient for a book in it's own right. With Jacques Cousteau, however, this is just another day at the office and once he has made the points he wishes to impart - it's always time to move on.When my own second book \\"Diving Belize\\" was being written I had occasion to write to Jacques Cousteau with a number of questions. His personal reply is now framed and hangs on my study wall. It says much about this great man that he found time for such a personal reply.Very few of those who visit the Galapagos Islands have any understanding of the special factors that exist there - factors that must always be conserved. What Cousteau has to say has not diminished with the passage of time. As far as Lake Titicaca goes, few divers get to visit there anyway and the message from this section of the book is probably the only appraisal of diving this high altitude lake. Of course, Belize and the Bahamas are very popular with scuba divers - but I wonder how many of those visitors know exactly what they are looking at when they first set eyes on those underwater stalactites at depths of over 50m (165 feet).I remember returning from one such dive when one of our group let it be known he was very disappointed with the dive. When it was explained to him that it was impossible for stalactites to form in water and exactly how they had been created - then bent!, and then continued to form, he couldn't wait to get back into the water to take another look. This time he was not disappointed. I have also had the privilege of diving inside Ben's Cave in the Bahamas and the same comment applies.Having been required to re-read this series of books for this (and other) book reviews, I am finding them all the more interesting because of the time which has elapsed since I read them last. In short, these books are timeless and I repeat my view that no scuba diver's bookshelf is complete without a copy of this and those other books in the same series. - but be quick, they will not remain available forever.NM"},{"Title":"Almodovar on Almodovar","review":"Known throughout the world for his unique directorial style and his often absurd characters, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar talks about his films, plots, actors, and other interesting facts that many of his fans knew little about. The book, which is part of series that spotlights many of the world's talented film directors, features Almodovar speaking about many of his films up from &quot;Pepi, Luci, and Bom&quot; to &quot;The Flower of My Secret.&quot;Providing interesting views, facts, and insight on many of his films and actors, there is no one who knows more about Almodovar than the man himself. His discussions are usually very open, especially when discussing several incidents that were high publicized in the European press, mainly his falling out with his most famous actress, Carmen Maura, after the completion of his masterpiece &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.&quot; Their professional divorce left Almodovar without a dependable leading lady (feature lead actresses Victoria Abril and Marisa Paredes never could capture Maura's persona) and it marked Maura's somewhat decline in Spanish film (she later went on to do several unsuccessful Spanish films and some television work before moving to France to break into French cinema.).The book which is out of print is one of the best one-to-one interviews I've ever read. Almodovar's contributions to world cinema are so numerous that they can be all listed here, and his work has opened the door for many other Spanish and Latin American film directors such as Carlos Arau and Bruno Bareto in showing the world that foreign language films can be as professional and productive as any big budget film churned out by Hollywood.&quot;Almodovar on Almodovar,&quot; is a must have for any Almodovar fan and film studies student. An excellent book on one of the world's most gifted directors."},{"Title":"Almodovar on Almodovar","review":"Almodovar became the enfant terrible during the '80s for his outrageous actions on and off the film set. Frederic Strauss's collection of interviews helps to dispel many of the myths surrounding the Almodovar mystique. Almodovar burst on to the scene with &quot;Pepi, Luci, Bom,&quot; a film renowned for a woman in it being urinated upon, and Almodovar's films have been doused in controversy ever since. Almodovar points out that he creates characters who live on the fringes of society and rebel against laws and regulations. Yet he does not pick up on the fact that as a homosexual director in the male world of Spanish cinema he works outside of the norms to create his films. Almodovar's comments on film making illuminate the artificial world he creates. Almodovar has refused to acknowledge the remnants of Franco's Spain and builds his narratives without societal contexts. &quot;Law of Desire&quot; takes place in a dizzying world of discos, beaches, and theatres while &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; breaks down the fourth wall by setting some of the action on the set of &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.&quot; No other director has consistently played with film narrative and conventions as Almodovar does and I wonder if we really need to know the backstage gossip. The truth dispels the myths and I am not sure I want to relinquish the myths. Nonetheless, Almodovar's observations and revelations are fascinating, especially in regards to his actors. He comments that he treats Antonio Banderas like a child in order to get a workable performance out of him. He lectures Victoria Abril on how to say simple phrases like &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;Have a good day.&quot; He became so professionally entangled with Carmen Maura on the making of &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; that their occupational divorce made headlines all over Europe. I wonder who this collection of interviews is intended for. As a connoisseur of his films, I relished his delineation of the creative process that goes into the making of his films even when they told many of his secrets. Yet I am in the minority, as many Americans do not even know Almodovar or his films. If they do, it's as a footnote in Antonio Banderas's film bibliography. Potential film directors will salivate over interviews that place a microscope upon the workings of a director. Actors will be fascinated by Almodovar's comments on acting such as when he criticizes Robert DeNiro for showing technique instead of building a character. He prefers the French method of acting where the actor IS the character. He believes that the performances of Antonio Banderas and Carmen Maura in &quot;Law of Desire&quot; are his greatest achievements as a director. Yet, he has been hailed as resurrecting the floundering Spanish film industry with such worldwide hits as &quot;Matador,&quot; &quot;Labyrinth of Passion,&quot; and &quot;HighHeels.&quot; Almodovar has always maintained a love/hate relationship with the Spanish film industry. Almodovar was denied funding for &quot;Matador&quot; due to his critique of the machismo inherent in the world of bullfighting. He linked the violence of bullfighting with the practice of necrophillia infuriating much of the Spanish public although the film was a smashing success. He was again denied funding when the board rejected the homosexual themes that make up &quot;Law of Desire.&quot; AIDS activists accused of failing to deal with the disease because he failed to mention it altogether. Almodovar points out that his movies do not exist in a real place and in his world, AIDS does not exist. As with his collection of stories, &quot;Patti Diphusa and Other Stories,&quot; Almodovar's interviews have a care-free attitude that is infectious. He discusses all of his eleven films including last year's &quot;The Flower of My Secret&quot; which many critics compared favorably to the women's films of the early '40s. This collection of essays is a gentle kiss harking back to such a magical women."},{"Title":"Almodovar on Almodovar","review":"Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Strauss brings us this amazing piece of work from the hand of Pedro Almod&oacute;var, in which he describes the life: the beggining and the actual work, of the spanish director.

I have been fascinated by Almodovar's work when I first watched All About My Mother. I made sure I purchased or watched any of his movies I could and it's amazing to see the his work evolve from playful and kitsch to classy and brilliant. This book provides insight into his crazy little mind and you get the sense of his ideas and feelings towards specific subjects.I haven't purchased any other book, so I can only recommend this one and I think it's good enough. Even if you are not a fan of his films you should get it to understand why/how/where everything comes together for him. Once you start reading you will not want to put it down--he's charismatic, funny, and smart.

I do think some of the craft stuff would be easier and cheaper to buy than make but I think you always have to remember above all it's an idea book. And yes, a lot of Martha's stuff tends to be expensive but you can achieve that look if you buy (I borrow from the library) some of her books and take them with you when you're shopping! Anyone can duplicate some of the most expensive rooms and furniture as long as you put in the time to research and shop around and have a clear picture of what you're looking.

I have to admit that I get depressed after looking at other decorating books - for instance, where rooms have dreamy coordinating wallpaper, border, paint &amp; fabrics. This is a decorating book that doesn't stress me out wishing I had a particular piece of furniture or a million dollars. It's the projects themselves that remind you don't need to have to go and buy expensive things around the world. With a little creativity and some elbow grease, you can pick up items from the local home or fabric warehouse and keep it simple. I'd like to make the folding screen (p. 98) from lightweight boards, hinges and casters. I may cover them with fabric instead of paint. But I'll probably start with the linen pillowcases (p. 130) simply because I've got the materials for it. Notice that all the rooms are quite simple. The living room has a couch, a couple of chairs, some nesting tables. period. The projects are &quot;light bulbs&quot; that go on and make us remark: &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; OR: &quot;that's what I am aiming for.&quot;"},{"Title":"Decorating Details : Projects and Ideas for a More Comfortable, More Beautiful Home","review":"This book is a compilation of projects from the magazine and TV show. The pictures are very nice and the projects could produce some beautiful results. But if you are looking for quick decorating ideas, then this book isn't for you. There are some simple projects here, but many of them are complicated.One pro is the lengthy source information (including prices) which is organized by page number. However many of the &quot;companies&quot; are listed more than once and only the first listing gives the address and phone. Subsequent listings have the words &quot;see above&quot; written after the company name. How inconvenient to thumb through six pages of small print for a phone number! Adding an alphabetical listing of all sources seems like a no-brainer.One more thing while you are thumbing through the source guide - notice that the sofa on page 18 can be had for a mere $8,870.

This book concentrates on the small details: how to display pictures, how to arrange your collections, and so on. The introductory chapter on how to display pictures and photographs is particularly good, giving ideas (complete with beautiful photographs) on how to display pictures and explaining principles such as where to place pictures, how to arrange them, and why certain arrangements of pictures work in certain places and not others.The book emphasizes Martha's trademark, which is finding inexpensive but beautiful pieces at garage sales, refinishing them, and adapting them to new uses. Many of the ideas she presents, such as refinishing an old footstool and turning it into a stereo stand, are practical and attractive."},{"Title":"Decorating Details : Projects and Ideas for a More Comfortable, More Beautiful Home","review":"It would only be fair to say at the outset that this is not so much a review as it is a caution. If you regularly read Martha Stewart, or even watch her, you'll find this book, like her other book &quot;Great Parties&quot;, simply a regurgitation of the things her staff have put together for her magazines or shows over the years. If you, like me, have already spent enormous amounts of money on all her previous magazines, this book will leave you feeling, well, cheated. It would be a lot cheaper for you to go through your old Martha Stewart Living magazines, cut out everything you like, and compile them into one big collection.

The best part of a book was its pictures-the more the better! Pictures tantalized the imagination as we plunged into the stories.In the same way, Jennie Afman Dimkoff's storytelling is absolute artistry. With words she paints biblical stories more vividly than cinema. With strings of thought she weaves connections between that world and ours. As an adult, it's wonderful to rekindle the biblical imagination of my youth all over again. As a seminary student, this one book has enhanced my education--adding living color.As a man, yes a man, \\"Night Whispers\\" is more than a book for women. Though written for a female audience, Jennie Dimkoff's biblical narratives contain both a balance of male and female characters and, more importantly, themes that transcend gender. Additionally, its immediate connections to women helped me to better understand women's spiritual struggles. No man lives in a world without women, making it a valuable-read for any man who wants to grow in faith with the women he loves.Regardless of your gender or experience with the Bible, \\"Night Whispers\\" will luminously enhance your interaction with the Bible, its stories, and, most importantly, its main character: God."},{"Title":"Night Whispers: Bedtime Bible Stories for Women","review":"I am not easily impressed by most books, but Night Whispers is an absolute treat.It's hard to believe this is Jennie's first book because the writing is so accomplished and inviting. The book's concept is equally compelling. Jennie obviously knows and loves God's word and her desire to share her experiences with other women shines right through.I love the way she introduces modern day stories as she leads back to the bible and shares observations that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. The other wonderful thing she does is to give \\"homework\\" in such a gentle yet inviting way we want to read and learn more.Thank you, Jeannie for your lovely book.. From the cover to the layout to everything else this is a must read and reread book for women of all ages."},{"Title":"Night Whispers: Bedtime Bible Stories for Women","review":"I felt as if I was reading an engrossing short story; not study material.

It has some group theory in it but its emphasis is on field theory because its focus is ONLY on Galois theory & its applications, so you'll have to find another book on general abstract algebra. But for Galois theory this text really helped me out with its fairly concrete treatment. Look at this to get a more tangible version of more abstract stuff. Each chapter has a bibiolgraphy at the end of it & each one is a goldmine for interesting stuff about abstract algebra, history, numbers, etc.(...) One could also think of this book as a jumping-off point to all kinds of other stuff it scratches the surface of."},{"Title":"Field Theory and Its Classical Problems (Carus Mathematical Monographs)","review":"First we study the classical construction problems. With ruler and compass we can construct precisely the numbers built up by rational operations and square roots, since our construction tools are \\"limited to degree two\\". For some specific number it could be very easy to prove that it is not constructible. This is the case for the cube root of 2 and the cosine of 20---the constructions equivalent to the classical problems of doubling the cube and trisecting an angle. These proofs are based on first proving that if we were trying to reach these number from the rationals then one more square root could never be the final step, so if they were constructible they must have been among the rationals in the first place, and since they are clearly irrational it follows that they are not constructible. But this approach does not work for proving that it is impossible to construct pi (square the circle). Here a great detour is required, using the \\"upper bound\\" on constructibility that any constructible number is algebraic. The proof that pi is not algebraic doesn't have anything to do with field theory; instead, for example, we are asked to work out a chunk of complex function theory in the exercises (complex exponential function, fundamental theorem of calculus). The next chapter follows a similar pattern: field theory is introduced in all its glory, and we wish to use it to study construbtibility of n-gons. In accordance with the above, \\"constructible\\" is now equivalent to \\"obtainable by field extensions of degree two\\", and this allows us to rule out many n-gons as impossible. But this fancy-pants theory cannot help us prove that the 2^n Fermat prime n-gons are in fact constructible---here we cannot improve on the ingeniously contrived proof of Gauss. So far, then, \\"field theory\\" is a bit of a failure since it had nothing to do with the proofs of our two most interesting theorems---indeed, its pointlessness forces Hadlock to resort to two \\"it is natural to ask...\\" proclamations in two pages (pp. 72-73). But we soon see that field theory is not entirely useless when we study the classical Galois theory of solvability by radicals. This is a standard treatment just as in any Galois theory textbook, but we then go deeper into follow-up questions: unsolvability by radicals of the general quintic of course follows from the unsolvability of its Galois group S_n, but then we set out to find specific polynomial equations that are not solvable by radicals. Some hard work with classical algebra and analysis enables us to prove Hilbert's irreducibility theorem: for any irreducible polynomial in n+1 variables we can pick rational values for n of the variables so that the resulting polynomial in one variable is still irreducible. With this result we can construct a polynomial of degree n whose Galois group has order at least n!, so it must equal S_n, so all roots are interchangeable, so all roots belong to the same factorisation. It follows that there are equations of any degree greater than 4 with no roots expressible in terms of radicals and that there are unconstructible numbers of degree 2^m (not surprising since the general solution of the quartic is based on reduction to a cubic and so involves cube roots)."},{"Title":"Field Theory and Its Classical Problems (Carus Mathematical Monographs)","review":"Hadlock writes in a brisk, thorough style, leaving no stone unturned in what I believe to be an excellent introduction to the subject.

Aside from the yearly chapters, there are also profiles of individual players and an &quot;at a glance&quot; look at the leaders in the major statistical categories for each year as well as the award winners. Surrounding all of this is an incredible array of photographs, in color and black and white.Mehno paints a picture of the National Pastime that is at once compelling and interesting, without overwhelming the reader with boring text.

It is hard to imagine any other author taking one from Hawaii to Poland, to Italy, to the Pacific Ocean, to Singapore, to a dozen other places....and yet make it cohesive and interesting, page to page. I highly recommend that people check out the television miniseries, which is available on video-cassette. Particular standouts for acting in this film are John Gielgud as Dr. Aaron Jastrow and Chaim Topol as Jochanan &quot;Berel&quot; Jastrow. Both added the necessary passion necessary to make the audience empathize with the characters' respective plights. It is so much more rewarding than most things you'll see on television...and you'll learn so much about the most tragic and exciting period in American history. Mr. Wouk himself served as consultant for the making of the miniseries. The producer, Dan Curtis, deserves the title &quot;Hardest Working Man in Film Making.&quot; Mr. Curtis, my hat's off to you!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Aside from telling a highly entertaining story, this book provides an unmatched lesson in the history of World War II. Nearly all English language fiction of World War II and most of the non-fiction consider the war almost exclusively from the point of view of the western front. Wouk's novel is more factual. The war on the western front was much smaller than the conflict between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The consequences of this fact for America's war strategy and post war foreign policy are not widely understood, even today. A completely satisfactory understanding of the United States war strategy can be obtained by reading this book.

It is however well-researched and conveys the feeling of the times. Of all the characters I think my favorite was Victor, who possessed virtues that are to little appreciated, because they do not call attention to themselves. He was dutiful, stoic, and loyal to his family and country, and had a sense of decency and humanity, as well as the humility to let others have the credit. This is something of an irony given his name; he was willing to let others be called the \\"victor\\" so long as the victory was in fact achieved. And maybe that was the author's point. He was not an exciting character, but just as a sword has to be forged before it is wielded, the navy needed thousands of nameless Victors to make it ready and keep it ready in those dark times.Slote was also an attractive character. He is quiet, timid, and shy. But in some ways he was the bravest of them all, despite his unshakable belief in his own cowardice.The Holocaust scenes were as gruesome as one might expect. But what really set them off was the shocking and convincing attempts to show what the Nazis were thinking. Wouk's Nazis think and act like real Nazis, not like comic book ones. The von Roon passages add to that. These are a memoirs, supposedly translated by Victor in which a German general tries to prove that it was all everyone else's fault. Von roon makes a skillful enough argument for his hopelessly evil cause, to be disturbing and at least sounds like how a German general would argue. He is also filled with a curious power-romance, and a contempt for his enemies except for Roosevelt whom he rather oddly pictures as an evil genius. In other words von roon is completely insufferable. But he makes a very convincing Nazi. As convincing as Wouk's other Nazis.The soap opera air, I simply never took to. However what I most appreciated was the atmosphere of World War II. The cover(of both volumes). Interestingly enough was one of the parts I liked most with the family photos on the cover, which gives the right mixture of domesticity and formidability for a warrior family, as well as the curious nostalgic feeling that hangs over World War II. One point that bugged me was wondering who it was that was in the enlisted sailor's uniform as all the naval heroes of the story were officers. An amusing error."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance is one of my favorite books. However, of the more than 30 books I've bought from Kindle, this one has the worse, most egregious typos. The Bold titles contain goodies like \\"World Solocaust\\" and \\"Bahsee Protocols.\\" It is quite distracting, and really detracts from the reading quality of this book. I didn't notice this in Winds of War, by the way, only in this sequel."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance and it's prequel Winds of War are eye openers for anyone who is not really familiar with the second world war. Wouk approaches the story in almost exactly the same way he told the story of Israel in The Hope and The Glory twenty years later - through the eyes and experiences of a family in the midst. I think I would have enjoyed it a little more if the similarities weren't so strong.The story is very readable. For me the main take home was how little can be said about WWII in almost 2000 pages. Wouk gives a sense of many relevant issues, the scope of activities, the political basics, how truly global the war was. He engages you with the Henry family and challenges you, I think, to dig deeper into the war. Wouk opens the door on the Pacific theater, Poland and the Holocaust, Russian and Stalin, American logistic, American perspectives and attitude, FDR, Churchill, the collapse of the British empire, Hitler and the Nazis, lead lease, and Nuremburg to start. He covers none of this in detail (although Hitler does get quite a bit of attention in the second book) but clearly communicates the fact that this LONG story is just part of one family's story. Part of one of millions of stories."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance continues the historical fiction story of an American family caught in the maelstrom of World War II begun in the Winds of War. The United States has now entered World War II. Victor Henry is captaining a cruiser (and still taking part in world politics at a low but crucial level). Warren is now fighting in the Battle of Midway as a fighter pilot. Byron is a submarine officer. Natalie and Aaron are now trapped in Nazi Europe with Natalie and Byron's infant and then young son.The focus of this book shifts from Victor (who still remains the glue that holds the family and the book together) to Natalie, Aaron and Byron. Natalie and Aaron must deal with the horror of being American Jews caught in the Nazi web. Their story is both harrowing and heartbreaking.Over all, of course, the book continues to give a great feel for life during World War II, both for those who love history and for those who know nothing about the war.One word of caution though: As the title to this review suggests, you really must read The Winds of War before this book. You won't be lost if you don't, but you won't understand the characters as much and may not become as attached to them. For instance, it won't be as tragic to see Natalie indecisive with her baby in the face of the Nazis if you did not first see how strong and independent she was in the first book.But go out and buy the Winds of War and read it (if you have not yet). When you are finished, I can guarantee that you'll rush out and buy War and Remembrance and then be sorry that the story is over once you read the last page."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I often look for books that take demand much of the reader and reward him with something that small, less involved books can not do. Herman Wouk's epic &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is that kind of book. As a history major in college I search for historical fiction that can not only describe the Zeitgeist of a time but rather transport me into the overall feeling of the time - the language, mannerisms, imagery and sense of knowledge. Mr. Wouk captured this feeling for people who did not have the experince of living through the greatest world conflict in history. His character development is exceptional, his writing style - while rough in the beginning of the prequel, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; - matures fully and reaches full stride. The result is one cannot imagine another person even attempting to write what Mr. Wouk did as he closes out the saga of the Henry family - it is that well done. His historical themes are accurate and at times, illuminating. One cannot but respect the knowledge and insight that Mr. Wouk brings to his German character, von Roon, in von Roon's fictional military works throughout the work. His portrayal of the Jewish experience is involved and accurate and his treatment of treating war as hell - no good guys or bad guys, just players - is also accurate. By the end, one wishes that the saga of the Henry family would continue much in the same way as John Jakes takes his readers through several centuries with his family, the Kents. Overall, a masterpiece that will become part of the WWII canon of literature and a requirement for any serious reader who looks for something more in a book than an alternative to television."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"As the sequel to Winds of War, this surpasses the considerable depth of that novel. This is one of the most difficult books I've read in years, I had to put it down for days in between reading sessions because it was gut wrenching. I literally sweated. There are parts that are extremely unpleasant, but vital to the story.The scenes depicting the war and the Holocaust are outstanding, why this book did not win an award of some kind is beyond me. The author TAKES you there and shows you, and the images will be with you for a long time.By contrast, the characters seem to be more archetypes than living human beings. Maybe that was intended so that they wouldn't overshadow the story. And wow, is it a story.This should be required reading in college. People need to know how WWII happened and the type of human decisions that shaped it. The characters seems to grow in some ways, or rather, they solidify. Most were perfect for the story, but some were so aggravating that they bear mentioning.Spoiler alertPug remains an android. For cripes sake, you mean to tell me he had no carnal relations with Pam until they were married? Sheesh. Too perfect. He makes the right decision with eerie frequency, maybe he's really from the future and already knows all the answers . . .I halfway expected that to be it. Nope. Just an android. The only emotion he has is drowned in booze on occasion, then he smartens up and reports for duty bright eyed and bushy tailed. Maybe a little haggard, but he shows up. And pulls off another miracle.Rhoda. Ugh. I literally wanted her dead halfway through. Pug stayed married to this bimbo for HOW long?! Android. She gets over Palmer when he stops worshiping her and sees her with contempt, and needs another moth to dance around her aging flame. What gets her hot is the idea that a man, any man wants her. At the end, she gets what she deserves, marriage to another suitor who is already bored with her, and the knowledge she frittered away a good husband and family.Briny/Natalie. They come as a pair. Both their decisions rank equally in terms of idiocy. You will be screaming in frustration as we go into a second huge tome with Natalie seeming determined to paint herself into the corner known as Auschwitz. Briny is Mr. Heroic that will save her no matter what, but fumbles his way around ineffectually. Couldn't they have put her and Aaron on the $#%^@ submarine?! They could have dropped them off anywhere in 1000 miles out of Hitler's way. Or she should have stayed hidden in the mountains of Corsica.Pamela/Shamela the only one more shallow than Rhoda. The 'Whore who couldn't'.She could not get Pug into bed, even though she had wild fun other places and apart from her lame idealistic soul mate speeches to him, she just wants to bag him. She followed him around the globe for that purpose. It's stretching it a bit to think a May/December pairing has raging hormones to that extent- you know, when the old boy can't salute as often? Viagra wasn't invented yet. And they never got in bed even once in almost 2000 pages of story. Not real.Android.Leslie almost grows a, er spine. But he manages to get killed just when he might actually get interesting. I would have loved to see the quandary Natalie would be in if he had been the one to rescue her and the baby. Briny would have had to sweat it out . . .The ending does not give happy, easy answers. People bear deep scars. It is doubtful if Natalie and Briny can really make a life together. It is glaringly obvious at the end they don't even know what to say to each other. Maybe she and Rabinovitz would have made a better couple, both having survived hellish experiences. Briny is still too safe, to much the spoiled American boy who thinks he can fix everything.This is the kind of book that will make you lie awake at night trying not to think about the images in the concentration camps. Mr. Wouk hits very heavy in these sections. The actual fighting was easier to bear than the stream of consciousness method he uses in telling of the final journey of Natalie and Uncle Aaron to Auchwitz.This is a masterpiece that re creates the war and lets the reader inside in spite of a handful of shallow characters. The book soars beyond them, a stage that outshines the actors in chronicling the darkest time in human history."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"It's understandable that free e-books from the 19th century would have a few typos, but this is ridiculous. When you're charging money for an e-book, you have a responsibility to make an effort at accuracy. Some of the chapter headings in W&R were originally printed in Fraktur (heavy Germanic script). The worst one I saw was \\"Zrandator'O aoreworb\\", which was supposed to be \\"Translator's Foreword\\""},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I can only add to the superlatives already written about this novel and it's prequel \\"The Winds of War\\". Quite simply, this is my favourite book ever. EVER. And I've read a lot of books. Not quite averaging the one a day as with some of the esteemed Top Reviewers I've read on this site, but usually two or three a week.Two or three years ago I spent a year in Australia and New Zealand - travelling around and working. If you've ever tried to pack a suitcase for a year you'll know the fun I had in deciding what was essential - but what I had no hesitation in tucking into a precious corner of space was my paperback copy of \\"War And Remembrance\\". This is my desert island book. My Number One \\"comfort read\\" and I wanted it with me for any times of loneliness or homesickness.I'm hugely interested in the whole history of WWII but this is by no means the only reason to read this book. The large cast of characters against this dramatic backdrop is immediately gripping and remains so throughout. Wouk cleverly (sure it's a contrivance but it works superbly) weaves their stories so that all the \\"theatres of war\\" with their real life people and events are included.My paperback copy cost me the equivalent of a dollar in one of those bargain stores that sell cheap make up, ugly clothes and the lower end of popular novels (those one with gold lacy covers. And in amongst these was a &quot;Pocket Book&quot; paperback edition of &quot;War And Remembrance&quot;. It's still a stand-out as one of the best value purchases I have ever made."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"To those of you who have read this book and loved it: read it again. You will uncover subtleties that almost surely escaped you the first time. I know I did. We think of the great loves of this book being Victor/Pam, Byron/Natalie, and perhaps Warren/Janice. There are others buried deeper: Victor/His sons, Warren/Byron.We all know fathers love their sons, and brothers love each other, but this book touches ever so lightly, but effectively on these familial loves. At first reading, the relationship between Pug and Byron seems distant, conflicted, and filled with disappointment, with occasional warmth. On second reading, that is still there, but there is bedrock of love that is so deftly written than it is amazing to uncover it. Think of Pug and Byron visiting the old house in Manila, where Pug apologizes for being rough on Byron when tutoring him as a young boy. Byron's response? \\"I didn't mind, Dad. I understood you. Best grades I ever got.\\" Or Pug watching his sons at Warren's house prior to Midway. It's Byron who leaps up first to get his Dad a beer. Or the line in which Pug realizes he couldn't survive as a functioning man if Byron were lost. SPOILERS: And that's not just because Warren has already been lost. Also, reread Pug's letter to his wife about Warren's death. As a father myself, it is heart rending. How do you put into words the feelings of losing a son. Wouk does it well. \\"There was nothing better than just resting my eyes on him.\\" or \\"We have Byron. We have Madeline. But Warren is gone, and there will never be another Warren.\\"As for Byron and Warren, think of the party prior to Midway with the hula dancer and Warren dancing. The women are looking at Warren, the men salivating at the hula girl, and there is Byron, tears streaming, watching his brother. Do you have an older brother? At some point, he was your hero. For Byron, he still feels that way about Warren, and Warren is deserving of that. In the other direction, there are several light sentences in which Warren acknowledges the superiority of his younger brother, e.g., his recognition that while Janice is a catch, Natalie is even more of one.The relationship between Pug and Pam is very well done. It is not rushed, and you don't get a sense of being a prurient onlooker when they are together. Pam has her faults, to be sure, but you can see her making the older man happy, and not just in the bedroom as might be presented in more current fictions. It's wonderful to follow the starts and stops of this relationship, especially after the initial \\"I love you\\" uttered (at long last) by Pug.Finally, I really enjoyed the writing about each Henry's feelings after a brush with death. Pug's feelings seeing the U.S. flag on embassy row in London (was that in WoW or this one?), Warren's bonhommie with the gun tub crew (\\"You bet your ass . . . sir\\") after his first Midway sortie, or Byron's sense of camaraderie after a depth charging.Is this book perfect? It's pretty close: the history is good, the romance is well done, and there are subtleties that emerge only upon a second (or third!) reading. There have been few other books where I have regretted their ending -- that's saying something when talking about a thousand page book.Reread it, maybe even with a pen to underscore the best parts. I only wish Wouk were alive to write a follow-on to this one. But maybe it is indeed best to leave us wanting more. I cannot see Pug as a bureaucrat in peacetime navy, Byron as an insurance salesman, Rhoda as a twice-divorced alcoholic."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This is the second of two books relating the history of the Henry family as they make their various ways through the Second World War. The main character, Victor \`Pug' Henry, is an American naval captain who is called upon to act in an unofficial capacity for the President, and who therefore sees the war from an extraordinary angle. Such a device creates the potential for marvellous fiction and Wouk does not let us down.Who knows what makes a writer write just such a story, and no other. Who can tell how the balance is achieved in a novel, that keeps us thoroughly in its grip and leaves us so satisfied at the end. Wouk has achieved these ends marvellously, and in my opinion, has done so by taking risks with both the plot and his characters, which, by being successful, raise the work to a very high level of historical fiction indeed.\\"War and Rembrance\\" continues the threads of all the family members, starting off with the events surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbour. The main story in this book is, however, that of the Jewish ghetto of Theresienstadt, to which, as the war advances, three of the book's characters are inexorably drawn. It is a chilling tale and one that deserves to continue being read around the world."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I read some chapter in library every day. Today, i read the chapter of the little girl Miriam going on the train with her teacher, Ms. Rosen behind her. The scene is really heartbroken. In reading this, i hate Nazis to a degree not able to be expressed in words."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"\\"The Winds of War\\" and \\"War and Remembrance\\" are two of my favorite books and other critics have given them good reviews for the hardback and paperback editions. I do have to express my disgust with the quality of the Kindle editions. In \\"The Winds of War\\" there were several typos, one of which was in over sized type that fairly screamed from the page. In \\"War and Remembrance\\" there are so many popping up that it is extremely distracting. One typo can be humorous, two can be a nuisance, but when they crop up nearly every other page, it becomes quite annoying and distracting. I believe the publishers should make the proper corrections and make corrected ones available for a second download. So far this has been my only encounter with typos in Kindle editions.Additional comment: I wrote this review before finishing the book. It only gets worse. In the space of one sentence, there were three typos. I have not received any comment from Amazon on this problem or reassurance that anything is being done to correct the problem. Since the Amazon policy appears to give me no recourse or possibility of refund, I will no longer purchase anything from Amazon and counsel all my friends and colleagues to do the same until I am notified of action taken. There is no excuse to charge me $20.00 for inferior electronic products and not take proper actions to correct the process."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"As I read this novel, I kept thinking that it should just never end-- just be a continuing story about the aftereffects of WW IIand how the Henry family continued in the following years.But ofcourse all good things must end at some time- so read this bookafter the first- Winds of War- and enjoy it and come back to it and read it again.I am definitely reading more of Herman Wouk's novels!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book is most compelling when read immediately after one completes \\"Winds of War\\" so the events, endings, and beginnings are fresh in your mind. It paints with a broad brush the horror and rage surrounding WWII, then draws sharp and revealing details on the personal stories of the people brought to life in \\"Winds\\".Sometimes history is best told as saga. (Think of Homer's Iliad.) It is once removed - it IS fiction - so it is more easily endured emotionally. Underneath the faade, though, you know the truth is there. This saga accurately depicts a panorama of the Pacific front, a crumbling and desperate Japanese Empire, the devastation of Europe as Hitler's terror slithers across the land, and the stirrings of the new movement and life in America in the midst of the chaos.For the merely curious, it tells what happened to the characters AFTER \\"Winds of War\\". The reader becomes a sometimes-uncomfortable voyeur peering - leering - into fictional lives that blur into undeniable reality, forcing a mental review of all those old history lessons (propaganda?).A powerful book by the master of historical fiction."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"As with any battle, it no longer has a hold on you when you look closely at downside. For an individual, a community, a nation or a world, when we look closely at the battle we see the pain that fueled the battle.And the closer we look, the more apt we are to remember that it is not a batte or a war that we want. It's belonging, peace and freedom for our highest self-expression.This story is a wonderful life journey that will free you to appreciate the basics in life."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"From the aftermath of Pearl Harbor to the bombing of Hiroshima, Herman Wouk has written an outstanding novel about an American naval family during WW2. The author brings to the life the horrors of the Jewish holocaust and is meticulous with his battle coverage. His segment on Midway is better than some history books. For anyone who wants to learn about WW2 from the American point of war, this book and its prequel are a good place to start."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Excuisitely written, superb character development, plot and use of foreshadowing. Human story of Jews during World War II and their persecution and mass-murder is extremely touching and educational; especially description of gassings and cremation- allows one to invision the horror that is almost impossible to invision.Excellent novel! I would recommend this book for high school student both as literature and history- with Holocausr &quot;revisionists&quot; (ie people who lie about history and distory truth formtheirm own benefit) on the rise, this is an important work for people to read, along with books of nonfiction, about what really happened during World War II and how the world responded."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Well, I did read both of the serie in only 1 month, and I can honestly say that the Henry clan, with a stone-like father Victor Henry, has settled in my heart, as if they have really taken part on that great world war. I sometimes, think, I'll try to be a man like Victor Henry. By the way, I must congratulate the writer, Mr. Wouk, for creating a fictious character like the Wehrmacht General, Armin von Roon, an aristocrat, who makes you think he really existed and could have sounded great if his views had been well understood bye the German Supreme command."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Herman Wouk writes a thrilling conclusion to this two book series from Iran, to the Concentraction camps The Henry clan battles in WW II and somtimes gives the ultimate sacfice"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"...they're recent history, too.

Mr. Wouk is a modern classic."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"\\"War and Remembrance\\" is a legitimate 5 STAR book if there ever was one! It is, along with The Winds of War, the Gold Standard of historical fiction for World War II.Some folks decided to trash the book based on an apparently highly flawed Kindle version or some badly mangled used books. (Apparently the Kindle issues have since been corrected). However, these were not literary criticisms and the people probably should have sought an alternative method to register their valid complaints. Diluting the thoughtful ratings of the substance of the book to air a production grievance is not fair to the author or to prospective buyers.Readers should seriously consider reading The Winds of War before reading this book for two reasons. One, the first book in the dualology is a prequel and the understanding the story and the characters makes reading the second book that much more enjoyable. The second reason is to be sure you like how Herman Wouk writes and treats history. Most people do but if you're one of those ultra-picky readers, you may find his canvas too broad, his characters too perfect and his treatment of historical figures too narrow. If that's the case, you need not waste your time reading the second book.For me, however, Wouk is a master storyteller and these two books are fantastic. They deal with a period of history that is my passion and I certainly tip my hat to Wouk for his thoughtful and thorough research. For wonderful thought-provoking entertainment and a history lesson all rolled into one, these two books are the best you can get!John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance is a novel written about a very difficult time to understand. It is well written and interesting at the same time. Every time you think everything is going perfectly, the author, Herman Wouk, throws a curveball and the face of the story changes dramatically. At the beginning you become very attached to Warren Henry. But then suddenly his plane is shot down at the battle of Midway, and you lose him. Wouk also did a great job of integrating the war from the viewpoint of Nazi \\"Armin von Roon\\". Although Roon never existed the addition of this side of the war is interesting. The fact that almost all the characters were fictional but the movements of ships in their respective battles shows the author's time and research that he put into the story. Another interesting aspect of the piece is the story of Natalie Henry and her uncle Aaron Jastrow's journey from Italy, to France, to Terezin, and ultimately to Auschwitz. It shows the view of two Jews, trying to escape the Gestapo and their American in-laws doing the best they can to get them out of Europe and home safely. All in all, the book is very good. At times it seemed to drone on and on, but I got through it. I would advise this book for people with a good vocabulary and good reading ability. I enjoyed this book"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book, and it's companion piece \\"Winds of War\\", are in my opinion, the greatest of all Herman Wouk's writing...In War and Rem. one is taken on a powerful journey through time..As you follow the Henry family through the conflagration known as World War Two, you learn to love them, and experience their triumphs and their incredible pain...you relive the most important battles first hand..Stalingrad, Midway, Leyte gulf, and on and on..and you delve into the Europe held in the iron grip of the greatest madman this planet has ever known...what was it like for a Jew trying to get out?..you will learn in the stunning story of Natalie and Aaron Jastrow...I envy you if you enjoy an epic historical story, and a great family novel, because you are about to enter the world of 1941 through the eyes of Herman Wouk...and you will never forget it."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"After reading Winds of war, I had to read the sequel. I did not think that it was quit as good but was a good read."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"The book arrived as described and in great condition. I am very pleased to add this to my bookshelf."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This is the best historical novel I have read on WWII. A majority of the information is historical fact and Herman Wouk does a masterful job of weaving fictional characters into the story.The only negative is the lack of information on Japanese atrocities.Mr. Wouk provides accurate information on the allied firebombings that killed thousands of Japanese but fails to mention the thousands of Americans, Phillipinos, Chinese, British and other allied soldiers and civilians that the Japanese murdered in POW camps and in countries they invaded.The subject of Japanese atrocities is never mentioned in the book, a small shortcoming to an otherwise superb historical novel."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I first read War and Remembrance soon after The Winds of War was telecast on ABC in 1983. At the time it wasn't sure if there would be a miniseries covering the time after Pearl Harbor and I wanted to find out just what happened to the Henry family. I actually started by reading The Winds of War just to get a feel for the style of the author and then immediately proceeded to War and Remembrance. I thoroughly enjoyed both reads and was pleased to see the miniseries of W&R; when it came out in 1988.My reading of the Kindle edition of W&R; this past week wasn't so enjoyable because as others have mentioned the conversion to eBook was not done very well. I have a few very old books from the 40's and 50's that I converted to EPUB and/or MOBI for my own use in an attempt to preserve the originals. I used an inexpensive OCR program and freeware to perform the conversion.I must say the conversions I produced using this very primitive means were similar in quality to that of War and Remembrance which was very surprising to me. The fact that an inexpensive OCR program and freeware produced eText that contained errors similar to W&R; to me indicated that whoever performed the conversion on W&R; wasn't too serious about quality. Quite often a 'm' was converted to 'rn' or an 'll' to '11' which is very understandable and actually doesn't hamper reading very much. However, when whole words are converted incorrectly the reading can get a bit difficult and that happened far too often for a supposedly professional conversion. Definitely a 1 or less star rating for the conversion.As to the actual content of W&R;, I must agree with most 4 and 5 star reviews given to the paperback version. The novel was a well written, extensively researched, and thoroughly enjoyable read. However the quality or lack thereof in the eBook version brings the product rating down to three stars for me.It is really too bad that Amazon hasn't cleaned up the conversion errors as they have had several years to do so."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book along with it's companion, The Winds of War are so full of vivid history. I learned from these books more about WWII including what led up to it than any history class, documentary, or history book could ever provide.On top of all this history is a touching tale about a military family that suffers the highs and lows of personal events (romance, divorce, death, etc.) while rubbing elbows with all the great names of that time.The authors descriptions of some of the battle scenes (The German defeat of the French) are so real that I felt I had experienced them first hand. This should be required reading for any WWII history class."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"&quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is the yet more epic (nearly 1400 pages) sequel to The Winds of War. It covers the period from shortly after Pearl Harbor in 1942 to the end of the war in 1945, again through the experiences of the members of the Henry family. I enjoyed &quot;The Winds of War&quot; quite a bit, but this one I thought moved too slowly and read much more as a history book than as historical fiction. There were many stretches when Wouk stopped telling the story altogether and simply described various events of the war, and he made far too much use of his device of Pug Henry's translation of a German officer's account of the war. There were, of course, many interesting events involving the characters, but they took much too long to play out and I found myself losing interest in what would happen to people.Wouk did a good job of bringing to life the horror of the Jewish concentration camps. And I got a little better idea of how the seemingly infallible German fighting machine somehow faltered, though it all seemed to come down to Hitler's egomaniacal micromanagement catching up with him, which is a little bit of a dissatisfying explanation. I still found Pug Henry and Pamela Tudsbury's characters interesting, but I was disappointed that the formerly strong and independent Natalie Jastrow became a typical fearful and cautious woman the moment she gave birth to a child. Still, I did learn quite a bit more about the war than I managed to pick up in high-school history, I just wish I could have enjoyed the read more."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Having read the reviews of the errors and misspellings in the Kindle version, I have decided not to purchase it.

I mean, the typos and other errors would be laughable were it not for the fact that it costs as much as the mass market paperback, which doesn't have these screwups. In that format, the book deserves six stars. Imagine the embedded fictional historical work \\"World Holocaust\\" by character Armin Von Roon having the heading \\"Borio Solocaust\\" at one point where Roon's \\"work\\" serves as an intermission. I can see that happening in one of the freebie public domain books, but this one has a price tag on it. Fortunately I still have the paperback that is such a masterwork by the great Herman Wouk, the book that glued me to the TV screen when it became a huge ABC miniseries, and had me coming here for the DVD version what that finally came out.All the Luddite naysayers who regard e-books as such to be an abomination concocted by Satan would be all over these flaws as yet another part of their argument to ban the e-book. I don't know how this happened. Maybe the transcribers suffer from the same \\"why bother, it's all George Bush's fault anyway\\" work ethic prevalent today.

General Sherman was absolutely right in his assertion that &quot;war is hell&quot;. Human beings are much more mature and understanding than they used to be and hopefully the nightmare will not be repeated. Salute to Herman Wouk !!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk is an astounding journey through World War II, through the experiences of the Henry family. With various members of the Henry family we travel through nearly all fronts of the war. From Nazi concentration camps, to the pacific battlefield, to stateside Washington D.C., this book encompasses it all.The book opens as we meet Captain Victor (Pug) Henry as he copes with the loss of his Naval battle ship in Pearl Harbor, and the impending doom of his marriage to wife Rhoda. Throughout the novel we follow Pug through the trials of the Pacific theatre during the Second World War.Natalie Henry is Pug's daughter-in-law, married to his youngest son Byron. We join Natalie while she is trying to escape Nazi Europe on a cruiser heading toward Palestine. Her young son Louis who is just a baby and her uncle the famous author Aaron Jastrow are traveling with her. She is separated from her husband Byron and hopes to make it back to him.Also in the Pacific Fleet are Victor Henry's two sons Warren and Byron. Warren is an aviator and Byron a submariner. Warren's wife Janice and young son Vic are both living in Hawaii, close to the action.This is one of the best novels I have ever read. While it is intimidating in size (a whopping 1378 pages) it is well worth your time. With myriads of subplots and twists and turns this book takes you through WW II with enough background information to make you an expert. At times it will make you cry, laugh, cringe, and really genuinely care about the characters. I am not a big fan of historical fiction; this is probably the only one that I have really liked a lot. This book is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Having read earlier reviews about the poor editing in this edition I decided to err on the safe side and got it digitally from my local library. The first few chapters were, if not mistake-free, at least readable. However, the further into the book I read, the more glaring and grating the editing (or lack of editing) errors became. The final straw was \\"Midman\\" when referring to \\"Midway.\\" Don't waste $10 on this edition. Better by far to get your hands on a hard copy. This is a terrific story, thoroughly well-researched and it deserves much better than it's received from these \\"publishers.\\" That they have the nerve to charge for this is hubris. Poorly, poorly done."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I've noticed that there continues to be an interest in these books, but that there have also been some interesting comments about them on Amazon. So I'll add some thoughts of mine.These novels, which are really one, extended, story cover World War II from antecedents to conclusion from the American viewpoint. Wouk uses the device of having one set of characters--in this case Naval Officer \\"Pug\\" Henry and his family--continually turn up in key situations so as to allow the novel to cover the entire epoch while having a continuous, human-level plot. (\\"War and Peace\\", obviously an inspiration to Wouk, is probably the most famous example of this approach.) Without this device the writer is forced to chose between taking a microscopic view of the period, or ending up with a set of connected stories without a unifying, human-level plot, or interrupting the novel with historical asides. The downside of this device is that it relies on a series of improbable events and coincidences to get a key character into each historical situation important to the story. Readers then need to suspend disbelief on this point to enjoy the novel; those that can't are going to be disappointed.Comments on Amazon suggest that these books are anything from soap operas to the greatest historical novels ever written. Those who consider them soap operas can't suspend disbelief concerning the plot improbabilities. That is a fair reason to not enjoy novels like these, but doesn't really consign them to the level of soap opera. But neither are they among the greatest historical novels ever written. In fact, they aren't even the best novels about World War II that use this plot device; that honor goes to Vasily Grossman's \\"Life and Fate\\", which covers the war from the Soviet viewpoint, and is a great novel by a great writer and well worth reading.At the end of the day, Herman Wouk may be remembered as one of the finest American novelists of the twentieth century, in that his best books were outstanding, if conventional, novels. But he was not a great writer, although he was a very good one. That said, these are two books that deserve to endure and gain new generations of readers. They are well written, keep moving and encourage the reader to keep turning pages, and give a grand overview of the World War II era. If you love history you might prefer learning about the era from nonfiction books by historians and participants. If you are looking for deep characterizations and profound insight into the human experience you should probably read smaller-scale novels that look inward rather than cover the broad sweep of a world-wide conflict. But for a reader looking for a well constructed and well written story that also provides an overview of the conflict that consumed the world in the 1930s and 40s, and set the stage for the geopolitics of the half century to follow, these are wonderful books."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"If you enjoy WWII stories that cover every front from the Pacific, Atlantic, Europe, Asia, Russia and from the view of Jew caught behind enemy lines and another in the concentration camps then you will thoroughly enjoy this book!!!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Like most readers, I first read Wouk's 'The Winds of War\\" which, as according to the author himself, was mere prelude to the probably-lesser-read 'War and Remembrance.' Read together, these books create one 2,000 page tome that skillfully leads the captivated reader into a living world of war, slaughter, confusion, and horror. The main characters, as palpably real as they seem, are fictional; the central events and themes were all too real.The events of the Second World War make up one of the most fascinating stories that could ever be told; as Wouk skillfully reminds us, the entire planet was at war, with hardly no portion of the globe untouched, and no political power of any consequence not locked in the high-technology death struggle. Wouk (and his researchers) have provided us with a marvelous gift in this book, which presents a cleverly developed fictitious tale set among ALL of the major events and players of this real life drama.I am writing this review in June of 2008. To us, the present world as we know it seems to be teetering on chaos and ruin, yet 2008 is nothing compared to what the world saw and experienced in 1941 to 1945, when fascist (and socialist, and imperialist) politics, rapidly developing war technologies, the last vestiges of old world European colonialism, and the overwhelming power of racism (anti-Semitism, among others), combined to change the maps of nearly every major power and realign the world for the time not yet ended. This masterful work of fiction sheds a fascinating light on the execution of this vast war, while also providing a great story.About the fiction of this work: Wouk's introduction states that 'The Winds of War' is mere prologue to this later book, this one being the book that he really wanted to write. That stated, reading 'The Winds of War' is a worthy exercise and serves to set-up the full effect of reading 'War and Remembrance.' In the prologue book (itself 1,000 pages of engrossing drama), Wouk invented an interesting family whose characters, all taken together, are present for active roles in just about every major event of the coming war, although, for the most part, what the characters experience is more in the nature of observation of events rather than participation. In this later book, those characters are no longer mere observers but are vital participants in every significant action and event of the war.I'll try not to spoil anything here for future readers, but I have to make a few comments about the content of the book itself. By the end of 'War and Remembrance,' it occurred to me that almost everything that existed in the lives of the Henry family at the beginning of the book is dead by the end of the book. By the end of the war, many familiar faces are gone: dead. Dead too are relationships, beliefs, plans, dreams, and intentions. The War, the great struggle that was a fire set by fascist, racist, and imperialist ambition, left no detail of any private life untouched or unchanged. My 'sucker punch' comment refers to the masterful method by which Wouk pulls the reader in to love his characters, and then showers the reader in the icy cold bath of War's reality for these characters. There are few happy endings in here. Some of our happy characters meet with tragic ends, just as occurs in 'real life.' It was a refreshing and rewarding element of this well-researched and well-written book, but it was also an emotionally difficult thing to experience. Given the sheer time invested in reading these twin volumes, and the emotion invested in these likeable characters, it's hard to see them suffer.My understanding is that Wouk was a Zionist. If he invested nearly two decades of his life in creating these books only for the purpose of promoting his Zionist message, he was successful. As presented, the case for a Jewish homeland is strong. More in this book than in the prologue, Wouk permits himself to stray from narrative and engage in editorializing. In some such portions, he expresses convincing confusion about the ability of Western civilization to produce something as horrible as the Holocaust. 'War and Remembrance' is just one effective device to memorialize that confusion, and a warning, to future generations.Great book. Please invest the time to read 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance.'"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"After you read the last page of the 885 pages of \\"The Winds of War\\" you realize that you have never read a book like it, and you probably never will, and then comes \\"War and Remembrance\\" and just blows the first book out of the water"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"A few reviews gave this book a one rating. Throw their reviews out since most reviewers gave this book a 5 star rating.This is a classic book to be read by the young, and older folk, especially the former who may never have heard of a guy named Hitler.I guess you can never satisfy everyone, and some people live to be different from the vast majority. They can say that they trashed Mr. Wouk or Hemingway or Faulkner...on-and-on. It puts them in the spotlight for a nanosecond, and gets people like me angry enough to write about their silly reviews in such forums."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"A reader does not need to have a special interest in war stories to enjoy this novel (along with the first part of the story in The Winds of War). This is a very well-written story that puts a personal face on World War Two. Even though The Winds of War adn War and Remembrance is one coherent stroy covering over 2000 pages, the story never bogs down. Spans events from the lead-up to the end of the war and follows the main characters all over the world. Wouk does a great job of writing from various perspectives.The history seems to be fairly accurate, with some necessary literary license taken to covey the sheer volume of information required as the backdrop for the main characters. You wouldn't read this to replace history works, but it really humanizes the events of the war."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Winds of War was magnificent and War and Remembrance is equally so. These two books represent the absolute epitome of what hefty, epic, and sweeping historical fiction can be. Global in scope, flawless in chronology, Wouk has woven the events of a fictional naval family within the triumphs and tragedies of world war in a manner engrossing and suspenseful - indeed, unforgettably so.It's all here. Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, Yamamoto, Mussolini, Moscow, Stalingrad, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Auschwitz, Teheran, Singapore, Pearl Harbor, and more. Winds of War and War and Remembrance are towering literary achievements and two of the best historically-based novels I have ever read. I loved them. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I read this book when it originally was issued in paperback, after also reading \\"Winds of War\\". I came across my copy of WoW not long ago and decided to re-read it. That, in turn caused me to order and re-read War and Remembrance.Wouk was able to combine history with fictional story lines very effectively. By the of the book, even those who have a minimal knowledge of WWII history will find themselves educated, in an entertaining way, about many of the main characters and decisive battles of WWII on both the European and Pacific fronts. It is not a history book; however it may entice you to want to learn more about the period.A good \\"re-read\\"."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I'm reading it right now, and I'm enjoying it alot.I own both moviesof Winds of War, and War and Remembrance, ans this winter I finishedreading Winds of War.

I found both books very enjoyable."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"The book came in in good shape. The problem is this book is in two parts and when I orignally ordered my intention was to order both.

It's an absolutely great book re WW2.Tom Thomas"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I just finished reading this for the second time. I regret only that I had let about 7-8 years lapse between the fist time I read both it and Winds of War because I forgot what happened to the characters and thus rushed through it more than I wanted to. The history and philosphy in these books is superior. The writing is beyond fault. This is historical fiction at its very finest. I cannot put words to how truly momentous this book is. I can only say that it is in my top five and I have read some of the very best."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I just finished this novel and I have felt a bit lost the last couple days. How can I possibly follow up a book of this magnitude with something else? Nothing compares. As for Wouk's own words that it stands on it's own and you don't have to have read Winds of War - don't listen to him; read Winds of War. You will not regret it.Wouk has created one of the most memorable cast of characters in a most memorable period time and he brings it all to life with complete credibility. As it is with war no one is safe and that goes for this book. The characters are actually vulnerable, the can and will die unexpectantly and leave you in shock at their lost - just like in war.I did feel like it was a bit rushed in the end. Some of the biggest events of the war and some of the biggest events in the characters lives were brushed over very quickly. I would have liked to have read more about Iwo Jima, the bombing of Dresden and Toyoko, the actions taken by the Germans to cover their tracks and get rid of the surviving Jews in their camps and I especially wish he would have gone into more detail about one characters experiences while in a German camp.That is my only complaint.Read this book. It doesn't matter how young you are. It was the worlds biggest catastrophe, a war that encompassed the whole earth. That will never happen again and it is so important for people to read the history of WWII and understand its causes, understand Hitler and how he gained control over his people and most importantly understand the consequences of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"WWII was called \\"The Last Just War\\". This book in fiction form deals with most of the questions that were with the people in this war. Isolationism, Jewish Question, failure to take initiative by leaders/govts are dealt with and presented. While this is all historical fiction, it still rings true.I am going on my second reading. This is a strange thing for me to do. I look at some of the ideas as they are still playing out in our lives today. It puts a glaring light on how governments will promise things and then forget the promise. Just look at the mess in the Middle/Near East. It is the product of decisions made from 1933 on.There is more to this book than it may first appear."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I'm an avid reader, and don't need to add to the well-written reviews of \\"Winds of War\\" & \\"War and Remembrance\\".All I will say is that I've read both books every few years - all told 6 times I think.

You will be drawn in; I sure have been."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I agree with the reviewer who claims that some of the situations in which the main character, Victor Henry, finds himself are ridiculously fortuitous. Had any American seen so much and influenced as many people as Henry did, he would have been recorded in the annals of United States history. The fact remains, however, that this is fiction, not history, and these episodes contribute to the overall effect of this work as a sweeping historical drama.I love _War and Remembrance_, and its companion piece, _The Winds of War_. The books contain complementary human dramas: the struggle of a family to survive and the defining conflict of the twentieth century. Herman Wouk certainly succeeded in his aim to use fiction to demonstrate the horrific effects of global conflict. I have read these books several times throughout the years, and feel confident that I will continue my enjoyment indefinitely"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"As always, Herman writes to the point of love wins over war and deceit and the best man does win, as we knew Pug would."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Having read this book and its \\"prequel\\", \\"Winds of War\\", many years ago, I decided to reread both.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I can't believe there are only, as of this writing, 67 reviews of this book. It is easily the best WWII novel ever written. It's certainly the most comprehensive, and the amount of research that went into this book is mind-boggling. Still, all of the historical never gets in the way of the narrative. When the end of this story was in sight, I stayed up until 4 a.m. because I needed to know how it ended and how things would turn out for the characters, who had become very dear to me. I simply cannot recommend this book (and its prequel) strongly enough."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I ordered this for my WWII buff boyfriend. I had read this years ago, and knew he would love it. He consumed the whole series with gusto. As well as being a novel about a family before and during the war, the books are historically accurate, and fascinating. Definately a worthwhile read, and a great way to learn about the era."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Why did I give this novel 5 stars? As others have noted, there is more than a trace of soap opera in this saga. And the plot does stretch your credulity; how else to get the members of one family in all the right places during WWII at just the right time? And yet, if WOW and WAR are soap operas, they are very, very, good soap operas. In other words, you keep tuning in, you keep turning the pages, all 2000 of them. I first read these books when I was in the Army in the late 1970s. I took the books with me as I traveled around Europe on leave. I visited London, Paris, Italy, etc. And at night in my hotel room, I'd often find a chapter that described the very city I was visiting. Another reason these books stick in your memory after 30 years was the mini-series. The TV version reinforces the written version. So like other readers have commented, the characters become real after 2000 pages and 30 hours of TV. In fact 2000 pages and 30 hours of TV is more exposure than a lot of REAL people will ever get in their lives. Maybe that's why I find myself comparing a friend's son to Warren Henry, or a good looking blonde to Janice; two people who are totally fictitious. Just the fact that I'm taking the trouble to write a review 27 years after finishing these novels shows how much they stuck in my head. And I note that Herman Wouk is still alive. I can picture him in his rocking chair, passing his days reading reviews of his life's work on Amazon. Well, as others have said, WOW and WAR are America's version of War and Peace. In fact, they're better than War and Peace. Nuff said."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I'm a bit too young for World War II, but my dad--enlisting in the Navy at age 17--survived Pearl Harbor, a close-range battleship attack on his ship (the USS San Francisco) at the battle of Guadalcanal, and personal participation in the invasion of Guam (3rd wave, to set up a communications station). As a Navy brat, I played on abandoned pillboxes in the jungle outside of Subic Bay (Philippines) in the late 50s and picked up empty shell casings on a group family outing to Corregador.That said, I consider _The Winds of War_ and _War and Remembrance_ to be the greatest novels written about World War II. The historical detail is dead on, the military, political, and social commentary is brilliant, and the story itself keeps you page-turning for a few thousand pages. It is a heart-wrenching book that helps one grasp--six decades later--what it was like to have the entire world plunged into war, with a close look at the horrors of the Holocaust.Wouk actually served in the US Navy in the Pacific during WW II. He lived through the war and brings that whole era to life in a way that I doubt any current author could. And yet they are utterly relevant today. I frankly think they should be required reading in college or even high school. Read them. ..bruce.."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book contains great fictional characters combined with a super accurate account of the war. I have read and re-read this book 4 or 5 times and I am sure if I live another 20 years (and keep my eyesite) I will read it 4 or 5 times more. The same holds true for The Winds Of war, the pre-quel. If you have any interest at all in World War II, or just want to read a good book, this is it."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I found War and Remembrance a fascinating read. It continues with the plot lines from The Winds of War and introduces new ones: an affair between in-laws Janice Henry and Byron Henry; how Auschwitz was constructed from the ground up, using Berel Jastrow as its narrator; how the US Navy creamed the Japanese at Midway; and other battles (I forgot the name of the other one, but it used the code word &quot;Sho&quot;) we got a glimpse of Oak Ridge National Lab using Capt.Pug Henry's eyes, as he sought a solution to a D-Day landing craft construction problem; we were introduced to Terezin, a town founded by Nazis as a &quot;Pushkin village,&quot; to demonstrate that the cream of European Jews weren't being butchered like sheep--oh yes they were!; and the world's reaction (or its disbelief) to the shock of the Nazi death camps' existence-embassy staffer Leslie Slote and Berel Jastrow both tried to get the world's attention on this matter, with neglible results.The novel is a thick tome, but it reads fast."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Herman Wouk wrote a dynamite pair of novels with Winds of War, and War &amp; Remembrance, anyone who lopved those books should read the great new novel that many reviewers have compared to Thw Winds of War, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY.

He is beyond compare."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"As a retired commander in the Naval Reserve, I can say this book is based on a lot of research into both politics and the war with Germany and Japan.The political discussion between the fictional German General Von Roon and American Victor Henry scattered throughout the book gives both the German and American views. It is fascinating and thought provoking material that asks hard questions about morality and human nature.Mr. Wouk has lectured at the Naval War College and I studied him while attending. I rarely read novels, but this one is well worth it. I liked it even better than Mr. Wouk's earlier Winds of War."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Herman Wouk is a great writer. With War and Remembrance and its predecessor, The Winds of War, He sealed his reputation as a great writer of historical fiction. Unlike such writers as Leon Uris, who tends to create heroic larger than life heroes and James Michener, who skimps on characterization altogether, Wouk creates brilliantly real figures who seem to live, breath and sometimes die. Whereas the Winds of War covers the period from just prior to the German invasion of Poland in Sept. 1939 through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, War and Remembrance covers the period from after Pearl through the surrender of Japan in August 1945. As with the previous book, Wouk blends his fictional characters with real figures such as Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Hitler.By exploring the experiences of the fictional Henry family and their extended acquaintances, Wouk manages to cover virtually every aspect of this sprawling epic struggle between good and evil. There is Victor \\"Pug\\" Henry, stoic Navy captain, his dutiful bound son Warren, a Navy flyer bound for action in the Pacific, his formerly wayward son Byron, now a submarine officer who marries the Jewish woman Natalie Jastrow in Europe. Natalie herself is trapped in Italy with her Uncle, the intellectual scholar Aaron Jastrow and her baby Louis. The Nazi vice that slowly closes on the American born Natalie is excruciating yet stunningly realistic. There is Leslie Slote, the callous foreign service officer who has an epiphany when he discovers the plans for the Final Solution and there are many many others. Wouk blends the personal stories of these characters with an expositional account of the war. He uses the device of a fictional memoir of an imprisoned German officer to prsent the war from the German perspective. It is bone-chilling reading. Finally, Wouk's stunning descriptions of Auschwitz are the most realistic and engrossing description of the Holocaust I have ever read. This book is moving, gripping and engrossing. It is also highly educational. The reader of War and Remembrance will learn a great deal about the Second World War and the War will be brought to life by this book better than any history. This novel should not be missed nor should The Winds of War."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"When I read &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, it was only after I had read the reviews of the book on Amazon.com that I realised that life would never be complete until I had read the sequel.Trolling Nairobi's thrift shops at long last gave me access to one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is an epic novel, a great romance (and heaven knows how I hate those, but this one was a gem), and perhaps the best history lesson on the Second World War I have come across.Without going into specifics about the book - which the other reviewers on the site have done so well, the things that stand out in the book are several:One; it brings to life the Holocaust in a way that history books can never hope to compare. Auschwitz is no longer a footnote to horror - it is now a flesh and blood camp with horrifyingly banal commandants. The SS are not nameless, faceless sadists - they are normal people with an abnormal hatred.Secondly, the philosophical-historical insights into European and German history, as seen through the mind of Aaron Jastrow, are superb.I need not dwell on the sweeping historical views of the war of &quot;Armin von Roon&quot;, that bring the bigger picture of the war into play.Natalie Jastrow, in my opinion the most developed character in the book, is prepared to prostitute herself in order to save her life in Auschwitz that she may see her son again. That, to me, makes her all the more remarkable a person than if she had remained unbelievably pious. Natalie is a real human being. The only injustice Wouk does to her is not to develop her character after Auschwitz.Finally, the most touching part of the book was the night that Udam, the theater man in Theresienstadt, decides to sing the haunting songs of the Jews under the threat of death. Of all the moments in the book, this one was the one that brought me closest to tears.The longest book I have ever read (at 1389 pages in my version), and certainly a book I will read again. This is a rare gem."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"WOW. Exceptional historical research, developed characters and subplots, great storytelling. A book for the ages. With Winds of War (read it first), this was a 2000+ page trek. Worth it and very satisfying. While being entertained, the reader receives an educational narrative of the progression of events, the atmosphere, and the personalities of WWII. Among the most enjoyable aspects for me was reading the face-to-face encounters with important personages of the war (at least Wouk's interpretation of them). It was the next best thing to having sat in a room with these people. By cleverly using a fictional family and its involvement in the war, Wouk takes the reader all over the world, providing a wonderful comprehensive overview of WWII. Finishing it meant saying goodbye to old and beloved friends. I repeat . . . WOW."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I've always wondered why this book was so popular, along with its predecessor \\"The Winds of War\\". I tend to avoid huge books in excess of 1000 pages, because I've been disappointed in the past by time-wasting tomes.For that reason, I avoided reading Herman Wouk's epics. Talk about judging a book by its cover, or in this case by its weight... But I finally did start reading these books, and was completely hooked from the first chapter of \\"The Winds of War\\". I couldn't wait to see what happened in \\"War and Remembrance\\".I can't imagine following Wouk's suggestion that one can enjoy \\"War and Remembrance\\" on its own, without having first read \\"The Winds of War\\". Start with the first one. If you don't, you won't know what you're missing later. The characters in the saga are developed in \\"The Winds of War\\" such that it breaks your heart when they encounter all of their perils and difficulties in the second book. I've never felt such sadness about the fates of fictional characters the way I did in \\"War and Remembrance\\", but I also was exhilarated by their successes and shreds of happiness along the way.The two minor criticisms I have with \\"War and Remembrance\\" in no way detract from the five-star rating I'm giving it. First: The book felt a bit rushed at the end. Even though most of the dangling plot threads were tied up neatly (as neatly as war allows), there were too few pages dedicated to some of the most jaw-droppingly significant events of the entire war, specifically having to do with Japan. And that leads me to criticism number two: The war in the Pacific got comparatively short shrift, as compared to Europe. I would have appreciated it if Wouk would have expounded more on Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Doolittle's raids, etc. The cast of characters would have had to be dramatically expanded to do this, and Wouk probably would have had to write a three-volume set instead of two. (I'm going to read Wouk's classic \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" next...that should satisfy my craving here.)His treatment of the Nazi-fueled cancer in Europe was as gut-wrenching and historically complete as anyone could ask for. The story's been told many times, but it must still be told many more times as history marches on and people forget. The atrocities of the Third Reich are fully documented here, in all their filthy excesses, and it's horrible to see the characters you care about getting drawn into that maelstrom. Sadder still to realize that you're grieving about fictional characters, when so many million _actual_ people were slaughtered in this hell on earth.Wouk writes from his background...his family emigrated here from Russia, and in the USA Wouk really explored and expounded upon his Jewish roots. Even though he wasn't in the Holocaust, he certainly did his homework. This is an important book for everyone, just for this reason alone: The man's a master storyteller.Rare is it that you find a book - let alone two! - where you feel educated first and then entertained. \\"War and Remembrance\\", along with \\"The Winds of War\\", are stories I'll remember for the rest of my life. Shattering, epic, dramatic, and I'm quite confident I'll never encounter such great works again.I am not Jewish, but I loudly add my voice to the chorus: \\"Never Again!\\""},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"All at once , this book is the greatest history lesson, the most exciting drama and the most intriguing story I have ever read. The 1500 or so pages ( and of course, the prequel &quot;Winds of War&quot;) may seem intimidating at first, but trust me, stick it out. The temptation is great to skip around in this book, especially to fictitous general Armin Von Roon's continuing analysis of the war from a German perspective, but the story should be read cover to cover to get the true flavor and development of the story. The heart rending trimphs and tragedies that strike the Henry clan in every theatre of the world make war and Rememberance an emotional thriller as well. Character development is also a Wouk strong point. Byron Henry starts Winds of war as an irresponsible loafing boy without a care in the world. By the time the novel ends, Byron has become a serious, emotional, successful naval officer with a wife that he would do anything to save and a son he'd do anything to find. The great thing is though, that Wouk does not skip a stage in Byron's development. By the time I finished reading both novels, it was hard to avoid identifying with Byron as if he were a real person. By the way, I also think that the ABC mini- series based on the book was the greatest picture to ever appear in the history of television and movies. I realize I sound a little exagerated and corny, but I simply can't believe that there has been so little attention paid to this masterpiece and the tremendous mini- series."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"\\"Incompetent\\" is the politest word I can think of to describe the kindle edition.There are spelling errors on nearly every screen.

When I read the descriptions, I kept thinking about my Jewish friends and wondering how a man as deranged as Hitler could hypnotize so many people into performing those hideous acts. Mr. Wouk stated that he hoped to see the end of war, yet he clearly understood that war is not simply a necessary evil but necessary because of evil. The events of the Holocaust must never be forgotten.Mr. Wouk created memorable characters, each flawed in their own way, yet engaging, very likeable and often heroic. The depth of research required to create this story staggers the mind, yet history and fiction meld into a wonderful story that will stay with you long after you close this book.This is a great story told by a great writer."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"War and Remembrance, by Herman Wouk. 1942-1945: the second half of World War II. The courageous battles of Midway, Guadalcanal, El Alamein, and Leyte Gulf; Franklin Roosevelt, Josef Stalin, and Winston Churchill; Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito; the millions of sailors, soldiers, and pilots who died for their countries; Auschwitz and other dreadful concentration camps; these eminent events and honorable figures are just segment of the history in War and Remembrance. Herman Wouk, the author, brings us to where every bullet was shot, bomb dropped, and torpedo launched in this amazing book of the second half of World War II. Wouk tells us the story of a war that would change the world forever. Victor Henry, a fifty year old United States Naval Admiral, has not only served but also commanded both cruisers and battleships such as the Northampton and Iowa , is not a well-known man, but has encountered many dangerous situations. Byron Henry, one of the sons of Victor Henry, is a Lieutenant Commander who serves on many different submarines such as the Moray and Devilfish in the Navy, and is also a very courageous man. Natalie Henry, the wife of Byron Henry, is a beautiful, intelligent woman and who gets wrapped up in escaping from Europe, since she is Jewish. Pamela Tudsbury is a British girl who fell in love with Victor Henry during the course of the story. Warren Henry, also a son of Victor Henry, was a Navy Air Corps Lieutenant (jg) pilot on a carrier called USS Enterprise who gets killed. Herman Wouk made me realize what World War 2 actually was. It was not just dates written and pictures taken, but a war to remember. He makes you develop a perfect view of the bloody battlefields in Europe and East Asia during the war. The glorious victories, the painful defeats, the millions of casualties lost; these are the \\"pictures\\" you will see not in a textbook, newspaper, or magazine, but in your mind. In school, we are taught America's viewpoint of this great war. However, there is more than one side. During War and Remembrance, Herman Wouk sometimes takes breaks in the storyline and talks about the facts and opinions of this war. To accomplish this, Wouk uses a fictional German Wehrmacht General, Armin von Roon, who wrote a few books named \\"World Empire Lost\\", \\"World Holocaust\\", and \\"Hitler As Military Leader\\", as I mentioned in my previous book report. Roon tells us the story of World War II, that is, from Germany's point of view. In The Winds of War, which War and Remembrance is the sequel to, Roon says, \\"There is no morality in world history. There are only tides of change borne on violence and death. The victors write the history, pass the judgments, and hang or shoot the losers.\\" I am including this cite because it is true. Who knows what the world would be like if the Axis Powers had won? Would there be a world empire or freedom? Would everyone be Christian? This is what we are deprived of when we learn about wars in school. Some people will never learn this \\"other\\" side, and are ignorant of what war can do to us and our world. Many people see war as a sport, like in movies when none of the main characters die. These movies do not show the \\"death\\" part of war. In War and Remembrance, Warren Henry, who was a main character, dies in the Battle of Midway. To see a main character die is very depressing, because authors like Wouk force you to feel as if they are close to you. I almost cried at this point. Wouk writes about Warren as his flaming plane was diving into the deep Pacific Ocean, \\"He had never thought he would be shot down, though he had known the risks. With his death sentence before his eyes he could not believe it. His future stretched before him for so many years- so well planned, so real, so important!\\" Warren was a little ignorant himself. He knew the risks, but he still did not think that he would die. And yet people still want to be \\"snipers that go in and shoot the bad guys.\\" They don't realize that they might die, like Warren did. Aaron Jastrow, the Uncle of Natalie, is also a Jew who tries to escape Europe, along with Natalie and her baby, Louis. He is a well-known Jewish author who has written many books. While trying to escape Europe, he kept a journal, recording all of the events that he goes through on his journey. It is not only a journal, but also a book, which is called, \\"A Jew's Journey\\". It is amazing what he, Natalie, and Louis went through. They went from living in a house in the hills of Siena, Italy, all the way to Marseilles, France (40 miles away from the Spanish border), then back to a German ghetto called Theresienstadt in Germany. Herman Wouk once in a while refers back to previous things that occurred as early as the beginning of The Winds of War. On pages 1125 to 1126 of War and Remembrance, it says, \\"Pug was experiencing the sensation of a slipped clog in time, of reliving an old scene. Rhoda's \`Bye the bye, there's a letter from Byron' had triggered it, he realized. So they had sat drinking Armagnac in twilight before the war, the day Admiral Preble had offered him the attach&eacute; post in Berlin. \`Bye the bye, there's a letter from Byron', Rhoda had said, and he had felt the same sort of relief, because they had not heard from him in months. It had been the first letter about Natalie. That day, Warren had announced he was putting in for flight training.\\" I went to the beginning of The Winds of War and found out if all this that was said was true. On page 15, Warren says, \\"Say, incidentally, Dad, did I mention that a couple of months ago my exec put in for flight training. I sent in one of the forms too, just for the heck of it. It seems we both have a chance.\\" And on page 16, Rhoda says, \\"By the bye, there's a letter from Byron.\\" As I sit here typing, I think about how much Herman Wouk has improved since he wrote The Caine Mutiny, which was published more than twenty years even before The Winds of War was. In The Caine Mutiny, Wouk just tells the story of life on board a destroyer-minesweeper during World War II. Don't get me wrong, The Caine Mutiny was an excellent book, but The Winds of War and War and Remembrance are far more well written. In The Caine Mutiny, there are only a few important characters, who are all in the same place during the book, which was on the Caine . In The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, there are many important characters, which are spread all over the world at different times, then meet at such anonymous places as Tehran, Iran. Also how Wouk has General von Roon tell Germany's side to the war through his books \\"World Empire Lost\\", \\"World Holocaust\\", and \\"Hitler As Military Leader\\", and Aaron Jastrow tell the story of the Holocaust through a Jew's eyes in his book, \\"A Jew's Journey.\\" The one thing that truly amazes me is the way Wouk makes you want something to happen later in the story, but the opposite of what you wanted to happen happens, and you are pleased with it. I know that sounds complicated, so here is an example. After Rhoda wanted a divorce from Victor Henry and Pamela Tudsbury rejected his proposal, they both wanted him back. But since he lost his love for them because they both did terrible things to him, he rejected them. I wanted Victor to end up with either Rhoda or Pamela before, but when he rejected them, I was happy. I know this is still very complicated. War and Remembrance is one of two best books I have ever read in my life. The other is The Winds of War. The soldiers, sailors, and pilots who fought heroically; the marvelous victories and horrible losses; the good days and the bad ; and the struggle for world peace and world empire; these are all things that are told within the covers of War and Remembrance. Victor Henry's quote after the Battle of Leyte Gulf sums up the future of our world, \\"Either war is finished, or we are."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I finished War and Remembrance last night and, after 1800 pages of it and the prequel (Winds of War), I wish it had been longer. Wouk defines the genre of historical fiction with a cast of characters that bring World War II to life. I would strongly recommend that you read Winds of War and War and Remembrance in sequence, because it adds an extra dimension to the main characters.Where Herman Wouk succeeds beyond measure is in providing glimpses into nearly every perspective in the war, making this a sophisticated tour of the unprecedented industrial war that defined the last century. You will visit the Pacific war, London during the blitz, Poland during the German invasion, occupied France, Moscow, Leningrad and Berlin. When the truth is as incredible as WWII, little fiction is needed: Wouk takes few if any liberties with the facts, and the result is both riveting and educational.Particularly refreshing: the characters are real, not perfect, and we can identify with their problems. The desperation is real, and the story unfolds with utmost realism. The author obviously recognized a duty to treat his subject with complete respect and accuracy, sacrificing nothing to commercial demands for fiction.I would agree with several other reviewers that this could well be the best means of learning the history of the war ever conceived. Yes, it takes a long time to read. But the immensity and quality make it an experience. I cannot recommend it strongly enough."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"If you've never read any books by this author, and you're a fan of anything historical, you've really missed out.....This was the third book by Wouk that I read (after the Caine Mutiny and The Winds of War). His works of fiction can in many ways bring home history better than most textbooks: his carefully sketched portraits of Rooseveldt, for instance (in this book) make him seem to me, at twenty-two a person whereas any biography of him would make him seem more of a demigod....Wouk aside from this is just a good read. He presents characters that you care about-- they seem almost real. You feel for loves lost and loves spurned, and-- as I did-- get so caught up in their lives that often you have to read more of his books to find out how they turned out....For anyone who is a fan of history and isn't put off by reading eight hundred pages that you can't put down prose, I'd highly recommend this book.... read &quot;Winds of War&quot; first, though, such that you don't spoil it...."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Very interesting story about real and fictional characters involved in WWII, but I found the Jewish religious discussions and overly detailed naval battle scenes to be too much, especially in the second half of the book. I speed read through these sections to get the gist of what the author was saying."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Though this book (and its prequel, Winds of War) is fiction, the facts presented are real and presented in well-researched, precise detail. These two books should be required reading at the high school and college level. Almost all the elements of Western understanding of good versus evil are contained in this narrative about real events.Because the interactions of the fictional protagonists are embeded in the narrative of actual historic events and people, the fiction takes on a tremendous sense of reality. Within the larger story, Wouk also presents a fictonal treatise by a German general Von Roon which gives an excellent discussion of the sense of the German people of the time and the etymology of their hatred of Jews. Von Roon's treatise also gives an excellent idea of how a German general might rationalize the war after a bitter defeat. In all, the Von Roon story one of the most important parts of a magnificent work."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"A great story and perfect sequel to the Winds of War.

Now how about The Caine Mutiny as an Ebook?"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book is so outstanding that I will make a comment which will at the very least be considered by some as controversial. Some may even consider it sacrilegious. This book is better than Tolstoy's War and Peace.Wouk's historical presentation is flawless. The way that he weaves the story of the Henry family with the ongoing tragedy is masterful. His World Empire Lost, von Roon's take on the war, is a brilliant creation. His presentation of the holocaust is vivid in detail but sensitive in presentation.I do have one complaint about the book. Wouk never makes it clear just exactly how Byron discovered that Natalie and Lewis were in Marseille. Neither was this explained in the made for TV miniseries staring Bob Mitchum. Oh well.As for the latest Kindle version, just rereleased, it is practically perfect. I found very few errors and none that interrupted the flow of the book. The publisher got it right."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"After reading The Winds of War, I knew this book would be great. However, I read the last book in print and the book was HUGE and the print was tiny, so I knew I'd need something easier on the eyes for this one. I had read several reviews on Amazon saying that the Kindle version had so many mistakes it wasn't worth reading, so I was leery when I ordered it. To my delight, the Kindle version was perfect. No mistakes that I could find.Lots of people have talked about how great this book and its predecessor are, so I will simply say don't start reading this book if you don't have a fair amount of reading time in front of you...you will be missing a lot of sleep otherwise! Great book!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Loved it. Historically accurate yet very engrossing. Learned so much about the events of WWII yet was entertained and involved in the characters of the story. In one way it reminded me of Forest Gump in that the Henry family seemed to be present at every significant event of WWII. This method of storytelling personalized the history and made it extremely interesting."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I have nothing to add to those reviews that have rated War and Remembrance a 5.0 historical novel of the World War II period. My purpose in writing is to proclaim that the problems (specifically, typographical and scanning errors) in the previous Kindle edition have been almost completely cleared up. I have almost completed my umpteenth re-read, this time on my Kindle, and I have noted exactly one uncaught typo and three uncaught scanning errors. The rest of what makes a Kindle edition work has been functioning just fine. So -- 5.0 for the original novel, 4.999 for the revised Kindle edition, 5.0 overall.If you have been scared off by the negative reviews of the previous Kindle edition, now is the time to add this masterpiece to your e-library."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Read this book for the second time, the first time being when it first came out in the 1970's. It reflects the era I grew up in like no other book I have read. The three Daniel Silva WWII based novels come close, but those were thrillers and not historical novels. Though some 1400 pages in length, which would scare off a lot of readers, I preceeded it by reading the prequel, The Winds of War at 800 pages. I still wanted more after they ended. The book is carefully researched, eye-opening in many aspects of WWII not normally written about in novels. This is especially true of our Russian allies and The Land-Lease program. Eloquently written and politically revealing on all fronts of the war - U.S. Britain, Russian, Germany, Italan and Japan. Wouk present a way of putting it altogether as to show how acts in the Pacific affected those in Europe, and visa versa."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Watched for a better price on this set, and this was acceptable. Plus it came with both the first half and the second half of the series which made it great. Follow up to Winds of War, it's a great chronicle of WW2 in all it's complexity. I love this series."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This is the follow up to &#34;Winds of War.&#34; It is, in my opinion, Wouk's best work. A history lesson that's easy to take, but jaring in its content and perspective."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"After reading Herman Wouk's Winds of War (5star plus) I bought his sequel War and Remembrance.This is a massive novel 1042 pages that reads fantastic with no boring parts. Wouk uses real pre and WW2 history, with real world leader figures and fictional characters. The reader gains deep empathy with the character life and death accounts, their love and tragedies. There is a navel family starting with fictional Commander Henry ( eventually retires as a Vice Admiral), his Lt Commander aviator son Warren who gets shot down and killed and his Lt. Commander submariner son Brian who eventually commands a sub. Also the three wives are main characters too.Exciting battle action with Admirals Halsey, Nimitz, King and Yamato and more. Lots of Sub, Battleship, Carrier, other ships and Torpedo planes and Dive bombers.Brain marries a beautiful Jewish girl and she has his baby son. His wife, their infant son and her Uncle get trapped in Hitler's Germany. Her Uncle gets gassed and cremated in a concentration camp. The baby is smuggled out but poor Natalie faces brutal persecution and more.Hitler, his Generals, Mussolini and battle planes are discussed as well as war in the Pacific against Japan. Pug Henry is attached as President Roosevelt's attache in Europe but is really a Battleship man. Also lots of interaction with the Russian Stalin and the Russian army, and England's Churchill and the Battle of Britain. Lots of interaction with President Roosevelt and a little with President Truman.Eventually Rear Admiral Pug Henry gets to lead a Battleship group with Admiral Halsey's carriers in a gigantic battle against Japan's navy.Also the development of the \\"A\\" bomb and the nuclear bombing of Japan is told.I wont ruin this great novel by saying too much more. Just say this is one of the greatest pre war and WW2 books I have ever read with great character development, mixing up with real historical figures and great detailed parts of history. Wouk shows us the horrors of WW2, the Jewish Holocaust and the hope that it will be the last World War and the world can have peace. The book is really superb. 5 stars plus."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This is the companion to Winds of War!!!! Another excellent book!You will not be disappointed!A must read also.

Herman Wouk captures the fate of many true instances. Follows truly the opening situations from WINDS OF WAR."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"\\"Winds of War\\"was fabulous, but Herman Wouk outdid himself in the follow up book, \\"War and Remembrance.\\" Monumental!

And that is saying alot because that is all i really read. It starts a little slow but give it a chance becuse once you get going there is no stopping it you have to make yourself put it down. Incredible use of real historical facts and personages it gives the reader a great scope to the size of the war and the issues being faced by both the public and those involved. This book in my opinion is only matched by its predecessor Winds of War buy it read it and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Wouk's War and Remembrance (and its predecessor Winds of War) have to me become the standard by which to judge historical fiction. Amid what amounts to an elaborate soap opera of sorts, Wouk weaves true and accurate facts in such a masterful way that I could place myself in the center of the malestrom that was WWII. Without pounding details over your head, these two books are informative history as well as powerful fiction. I highly recommend these two books to anyone interested in WWII.Picking up immediately where Winds of War ends, this tale takes the reader from Pearl Harbor to the end of the war (not an easy task!) As could be expected, this is a far grimmer tale that WoW. I particularly found the details of the death camps to be the strongest and most moving parts of the book. When the books ended I felt as if I had been privy to something special; the story of a generation who fought and sacrificed everything to defeat tyranny."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Wouk's sequel to &quot;The Winds of War&quot; is an enveloping epic that enchants throughout its pages. It chronicles the Henry family's continuing saga during World War Two. Wouk offers a unique glimpse into the national mindsets of the enemy German and Japanese who seek world domination as their entitled destiny! Most touching is the author's haunting description of the living and dying conditions in the Auschwitz and Thereinstadt concentration camps. Wouk lays bare man's inhumanity to man and puts personal faces on individual Jewish people who suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime. &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; presents hsitory in a way no high school or college course ever could. This work speaks to both the courage and cowardice of mankind. It also forces reflection of the sacrifices made by our veterans who stood in harm's way during World War Two. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Mr. Wouk is the master at weaving interesting fictional characters and storylines into real-life historical drama. In the beginning I was enthralled by the Henry's and the war. By the end I was touched by the reuniting of Louis and Natalie. I've read the book twice and I watch the entire mini-series about once every two or three years."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"The novel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is by far Herman Wouk's greatest book, and the prequel &quot;Winds of War&quot; is nearly as good. Wouk blends history and fiction brilliantly, better than anyone else I have ever read. The greatest part about this book is the analysis of the fictional General Armin von Roon. Wouk beautifully captured the mindset of the German military commander. I happen to have an obsession with World War II military history and I must say, that he is dead on with his analysis. From biographies I have read on Rommel, Guderian, and Manstein, even Hitler, his conlusions are supported by the words of the commanders themselves"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Great book, but I have never seen such a sloppy Kindle version. It is riddled throughout with mis-scans that in a couple of cases are impossible to translate."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book is superb, a compelling story and very historically educational. However, the Kindle edition makes me think it was scanned and run through a mediocre OCR program. Typos abound and they all look like what I've seen from OCR programs from years ago. On top of that, no competent editor found and fixed these errors before it was published as a Kindle book. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"great, i enjoyed it very much and like the workof herman waugh as well great stuff etc etc etc etc"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I intended to separately review \\"The Winds of War\\", then \\"War and Remembrance\\", but the author's design of the work is far to well integrated for this idea to create anything but a diversion from what the work represented. Take this as a combined work for both volumes. They are vastly different in scope and focus, but must be seen as essentially one work.First a word about editions. I bought both for the Kindle, and feel a little swindled. Book 1 was okay--I mean, it was great, and the Kindle version was properly executed. CLEARLY, however, no one from the publisher or Amazon proof-read \\"War & Remembrance\\". It was a disaster. Bad enough that the artistic impact of the work was diminished. Amazon should offer some sort of guarantee for what it sells. Typos were common and serious through the first 80% of the book. I'm not sure whether I had just become more adept at ignoring them, or if there were less of them towards the end. This was a poorly produced offering--certainly not worth the ten dollars I paid for it. Searching the B&N; \\"Nookbook\\" site, I find no mention of this poor production, but the Amazon site is loaded with disappointed purchasors. Maybe it's only bad in Kindle. So much for bitching and bad-mouthing.The Winds of War captures events leading up to the United States entry into World War II, point of view being captured through the eyes of a career navy officer, his family, friends and acquaintances. It's a wonderful story, quickly engulfing the reader in its narrative. I cared about Capt. Victor Henry, his wife Roda, his sons Warren and Bryan, their wives, etc. All characters were well-drawn and credible.War & Remembrance continues the story through the end of the war. It is not so artfully spun, but meticulously assembled.You see, this second book revealed the purpose of the entire effort. Wouk created an epic polemic of the holocaust disguised as a novel. That virtually everyone forges on through the thousand page (print edition)tome is an incredible tribute to his craft.Wouk artfully introduces Jewish characters (Winds of War)through the eyes of the Henry family to temporarily subordinate them. There are only two major Jewish characters; Dr. Aron Jastrow and his adult niece Natalie, for whom the first section of the book is named. Dr. Jastrow is a famous literati, having written a book-of-the-month club best seller, \\"A Jew's Jesus\\" which is excerpted in paraphrase through the first book and mentioned often in the second.Captain Henry's erratic wandering son Bryan has quit his graduate studies in Italy and taken up residence with the eminent Dr. Jastrow as a research assistant of sorts. Jastrow is working on a book about the Emperor Constantine. While he claims no special relationship with her, it is evident from his correspondence that he is in the thrall of niece Natalie. This serves as the beginning pivot and secondary focus of both volumes. The Jastrow's (later Natalie Henry) become \\"stuck\\" in fascist Italy and go through a Homeric ordeal that ultimately carries them through various occupied areas of Europe, ending in Auschwitz.As I've said, the books are wonderfully crafted and a delight to read, but the story is secondary. Wouk uses the Jastrows to personify the holocaust. Their story accounts for over a third of the second book. At the same time, he offers an overview of the holocaust events, partially through the employment of another Jastrow, Aaron's cousin Berel. Berel stayed in the \\"old country\\"--Poland--with the rest of the clan after Aaron's father relocated his branch of the family in America.Berel is the Jewish superman. Seeing everything, doing everything and surviving everything. He takes his family eastward from the Nazi's during the fall of Poland, then re-emerges in Russia and, always in danger of capture, consistently avoids it until he joins the Russian army, where he is captured. Eventually (I've run the two books together here.) he is part of a work group of prisoners that digs up previously mass-murdered Jews and burns them.) He offers a cacaphony of sordid detail.Ironically, what is most admirable about these books is Wouk's deceit. Who would buy books advertised as a detailed reminiscence of the holocaust with heart-rending narratives of victims and survivors? Primarily, that's what this book is. The Holocaust (I don't like to NOT capitalize it.)is arguably the most important story that could be told. (The only possible rivals in importance being the book of Genesis and the Passion of Jesus Christ.) It's setting is WWII, which continues to attract enormous enthusiastic audiences. The triumph of good over ultimate evil: the risk of a war that threatened to end civilization--what a yarn! Millions would want (did)to read it.And just after you become worried about the future of truth, justice and the American way, Wouk lowers the boom on you. BAM! You are transported to the midst of the Holocaust. You see men of great personal presence forced to represent themselves as \\"filthy Jews\\". You struggle with them, first for simple survival, but then for hope and finally, dignity. You are overwhelmed by the monstrous evil that conceived of this plot told in graphic detail, and finally you are tormented by the individual fates of characters you've come to love and admire at the hands of the Wagnerian horde. At these moments, World War II is all but forgotten."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"If you read \\"Winds of War\\" by Herman Wouk, you must read \\"War and Remembrance\\" because it tells the rest of the story. I have no doubt that they were originally conceived as a single voluminous tome, but, thankfully, Wouk's editor must have talked him into two volumes. A single book consisting of both volumes would have been imposing, to say the least.On the other hand, if you did not read \\"Winds of War\\", then it would be like coming in at the middle of a movie if you read \\"War and Remembrance\\" first. You would have to sit through intermission, buy more popcorn and then sit through a drama that would be merely filling-in-the-blanks, as it were.Wouk masterfully penned both volumes, and I can not help but feel that the old writer, in the story, was really a self-portrait by Wouk. This is great historical fiction that does not seem like fiction, but seems as if (and it is, actually) based on real WWII characters. Buy it! You'll like it even if you are not a WWII buff. It has all the elements of gret drama, behind the scenes war drama, romance, suspense, great character development and actual naval combat that, even in itself, Wouk manages to make into suspense."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"There may be Spoilers herein. I don't think so though.I reviewed \\"The Winds of War\\" recently and had some trouble with it. I had trouble because it was half a book, even with its titanic length. I will have no such problem here however. I have some things to say about this book.In the Forward to this book Herman Wouk informs us that we don't HAVE to read \\"The Winds of War\\" but can simply start reading this book. I respect the author but NOOOO! YOU CAN'T! It can't be done that way. If you do you will be reading the middle of a story. You won't know the main characters of the book, you won't know how they got to be where they are and you won't ultimately care. Just read the first one first and then keep going. Those worried about length restrictions will be amazed how quickly this book (as the one before it) moves along.The plot of \\"War and Remembrance\\" pretty much picks up the story after Pearl Harbor with the Henry Family in the process of pulling itself apart, much like the world it is written in. Natalie Henry and Aaron Jastrow are still trapped in Europe and Byron is working like Hell to get them out, especially now that there is a baby involved. This storyline is the one that is hurt the most by reading ONLY this book and not its prequel.In general the story of this book has three basic storylines that are constantly Vying for attention. First is the Holocaust thread. It should be said that here I was hurt by having seen the miniseries first because the very filming of those scenes were historical. The Holocaust thread basically follows Natalie and her Uncle Aaron as they try to get out of Europe with Byron and Natalie's son intact.The second major story thread is that of Byron and his coming of age as a submariner while trying to get Natalie out any time it looks like he can. This involves him worrying a lot and finding distraction in fighting the war. This bit has a lot of unwashed men fighting together. Very Manly.The third storyline is about the rest of the Henry Family. It's that simple, the rest of the family mostly spend time reacting to war's trials and losses by having affairs or not having affairs but in the end it is how these people deal with the war that will inevitably be remembered and written into our history.Speaking of history, Von Roon is still writing his history from prison and actually, in one of my favorite bits from this thread, makes a very powerful case that Roosevelt opportunistically used World War II to achieve global domination. In these days that accusation is easier to believe than previously.Now for a little nit I inevitable have to pick. Just a small thing.I once read a book that was essentially a timeline of history by Isaac Asimov. Asimov's book went up to 1945 and then there was an afterword stating that there was such a paradigm shift in the history of HUMANITY that it would take a book the same size as the one he had written in order to cover the time between 1945 and when the book was written, which was in the 70's or 80's.Think about what that means! Especially if you are young or don't like history. Here's a quick lesson: In 1939 the world (meaning the human world) BROKE ITSELF!!! If you are alive then you were affected by this. Countries rose and fell! Nazis burned and tortured Jews in order to redistribute wealth! A single heroic man kept his country from falling with nothing but the sound of his VOICE! Of course all of this was punctuated by the giant EXCLAMATION POINT that was the ATOMIC BOMB!!!! An event which the still hasn't even begun to come to grips with. We remember these events two ways: We remember the Holocaust and Hiroshima for their destruction but we also remember this as \\"The last good war\\". There was a chivalrous atmosphere about our memory of this war which makes it a time to remember. I think both viewpoints probably exist side by side.With all this coming from the text I was seriously annoyed that the A-bomb gets one line of dialogue in the whole book. That really...REALLY bothers me. I understand that the A-Bomb may be part of the NEXT big story but it still bothers me.In conclusion: Read this book! Expect a good book but a very intimate ending."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Gee, I just finished the \\"Winds of War\\" and was ready to launch into \\"War & Remembrance\\" but Amazon has pulled the title, likely for needed editing as others have noted.

The historical sequence, the actions of world leaders, and the events of the war are detailed and factual, but the main characters and their places in those events are fictional. It's a brilliant device to bring the history we think we know to life, and grounds momentous events in the humanity of individuals trying to cope with the total upheaval of a worldwide conflict and the unimaginable horror of events like the rise of Hitler, the Pearl Harbor attack, the Atomic Bomb, and the Holocaust.The Audible production is truly a masterful interpretation of a masterwork, primarily due to the monumental work of Kevin Pariseau. He handles a huge cast of characters, with a m&eacute;lange of accents - Russian, British, German, Yiddish, Italian, French, several American dialects, and more - with convincing ease, but it was the singing as multiple characters that put the icing on it for me. When Udom sang to the crowd at Theresienstadt before being sent off on the train to Auschwitz, it tore my heart out.I read these books to gain a deeper grasp of my father's generation, of the sacrifices they made, and of the events that shaped their world view. I came away with so much more than that. My faith in humanity was restored.War and Remembrance"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"The story and writing are outstanding. I read this many years ago and it's a good thing I knew it was worthwhile: the Kindle version is absolutely horrendous for the typos, poor formatting and general lack of proofreading. This was so distracting, I put the book down many times due to the frustration. Herman Wouk's excellent story of World War II deserves better. As do those of us who bought it."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This book is a very engrossing and readable novel -- one identifies with and grows very interested in the charactors. In spite of being fiction, in that the main characters and the events in their lives are fictional, it provides an excellent factual overview of the world events of World War II. In particular, it gives an excellent picture of life during the war in the US, England, and Russia, and to some degree the rest of Europe, Hawaii and the Pacific, and the Middle East. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I found this book gripping and a real page turner. Again, Herman Wouk did not dissapoint. I read Winds of War several years ago and never did get around to reading this one until now. I am so glad I ordered it. My only complaint is not with the book but the multitude of typos and spelling errors in the Kindle form. That seems to be an ongoing issue with most Kindle purchases I have made."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"You're in for a long haul but it's well worth it. I take on at least one epic every winter and picked \\"Winds of War\\" and it's sequel \\"War and Remembrance\\" this year. I love historical fiction and these two books are some of the best. You'll learn about WWII and still be able to wrap yourself around the characters whose family soon becomes a part of your life. There's intrigue & suspense, there's action & very personal relationships as well and then there are the facts of WWII that will have you looking online for more information. These are powerful novels that really draw you in; so much so that after I read \\"Winds of War\\" I was going to take a break and read something else between it and \\"War and Remembrance\\" but as I read the \\"other\\" book I kept wondering about what happens to these characters Wouk created. So I quit the \\"break\\" book and got right back on \\"War and Remembrance.\\" I'm very glad I did. Both novels are such page turners that it's darn near impossible not to want more. The two combined are close to two thousand pages but they read like a novel of several hundred. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I agree with everyone who raves about the book. I've read it several times over the years and even bought the video tapes. An irritant with the Kindle edition is the extremly poor quality proofreading/ I found enough mistakes in punctuation and spelling such that it became a distraction. I'm not talking about two or three errors in the book but a very large number--Herman Wouk would be ashamed. Come on Amazon--it's the Battle of Midway, not the Battle of Midman."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"I appreciated the historical information and the presentation of characters in the novel to bring the story which needed to be told.

The DVD series was excellent and was enhanced by the two books."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Typical Wouk novel but read Winds of War first. The history is excellent but the character development will remain with you forever. You are emerged in WW II."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good."},{"Title":"War and remembrance","review":"This title, like it's predecessor, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; is full of so many ridiculous situations, as to border on the absurd.To think of a person in the main characters position, to be in these situation, is ridiculous fiction.

Pug, the omnipresent, clarevoyent, far-seeing, all knowing naval Captain, giving advice to world leaders who figuretively slap their foreheads while saying, &quot;Pug, you're so right, why didn't I think of that ? &quot;.........yeah, right.Also amusing is how he and his family always have sumptious meals of steak, seafood, fine wines, etc., during wartime shortages and rationing.Both books are full of such contradictions, over and over and over......Both books are amusing entertainment, though in a very shallow way, but to take them serious, is a mistake."},{"Title":"THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION VOLUME 2","review":"This is a book you just read and try to understand.

It is imperative to get the audio to go along with it! Overall, this is one of the best ways to learn if you are dedicated and self-disciplined.Cons:It was designed to teach American diplomats going to a German-speaking country, so the level of formality is above what most of us would ever use. It assumes all the working roles are by males. It was made some 40 years ago, so some of the language is outdated and the technology since then is not included (computers, cell phones, etc). It instead talks about placing a long-distance telephone call, etc. There are a lot of typos.Pros: Extremely comprehensive, it aims to teach real, spoken German, and succeeds. This is not \\"German light for Americans,\\" this is German as spoken by native German speakers. It strives to show the learner the relationship between English and German grammatical forms, such as modal verbs, comparatives, etc, which is extremely helpful and makes German seem \\"not foreign.\\"Level 2 is units 13-24. Each unit begins with a series of conversations. New vocabulary is introduced along with the conversation. You are intended to listen to it and orally produce it before looking at the text. The conversations are then repeated (on the audio) at normal conversational speed. Then come a series of drills which increase in complexity and difficulty. These also are intended to be done entirely audio/oral. The book is to look at later if you can't understand. The first drills are substitution, the next are variation, then vocabulary (which drills around 12 new vocab words or phrases in context of making sentences out of them), then unrecorded translation drills and response drills followed by a short narrative.If you work at it 2 hours a day, a unit will take around 2 weeks.YOU MUST HAVE THE AUDIO. The audio has time for you to formulate your response to each drill, then the native speaker gives the correct response.If you are serious about learning German, this is for you. If you're just going on a short vacation, this is probably way more than you want or need."},{"Title":"21st Century Dictionary of Quotations (21st Century Reference)","review":"If all you want is quotes, you will enjoy this book.

It also gives a brief description of each of the authors which is highly convenient if you'd like to find more books or qoutes by that author. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great source of familiar and highly amusing quotations."},{"Title":"21st Century Dictionary of Quotations (21st Century Reference)","review":"Given that this is a paperback, it's rather ridiculous and unfair for it to be denigrated for not being some scholarly in-depth all-encompassing encyclopedia. It's meant to be a handy guide to a lot of quotations, some long, some short, some well-known, some not so well-known, on 880 different categories. And if one doesn't find what s/he is looking for in any given category, it refers the reader to the numbers of similar concepts, such as \\"Contempt (also see concepts 327 [emotions], 689 [rudeness], 698 [sarcasm], 734 [shame]).\\" I've gotten an incredible amount of use out of it for almost ten years now. The only complaints I do have about it are, first, that quite a few of the people listed in the index in the back have since passed on, and I'm not just talking about those who died after the publication year of 1993. I've had to write in their death years by hand. For example, Don Herold, who was born in 1889, has a blank space in the parenthesis, giving the impression he was still alive then, when he actually died in 1966! The editors really should have done a little more homework on that front. And while this is only a paperback reference book, I still wish the quotes had been given some context, like if they came from a song or the speech of a character in a book or movie instead of just something the person wrote or said in real time, or if the person were referring to something in particular and not just making some deep philosophical statement off the cuff. After all, we all know that if you take something out of context, you can interpret it to mean something that the writer or speaker never intended at all, such as the famous George Santayana line, \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\\" which was actually referring to the danger of repeating historical cycles, and not some kind of warning to learn from things like wars or genocides. But overall, those who are just looking for a good quote to use in a paper or speech or to add to a list of quotes or whatnot aren't going to care that this reference guide isn't as deep as a more encyclopedic reference."},{"Title":"21st Century Dictionary of Quotations (21st Century Reference)","review":"This is not a true reference book, and should not be confused for one.

Having read Prayer of Jabez a while back, a lot of the more pointed jabs elicited guffaws from me. The satire really is good. But what I really liked about this book - particularly in contrast with Nathan Wilson's parody, Right Behind - is that Mr. Jones really showed quite powerfully exactly what was wrong with Wilkinson's position, and I thought he offered a brief but substantial explanation throughout of better ways to view things. He wasn't just making fun of the book; he was also offering a replacement.So in short: good parody, but the critique of modern evangelicalism was the real gem. Gives a short, concise summary of some of the problems in the church today, and offers a glimpse of some of the solutions. Swell book."},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"I bought this book on Friday (it's Monday) and received it today. I read it in about 20 minutes, and my neck hurt because I was laughing so hard. The author is RIGHT ON about the Prayer of Jabez and all its reprocussions. I especially loved the bit about gnosticism.If you're evangelical and want all the problems with Jabez pointed out to you (e.g. you want to know the truth), purcahse this book."},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"This was refreshing. I thought the original book assumed a lot that isn't necessarily true, even abusing some people's desire for earnest faith, and this book underscored that. The author boils it down to &quot;immaturity&quot;, which is both funny and true.Not to be taken too seriously, of course - they do warn the reader of this on the back cover: &quot;This is a parody, for Pete's sake!&quot; - and I enjoyed it. They refer too much to &quot;Right Behind&quot; (the sister parody book), so it's kind of over the top. And they don't nail every obvious theological aspect that I had thought important. But the section lampooning the &quot;airplane&quot; personal example had some very pointed thoughts about how we view life and other people, which I found unexpectedly worth the whole book. Worth your three bucks!"},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"The mantra takes a good and needed poke at the \\"prayer\\".

In my opinion, &quot;The Mantra of Jabez&quot; is not quite as successful as &quot;Right Behind&quot;, which is not to say it's bad. For one thing, it's probably easier to parody a work of fiction than it is to parody what basically is a sermon in book form. This book does make some good points, in a satirical fashion, of course. While the original seems to indicate that Jabez was more honorable than his brothers because of his prayer, this book makes the point that his prayer was answered because he was more honorable, a big difference. But the author seems to be intent upon imparting a certain strand of Reformed theology and ridicules everything that falls outside of its scope. Nevertheless, there are some weaknesses in the way &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot; is utilized, and this book is very faithful in pointing those out in a humorous fashion."},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"The title rings of the jubilation my brother had after reading the book. Yes, both he and I are convinced beyond a doubt that it's time to quit our jobs and wait for the second coming while teaching others sentences. All because of this wonderful little book.Part of our problem was that we weren't blessed with the shallow arminian upbringing that inspires fit bodies and flabby minds. Instead, we grew up orthodox, then as teens found ourselves attracted to reformed thinking. Fortunately, this book has turned the table on God, giving us the formula to compel Him to give us the gifts He wanted us to have in the first place.The only thing that could have made this parody even funnier was to incorporate some infomercial-type-techniques. Oh well, you can't have everything. Oh wait, what am I saying, I suppose I could if I could just remember how that mantra goes.Now the only thing left to do is to convince our Lord to let my brother and I to sit at the right and left hand when we get to His Kingdom."},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"The good folks at Credenda/Agenda, a journal of Reformed theology and opinion, have issued a line of parodies skewering various forms of silliness that have overtaken the Evangelical Protestant landscape. Any who have read Credenda/Agenda know it is sometimes caustic, usually challenging, and always Calvinist. This series shows they can also be extremely funny - shattering the common image of Reformed folk as people whom God has predestined to be humorless.Douglas M. Jones' The Mantra of Jabez is a biting and at times almost cruel parody of the \\"name-it-and-claim-it\\" theology plaguing much of Evangelicalism and especially prevalent in the hoopla surrounding Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez. The concern for earthly comforts, the disdain for the spiritual value of suffering, and the reliance on \\"quick fixes\\" that seem to range fromt the formulaic to the superstitious all are skewered as Jones aims at the pinnacle of pop Evangelical \\"devotions\\".The fact that a relatively obscure Scriptural passage concerning a relatively obsure individuak could be taken completely out of context and transformed into a \\"sure fire\\" prayer to turn one's life around demonstrates the increasing banality of the Evangelical landscape. The difficulty in sustaining a parody is that the original is so bland as to make satire difficult. Great parody requires either distinguishable characteristics or an \\"over the top\\" execution to highlight and lampoon. The Prayer of Jabez is so horribly bland that it is little more than a Christianized infomercial. Jones does the best he can do given such bland material and to his credit manages more than a few laughs.Although not as knockdown funny as one might hope, The Mantra of Jabez is still a worthwhile read. If nothing else, it manages to point out the increasing triviality rampant in American Evangelicalism. The problem is will those who follow Wilkinson's book realize this one is a parody?"},{"Title":"The Mantra of Jabez: Break on Though to the Other Side","review":"Reading this parody is a way for me to keep sane, by laughing at the insanity of the other book.

Some will cry foul. Jones's insightful humor can be biting but it's fair--and funny. I laughed hard. I thought hard.Wilkinson would have us follow the yellow-brick-road to the Wizard of Oz.

However, so is the smarmy sarcasm of this author in response to Wilkinson's errors. Clearly from scripture we are to confront false teaching but it is to always be tempered by the fruit of the Spirit. Sarcasm is not listed in my Bible as part of the fruit of the spirit. Straightforward apologetics is certainly called for in the face of false teaching but to build a ministry around sarcastic parody is quite frankly not Christlike.

Excellant!"},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"The text, 'A History of the Church in England', by J.R.H. Moorman, is one of the important works of Anglican history of this generation. There aren't many one-volume treatments of the whole of Anglican history; while Anglicans as a rule give a good amount of attention and authority to history (the second of the three pillars of Anglicanism - Scripture, Tradition, and Reason - has much to do with history), it is surprising perhaps that this book is rare in nature.As Moorman writes in the preface to the first edition, 'It is notoriously difficult to pour a gallon of water into a pint pot.' Moorman doesn't simply treat the period of time from Henry VIII to the present, a five-hundred year span that is also difficult to encompass in a single volume; he examines the history of the church IN England from the earliest Christian presence to the present time. Perhaps this explains the title more fully - this is not so much a history of the institution of the Church of England, but rather an exploration of the church as it continues from its earliest times to its current expression.Moorman concedes that his is not an unbiased reporter - indeed, such a creature is unlikely to be found, particularly among those for whom English and England are native aspects. Moorman states that 'impartial history would be very dull', and thus makes no such pretension. He is one who does not see the Church of England as being created by Henry VIII, but rather sees the church in England (of which the Church of England is the primary institutional successor) as a continuous entity.Moorman's text is an interesting read, but a bit dry by the standards of today's historical writing. I can tell by comparison to other works of the 1950s and 1960s (when the principal text was assembled) that this would have been an innovation in terms of accessibility and resistance to stodgy history (the kind that comes in dusty tomes residing on library shelves, doomed to never be read), but today reads as being a bit archaic at times. As every history is necessarily selective, this one suffers a time or two in the kinds of details left out, but generally hits all of the major events and issues of the development of Anglicanism in England, particularly from the Elizabethan time forward to the early part of the twentieth century.One of the flaws of the book is that it does not take into account the increasingly global nature of the Anglican Communion over time. Moorman treats this only briefly in a few sections (four pages in one chapter, six pages in another). Moorman also only briefly touches on intercommunion and ecumenical actions, which are increasingly important in today's society (when he writes about other churches, it is overwhelmingly about the Roman Catholic church that he is writing).However, Moorman is an excellent text for the topic its focus. It is well documented (nearly 800 other works are referenced here), has an excellent index (24 pages of small print), and a good table of contents with chapter annotations.This is a must-read text for any Anglican, or any student of the history and culture of England."},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"I had to read the second half of this book for a class assignment. I found it so helpful, understandable, and enjoyable that I went back and read the first half as well, even though I could not spare the time.This is an excellent summary of the development of the Church and much of the culture on the island we now know as England from Roman times to the 20th century."},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"This is the best book I have found on the history of the English Reformation and of the Church of England through the middle of the 20th C. I have read it twice and still refer to it often. It's definitely worth owning if you have any interest in this area."},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"John Moorman has written an excellent historical introduction to Anglicanism (or, more properly, the Church in England). Along with Neill's \\"Anglicanism,\\" Moorman's book is one of the best places for the student of Anglicanism to begin his studies.There are 2 main differences between Moorman's book and Neill's \\"Anglicanism\\". First, Moorman's emphasis is only on the Church in England, while Neill gives some attention to worldwide Anglicanism. Second, while Neill begins with the Reformation, Moorman begins with the Church in England from the first centuries until 1966.By dealing with the entire history of the Church in England, Moorman gives an invaluable introduction not only to the Church of England but also to Anglicanism. By dividing his book up into 22 historical units, Moorman provides an excellent frame on which the student of Anglicanism can build his understanding. Moorman also subdivides each of his 22 sections into approximately 5 sections, so that it's always easy to see where you are in history. For each period Moorman also makes reference to what he considers the most useful works he's consulted, for which the reader ought to be grateful.Moorman writes in a clear, narrative style, and the fact that he covers so much territory in one volume makes it possible for the reader to digest the most important aspects of each historical period, as well as to gain a vision for the whole. Moorman covers an enormous amount of material yet does it so gracefully that the reader never feels breathless or rushed. Through it all, Moorman comes across as unbiased and an accurate historian.I highly recommend this work, which is divided up into the following 22 Sections:I. The Church in Britain Before 597II. The Conversion of England (597-664)III. Consolidation and Advance (664-793)IV. Chaos and Reconstruction (793-988)V. The Eve of the Conquest (988-1066)VI. England Under the Normans (1066-1109)VII. The Struggle for Power (1109-1216)VIII. The Thirteenth Century (1212-1307)IX. The Age of Wyclif (1307-1400)X. The Close of the Middle Ages (1400-1509)XI. Henry VIII (1509-1547)XII. Action and Reaction (1547-1558)XIII. Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603)XIV. The Early Stuarts (1603-1649)XV. Commonwealth, Restoration and Revolution (1649-1702)XVI. The Early Eighteenth Century (1702-1738)XVII. The Age of Wesley (1738-1791)XVIII. From Wesley to Keble (1791-1833)XIX. The Oxford Movement and After (1833-1854)XX. The Mid- Victorians (1854-1882)XXI.

He did a fair job of portraying the Edwardian Reformation and the age of Elizabeth and the Evangelical revivals of the 1700s. He also demonstrated sympathy for the Broad Churchmen and the role of reason and the challenges of modern science to a literal reading of Genesis. He was less sympathetic to the Oxford Movement and the efforts to re-catholicize the English Church, but not so much that an Anglo-Catholic reader would be overly offended.

I find this to actually be a plus, as the secular side of things could probably double or triple the length of the book.

A pleasure to read.John A Simpson"},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"The book is only 459 pages, so it obviously cannot go into a lot of detail in covering almost 2000 years of history. The author has, however, done a pretty good job of providing a good overview of the entire history along with more extensive details for those periods when events of significance were happening -- either in England or on the Continent -- that affected the church and the direction it eventually would take in getting to where is is today. Likewise, the author has provided significant information of the men behind those events -- their backgrounds and their reasoning for what they believed and for what they did."},{"Title":"A History of the Church in England","review":"Moorman has made the story of the church in England an interesting and intriguing read in addition to writing an informative history. He begins in the begining with the initial arrival of Christianity to the British Islands. These chapters are perhaps the most amazing, as we see early Christians courageous and sacrificial in their mission of sharing the gospel.Moorman moves through the ages discussing the changes in the religious landscape and the political landscape. This is a pattern he follows throughout the book, as he addresses the changes in politics that affect or are due to religion. He provides important details at all stages of the history and highlights all of the key figures.I think his explanations of the English Reformation and the development of the Church of England are exceptionally well done and simple. He provides writing on the different interests that led to the Church of England's break with Rome and all of the tensions between interested parties in the formation of Anglicanism.He writes with enthusiam and an apparent passion for the Church of England and its history. The book is very well balanced covering all the time periods with as much writing as is needed. This is a book that would be good for readers who have little familiarity with the subject or for readers who hope to enhance their already adequate knowledge of the church in England."},{"Title":"Training manual for sight without eyes through mind sight and perception","review":"This chap literally taught people to see without using their eyes. He died in the late 80's, and this seems to be the first 'real' publication. I've just finished reading the book, which is fascinating and inspiring.The publisher is seemingly a small concern based in the U.S.A which specialises in 'survivalist' literature.That this house would publish this book is curious, and aghast weirdness ensues when the reader discovers that there is around one spelling mistake and another typo in every paragraph of the book, making it an exercise in tolerance to read.This could have been so easily fixed- the process is called 'proofing' - but no, it went to print as a crappy, 'who-cares anyway?' draft.If you are fascinated by the possibility and promise of mind sight, you'd better get this book now, as it will certainly be out of print soon. It contains enough exercises and information to start work yourself.Mr Hopkins was obviously a man of integrity and character, who achieved amazing success teaching expanded potentials of the mind. That this is the first review speaks loudly that the world is too mesmerised by their television and blackberry to care. As for the publisher? You care, so why didn't you proof the book?!A sadly neglected legacy of this man, but at least it's here. Now let's do something with the knowledge."},{"Title":"Carrier War (Epic of Flight)","review":"This book is a good over all read into Carrier War In WW2. It shows both sides.

Thanks, Sincerely, Rick L."},{"Title":"Programming Perl - Quick Reference Guide","review":"The other Perl books are great, but frankly I use this little book more than any other when I need reminders on coding Perl. This is the one I lock up at night!"},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I have spent a great deal of time browsing through a number of VB.Net books in a couple of my local bookstores. (Both have extensive technical book sections). This book caught my eye and I decided to browse through it. First off, I must say that in the bookstore I was &quot;wowed&quot; by quality of the content. After I got it home and started implementing the examples in the chapters, I can definitively say that this book is excellent.My goal in my book search was to find a book that explained the VB.Net language as it pertained to the VB.Net development environment. I wanted a book that actually &quot;showed&quot; me how to navigate around the IDE while explaining nontrivial VB.Net concepts and examples, and discussing the language so that I would be able to write some programs after finishing it.Some of the earlier chapters are geared to a beginning programmer (somewhat like me and even less so), yet the authors branch off and talk about relevant topics without falling off a limb. For example, in chapter 2 - &quot;Writing Software&quot;, the authors discuss data types and give numerous examples of accessing the different properties of each. When they get the the Boolean datatype, they actually go into a juicy amount of detail about binary representations and even discuss binary math. Its just a few pages in length but it is darn appropriate and gives a nice overview into the topic at hand. However, they keep it moving and move on to the next appropriate topic with their usual clarity in writing.I am now focusing on their chapter on &quot;Building Objects&quot; - chapter 4. I have to say that this chapter offers the clearest examples of classes that I have seen. Far too often I have read about classes in other books and have seen weird examples that had little to do with real life...often requiring a &quot;suspension of reality&quot; on behalf of the reader such that the reader was forced to make the leap from theory to reality. This book, on the other hand, shows me how to construct an object that I can actually relate to.So far I have not found any errors, although they do list some (minor) errata in the Wrox website. But the fact that Wrox even *has* a comprehensive website proactively listing potential errata is yet another reason I am glad I bought this book from this publisher. By the way, I found their website and located the section related to this book in about 12 seconds. The quality is in the details, and obviously somebody at Wrox actually cared about the ease of finding information about their published material.Like I said I am only on chapter 4, yet I have done a lot of &quot;skimming&quot; ahead and I eagerly await the topics in later chapters where I will learn how to build little Windows applications, make my own menus, handle errors, connect to a database, etc. Basically *all* the things I want to learn how to do. (Are they mind readers?)Excellent work."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book is for beginner programmers who have chosen Visual Basic .NET as their first programming language. It is also intended for programmers experienced in another programming language, but who are new to Windows programming.The book begins with step by step instructions on how to install Visual Basic .NET. Next, there is a brief introduction on how to write Visual Basic .NET code, and a description of what the .NET framework is. The next chapter teaches how to control the flow of applications using loops and branching structures. You will then learn how to create windows, screens, and how to add menus to your applications.Visual Basic .NET is the first version of Visual Basic to provide full object oriented capabilities, making it among the most powerful windows development tools. The book teaches you what object oriented programming is and how to use it in your applications.Chapter 15 and 16 introduce database access with Visual Basic .NET. You will learn what a database is, how to write simple SQL statements, and how to use ADO.NET to access Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access databases. The final three chapters show how to create applications for the web using web forms, XML, and web services such as SOAP, &quot;Simple Object Access Protocol&quot;.Like all Wrox Press beginner programming books, this book is written in a clear and easy to learn manner. Each chapter contains plenty of sample code examples and an end of chapter test.If you are new to programming, or new to Windows programming, &quot;Beginning Visual Basic .NET&quot; is an excellent first step in aquiring the knowledge needed to develop Windows applications."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am a Systems and Network Administrator who used Visual Basic 6.0 to automate many of the redundant tasks typical of this environment. I don't claim to be a &quot;developer&quot; but have been developing tools for a long time. I typically do not like WROX books but after sitting down at my local bookstore and plowing through 20 books on VB.NET, this one stood out. It has good examples that you can follow, it assumes you have basic programming/development skills and it is well written. If you are a developer by occupation this is probably not the book for you. For those of us who do not release our code to production environments this book has served me well by not being incredibly basic nor losing me in advanced topics."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am a new programmer and would NOT recommend this book to someone else who's new. Wrox presents the intangible before the tangible and introduces concepts within concepts without explanation. An example of how the intangible is presented before the tangible is in chapter 4 where they introduce objects, classes, properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism and namespaces(whew), but it's not until chapter 7 that they explain how to put a button on a form. Seriously out of order in my opinion. An example of how concepts are brought up without explanation all throughout the first 8 chapters (all I could stand) is how various code methods are used without referencing the big picture. What are other methods in the same class? Could some of the most common ones be listed in a glossary? I know there are a lot of them and they're somewhere in the MSDN library, but a beginning point of reference would have been nice.This was such a frustrating book that I nearly gave up on learning programming all together. I decided to give it another try and can recommend two books that present everything in a clear and logical manner. Visual Basic .NET by the \`In Easy Steps' people is the first. It's light, clear and offers a quick overview with lots of pictures. It isn't detailed, but it's not designed to be. I don't think you can buy these books through Amazon. This excellent series is available at Barnes and Noble. For greater detail I highly recommend Microsoft's Visual Basic .NET Step by Step. The book is true to name, meaning it establishes a building block approach and takes you through everything step by step. Its thoroughness is a joy. Michael Halverson understands the learning process and has a good sense of humor too. A Microsoft product with a sense of humor? Yes. It solved all my frustrations brought on by Wrox and made learning easy and fun."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book has left me with more questions than answers. I'm new to OOP and this book certainly has not helped. The book said it was for \\"Beginning programmers\\" but after chapter 3 it assumes you magically know OOP concepts. It left me flipping around the book, searching for definitions.I've purchased other Wrox books before and have been pleased in general. For some reason Wrox dropped the ball on this one. It's as if the book was written by three authors at different times and then compiled into one book, without regard for what you have or haven't already learned in previous chapters.I wish there were a rosetta stone for new beginners to make the bridge to .Net. Until then I'll be searching for a better VB.Net book."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I bought this book a few days ago and due to other commitments I have only read up to chapter 4. During this reading, I wrote out every example in the book. To my surprise, not only did every example work, but I managed to remember so much more than I thought I would. I even went as far as to debug a friends application, with no assistance from any book. My total reading time thus far for ANY .NET book has been 3 days...and my only source of reading has been this book, and the online classes reference from VB Studio.NET.I particularly like the fact that the book presents an idea, steps through the code and then details each section of code - what it does, how it works etc. This was very useful in understanding why things are structured the way they are.I might also add that I have never programmed VB in any way before, making me a total newbie at this (my only other programming language is a little bit of Perl). Even if the other chapters turn out to be rubbish (which I very much doubt), then I would still say, this has been well worth the money. I have learnt (and retained) that much.I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Go buy it."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I purchased this book 3 days ago and because of other commitments I have only read as far as Chapter 4. However in that short space of time, I did the right thing by myself and wrote every example out in the book so far (nothing beats learning by doing, at least as far as I am concerned). I must admit, having gone from a flat 0 in VB experience to now writing basic programs by myself without referring to any book or online help.Even if the remainder of the book turns out to be [weak]), the info I have learnt already has made me very happy with the purchase.I have not seen one error yet, everything works as shown and is explained so anyone can understand it.If you are new to VB.Net or programming at all, buy this book. It is without doubt the best book I have ever seen on the subject of programming. This is my first Wrox book and it probably will not be the last if this is the quality of their products. This book Wrox! :)"},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I have read many Books on the topic of Visual Basic, this one being my first foray into VB.Net. This book contains the best compilation of exercises I have seen in a beginner's book. The explanations are thorough and clearly explained. In addition, the authors appear to go to great lengths to expose the reader to a wide variety of functions throughout the lessons. I will admit that the editing staff for this book might benefit from taking an English class or two, as some of the grammar in the book is painful to read. However, in spite of the ineptitude of the editing staff I think you will be hard pressed to find a better resource for learning VB.Net. This is a how to manual, not a literary work of art. While I have noticed the poor editing, it is not substantial enough to make me want to throw the book across the room (which I have done with some books in the past). I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs to get their feet wet with VB.Net."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I was trying to find a book that would extend my VB6 capabilities to VB.NET especially that the language has completely changed. After surfing the net in general and Amazon in particular the title of the book attracted me. I said WoW, now its time to learn VB.NET.Actually going through this book enriched my knowledge a lot, i was not only able to tranfere most of my programs (Civil Engineering) but i extended them a lot.This book gives a very clear view of classes and i consider this the best part of this book.I encourage you to buy it although it is not really made for those who are totally new to programming. It requires a little bit of experience, a good understanding of VB6 will help a lot."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"If you are a beginner to VB.NET or even a beginner to programming and are interested in creating a software application, this book will give you all the information you need to get started on this endeavor. By the time you reach the end of the book, you may have to supplement your knowledge of VB.NET by reading a few other books depending on the nature of the software application you are creating. But otherwise, if you want to buy just ONE book and learn VB.NET in under 10 days (enough to create Version 1 of your software application), this is the book for you.Why is it such a great book for beginners? It explains all the necessary concepts in great detail and in a simple fashion. No prior programming experience is assumed and the authors do a terrific job of explaining all the concepts and use good examples. The sample code can be downloaded from the publisher's website and there is an excellent discussion group led by the authors and other industry experts to answer any questions you may have on VB.NET.The book covers the following main topics - an introduction chapter, VB.NET development tool, basics of writing software, how to control the program flow, intro on objects, the .NET framework, how to build windows desktop applications, how to build web applications, how to access databases, how to access other applications using your custom application, etc.Of course, if the application you are building is a complex one, this book is NOT sufficient. You need to supplement the knowledge gained through this book with the knowledge from a variety of other books. This is the unfortunate thing with the .NET technology as it stands right now. The situation is definitely improving but it's not there yet in terms of easy explanations on how to manage the development of complex software.What struck me most about this book was the ease with which practically anyone with above average reading and computer skills can learn how to use this powerful technology. The explanations were very clear leaving almost no doubts on how to use VB.NET for developing software applications. I believe that you can get through each chapter in 1-3 hours and if you are determined to learn VB.NET in 10 days, I believe you can do it with the help of this book. You would have to spend 10 hours a day but you would get through this book by the end of the 10 days. This might be the reason why the sales rank of this book on Amazon has gone up so rapidly over the last few months.Recommended process for learning VB.NET using this book - read the book cover to cover without skipping any chapters. You can work through all the examples in each chapter or skip them if you feel comfortable that you understood what the authors are trying to convey. These chapters are organized the way they are for a very good reason, to help you learn VB.NET in the shortest amount of time and hence the recommendation NOT to skip any chapters in this book. They all cover very important topics especially for beginners. If you have any amount of programming experience - .NET in particular, you may find it extremely difficult to keep your focus while reading this book as it is too basic and covers too much material that is aimed at teaching how to program. But for beginners, this book is a blessing.

The authors take little for granted in your programming background.The size of the book partially reflects the many diagrams offered. Since these can be very useful and reassuring to a new programmer, it is a good thing that the authors are so liberal in furnishing them.

Most of the material is covered in a superficial, rushed manner. These guys were obviously more interested in getting their faces on the book cover than teaching. If you're coming from VB5 or VB6 you'd expect to see an introductory book to VB.Net to contain at least a list of VB5 functions and their VB.Net equivalents. For example: Substr(strA, 1,3) & strA.substring(1,3)The treatment of ADO.Net is pathetic. They explain how to bind data to form controls and the datagrid, but nowhere do they cover the basics you were used to in VB5 or VB6. Like, how do you reference individual fields in records, perform seeks or finds. No guidance as to how you do edits (rs.edit), adds (rs.addnew) or updates (rs.update) like you did in DAO. No direction on how to allow for the disconnected data model implemented in ADO.Net versus what it was in DAO. Like hey, how do you determine if the record you're updating was accessed and updated by another user before you completed your update. That seems pretty elementary stuff and its omission gives you an idea how carelessly and hurriedly this book was sent to print.Setting up the datagrid for data binding is done programmatically in the book instead of showing you how to do it through the IDE which is infinitely simpler and likely the most frequent way you'll do it. No discussion of how to manipulate data in the grid. Simple but essential stuff like how do you determine which cell/row was clicked. How do you get at the Cell's data, edit it and tell the user if there was an error or even simpler: How to set the Cell & Row headers or highlight the entire row if any cell was clicked.A word about support. Forget it. You're supposed to be able to download the source for the book. I tried multiple times at different times during the day/night. My download request kept timing-out after 100 retires.

It starts quite simply doing a little program where you type in your name and it comes back with a 'Hello' statement. From there it goes step by step to fairly complex programming using Microsoft's ADO.NET interface to talk with SQL Server.Microsoft has established this programming evironment where everything about the language, the editor you use to program it, the utility routines you call on, the database you access has to be Microsoft product.

I went through many of the same things as Trena Cole, and as scary as it is that other people go through that, it's comforting not to be alone in knowing what it feels like.

Trena Cole is the eldest of seven children borne by a poorly educated woman living in a shack on an alley in Small town America. Trena, from her earliest memory, was forced to be a wage earner, housekeeper and guardian for her siblings. Her Mother, Alcee, is a lazy and manipulative woman who exploits her children for money and emotionally abuses them for entertainment. Gordon, her stepfather who parades as the supreme king, enjoys the pain and control he wields within the confines of his house. All of the prominent players in Trena's existence are brought to life. Her schizophrenic Grandma alternately shows her love, yet subjects her to the harshest cruelest criticism possible. Aunts, uncles and cousins who witness the vicious cycle and do not raise a hand or voice to help. Raymond, the manager of a small restaurant at the end of the alley, takes advantage of a seven year old child with impunity. Well meaning school officials and child welfare agencies only succeed in creating a more desperate situation for the very children they attempt to assist. Trena's life was a montage of cruel and painful events meant to demean and deprive her and her siblings of a human face by the very forces that society expects to comfort, love and protect them, the nuclear family.CHARRED SOULS is a profoundly touching yet an \\"on edge of your seat\\" story. You find yourself pulling for this lost soul from the Introduction to the final page. This is not a light read, but a MUST read, especially for every professional whose life is dedicated to making children safe! All who read this book will be forever changed by it. This is a captivating and riveting story that makes you want to reach out and help this child!CHARRED SOULS is written in first person narrative and freely laced with dialogue exactly as Trena remembers it. The dialogue comes directly at you in waves and throws you into Trena's life exposing you to the reality of her \\"Hell on Earth.\\" The subject matter is difficult yet the struggle is compelling. This is a journey you won't want to miss.Though it is unusual, a personal \\"Thank you\\" goes to Ms. Cole for sharing her experience and allowing herself to show the wonderment of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"\\"Mommy, if I died, would you miss me? Would you cry?\\" She said: \\"What would I have to cry about? I'd have one less mouth ta feed!\\" Then she started laughing and said: \\"No, I'm just kiddin'. I probably would cry because I'd have ta come up with the money ta bury yer little worthless [self]. Course, I could always just stick a hame bone up yer [butt] and let the dogs drag yer off.\\"This statement was a part of everyday life for author Trena Cole and her six siblings. \`Charred Souls' is a book about child abuse in a way you wouldn't be able to imagine if you haven't been there yourself. Unfortunately, events like these take place in many families. Can you even call it a family? Trena Cole and her six siblings were the victims of their parents' twisted, sadistic and degrading game play. They seemed to be born to be abused verbally, emotional and physically.It took a lot of courage and strength for Trena Cole to tell her story and it is as heartbreaking as it is devastating. The story starts from the age of four years old where she is able to remember what happens. Trena had no childhood at her own as she was the oldest and forced to be a little mother of her siblings and saw herself caught in what she calls a \`babyfactory'. Her mother and stepfather were directly mean and sadistic and still are till this day. They forced recreational abuse on their children - simply for the fun of it.\`Charred Souls' describes the \`side effects' of mentally and physically abused children and that not every child reacts the same way. She tells us about the verbal abuse that were so damaging that she really believed that she was ugly, stupid and worthless and tried everything she could to be worth her parents. Her and her siblings also believed that all families lived like this, because they didn't know anything else. It describes how you cope with it later in life and that some scars will always be there.\`Charred souls' took me through more than one broken heart, many nightmares and many hateful thoughts. Abused children think it's their own fault that they are getting abused. They believe it's normal to live this way. They do everything they can to please their parents. They are divided between love and hate, and don't really know the difference. Also as adults they haven't found the right way of living and still believe it was their fault. If you've been abused, this book can help you in realizing that it was never your fault. That you were supposed to be loved. That you are not worthless and stupid. This book is also for those who are spouses, lovers, friends or acquaintances of abused people, to help understand what they are going through - both then and now."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I've read this book three times and it still makes a big impact on me. I love Trena Cole's writing style and I think she did a wonderful job with this book. I felt like I was there with her and her siblings as they suffered the abuse they were subjected to. The horrible things that were said to those children were not said in humor, the words screamed at those little ones were meant to hurt and emotionally cripple them. Those parents had an arsenal of weapons, but I think the words they used against their children caused more harm than the belts, switches and fists they used.I have to agree with the term 'Recreational Child Abuse' because it seemed like, to me, a good part of the abuse was just for fun on the parents' part. Child abuse is always tragic, but there is a difference in a parent losing their temper and one who abuses their child for laughs. It's no wonder the adults in that family never showed any remorse for what they did to their kids, I don't think they could have a conscience. I can only think that they must have been so full of hate for something in their pasts and they took it out on their children. Rather cowardly, I think.It was repetitious but I wonder if that was intentional. Like when a child tells you over and over how bad their knee or tummy hurts. I felt like Trena was saying over and over, \\"Look what they did! Hear what they said!\\" At first I didn't get it, the repetition, but then it occurred to me that it was very effective to get her point across. It takes a lot of courage to write about the things Trena Cole wrote about. I have a lot of respect for her. Thanks Trena."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This book is a rewarding story to get through. It is hard at times to understand the pain and frusteration that a person deals with after they have been abused, and our actions towards them can be helpful or detrimental. This book helped me cope with abuse in my family and helped me learn how to help the abused individual. It's not a world that you can understand unless you live it, but this book helps you come as close as you can. Very moving, very fulfilling. Thank you, Trena Cole."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"What an incredible story of an unspeakable life. After reading this book I was sickened that teachers, authority, or even family did not try and help this children. What is wrong with our world that we turn our heads to such abuse. How can we sleep at night knowing we did nothing. Thank you Trenna for sharing your incredible journey and my heart is with you always."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Tina,Upon reading this book at a close friend's mentioning, I was immediately drawn to the content. Having worked in education for 10 years, I found the book to only reinforce my views in reference to the long-term impact of various types of abuse children are subjected to suffer. Your book reaffirmed my belief that a child's susceptibility to believe what they are told about them, whether it is good or bad, is profound and can be everlasting. And the physical abuse, in conjunction with verbal abuse, only sets the stage for the true test of resiliency. Fortunately for you, your level of resiliency paved the way for a productive life as an adult. I can only hope that your days are filled with pleasant thoughts about the positives in your life now. Many are not so lucky....For parents trying to encourage their children, by positive measures, to know that there are no boundaries for their future, this book offers the other side of the coin. This is an eye opening book that lets the fortunate ones know what really does happen in our world, from a child's point of view, and lets the ones who have endured similar experiences know that there is hope for them to make it!To have consistent and unrelenting negatives put upon such young minds or for that matter any mind, is truly a travesty of justice for the human soul to endure. Your book puts in perspective the realities of life for far too many and it is heart breaking. I read it quickly, leaving laundry for another day and then yet another day, to find some hope at the end. I found it to be real...and thereby leading me to be even more alert to the children I work with, and knowing that follow-through and true caring makes a difference for the life of many that don't get it from home or family. Thanks for being so open and honest and letting your heart open up to us. You may have helped your therapy by doing so, but you also helped countless others. Thank you."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I love this book, but I hate what it's about, child abuse. Everyone should read this. It illustrates almost everything you shouldn't say or do to children. It will hopefully make people think before they speak to children, especially if they are angry at the time. I read another review which criticized the language, but I feel it was necessary to get the point across. Verbal abuse is emotional abuse and it is just as crippling as physical abuse. I thank Ms. Cole for waking me up. I will choose my words carefully when I address my own children. Not that I would have ever used the language against them that was used against Trena and her siblings anyway, but I have heard others say cruel things to their children. I hope they read this book. I have to agree with Trena's therapist, most of the abuse, both physical and verbal, was for recreation. It's a shame that the person that little girl could rely on the most, her grandmother, was about as twisted as the rest of the adults in that family. This book is a wake up call to another form of child abuse I had never heard of, Recreational Child Abuse. This is the best memoir I've read on child abuse for years, definitely five stars."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I read this book on a flight back from England. My mother sent it to me while I was there and I got sucked into the story after sitting down for 15 minutes one night because I couldn't sleep. The entire flight I was unaware of my usual worries, like the wing falling off, the engine catching on fire, etc. because I was too concerned with my book. This book is a tearjerker, but also a realistic view of abuse. It is a cold truth that makes you think, but do not be scared. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I found this book to be heartbreaking, inspirational and disturbing. It is heartbreaking that Trena Cole was abused so horribly by the people who should have been giving her love, comfort and support. Even her grandmother, one of the least villianous, provided sanctity from other abusers at a price, thus the name \\"Grandma Fagan.\\"It was inspirational that; after surviving the humiliation, torture, and chaos; she was able to become a nurturing parent and a successful person. Statistically, she should have become an alcoholic, a drug abuser and/or a prostitute. I truly admire you Trena.Lastly, it is disturbing that she, or any child, should ever have to endure what she did. I was disturbed by the language that was used toward her and her siblings. How could a child develop any self-esteem when subjected to the constant verbal abuse and humiliation? I guess the thing that disturbs me as much as these children being put through this, is that children are continuing to be subjected to this today.I wish that everyone could read this book to learn \\"what not to do\\" in raising a child. To quote another reviewer, it is a \\"knock the wind out of you\\" survivor story and is definitely \\"not for the squeamish.\\"Trena, I hope the remainder of your life is as good as your first twenty years were bad."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I read several reviews on this book and \\"Nighmares Echo\\", and had to read these books on child abuse for myself.The title \\"Charred Souls\\" is such a perfect title for this book, because that is what the parents did to the \\"souls & spirit\\" of their children. How terrible life must have been. I actually had to skip parts that were too disturbing for me...\\"the trip with the dog\\", for example.My final thoughts after finishing this book were, anyone feeling like life has thrown them a \\"curve ball\\", needs to read this book and see how bad life can really be!Bravo, Trena for telling your story."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This is an excellent book!

She invokes such emotion with her stories, you feel like you're on a roller coaster. You hope for these children and care for them as if you know them.

It had to be as hard to write this book as it was to read it. I like her style and guts. She was brutally honest about the cruel emotional abuse she and her brothers and sisters lived through. This isn't a book for the faint of heart, it's sad the way those kids were treated, but it does give the reader a lot of insight to the way some kids live every day. This woman is a true survivor of berating brainwashing in the worst way and I admire her for telling on the creeps who lorded over her while she was young. The book was a little choppy in spots and repetitive in others, but all and all I'm glad I read it. I would recommend it because I think it's important to expose how neglect and abuse make children feel, not only while they are being neglected and abused but forever."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"While I admire and respect Trena Cole for all she's been through and her unwavering strength of human spirit...this publishing did her story little justice. Typographical and grammatical errors abound in this book, leaving the reader to feel this is a second-rate or low-class book. There was so much repetition within this book that I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again for 300+ pages. I think a better editor and publishing company would have done loads of justice to Trena and her story. Regardless, this is a story of a child's innate will to live and the perseverance of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This story really moved me. It's told in an honest way, which means the language is graphic at times, but we are dealing with child abuse and child abuse is ugly. The form of child abuse Charred Souls focuses on is recreational child abuse which is basically when a parent abuses a child for fun and entertainment. The fact that Trena survived is amazing and that she survived to become a well balanced adult woman is a tribute to her dynamic spirit. I wish her sibling had been so fortunate. If you were moved by \\"A child called It\\" this story will likely move you as well, caution, the language is just as Trena remembers it..but I personally feel it is needed so we can really know what it was like to be a charred soul."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I guess I should say \\"What kids!\\" because there were seven all together and all were impressive in some way. I had to buy Charred Souls for a class and I can't wait for school to start so I can discuss it with my professor and fellow students. This is an incredible story about constant emotional and verbal abuse of children. I was impressed with the raw emotion Trena Cole emitted with her writing and I was actually impressed with her style. Yes there are grammatical errors but I think this story is important enough to forgive those. I give her enormous credit for sharing her emotions and feelings through her book. It wasn't an easy read but it couldn't have been an easy write either."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Ms. Cole's book was recommended to me by Amazon after a search. I found it to be well worth ordering it and worth the read from the moment I started reading. Ms. Cole has taken a terribly horrid childhood and risen above it in order to write a book that could teach all how to see signs of child or recreational abuse of a child(ren). It is very useful for all who deal with, are relative too a child. This book tore at my soul reading, it hurt to read but I could not put it down. I am blessed to have come acrossed it and have recommended it to others as a nurse, a mother and friend.Ms. Cole knows of what she speaks and where she came from to be able to look upon her past and learn from it. Cold hearted is the soul that can look at this book and not wish they were on hand to steal this poor children away and give them a better more loving life. Or imagine that they know better what this life was like and what name to call it by. If the name, Recreational Child Abuse fits and helps Ms. Cole and others on their way therapeutically(sp?)all the better. I cannot imagine a person reading word for word in this book and not seeing into the horrors of these young lives.These things (any sort of abuse, but the worst being to a child)happen and happen far too often. People do over look warning signs until it is too late. This has happened in our society time and time again. Ms. Cole's book is a fine aid in learning more about abuse. I believe that it has more than likely saved a child somewhere in that someone had knowledge gained from this book.I look forward to the next book by Ms. Cole and I am sure I will be recommending to others as well."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This is the heart-wrenching story of an alcoholic, dysfunctional white trash family, where babies were born like clockwork and then subjected on a constant basis to the vilest verbal and physical abuse. I hope everyone who is considering becoming a parent reads this book. This book may also sell more than a few \\"nannycams\\", as the sick, sadistic mother here also made a few dollars as a babysitter, subjecting her innocent charges to the same shameful abuses she employed to cripple her own children emotionally. I hope as well that poor Trena's beast of a mother, who I suspect is a narcissist as well as a born-again in complete denial, will read the reviews of her daughter's book here at Amazon and perhaps before her day of judgment realize what evil she perpetrated along with her equally depraved and sadistic husband. I am forced to deduct one star for the extreme editorial sloppiness displayed in this paperback from Oberpark Publishing Inc. of Indianapolis. Apparently there is no one in that city who has ever cracked the cover of a Chicago Manual of Style or Strunk & White's Elements of Style if this sorry edition is any evidence, as grammatical and punctuation errors abound here on every page. To cite just one example, \\"it's\\" is used throughout as the possessive form of \\"it\\". Trena Cole's story deserves much better support than this, and I hope Oberpark or another publisher will rise to the challenge in a future edition."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"A powerful moving story of one woman's survival of being abused as a child.

Reading this book is like a personal interview with someone who not only lived 'child abuse' but had the insight to understand the dynamics of the perpetrators as well.Although this book is not literary, it is written well: emotionally powerful, educational and entertaining (definitely holds your interest) to read.I have read a lot in the field of child abuse, first hand accounts, clinical studies, etc., and this is one of the best books on the subject besides a Child Called It .Commendation is due for the narrator's voice and tone: not a poor me tone, but a factual, 'I have suvived' tone, actually laced with an underlying sarcastic humor (I actually cracked up in places, because the humor reveals the ridiculousness of adults bullying a small child). This book can be therapeutic to those who are in the proper healing stages of recovery."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Why people enjoy torturing, manipulating and mistreating children is a mystery to me. What kind of victory do adults feel by bullying the small and defenseless? I used to say jokingly, on a bad day with my children, \\"I'll never condone child abuse, but some days I can almost understand it.\\" After reading Charred Souls, I will never say that again, it's not funny anymore. I had never heard the term 'recreational child abuse' until I saw this book and that's exactly what Trena, and her brothers and sisters, lived with. If I were a vengeful person I'd say it would be fitting for those parents, and a few extended family members, to have to live the way those kids did for just one year. But I'm not vengeful and they probably still wouldn't admit the error of their ways anyway, child abusers almost never do.Trena Cole did a wonderful job making me feel as though I was there with her while she lived through the abuse she was dealt in life. I'm glad she told, I wish more survivors did. The author describes the way the children were cussed at and smacked at all day, every day. It seemed like the children enraged the adults just by being there. They were either enraged and attacking the children, or they were torturing them for fun. Recreational child abuse, who could have put a finger on that one? Trena Cole's therapist. Who would have thought someone would have to come up with a name for such mistreatment? That bunch of sick pillars of the community who had seven kids and abused them emotionally, physically, mentally, verbally and permanently! I have to believe they knew exactly what they were doing and I also believe they will never admit that what they did was deplorable. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's definitely five star material."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This book is amazing! I couldn't imagine anyone else went through what I did. The comparisons are bone-chilling...The author makes you feel like you are watching as she describes the situations that plagued her childhood. This is a sad story, but I have faith that it will help a lot of people. It is a battle worth fighting to awaken awareness about child abuse."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I have read all of the reviews of this book, and in no way can I so eloquently state what others have. This book is a must read for so many, for all..perhaps. I didn't smile or chuckle once in this book, but I did fall in love with a little girl that I wanted to [grab] from the pages and take care of. Trena and her siblings went through more abuse that I tensed at every turn of the page. I cried for her, but now applaud her. That she was able to write this book is amazing....When I read this book, I really felt as though she was just a friend of mine and we were sitting in the yard under an umbrella and she tells this story. You feel like she's talking to you and the only thing that I can say is that the one thing that is missing is that you want to find her and hug her at the end. Her parents are disgusting to me...it's hard to believe that this abuse occurs everyday. How she survived, I don't know....maybe those angels. Please read this book. It's inspirational, it really is. It's hard to peek into a life so dysfunctional and mad, but I am very glad this book was recommended to me and I am glad that I read it. I think whether you work around children or not, it should be read by all...for the sake of the children."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Paradoxically the very things that make Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse by Trena Cole perplexing for an academic reviewer are the strong points that make the book well worth the read. The author does not offer a theoretical perspective on chid abuse and, other than concluding that her parents abused her because they enjoyed it, she does not seek to explain it. The authenticity of the descriptions are wrenching as the author relates horrendous accounts of brutal, humiliating, chronic abuse of a young girl's first eighteen years of life. It goes far beyond what even the most skilled Munchausen patient could concoct. Yet the tone of the writing is refreshing for the absence of self-serving and indignant claims. Throughout, the author is telling the reader what happened. The writing will be hard to discredit for even the most skilled of those who seem to want to deny the existence of abuse of the kind Ms. Cole experienced.At the author's therapist's suggestion, she called it \\"recreational abuse\\", i.e., done for fun, kicks, and recreation. For the fun of seeing their children's terror, the parents drive out in the country and abandon the children. The children are made to witness one of their pet dogs shot with the threat that the killing is a justified punishment for disobedient dogs and children. The most severe beatings and toxic humiliations were daily affairs. At age six, the author was forced to work in a store for fifty-cents a day which was turned over to the mother as her share of help to support the family. Years later, the author learned that the man in the store was an already known child molester when she started work there. He sexually abused her while she was employed at the restaurant starting when he insisted on examining her to prove that she was not a boy since boys were not allowed to work at the store. The author concluded that her mother enjoyed her daughter's anguished pleas to quit the job. There is an eye opening description of her punitive, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. The palliative and positive effects of an all too short stay with a foster family lead her to the first realization that not all adults were like her parents. As early as age four she was charged with the care of what became six siblings. Her caring attempts to protect them were carried out at a high price. In a later section of the book the author discusses the dilemma posed by the life saving admonition that \\"If you are going to make it a double drowning, don't go in\\".Reading this book provides a good look into a life of chronic and extreme abuse and neglect, their effects and the author's struggles to overcome them.The conspicuous absence of intervention throughout the author's childhood by anyone in a position of authority during the less enlightened 1950s and 1960s is no less forgivable than is the blatant under resourcing of children's protective services today at a time when we supposedly know better. In the current \\"killing the chickens because we won't wait for eggs\\" economy, we can pay now or pay more later. The current costs of having over two million Americans in jail (a higher rate of incarceration than any other \\"developed country\\") gives one clue to the price of indifference and the lack of prevention. In economic terms Charred Souls gives an excellent view of the human cost. While Ms. Coles very survival is miraculous, it is important for the reader to be mindful of the fact that thousands of American children are not so fortunate and suffer truly lifelong unrepairable damage or worse.I cannot imagine that anyone could read this book and not be deeply moved and troubled. Thus, I strongly recommend its reading, for ordinary citizens and parents, and for those professionals involved in the protection, care and treatment of our children.Roderick Durkin, Ph.D..."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Writing under a pseudonym, the author of \\"Charred Souls\\" takes the reader through her experiences growing up in an abusive family. It is not for the timid or those offended by foul language but the hurt and pain the author has endured is openly visible through the text. What makes this story somewhat different from most is that it is a case of recreational abuse, abuse that is done just for the pleasure of the abuser.The author takes us from her earliest childhood memories, through her childhood growth years, and on through high school to adulthood. At each stage she shares her thoughts and experiences as a child.

Unfortunately, I had never been able to conjure up an appropriate way to describe it. Well, there you go. And yes, \\"recreational\\" means everything it implies.It goes beyond just physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, or neglect. It is the story of a pattern of (what seems to be) pleasure-driven maltreatment...hence the term \\"recreational.\\" The more common terms don't accurately describe the experiences of children who are forced to eat squirrel eyeballs or toenail clippings...while a sadistic father looks on with raging laughter. The common terms don't give full validation to what it's like to live with a psychopath/sociopath...to live with a person who makes you bathe in a pond or sleep in a hay pile in a barn...just because he thinks it's funny. \\"Recreational\\" is the perfect term to describe the experience of children who know what it's like to be abused \\"just for the fun of it.\\"While I agree with others that the book isn't that elegantly written, it had substance, & while it was sometimes repetitive, I still couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened to Trena, Dana, Dena, Tim, Tom, Tony, & Denise.This is a 'knock the wind out of you story.' It's definitely not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I'm glad someone finally came up with a name for the enjoyment some adults seem to get from abusing children, Recreational Child Abuse. That's exactly what it is when someone takes delight in beating or degrading a child. I have never seen it to the extent Trena Cole and her siblings did, but I've seen enough to know it exists. This is an eye opening book for anyone who works with children professionally or personally, icluding parents. It gives insight to the symptoms people can watch for if they are in a position to protect a child. I would highly recommend it for anyone considering foster parenting. It might help them understand why the children they foster are the way they are sometimes. As I read the chapter about her foster parents I was hoping and praying they would be her saving grace and, although things didn't work out like she hoped they would, she did learn a lot and take it with her. They might very well have been what saved her.As I read about the physical abuse these children suffered I cringed, but the emotional and mental abuse I read about kept me up at night. No child should have to live the nightmare these kids lived, but children still do everyday. Hats off to Trena Cole for telling it like it was, and calling it what it is, Recreational Child Abuse."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I give this book five stars because that is the highest rating available. I was fortunate enough to hear Trena Cole speak to a group of professionls a few weeks ago and to meet her was even more touching than reading her book. She was very brave, and inspirational, to give us a glimpse of not only what happened to her and her siblings but the long term effects of severe emotional abuse. Her story is not only inspirational, but educational for anyone touching the lives of children in their profession.While reading Charred Souls I had to ask the same question Trena seemed to ask over and over as a child, \\"Is anyone watching? Is anyone paying attention?\\" While she and the rest of the children in her immediate, and extended, family were used as game pieces for sadistic controlling power games it seemed as if the whole world lived that way. Those children certainly had no inspiration or intervention from anyone to indicate anything else. Not since, A Child Called It, have I read such a heartbreaking case of child abuse.In her book Trena talks about the angels who passed through her life while she miracously made it through the chaos of her violently tornadic childhood. When a gas station attendant smiled at her and told her she was a pretty little girl, that was enough to keep her inspired and forging ahead for days. She refers to him as one of the angels who gave her a kind word when she felt like she was shriveling up and couldn't go on. Forced to stay strong and hard. Forced to keep the secret of her abuse from the rest of the world. I salute Trena Cole for her courage to become an inspirational angel, in her own right, by educating people who can make a difference in such a child's life."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This book left a huge impact on me. The courage and insight that is displayed throughout the book is what makes her story so inspirational. In all the horror of her childhood, she still found the courage to survive and become a caring adult. She had the strength to break the cycle and help others who suffer. I love this book and her story is amazing."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Not to say that this story isn't tragic. It is. The story itself isn't the issue that I had with the book. My issue stemmed mainly from the fact that it feels like a repetition of the same thoughts over and over and over. I felt like every sentence I read was nearly identical to the last.The book itself also contained numerous typos and grammatical errors. This might not be off-putting to some readers, and if not, please don't let this comment stop you.I have read several books about child abuse and its aftermath. If you are looking for a good read, I wouldn't strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I think that people are giving high reviews based only on the story. I can't see how this can be given five stars based on the writing style, the amount of grammar errors, and the amount of repetition."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"This is a good book if you are studying child abuse, or familiar with it. I was looking into going back to school for social work and this book is really good at making you aware of what can happen out there to children. Trena tells a good story. Whoever edited it though, didn't do a good job. It can be repetivie , but that didn't bother me as much as the misspelled words (there were only a few)The author did a good job at telling the story and if you can overlook some of the spelling errors you've got yourself a pretty darn good book!!"},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Wow! While the author's honesty and pure heart-wrenching feelings were wonderfully portrayed, the book could have been shortened by 150 pages. Hearing the same information 2 or 3 times in the same paragraph was irritating to the point of putting the book down many times. It took me over a week to read 'cause I just couldn't deal with the inconsistencies of the \\"flashbacks\\" and the constant repetitiveness."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"The author shows a lot of anger in her writing of this book and upon reading it you will discover why. The cruelties inflicted upon these children put the child welfare system, the school system, law enforcement and the town they grew up in to shame! This was a painful book to read, I felt helpless for these children and disgust for the adults in their life who did nothing to help them.I believe the author has a long road ahead of her before healing herself, if she ever can. Powerful reading."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"It probably could have been an interesting book but it was so poorly written I didn't even finish it."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I was excited to read this book, but am finding it very difficult to get through because it is written so poorly. The whole book is very repetitive which gets very annoying. A better editor or publisher would have done this book wonders."},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"I DID NOT THINK WAS A VERY GOOD BOOKIT WAS VERY POORLY WRITTENWOULDNT RECOMMEND"},{"Title":"Charred Souls: A Story of Recreational Child Abuse","review":"Disclaimer, January 2011: Please do not get the impression that I don't take the topic of child abuse seriously. This is a review of this particular book, not the topic of child abuse. The topic of child abuse is not \\"silliness\\". In fact, that's one of my problems with this book. I think it denigrated real survivors of real child abuse. Since I am a survivor myself, I don't appreciate that.I say this because a comment claims that I'm denying or minimizing child abuse. I wish I could have seen that comment sooner. Unfortunately, it sat there for three years before I saw and responded to it. Now that I read my review, I see that person is kind of justified in drawing the conclusion that I'm minimizing child abuse itself.Not at all.I just don't like it when someone claims to have been abused when they really haven't. One the other hand, perhaps I should re-read the book, just to be fair.****************************************************I felt that this book was boring, self-indulgent, silly and totally lacking in insight. Also, a little dishonest and insincere. I don't have time to waste on reading this kind of nonsense, so I had to stop after the first few pages.Therefore, I may be missing some important events in the book.I was born in the late 40's, and, yes, we did know some families very much like that described in the book. Mostly, neighbors tried to pitch in wherever and whenever possible---------letting the kids come over for dinner, or stay over with neighbors' kids and so forth.Actually, I myself was one of the kids that neighbors tried to help in this way. I almost never went home, and the neighbor families understood. They didn't ask.But, this book reads like a tract for \\"population control\\" and that's one of the many things I dislike about it. It seems to be pandering to certain stereotypes.I feel that this author has been highly selective in her choice of events to describe. It doesn't really sound honest. Many things that may seem shocking now, were just commonplace back then.Kids did go to the store for their families at age four. It wasn't really a big deal at the time. I used to walk half a mile one way, and it was all uphill going back. That was in 1951, when I was three. I loved going to the store, to tell the truth, because it made me feel grown up and independent.True, sometimes there would be too many groceries for me to carry, but folks would try to help out. The store people would call home, or another neighbor would drive me, or something.The story about the mom's saying she'd be sad if the kid died, because the funeral would be too expensive or something----not sure------I feel that perhaps the mom was just joking. Families say things like that all the time, in jest. And, to protect themselves from the intensity of their true feelings, of course.Some reviewers have commented that the term \\"recreational\\" is descriptive and accurate.Huh????First of all, there's no such thing as \\"recreational\\" child abuse. The author's therapist made it up. I think this has much to do with the therapist's own issues. She may be using Trena to work those out.Second, this term is very misleading.What is the difference between \\"recreational\\" bank robbery, say, and just regular bank robbery? Or, \\"recreational\\" embezzlement and just plain embezzlement?This tends to further objectify and stereotype the parents.These parents obviously had problems of their own. I don't see any evidence of malice here. Just lack of control. They needed help.If you enjoy reading about systemic child abuse, why not just pick up a copy of _Oliver Twist_?"},{"Title":"The New Jersey Devils' Road to the 2003 Stanley Cup Championship","review":"The New Jersey Devils are an amazing team in the NHL.

The main character spends the story attempting to uncover the person responsible for a plot to destroy him. It's a much better story than the stereo-typical adventure plot.Although the plot and writing (and vocabulary!) are excellent, the characters are decidedly lacking. Their emotions and motives are not heavily explored and a few, such as the troll-man who serves as the main character's side-kick, end up feeling highly stereo-typical. Although the events in the story are satisfying, the lack of character development left me without any actual emotional attachment to what I read.This book is a pleasant enough distraction as a bedtime read, but not much more."},{"Title":"Dreamer in Discord","review":"I recently found this book in a used book store, and I absolutely love it. Craig Mills has such a unique way of describing events and things that go on about the characters. The plot is original, and the outcome is better. The events between are suspensful, pleasing, sorrowful, everything they're supposed to be. The description is some of the best I've read. It has just a tinge of darkness to it, just a hint that not everything will turn out alright.The characters are all believable, and they have human emotions, wants, fears and dreams, down to the minor characters. I'm suprised this book hasn't seen more publicity. It may be older, but it is as of now, my favorite."},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"No fooling! 13 years ago today I quit smoking forever and I did it by using this book! J. Rogers devised a systematic approach to ease the addicted one off cigarettes - it really works if you follow the system.In 1996 I purchased this book, part of the process was to pick a date to quit smoking - about 4 weeks into the future, I selected April 1st, because only a fool would continue to smoke after that day!I followed the steps as outlined in the book, steps like keeping track of when and how much you smoke, changing cigarette brands to lower nicotine brands, waiting 15 minutes after you eat to smoke, and so forth. Eventually, all the trigger points are dealt with, and the amount of nicotine entering your system is dramatically less than when you began - making your quit day a breeze. This method will work - buy it for anyone who smokes and knows how to read!"},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"I quit after 15+ years of smoking. I read this book 2 times before quitting and then stopped 2 years ago and haven't looked back since! I was the most addicted person I know. I mailed my book to one brother who used it to quit.

You should see how healthy I look! No more sore throats or headaches."},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"Although this book has been written more than twenty years ago, it worked for me-twice.First time i was smoke free for 18 months, second time 9.The program that the author suggests is good, I was not climbing walls, I didn't have unbearable cravings and I really enjoyed the way I smelled after I quit.The fact that I 'slipped' is my own responsibility and failing and I am currently going through the program to quit - for good this time.Highly recommended. You have nothing to lose."},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"I went looking for this book to buy for a friend because I used it to quit smoking over a decade ago, and because I really did like it so much, I thought I should just add my two cents worth!I didn't quit with this book - I quit for good after seeing a reputable hypnotherapist (2 appointments, very easy - a good one shouldn't charge an arm and a leg or take a million sessions.) But I firmly believe that hypnosis wouldn't have worked if I hadn't read this book first. All the emotional, psychological and mental preparation that really enabled me to quit was done with the help of this excellent book. It helped me to understand why I was so attached to smoking (beyond the physical - that part, while unpleasant, is easy to overcome -I did it many times, haha!) Without a doubt it laid the groundwork for me to quit. It really was invaluable. So often people don't talk about the psychological aspect of quitting, and for many, that is in fact the most difficult part. I'm pretty introspective but even I hadn't really even thought of approaching it from that angle until I read this book.I have to say that the work that I did with this book also laid the groundwork for my quitting drinking for good 5 years ago (an added bonus I didn't expect!) I applied the same principles, and I quit for good (without hypnosis this time!) So I can't recommend this book more highly. Thank you Ms. Rogers! Now I'm going to buy it for my friend and send it to her. (Note: you do have to read it and really take it in, however! Don't think there's a quick fix - you have to put the effort in. You have to really want to quit, or as I say - want to want to quit! But this book helps with that too. It will make you be honest with yourself. There's no whitewashing.)"},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"I received this book from a friend and when I was ready to quit, I read it and then began the steps. It takes six weeks to do the program to help wean you off smoking. I have been smoke free for twelve years and feel great. After that I purchased two of these books and gave them to friends.

It guided me through the process of understanding why I smoke, and helped me to understand the role that smoking played in my life, and how smoking served some need (for me, squelching emotion and creating distance from people). It also helped me anticipate what it would feel like to be an adult non-smoker, which was scary because I had never been one! You have to do the internal work before you can quit successfully, to understand where you are, how you got there, and why you want to change. It has to be your own choice for your own reasons. Then, it's easy. Believe me."},{"Title":"You Can Stop Smoking","review":"This book was a GREAT help to my Mom in her struggle. It detail's a very different kind of approach to quitting smoking. It doesn't throw crap down the reader's throat but rather allow a little leeway, understanding the difficult struggle ahead.Good strategies for anyone willing to listen to them.It is not a \\"STOP SMOKING NOW!\\" book, neither is it a self-help book, rather an informative, helpful little guide in breaking down each individual smoker's habit, helping them slowly, but surely, gain the willpower necessary to finally quit smoke.Since she finally quit, It's been several Month's.

Yes, the story has a simple plot of a single mother working to provider for her daughter and mother. Possibly the all too ancient clich&eacute; of working hard to get what you want in life. However, there are many lessons to be learned here. Recovering from a disaster [family's home was in a fire], charity [neighborhood donated items for the new home], work [mother works until she can barely stay awake, daughter helps whenever she comes in], and setting a goal [although so much was lost, the family worked together to purchase a special chair]. On a side note- a friend of mine commented how they would never read this to their child...it lacks a father figure. My response is frankly- SO WHAT?! The illustrations fortunately show cartoon people of ALL colors. This book is free of religious, political and racist agenda. With that alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone. Well overdo are books that realistically demonstrate the hard work a single mother goes through. The same applies if it were a man working from bell to bell.

It tells a young child that working for a dream and thinking of something is as important and thrilling as immediate gratification ! For the reviewer who said I do not like this book due to the issue of divorce ? I think they are missing the point entirely -- the books premise is about how saving and looking forward to something after tragedy hits is worth it.

I love teh emphasis on hardwork and perseverance.Most children can relate to the notion of saving money to purchase something they really want to have. Written from the perspective of the child makes the story easy for children to identify with. The notion of harwork and perseverance is weaved through out the story. From the mother's long hours at the diner to the family's year of saving change in a jar. The Coldecott-winning illustrations allow the reader to feel the emotions the little girl is feeling and correspond beautifully with the text. The cover of the book is an outsiders view of the diner where the little girl's mother works. Ths vantage point lends to the perspective from which the story is told. I feel this is a story that can transcend time. There will always be the need for hard work and perseverance. There will always be hard times one has to overcome. The notion of earning and valuing material pocessions can cross all cultures."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"I recently bought this book for my 7-year-old, and was really impressed by both the story and the beautiful illustrations. I felt it was a good story for my daughter to read as it told how the young girl, her mother and grandmother survived a fire that destroyed their home and built a life for themselves afterward. The reward to being able to buy a comfortable chair after all their hard work and savings drives home the point of how much we have and how little we may sometimes appreciate it."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"Told in the words of a little girl, this story tells of a family making the best of a bad situation.

It tells a sweet story about how a family is supported by friends and family after they lose their house to a fire. It also shows how the family works together to save up for a chair so the mother, who works as a waitress to support them, can have a comfortable place to sit.I give it 4 stars only because my son did not care for it. I can only assume it is because none of the characters were boys and, it's really not a \\"boy\\" story, I suppose.

The family members decide to save coins to buy a new chair for their home. The mother is a waitress and tries to save all of the money she can to help out the family. The mother and daughter take all of the money they save it in a jar. When the jar is full they go out and buy a beautiful chair for the family to enjoy. This book is appropriate for ages 6 to 10.

The book was a 1983 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. It shows the joy of attaining one's goals after continued effort."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"This is one of those books that contain an extremely simple story. There are no apparent conflicts, the story flows along is a simply mellow sort of way and you finish it and say \\"how sweet,\\" and then sort of go along with your business.Strangely though, this is one of those stories that once read, absolutely sticks with you for some reason and is much more profound that many a more complex tale I have read.Simply put, which I feel is appropriate here; this is the story of a little girl and her family. Her mother is a hard working woman who is supporting the family. In the not so distant past, their apartment had burned down and the family lost everything. The entire neighborhood and the little girl's extended family pitched in and helped. Most things were eventually replaced...most thing with the exception of a nice comfortable chair that the mother could set in at night and rest her weary body. Over time the little girl and indeed, the entire family saved and saved their pennies until they were able to buy momma a new chair, or at least a very nice used one.That's it! That is the story!When we take this simple tale of love between family members, the neighbors and the relatives, and mix it with the wonderful whimsical art work, we have something very special in this book. Hard times are hard times but the message of everyone pulling together is strong here and is certainly applicable in the hard times many are facing today.Now I like this story and every kid I have read it to likes it. It is simply pretty special.Please allow me a small rant here. I note that at least one reviewer; maybe two took exception to this story. They did not like the fact that the woman did not have a husband. They apparently did not like the fact that there were strong women figures in this story. (Apparently the strength of the mother and little girl are all part of some sort of evil anti-Christian feminist agenda). If you read these reviews you find a lot of pure misunderstanding and/or a very twisted philosophy and/or religious view. It is not a \`sin' to not have a husband. This story told nothing of divorce. Even it had, that should make no difference what so ever. I know that there are several obscure passages in the bible that tell of how horrid divorce is, but folks...to be honest with you, the vast majority of people I know have been through this process whether they be Christian or otherwise. It is life and we need to deal with it. I also noted in these reviews just a hint of racism here and there. Shame on you! That is pretty disgusting and certainly inappropriate. If your religious views include some sort of racist doctrine, then I strongly suggest you check out some other denomination. It ain't what the bible teaches...trust me.Thank you for allowing me that little side paragraph.All in all, this is a great book. Your child will be better for having read it and I dare say you will be too.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"A working-class family consisting of a daughter, mother, and grandmother have lost their house in a fire. Although the community banded together to help them assemble the essentials, they have been saving their change in a jar for a year to furnish their bare living room in their apartment. They dream of the perfect chair and, when the jar is finally full, like Goldilocks (as Grandma said), they go searching for and find a chair that's just right.This book focuses on three generations of women who are self-reliant. The illustrations are bright and colorful and each spread is embellished with a floral or geometric border. I especially love the illustration of the community showing people of many hues coming out of their houses and lining up to deliver household items to the family in need."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"I borrowed this book from the library to read aloud to my 2 year old. He loves it and I'm adding it to my wish list.The story is about a family of mother, grandmother and daughter (maybe 7 or 8 years old). The mother works as a waitress to support her family. The little girl realizes and appreciates how hard her mother works - she often helps out at the diner herself after school. She's learned from her mother the value of saving - when her mother's boss gives her some money for filling the salt shakers, she puts half in the big jar at home.The little girl speaks of a fire that detroyed their home and all their possessions. Through the help of extended family and friends they are able to start over. However their new apartment lacks a place for her mother to \\"take a load off [her] feet\\" The family saves coins in a big jar for a year to be able to buy a new easy chair - from the mother's tips, from the grandmother's market savings, from the little girl's \\"earnings\\".The pictures are beautiful - colorful, almost luscious. Our favorites are of the mother collapsed in a chair while the little girl counts her tips and a picture of the little girl's fantasy chair - huge, covered in velvet with roses on it.The words are simple enough that beginning readers will be able to master it, especially after having listened to it being read aloud over and over again.

I tear up every time I read it when we get to the part about the whole neighborhood helping them move into their new house after the old one burns down. It's a wonderful example of community, and very realistic.I will note that this book is a bit wordy, and may not hold the attention of children under the age of 5 or so. If your kiddo has a short attention span, wait a year before reading this one."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"Vera B. Williams's best known book. In this story a young girl, her single mom, and her grandmother all occupy the same apartment after their home is destroyed by a fire. To fill their empty space the women scrimp and save for a big comfy armchair.This is a story of perseverance, but it isn't preachy in any way. The family looks to be South American, but this isn't drummed into the readers' heads. All it's trying to do is tell a story about getting what you want when you've faced a disaster of some kind. Though I've never really been a fan of Williams's art, this book is very well done. Ms. Williams works with a rough watercolor style that leaves little room for fine details. Just the same, when the mother in this book sees her house on fire after buying new pumps, the next picture displays the woman, new shoes in hand, sprinting towards the house. It's the little touches that make any book interesting, and this book falls into that category. Finally, it's a bright cheerful story that is smart enough to acknowledge sadness and hardship. An excellent book for kids."},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"I have used this book over and over again as a teaching tool in classrooms ranging from kindergarten to eighth grade. It serves as a great lesson in empathy, tolerance, goal-setting, and gratitude. Too often, so many kids today seem to walk through life with a feeling of grand entitlement. It's our doing, of course. We give them everything and are then upset when they want everything. \\"A Chair for My Mother\\" is a story of giving. It is the story of a child who loses everything in a fire, but is most concerned that her mother no longer has a comfortable chair to sink into after a hard day. She saves all she can so they can buy a big, lush, comfy chair. It's also serves as a great lesson in characterization, foreshadowing, and making inferences. And, I have used the book as an introduction for all of those concepts in seventh and eighth grade this year. It seems like I'll use any excuse to share the book with others. Simply put, it's a worthwhile book for kids of any age.Chris BowenOur Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom"},{"Title":"A chair for my mother","review":"I read this book to my children who were all homeschooled. We loved this book. Last year I read it to a group of kids ages 8 to 17...and when I finished, they clapped because they were so moved by it! To me, that says it all."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"I first read Outlaw Red and as yong girl about 30 years ago. I still go back and read it from time to time. The story is clean, honest, and it takes the reader right to the setting of the Wintapi in Canada. I love all three of Kjelgaard's books for that reason. Kjelgaard masterfully used imagery to keep his readers' interest This however, is my favorite. Sean, the pampered showdog, is haphazardly thrown into the wilderness. Through cunning and instinct the dog manages to survive the perils of his situation.Sean's courage in adversity makes this book a perfect read for anyone of any age."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Personally, I can only read so many stories about Irish Setters that exceed all realistic performance expectations, and this book somehow cheapens its predecessors.By putting Sean on the same pedestal that Big Red himself already occupies, Kjelgaard does a disservice to Big Red.That being said, this is still a pretty strong book. I enjoy Kjelgaard more when he tackles other breeds (such as Snow Dog, Lion Hound, and Desert Dog), but there's no question that he brought all of his considerable writing skills to this exciting novel.Fans of Kjelgaard know to expect taciturn human characters with hearts of gold, exciting encounters with local wildlife, and vivid descriptions of the natural setting. They will not be disappointed here. While the plot is pretty predictable, I think most readers will enjoy the journey.An established Kjelgaard fan will certainly want to read this book, but if you're trying this author for the first time, start with Big Red or Snow Dog."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"This book was much better than I expected, even though I knew about its critical acclaim. The story of a dog in the wilderness takes the reader into a world that you may have thought you could never go. But it's not just about dogs, it's about all the emotions of life and adversity for animals as well as people, and it helped me understand dogs better for it. It's no wonder that Outlaw Red won the prize for best peaceful book. Wonderful read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"In his life time, Jim Kjelgaard wrote well over forty novels for young or juvenile readers; most of which dealt with animals, in particular dogs. Most of his writing was done in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As a young man I must admit I devoured these books, giving most of them multiple readings. Several of these \\"youth books\\" had a rather profound effect on my life. The three books dealing with Irish Setters, e.g. Big Red, Irish Red and this one being reviewed here, Outlaw Red, ingrained into me a love for dogs that has lasted a life time. A fourth book, Wildlife Photographer started a life time hobby which I pursue to this day.Outlaw Red, Son of Big Red is the story of an Irish Setter who was born to hunt but was unlucky enough to be a bit too perfect. Rather than doing the job he was born to do, he is made into a much pampered show dog and is more or less doomed to a life in a kennel. I have more to say about this later. As it might be expected to happen (Kjelgaard's books were all pretty predictable), Outlaw Red is accidentally released into the Canadian wild and is forced to live on his own, using his instincts, wits and a generous amount of good luck. This is your basic boy dog books and is arguably one of the best in this genre. Big Red, the first of the Setter series was and is the most famous, largely due to the Disney film of the early 1960s, but I, like many, feel this was a better read than the first or second books in the series.As with most of his books, the author more or less tells the story through the eyes of the animal or animals concerned. He, the author, has tremendous descriptive power and was a natural story teller. The story here is crisp, well told and is truly a page turner. Now I will be the first to admit that some of the circumstances encountered in this read stretch credibility just a bit, but hey folks, this is a story for young men and women. I read and enjoyed Harry Potter, but I doubt if any sane individual, young or old, believed ever word that Rawlings wrote. A big part of being a great story teller is the ability to present unlikely circumstances in a light that is completely believable, or at least make the tale interesting; Kielgaard is a master at this technique.This book, and the others by this author, are ideal reads for young people. Most of them are still in print and I note after checking with the public and school libraries, that they have quite a large following even to this day. Don't make our kid read them or he/she will hate them, but let them discover them for themselves. These are very clean books and teach so many good and desirable traits for a young person to grow into.PURE PERSONAL COMMENT: I of course have been around dogs all of my life and in fact have owned Irish Setters. When I was young, two of the best gun dogs that I ever shot over were Irish Setters and at the same time were some of the best family dogs that you could imagine. They were a magnificent breed! Alas, this was their downfall though. They became very popular and became the darling of dog shows. There are still a few hunting blood lines out there that have held true, but they have become few and far between. The \\"pet\\" setter and the \\"show\\" setter are still sweet, loveable and goofy dogs, but to be honest they have had their brains bred completely right out of them, and most of them have trouble finding the end of their own leash. In addition to that, the puppy mill people jumped on the bandwagon and this particular breed is now plagued with a plethora of physical problems from hip dysplasia to epilepsy, (extremely common in this breed, almost to the point of being an epidemic), and everything in between. Again, there are good lines out there, but good luck in finding them. For goodness sakes do not buy from the puppy mill people or pet shops. If you do, you are likely in for a lot of heartbreak. Now you quite well may have an Irish Setter that is quite perfect, healthy, smart and wonderful...I truly hope so, but to be honest, you are one of the fewer and fewer lucky ones. If you happen to be one of those that are churning these wonderful animals out by the hundreds with no care as to breeding standards and health concerns, ad selling to the pet shop folks, then I have nothing but distain and ill will toward you. And I will tell you right now, telling me that I don't know what I am talking about here would be a lot like telling Noah that he knew nothing of the flood.Anyway, do your kid a favor and turn them on to this one and other by the same author!Actually, you would probably like this one yourself!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"There are three books in the \\"Red\\" series. The first one is \\"Big Red\\". The second one is \\"Irish Red\\", about Mike, the son of Big Red. This is the third one, about Shaun, Big Red's son who is the ultimate show dog, and can't have a life outside the show ring for fear of damaging his looks. Danny, the hero of the earlier books, has hired Billy, another boy from the mountains to work in Mr. Haggin's kennels. Billy is the best person in his family. His relatives are thieves and trouble makers, and his uncle shows up Mr. Haggin's ranch looking for trouble. Even though Billy is a civilized young man, he is forced to protect the ranch against his uncle, and becomes a fugitive in the wilderness. Then the beautiful dog Shaun is lost in the wilderness, and his mate. They all join up for companionship and survival. There is a lot of coincidence in this story, which stretches credulity. It is best just to accept that this is a story and suspend judgement. In spite of this, \\"Outlaw Red\\" is definitely one of the best of Mr. Kjelgaard's books."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Far out in the Wintapi Wildness there is a breeding farm for Irish Setters. The top dog on the farm is Sean, a big flawless red Irish Setter. Running the farm is Ross his son Danny and a kennel boy named Billy. Late one night Billy has a argument with someone he has known his whole life. Then something happened were Billy has to run away and become a outlaw. Shortly after that Sean is sent to another farm to breed with their top dog Penny. On the trip miles into the wilderness the cage falls off a truck. Sean has never been on his own without the care of his friend Billy. Sean soon learns that without man, food will be his first challenge in the wild. After many months in the wild he finds his way to his original destination and his mate to be Penny. Where his adventure into the wild continues and he meets up with an old friend. My thoughts are that the book was one of the best I have ever read because it deals with some one who has been tossed into the wild and has to learn to survive on his own. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"My favorite book I have read this year is Outlaw Red by Jim Kejelgaard, although I can't say I have read it because I'm still reading it. Outlaw Red is about a show dog named Sean, who wants to be a hunting dog like his father Big Red. The book tells you how Sean dreams about running and hunting with his favorite trainer Danny Picket. He finally gets his wish, but not the way Sean expected! Sean was on the way to a show in an old rickety truck, when the truck jolted and he bursted out the back end of the truck. Not long after he was thrown into the wild, Sean starts to feel a gaping hole where companionship should be. On his adventures he runs across an Irish Setter, like himself, named Penny. After awhile Penny and Sean fall in love, and the only thing standing between them is a chicken wire fence. After much planning Penny finds a way to jump the fence. Penny and Sean are free to run in the wild."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"This is one of my favorite books out of all 3. In Big Red, Sean,Mike and their brothers are born leading to Irish Red, which is mostly about Mike the less attractive yet with the best nose of all and mentioned only a little bit is Sean the older and handsomest of the pups. Sean was never as energtic as Mike but in Outlaw Red, he is. He gets lost in the wilderness and finds a mate, which he must protect from a coyote. Its a wonderful book and I would recomend it to all who like animal-adventure stories and have read Kavik the Wolf Dog."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Set in the Wintapi a gorgeous setter,sean, has captured the heart of a young man. dumped into the wilderness, pampered sean must survive on his own with a ruthless coyote on his trail. If sean survives can the boy who loves him keep him for himself?"},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Others have said this is a great book, well written and uplifting. I absolutely agree. I'd like to respond to those who say the book is unbelievable. Not just show dogs, most dogs could not survive on their own in wilderness. In this case, three things should be considered. Irish Setters are hunting dogs. Sean had already sharpened his hunting instincts on the creatures he found near his kennel. The trapped creatures and suckers made all the difference. Can't say more. If you will keep these points in mind as you read, I think you'll agree the story is more believable than not. But anyway--it's a great read for young and old."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"This book as well as the other Big Red books were favorites of mine from childhood. They helped shape my love of dogs which I still have these many years later. I recomend this for book for all dog lovers young and old."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Another great dog story by Jim Kjelgaard! stories like this are not available any more and it's great that amazon is making them available for kindle. I have gotten all the Kjelgaard stories they currently have available and keep watching for more new releases."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"I bought this book used to complete the Kjelgaard series. They are written for young people (10-15 years old), but I had read the books at that age, loved them, remembered them fondly, and wanted to read them again.The 1st two in the series, Big Red, and Son of Big Red, I was able to purchase new. Outlaw Red was only available used from a bookseller on Amazon. I was a little reluctant, not sure of the reliability of the seller to deliver and the condition of the book. I need not have been. The book arrived sooner than expected and although it was advertised as \\"Good\\" condition, I think a better description would have been \\"Nearly New\\". The price was also quite acceptable, around $5.00 with just a few dollars shipping. I would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"I read this book when I was about ten years old, and I loved not only the fact that it was about dogs, but also that it was about surviving in the wilderness -- something that isn't instinctively easy for a purebred domesticated dog to do. And I loved that the story was about friendship between a human and an animal. Big Red, the first in the trilogy, has been recently reprinted. I would love to see Irish Red and Outlaw Red also reprinted, so that a new generation of children can read these books."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"As always Kjelgaard comes through with the third in the series. I was a sixth grade teacher and \\"Big Red\\" was required reading. Many of my \\"kids\\" went on to read the sequels, \\"Irish Red\\" and \\"Outlaw Red.\\" I think his best book was \\"Wild Trek\\", preceded by \\"Snow Dog.\\" Unfortunately, \\"Wild Trek\\" is out of print!"},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"One of the best of this series of books.

I first read this book about 35 years ago, and then, as now was still fascinated by the visual perceptions that the author presented. I feel the story is one that will keep the reader engrossed until the end. While I feel the intended audience is for late elementary and junior high aged readers, I ordered it because it was one of my favorites. I have read this author's entire line of books, and while I enjoyed them all, I feel this is my favorite. The book, itself, is larger than I remember the original being, but even after all these years, the story is just as vivid and compelling as it was then."},{"Title":"Outlaw Red","review":"Outlaw Red is based on real life events. The book might be fiction but all the events can happen in real life. This book is easy to understand and know what is going on. If you are the outdoors men type you will like this book. This book is full of adventure. This book has to do with the adventure of a man and a dog. I would recommend this book for people to read."},{"Title":"The life of Joseph Smith, the prophet","review":"This is a very old but still very well written biography. Its greatest strenth is the fact that George Q.Cannon met Joseph Smith and knew people who had known him most of his life. You can sense that Cannon had a deep respect and love for Joseph Smith. Of course this love and respect that Cannon had also leads to bias. Cannon does not speak much about controversial subjects in the life of Joseph Smith. There have been better biographies written about Joseph Smith since this one. Such as No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith by Fawn Brodie, this biography of course has a skeptical bias and is not always historically accurate. The most fair biography of Joseph Smith is \\"Joseph Smith the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill. However the best biographies of Joseph Smith are still to come. But any serious person who wants to study the life of Joseph Smith must look at this one by George Q. Cannon."},{"Title":"The life of Joseph Smith, the prophet","review":"This biography on the Prophet Joseph is the best biography written. President Cannon knew the Prophet personally which adds to his insights. With the exception of the biograpy by his mother, all other biogrpahies are repeats of President Cannon's."},{"Title":"One of Those Days (Share-a-story)","review":"A girl comes home from school with a few things that happened to her that day (none of them good) and the mother chuckles, and goes to tell her daughter what a day SHE has had. You will be chuckling more and more as the day goes on and she describes all the silly things (all very realistic) that happened to her. A real cute story that is also good for a beginning chapter book reader. It's small, interesting, and is enjoyable for children and adults both."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"Kudos to Wordsworth Classics for keeping these four books in print -- affordable, too! I've now read all but one of the Hannay adventures (this one, plus &quot;39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Mr. Standfast&quot;) and thoroughly enjoyed them all. &quot;Hostages&quot; moves a bit slower and doesn't have quite as much &quot;local flavor&quot; as the others; but it's a fine book, with much to recommend it and much to remember.I enjoyed especially the respectful portrait of Hannay's wife, every bit as smart and tough as he -- quite surprising in an era (and culture) that I had assumed would be somewhat chauvinistic -- and a real relief from other spy stories in which the women simply scream helplessly until The Man comes along. Mind you, I have no political agenda -- and indeed am quite conservative about gender roles; but I just find it so much more sensible and realistic when women characters act like human beings!&quot;Hostages&quot; is also remarkably prescient about the onset of WW2, and how Hitler would try to rule the world not merely through brute force but through propaganda and mass hysteria. There is also some fine thematic development here, esp. the notion that a spy mission may achieve &quot;success&quot; without &quot;victory.&quot;But the best thing about the book is its final chapter; as in &quot;Standfast,&quot; &quot;Hostages&quot; has a split climax; the main conflict is resolved about 35 pages before the end of the book, and then there's a further, more nitty-gritty, down-to-earth duel at the end. Fantastic!These books are great for folks looking for good old-fashioned adventure like James Bond, but without the girls and the violence.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"This is Buchan's fourth novel featuring Richard Hannay, hero of The Thirty-Nine Steps, and if you can pretend you are a somewhat naive reader in the 1920s and just sit back and enjoy the ride as if it were an old movie serial, you'll probably enjoy it very much. The story is set after World War I, with Hannay settled down, married and with a son. Manipulative evil still prowls the world, however, and Hannay's old spy boss Bullivant calls him out of retirement to deal with one threat in particular. As you can guess from the title, there is hostage-taking -- three times over -- and enigmatic clues to decipher and underlings to ferret out. Espionage jack-of-all-trades Sandy Arbuthnot is in on the action, as is Hannay's wife Mary, and an old wartime acquaintance of Hannay's makes an appearance as well. Admittedly, portions are melodramatic and hokey by today's standards, but it's still a rollicking good read, right up to the final confrontation between Hannay and his nemesis du jour."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"The story is pretty good, but paying 4 dollars for an ebook that is filled with the same errors and lack of pagination as the free Project Gutenberg version is ridiculous. What a waste of money..."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"I have enjoyed many of John Buchan's novels: The Thirty Nine Steps, John McNab, Huntingtower (especially amusing), The Island of Sheep. But this Richard Hannay novel is rather strange, involving the use of hypnotism as a means to gain political power. Most of his novels are rather far-fetched, but fun. I'd give this one a miss though. Really out-there!"},{"Title":"The Wind & the Veldt (Paperback Audio)","review":"On this cassette you'll hear two great Bradbury short stories. First off is \\"The Wind\\", in which a man believes the wind is trying to kill him. First he just seems paranoid to you, then gradually you begin to think it's possible! The ending is one of the most chilling ones you'll ever hear! I definitely suggest listening to this one in your car on a stormy, windy night to give yourself an extra scare every time the wind hits your windows. In \\"The Veldt\\", we hear about what happens when you let your children entertain themselves too long with a virtual reality nursery. The ending to this one is a little more predictable, but it's still one that will keep you listening until the very end! All in all, this whole collection of Durkin Hayes Audio Books of Ray Bradbury stories is a winning set, so get all of them you can. There isn't a single bad one in the batch!"},{"Title":"The Wind & the Veldt (Paperback Audio)","review":"I started listening to these with my daughter when she was 6 or [....]. She's 15 now and we still listen to them! Everytime we head out for a long road trip we grab this stash of tapes (there are others in the series) for entertainment. We have favorite quotes that we use from the series and can re-enact most of the scenes. The thing that makes these stories so great is that they use a full cast to act out the story instead of a single person reading it in a monotone voice. It's like old-time radio where the cast would act it out and they added in sound effects for the whole experience.We whole-heartedly recommend these!"},{"Title":"Yves Saint Laurent 5, avenue Marceau, 75116 Paris , France","review":"O.k. first, let me say, it's my own fault. With picture books it's best to have a look to see if you really want to spend the $. I didn't. I made an assumption that with YSL retiring this would be a retrospective of his glorious career. Not so. Fuzzy, boring, behind the scenes pictures of people at work in his atelier. Very few dresses and those shown aren't shown well. All in all a disappointment."},{"Title":"Yves Saint Laurent 5, avenue Marceau, 75116 Paris , France","review":"Though the producers and editors of this book have obviously taken great care and reverence in assembling the images seen in this hefty Rizzoli hardcover edition, it is nonetheless lacking.There is an eight-page, albeit in very-large typeface, essay extolling the philosophy behind the decades of YSL's influence and visions of modern fashion, as well as journal entries in Yves Saint Laurent's own handwriting that are written mostly in French. There are several famous quotes from him: among them the most famous of all \\"there is nothing more beautiful than a naked body.\\"The photographs number in the hundreds, though only a handful of family photographs from YSL's childhood in Oran, Algeria are captioned with names. Otherwise, the documentary's images shot mostly in the atelier at 5 avenue Marceau are without caption or description, though you can discern the sense of creativity and endless discussion that is the process of the haute couture. The masterpieces of tailleur (suits) and flou (dresses) are often one-of-a-kind. Their numbers are usually limited to one or two copies, so the 2000 or so women who can afford the prices are not likely to see someone else wearing that same opera coat or evening gown which ends up photographed in the society pages of Paris and New York among other places. If you are paying $50,000 for a hand-embroidered Lesage suit jacket, you don't want to see it on the shoulders of a half-dozen of your fellow couture followers. Ca marche pas!Most interestingly the editors did not include many quotes from some of Saint Laurent's inner circle, except for a small contribution from his life and business partner, Pierre Berge. There is one short blurb from Catherine Deneuve, but no words from Loulou de la Falaise or Betty Catroux, or even Marie Munoz, directrice of the YSL atelier for years. There are some very old press clippings from the 50s and 60s when YSL was hitting the peaks of creativity, but very little from the pinnacle of his career, which would be most of the 1970s. In the 70s we witnessed some of the greatest moments in fashion history with the Chinese and Russian collections that set the trends for womens' wear for years after the clothes were shown in Paris.The book is full of images, but short on text. For those who are unfamiliar with all the innovations introduced for women's clothing, their number is second only to that of those brought forth by Coco Chanel. Saint Laurent created the women's pantsuit, the \\"smoking\\" or women's tuxedo, the trenchcoat, the safari look, khaki, the list goes on and on. Seeing the documentary would be more than helpful, as it would fill in many of the gaps.A beautiful book that leaves you only wanting much more..."},{"Title":"Yves Saint Laurent 5, avenue Marceau, 75116 Paris , France","review":"If you are looking for a book about the designer YSL look somewhere else. If however you are interested in the flow of fashion design as done by YSL then this is a wonderful creation. To me it feels like a work of gratitude to all those involved behind the YSL name."},{"Title":"Penny Stock Winners","review":"This book is a huge scam. It gives worthless testimonials that tell you nothing about how to buy and sell Penny Stocks. Additionally, it is potentially the worst written book I have ever read. Riddled with typographical errors it appears to me an opportunity to fill up pages so that the author can make money rather than offering any real decent product. Additionally, it seems that the majority of the other reviews of this book were written either by the author of this book or by one of his close friends because they are nowhere near the truth. If you buy this book, do not say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"Penny Stock Winners","review":"First of all I would have rated this book only a quarter of one star but the lowest rating was one star. Now, after having said that I would like to say that there were a few penny stocks mentioned in this book but for the most part, stocks listed in this book were what I would categorize as low-priced stocks instead. How can you classify a stock trading as high as five dollars as a penny stock? In my mind, it's apples and oranges.I also did not think that bringing up religion in this book was relevant and I saw it mentioned over and over.I did like the Lou Dobbs interview and that was about it.For newcomers interested in penny stock investing stay away from this book because it has no value as far as I'm concerned.Sorry, Mr. Bowser but I returned the book for a credit."},{"Title":"Penny Stock Winners","review":"First let me say that although at least two chapters in this book are repeated verbatim in Max Bowser's other book, \\"Making Dollars with Pennies\\" (chapters I identified are \\"Wannabe Ostracized? Buy Minipriced Stocks\\" and \\"Why does Merrill Lynch hate $2 Stocks?\\"), this is definitely not the same book in a different cover and you are really missing out on a true gem if you don't get this one.In contrast to \\"Making Dollars with Pennies\\", which was more of a \\"how to\\" type of work, this book mainly consists of profiles of successful investors, which are for the most part excerpted from past editions of the Bowser Report (therefore, if you've been subscribing to the Bowser report for a while you've read practically everything in this book - still, it's refreshing to read it all bound up as a book). About two thirds of the profiles are of past or current subscribers who are following Bowser's \\"game plan\\" and doing well (although the figures are presented in a fuzzy manner). The remainder are various participants in the small cap stock market. Strangely, the one interview with a bona fide celebrity, Lou Dobbs of CNN, fell flat with me; he seemed out of his element.The subscriber/\\"Winners\\" represent a broad cross section of Middle America, with all of the everyday problems of regular people (divorce, illness, unemployment or a general lack of money to invest). A significant portion of those profiled have a military background, and they are not necessarily of the World War II generation where military service was well nigh universal in men. Bowser himself retired from the military before starting his \\"Bowser Report\\" in the 1970s and one suspects that perhaps his subscriber base grew through word-of-mouth among military people. If there is anything in particular that sets the winners apart, it's that they all appear to be self-starters who are willing to stick to their guns with investment ideas and let the chips fall where they may. They also appear to show significant emotional maturity towards their investments. Although they often invest in companies profiled in Bowser's Report, they tend to view the investments as \\"their\\" picks, whether the stocks ultimately end up winning or losing. They don't run to Bowser and whine.Although I don't know specifically how many people subscribe to the Bowser Report, Bowser's market strength is alluded to in the book more than once, particularly in the days following when Bowser issues a buy recommendation on his \\"Company of the Month\\". As Bobby Cohen, a market maker, reports on page 176:\\"Max, on the Monday after you pick a Company of the Month - there is a huge number of buy orders. A market maker doesn't have to be a rocket scientist to know there's something happening with the stock.\\"Because the interviews in this book span the 1990s, one can see in retrospect how much the internet has changed the investing landscape, such as when Lenny, interviewed sometime around 1996, remarks [p. 75]:\\"Do you realize how difficult it is for a guy sitting here in a small town in Maine to get the phone numbers of these companies [that Bowser covers]?\\"I rate this book so highly not because any particular investor in this book is brilliant. In fact, they each appear to have significant flaws. The impressiveness of the work comes from seeing the American everyman & woman grapple with independence in a stock market that is blatantly not set up to serve them first. Rather, it is geared towards mutual funds, pension funds, brokers, etc., all of the big players. To see all of these people go against the grain and succeed is very heartening."},{"Title":"Penny Stock Winners","review":"In response to a Spotlight Review by a reader from Shoreline, WA, on February 28, 2004, who had comments about my book &quot;Penny Stock Winners.&quot; In this critical review, the person was prinicipally dissatisfied because there were only a few penny stocks listed in the book. About this, we have two comments:(1) There are two definitions of penny stocks. One is of a stock that sells for under $1.00. The other one, which is sanctioned by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, is that any issue under $5.00 is a penny stock. The reviewer from Shoreline is only concerned with the stocks under $1.00.(2) The book was not written with the intention of listing stocks. Instead, as the title indicates, it is the case histories of subscribers to our newsletter, &quot;The Bowser Report,&quot; who have successfully followed our investment techniques. Those techniques are explained in detail in two other books I have written, both of which are available on Amazon and elsewhere--&quot;Making Dollars with Pennies&quot; and &quot;Guaranteed Profits.&quot; And, furthermore, in each of these books, there is a coupon which entitles the reader to request a free sample copy of &quot;The Bowser Report,&quot;--the only newsletter published for stocks $3.00 a share or less--which lists many penny stocks each month.All three of the books mentioned are published by Marathon International Book Co., Madison, IN, jwortham@seidata.com.---R.

If that is you, then this book may be fine for you. If you only want to run the wizards & menus & little else, great. I happen to use Win-XP on some machines, and have a D-Link DI-624 on one. But I actually was hoping to learn more, and this book disappointed me. I'm taking it back to Barnes & Noble.The authors use acronyms(initials) but usually make you go to the index to find out what the initials stand for. Seldom is there an explanation of what it really means. Sometimes the acronyms/initials are not defined, and at least once, the initials were defined two ways at two points in the book (see MAC as medium access control on page 90 and media access control on page 123 & the index).What I really disliked is the total omission of Linux, a bunch of the technologies & components involved in wireless, and a good explanation of the basics. This book omits way to much for me. The authors apparantly think readers do not need to understand wireless technology basics. I'm not looking for wireless network certification or employment, just good basic understanding and this book doesn't have it. It does have some good material for the newbie, and is not overly verbose, so 3 stars."},{"Title":"Pc Magazine Wireless Solutions","review":"This 414 page guide is a great resource for readers who are ready to create their first wireless network, or extend their current wired network with wireless features.

The Author never talks over your head, but doesn't insult your intelligence either. The book is rich with photos, computer screen captures, and diagrams, and the Authors have made generous use of sidebars and notes.Chapter 8 Security Tips and Tricks had some enhancements that I was not already using (including a cool honeypot solution), and I thought that Chapter 14 Setting Up an Entertainment Network had a lot to offer.The book also has some chapters in its last part on wireless solutions for mobile, and office which build and expand on information in the previous chapters. However, these are a bit thin, and probably things most network admins already know.The real value in this book is its great guidance for building, extending and expanding a home network with wireless technologies.

The best way to find out is through prayer. So I prayed,and the results were the GOD'S WORD TRANSLATION.The word of God has undergone many changes as far as versions,and/or translations are concerned and sometimes trying to decide whats best for you can be over whelming.Each Bible offers a certain feature that the others don't,and you think sticking to the \\"authorized versions\\" is the only way to go because of our traditions.But I want to say contrary to popular belief;I believe the various translations, no matter how hard it may be for the traditionalist to receive this opinion,that this is God's way of making His word more plain,simple,easy to understand and more crystal clear and available to us.Sometimes you just want to curl up with something plain, and simple to read and something you can enjoy without feeling like you have to do a lot of work and have alot of tools in order to hear God speak to your heart.Life can be hard enough without us making getting to know God intimately that much harder.When I recieved my GOD'S WORD TRANSLATION,It was like God had opened the flood gates of heaven and all of the chambers in the seas broke forth all over again.So,when I prayed Lord, open the eye's of my understanding, He gave me the GOD'S WORD TRANSLATION.Thou Knowest not That Thou Doest when Thine eyes Gazeth not Hither to The GOD'S WORD TRANSLATION of the BIBLE.This way of speaking is not \\"THE HEAVENLY LANGUAGE\\". It is the way people spoke at that time period, and the way God spoke to them.Now God wants to speak to us today in our language so we can understand Him.This Bible is perfect for the babe and mature in Christ.It is great for study,teaching and preaching, and private devotions etc.To me, this is another one of God's ways of saying I LOVE YOU so we can really know and understand that. I would find it hard to read the Bible sometimes. It became dull and boring, but now since I have my GWT I am excited to read my bible again and I'm happy to say that my desire to read the Bible is being renewed and restored thanks to my GOD'S WORD TRANSLATION of the BIBLE."},{"Title":"Woman in Prison: Gender and Social Control","review":"This book was meant to expose women's studies majors to criminology and criminal justice majors to women's studies. Otherwise, it really offers nothing new.If every single chapter says, \\"Female inmates have it harder than male inmates because they are primary caretakers and miss their children,\\" then why have a whole chapter on the topic. If every chapter says, \\"Disproportionate numbers of female inmates have been abused in their lives,\\" then why have a separate chapter on the topic. I guess I'm touching upon the repetitiveness of the book. bell hooks says she is repetitive because many readers only find one chapter of her books, not the whole thing. Perhaps the editor here too assumed that readers would only read select chapters.The book doesn't really prove that female inmates have it worse than their male counterparts. It says such inmates are derided by being called \\"ladies.\\" Hello! \\"Ladies\\" is a term of respect, as in \\"Ladies and gentlemen.\\" It says only women are treated like children in prison, but I am sure that male inmates would disagree with that assertion.The book repeats that disproportionate numbers of American female inmates are of color, yet the only chapter to mention \\"race\\" in its title is one on British prisons where women of color are a minority.This may be a good book for novices, but otherwise, it simply is not a strong text."},{"Title":"Understanding the French Revolution","review":"Seventeen interesting essays examine aspects of the culture and situation in France leading up to the Revolution and specific issues during the Revolution itself. It focuses mostly on the petty bourgeoisie, as would seem logical because the book was written by one of the best known Marxist historians of the French Revolution, Albert Soboul.Among other things, these essays examine the emergence of capitalism, the complex character of the class structure in France, the attitude toward work of the artisan and laborer, the dispute over maximum wage legislation, the social background of those involved in the Babeuf conspiracy, the influence of religion on the popular culture, and the attitude toward the 'Red Priests.'This work is not an introduction to the Revolution or an explanation of it as a whole as expected by the previous reviewer. What it does is give insight on many specific aspects to those who already know the basic events and characters.The author, Albert Soboul, was chair of the History of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne for many years until his death in 1982."},{"Title":"Understanding the French Revolution","review":"\\"Understanding the French Revolution\\" assumed that the reader already knew all about the French Revolution.Names and events were introduced without explanations; competing factions were referred to but not defined until many chapters later. Idiosyncrasies, such as calendar revisions, were not explained. For the novice like me, it meant piecing things together and hoping I got most of the pieces.The revolution was led by financial, mercantile, and manufacturing enterprises that wanted power commensurate with their wealth. This book mentions the \\"leading role\\" of the \\"big bourgeoisie;\\" however, it was entirely devoted to conflicts between various factions of the petty bourgeoisie.This book does present most of the relevant facts about the revolution, but the book is poorly organized and lacks a unifying theme. It is not easy reading."},{"Title":"A history of conservative Baptists,","review":"This was one of the textbooks we had when I took a class on Baptist History and Distinctives at Southwestern Conservative Baptist Bible College, also known as Southwestern College. It took me 30 years to read it through.This will not be the most interesting book unless you are interested in theological history in general or in the Conservative Baptist Association Of America in specific. But if you are, it is a great source of information of a group that is trying to achieve the Biblcal balance between being too inclusive and too exclusive.Point of interest #1 -- This is a story of a group of conservatives that have a desire to be salt in a group where the leadership is at odds with them during the early and mid 20th century, which eventually come to a point where there is no choice but to split.Point of interest #2 -- It deals with a group that is committed to the autonomy of the local church both in reacting to a centralized denomination and efforts to keep from making the same mistake.Point of interest #3 -- While not directly a book about missions, it deals with a movement born with missions. It tells about the formation of three different missions group, particularly the CBFMS and CBHMS, both of which have changed names a couple of times since. The final chapter has some exciting missions stories from the 60's.Point of interest #4 -- It has a section where a balanced group had to contend with a more narrow minded group and how to keep peace in dealing with the problem.While the focus is on the CBAA, it also touches on the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC) and the Baptist General Conference (Swedish Baptists), which also came out of the Northern Baptist Convention (now known as American Baptist).The book has an Acts 28 ending. It is open ended because the history has continued in the three decades since the book was written.Jeff Reynolds"},{"Title":"Teen Queens and Has-Beens (Truth or Dare)","review":"The third installment in Cathy Hopkins's Truth or Dare series features Lia, daughter of a famous '80s rocker. Lia recently started going to school near her home after years of boarding in London. She loves her friends --- Cat, Becca, Squidge and Mac --- and just wants to fit in.Popular \\"teen queen\\" Kaylie mentions that she likes Jonno, who in turn asks Lia out. Now Kaylie has it in for Lia, and starts a subtle bullying campaign that has Lia in knots every time she goes to school.The pranks increase and get more serious, and Lia now thinks about returning to her school in London. But her new friends are not ready to give her up yet, and encourage her to stand up for herself. She tries to reason with Kaylie, but the girl is bent on humiliating Lia in any way she can. Lia also tries avoidance and shrinks within herself, attempting not to attract notice. The last thing Lia wants is a big confrontation, but soon she realizes that lots of other girls are bullied by Kaylie and her friends as well. It's time for it all to end.Hopkins tackles the serious issue of girl bullying in the midst of an enjoyable story.

She is still adjusting to her new life in Cornwall. Lia had loved her old school, but ended up boarding there when her parents moved to a new home, far from London. She missed her family and decided to live at home and start over at a new school. She has made some great friends there, particularly Cat, Becca, Mac and Squidge. But she wonders how she will fit in at this new school. Her dad is a famous rock star. Her mother is beautiful, her brother and sister are popular and outgoing and Lia feels invisible, no matter how beautiful everyone says she is. She wants to conceal her parents' wealth and her father's fame from her new schoolmates, hoping to fit in with the rest of the crowd.Kaylie O'Hara is teen queen of the new school, along with her group of Clones. She has set her sights on newly unattached Jonno Appleton, the most popular boy in their class. But to Lia's surprise, Jonno is interested in her, not Kaylie. While Lia is flattered by the attention, she fears that Kaylie will be out for revenge. Sure enough, Kaylie and the Clones set out to make Lia's life miserable. No matter what Lia does, Kaylie has zeroed in on her as target and the bullying begins. Kaylie starts rumors, humiliates Lia at every turn, making sure that whatever she does cannot be pinned on her. This causes Lia's self-confidence to take a nosedive, wondering if she is imagining that Kaylie is behind this mess. She is also confused over who her real friends are. In the satisfying resolution of this book, Kaylie gets her comeuppance and is exposed for the bully she is, and has always been.It is sad and disturbing to realize how prevalent this kind of bullying is these days, typified not only by the experiences of so many young girls, but brought jarringly to our attention by recent movies such as Mean Girls and 13 Going on 30. It is important to teach children that bullying of any kind is never acceptable and that keeping silent is toxic to their self-esteem and relationships with others.American readers might have a bit of trouble understanding some of the British colloquialisms, but the message in this book is well worth the effort. The writing is authentic and it is apparent that Cathy Hopkins has done her research well, delving into the psyches of young teens and creating characters who will be immediately recognizable to her readers."},{"Title":"Teen Queens and Has-Beens (Truth or Dare)","review":"i learned a lot from this book especially about cliques, and friends, and that its hard sometimes for girls at that age to get along.

Prayers by Malcolm Boyd","review":"Malcolm Boyd (born 1923) is an American Episcopal Priest, author, and civil rights and gay activist. He was known in the '60s as \\"The Espresso Priest\\" for his religiously-themed poetry-reading sessions at the \\"Hungry i\\" nightclub in San Francisco (the period for which this 1965 book relates). In 1977 he came \\"out of the closet\\" (see his book,Gay Priest: An Inner Journey).The book's title relates to this excerpt from a prose poem: \\"Where am I running? You know these things I can't understand. It's not that I need to have you tell me. What counts most is just that somebody knows, and it's you. That helps a lot. So I'll follow along, okay? But lead, Lord. Now, I've got to run. Are you running with me, Jesus?\\" (Pg. 19)Concerning the plight of an assembly line worker, he wrote, \\"His work is monotony to the point that he sometimes thinks he'll fall asleep---that, or start running down wild down the assembly line... A fiery hell would be an exciting prospect for him to look forward to, Lord. Can he be brought to life, Jesus? What could life and his work really mean to him?\\" (Pg. 39)He visits a gay bar, and observes, \\"This isn't very much like a church, Lord, but many members of the church are also here in this bar. Quite a few of the men here belong to the church as well as to this bar. If they knew how, a number of them would ask you to be with them in both places. Some of them wouldn't, but won't you be with them, too, Jesus?\\" (Pg. 106)While in church, he muses, \\"Help us, Lord, who claim to be your special people. Don't let us feel privileged and selfish because you have called us to you. Teach us our responsibilities to you, our brother, and to all the people out there. Save us from the sin of loving religion instead of you.\\" (Pg. 137)The \\"radical '60s priest\\" thing is kind of pass&eacute;, of course.

Anthony Quinn, perhaps best known as Zorba the Greek, is only one of many actors whose Mexican origins were once concealed, and there are many others whose Latino roots have only recently come to public attention, ranging from Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Cansino) to John Gavin (born John Anthony Golenar) to Raquel Welch (born Raquel Tejada). And it was a young Emilio Estevez who boldly reclaimed his own Latino family history and thus revealed to the world that the real name of his father, Charlie Sheen, is Ramon More often Latino actors found themselves in an awkward dilemma in Hollywood, as the authors of &quot;Hispanics in Hollywood&quot; point out--if their Latino identities were not concealed, they were put to use in depicting stereotyped Latino characters: &quot;maids, slum dwellers, drug addicts and gang members,&quot; co-author Luis Reyes reminds us, or &quot;cruel dictators, mustachioed bandits and beautiful se&ntilde;oritas.&quot; Only in the last couple of decades have Latino actors and directors enjoyed the opportunity to tell stories about their own heritage in a more open, honest and affirming voice in movies such as &quot;Zoot Suit,&quot; &quot;La Bamba,&quot; &quot;Stand and Deliver,&quot; &quot;Selena&quot; and &quot;A Walk in the Clouds.&quot; Reyes, a movie publicist who is also a chronicler of Hollywood's Latin American heritage, describes the book as &quot;an attempt to show the way Hollywood has depicted Hispanic Americans and Latin America, while also pointing out the contributions to Hollywood movies and television made by unsung Hispanic Americans as well as those more famous.&quot; Thus, his book can be approached as a serious effort to ponder the issues of race and ethnicity in American pop culture and, at the same time, as one of those useful reference works that can be pulled down from the shelf when puzzling over some old and obscure movie on cable."},{"Title":"Hispanics In Hollywood (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","review":"Bravo Mr. Reyes for such a deeply researched, sensitively written, book blooming with photographs of Hispanics in Hollywood celebrated over 100 years. Indeed, this was needed many years ago, especially in my start as a high school teacher in a predominantly Latino/Latina high school for 28 years. Zoot Suit was culturally affirming for East Los Angeles. The unique style and political statements opened up new worlds of research re Latino/a film. And look at the power of Teatro Campesino, and its earlier form in La Carpa, in making political statements regarding exploitation of the Mexican worker. And now, in your book, we get to look back at the contributions made in earlier times we did not know of, and contemporary times.The world of prejudice and stereotyping is So complex and being examined now in organizations such as Facing History and Ourselves,and college texts that reveal an array of a variety of cultures in America, especially of the tension between adapting and keeping two cultural worlds within and without.Alas, there are intracultural prejudices too. Sometimes more established Latinos/as make fun of the recently arrived as wetbacks. In Jewish society, those who were in the US longer than the recently arrived Jews--called them \\"greenhorns\\".I loved so much of this book and have given it five stars. I also liked the preface tremendously. I too had the experience of watching films for content and style, and pausing for the film to permeate me as long as it could. At that time, I was particularly interested in the psychological depth, and the unique style of filming of the unconscious as well as the conscious world in Fellini, Truffaut, Bergman, and many others perhaps forgotten now, and of course Bunuel. I was lucky to see and read \\"The Boom\\". \\"The Boom\\" exploded with new styles as Mexican and Latin American writers were celebrated for literary, artistic,and cinematic innovations, such as \\"Magical Realism, that weaves around history and political realities.Now, I would like to gently approach one line (what writer doesn't have one or many) that troubled me. You mention that \\"Most\\" of early Hollywood was controlled by Eastern European Jews.This is not really true in light of all cultures who contributed to Hollywood's start, and it itself is a stereotype that a number of books are now discussing.This belief about Jews dominating the film world actually fueled more anti-semitism than already existed severely in this country, where most Jewish immigrants were severely poor. You question why these \\"predominantly\\" Jewish promoters did not discuss their own culture. First of all--in diaspora, there were the German Jews who were more assimilated in Germany, and hence probably could have the skills and education denied Jews in Poland and Russia, and alas, Mediterranean Jews were often denied the right (many self taught while enduring backbreaking work only allowed them.)And yet, they did forge a cultural works such as Yiddish theatre, books, and poetry,in America. They created while working 14 hour jobs and striking in times that treated them far more violently than strikers are treated today.These people demonstrated for All workers. This paved the way for our own work worlds to have the right to breaks, sick time, health benefits, vacation time, an 8 hour day,and unions to protect those rights. They were joined by other oppressed cultures who worked along side them such as Italians and others, forming a multi-cultural comraderie that is so needed in our world today.Actually, it is seen that there was much imitation of elitist European culture in early films. American themes came later. And alas--how complicated this was in our forging and reforging this country's identity. America was steeped in anti-semitism (and of course--hatred of all considered \\"the other\\". Early German immigrants in America faced disdain.The Irish, when looking for work, saw signs that read \\"Irish Need Not Apply. Later on, some people of these backgrounds forgot that they were scorned as new immigrants arrived. So you see, so many groups in this country have not had their stories told.If there was a pitch for a movie about pogroms, it would not have sold--maybe if Errol Flynn flew in to swashbuckle those killing and raping sprees. Or, what would have saved a pitch about a Jewish family headed for a beach where the sign read \\"No Jews or Dogs allowed\\"? An exhibition from a few years ago called Degenerate Art (art that Nazi's banned) showed a big nosed and walleted series of series of movie and music producers, for Monkey like looking African-Americans ( inferior to the Nazis also) playing jazz (banned in Nazi Germany).Actually, true art in film has been noted to have been brought in by German emigre artists both non-Jewish and Jewish, who were not free to do their form of art, especially abstraction, in Nazi Germany. Also, they left a regime they knew was appalling.Therefore, in the term \\"most\\"( re Jews), there needs to be a bit more study. The truth is, if one filmed about life in Mexico, it would be very different in Jalisco and Oaxoca--because the cultures are different. Gabriel Garcia's Columbian world and Carlos Fuentes' world in Mexico would be different. At my school, the Goths and the Rockers live in different universes. Does this read as a bash? No!!!The book is fantastic and a must read for all cultures! Prejudice of the\\"other\\" we do not know needs to be perpetually unbound. And wow--what an incredible array of Latino/a film history. All should grab it as a must read!!I am so glad, at this time in film, we see Chinese Americans,films from Bombay, Syria, Armenian themes--and many previously unsung cultures in our theaters.We are now seeing the truth told about many atrocities such as the treatment of Native-Americans (here first)--for instance, the smallpox virus placed in American Indian blankets, as a form of genocide. There is knowledge imparted of exploitation of other immagrants--for instance, the shooting of some Chinese American railroad workers for \\"pay\\".As for all the new styles and representations of all cultures (look at this year's (2009) many awards for Slum-dog Millionaire), filmed in India. These are added cultural fabrics, with textures and threads of expression that expand our global awareness.In this sense, we grow in cultural understanding and the culture of ourselves (I believe each person Is a singular identity of many cultural influences). As long as this review is, I think I could write a book because cultural pride, and intra-cultural love and understanding are so important to me. And Do know I am savoring every page of Hispanics in Hollywood. No one will eat Fritos thinking of The Frito Bandito,or drool over the Tiajuana stereotype of loose women easy to pay for \\"a moment\\"! Let's cover those on Hollywood Blvd or all over instead...yes?Thank God there are no more of those snoozing Mexican sobreros hiding the sleeping Mexican, denoting the Mexican as comical and lazy (and if anyone has one--bash it)!Though I may speak of objects or books not filmed--they were certainly influences.I must also say that I know Mr. Reyes as eclectic, a wordsmith, an activist, and an educator. When Zoot Suit came out, Mr. Reyes spoke about the field of publicity , while imparting information about the production of Zoot Suit to my the students, who were were given tickets and other fun items. We were all ecstatic with the \\"prep\\" for the film!Our students were also given free tickets to a film called Triumph of the Spirit (not\\"of the will\\") the Nazi propaganda film. A number of my students, predominantly Latino, came to see the film about a Greek Jewish boxer survivor in Auschwitz. This is not named in the credits of the films Mr. Reyes has publicized, listed in Hispanics in Hollywood.I saw my students sobbing while watching Triumph of the Spirit, even some big guys sitting next to me. This is what we want--to break through and feel all of our pains and triumphs in this diverse country.In your talk at our school, Mr. Reyes said: look at us--all different cultures, colors (class is another issue)-\\"-Beautiful!\\" When I also taught at a State College, where I had a real United Nations of students, it was so great that at the end, they spoke of misconceptions of each other at the beginning, and how they changed.Do know I am celebrating this book as a contribution to Global understanding. I did want Mr. Reyes to know that a single stereotypical line we can All make, can hurt. As one student of mine in a Facing History and Ourselves class said, you can remove a bullet, but you cannot remove a hurtful misunderstanding. And I know you are one who believes in the same thing.Incidentally, I would really like to see a film about a kid growing up loving film on the upper West Side of New York, who is from Puerto Rico. Plus, I applaud your work in probing Hawaii in film. I loved seeing photos of Robert Louis Stevenson visiting and merging in Hawaiian culture. When I went to a hotel where a lot of stars went, it saddened me to see Queen Liliokalani and family in stiff Victorian attire they felt they had to wear.I am looking forward to more of your works (and films?). The cinema permeates so much of the psyche, letting us venture into other worlds, and the worlds of others, as both of us experienced in our youth and later.Oh--just a little bit of history to end you may be interested in. Max Factor, who came from an Orthodox Jewish family in the old world and had made the wigs Jewish married women wore, introduced wigs to Hollywood! Also, he changed the world of the pancake make-up. In fact, he invented the science of make-up that inspired all women to wear it. My students saw the Max Factor Museum that had the red haired room, blonde, brunette, etc.Guess where his original house is? It is in Boyle Heights (East LA) and inhabited by the parents of some friends of mine. Boyle Heights started out as a Jewish neighborhood--actually you might say \\"to keep Them with their own.\\" Then came Russians, and Latinos, African Americans, and Japanese (sadly ripped away later by the Japanese interment camps)...and others. The community was mainly very radical. There is a wonderful documentary called Meet Me at Brooklyn and Soto. A woman recalls that the high school I taught in, Roosevelt High, had true cultural harmony--and pride days. In fact, many Jewish families watched over the Japanese homes to make sure there was no hateful pillaging!As an afterthought regarding Jews not telling their stories, what about the first Talkie, The Jazz Singer with Al Jolson? In it, he is a Cantor's son (singer in synagogue) whose father wants him to follow in his footsteps. But Jolson is torn, because in his character, he wants to be a jazz musician...which he pursues instead. This was filmed at the largest and probably most exquisite Jewish temple in Boyle Heights, now (or the last time I saw it) full of pigeons and Graffiti. So, there you go re Jewish themes in film. (Just look away when you see Jolson's \\"blackface\\" make-up as he sings \\"Mammy\\"). Once again--here is the tension and triumph all of us face in our multi-cultural country and world.

Comenius: \\"The Labyrinth of the world and the paradise of the heart\\" (1623) Comenius gives a representation of his own life experiences in the 17th century. But &quot;The Labyrinth&quot; are in my opinion relevant also to-day, when educators discuss the present situation in our society and culture. Comenius confronts us with a series of critical questions. Examples: Chapter 7.4 : What is the true nature of man, behind the masks, behind the roles? Chapter 7.6 and 9.7-8 : Are the things we do and the things we produce and consume really useful and necessary? Chapter 7.8 : Are our physical surroundings, our institutions and social structures organized to prevent our fellow beings from stumbling and falling? Are we cynical to others and insensitive to the suffering of others? Comenius is not naively optimistic. He describes life as a labyrinth, a more difficult one than the classical Greek model. The entrance is our birth, the exit is our death. Both are blurred in darkness. People are moving towards the east, to the castle of Fortuna, to Happiness seen as wealth, pleasures and honour, and to the queen of the world: &quot;Her Most Gracious Queen Wisdom&quot;, in Chapter 33.1 unveiled as Vanity, with painted, swollen face, a foul breath and a disgusting body. The pilgrim in &quot;The Labyrinth&quot; has two &quot;helpers&quot;: the inquisitive guide &quot;Find-out-everything&quot; and the interpreter &quot;Mirage&quot; who is blurring all problems by soothing words, so the problems seem to be harmless. Both are the Queen's men. The pilgrim is tempted by the first to a mania for novelty, continuously inquiring new problems; by the second he is tempted to resign, to be satisfied by half-truths. However, he resists seduction by these helpers, thanks to his own personal view. He is not always looking through the glasses they have given him, and therefore he is not led astray by superficial inquiry or accumulated &quot;wisdom&quot;. Everywhere searching &quot;the highest good&quot;, summum bonum, (Preface to &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;), he finds only a terrible truth: Nothing in life is absolutely good. The famous Czech humanist, Jan Patocka (Die Philosophie der Erziehung des J.A. Comenius, 1971), interprets &quot;The Labyrinth&quot; as a pretheoretical myth or story, anticipating modern existential analysis: Our minds are scattered and directed by others. We fail to comprehend ourselves and try to run away from ourselves and our limited existence. When, in his despair, the pilgrim finally cries to God, though he is not sure of God's existence, he is awakened by a voice calling him to go into his own heart. There he finds an inner ruin akin to the rotten situation in the labyrinth. But to this chaotic heart, Christ comes as a guest, and the personal appearance of Christ immediately attracts the pilgrim. A relationship of trust is founded. He therefore opens his ears to listen to the words of Christ. He is initiated in Christian practice and teaching, makes a total conversion to God, gives his senses, reason, heart and will to God and joins the invisible fellowship of believers. For them all things are relative, except one: to keep the good relationship with God. Therefore the pilgrim gets new glasses through which it is easier to see the vanity in the world and the joy in God. The frame is the Bible, and the lens is the Holy Spirit. (Chapter 36-41). I think we misunderstand &quot;The Paradise of the Heart&quot; by interpreting it as a way out of &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;, if this is understood as a way to complete openness. In my reading of &quot;The Paradise of the Heart&quot;, I have not found this notion of &quot;getting out of the labyrinth&quot;. On the contrary, Comenius' clear message is that the labyrinth has to loose its power within our heart (Chapter 37 and 38). We are not leaving the labyrinth, but the labyrinth should no longer be allowed to occupy and govern us (Chapter 43). If Christ is God, the absolute true and good, he is able to amend the inner labyrinth of man. He creates order within, and gives man strength to live in the world, live in the outer labyrinth without resignation, facing the problems in a flexible and fruitful way. If Christ is not God, then Comenius' insistence on a total surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Chapter 38.3 and 39.3), the crucified (Chapter 50.4), is just another variant of fanaticism. Stein M. Wivestad"},{"Title":"Death sty : a pig's tale : a novel","review":"Death Sty: A Pig's Tale is an amazing, original, thought-provoking piece of fiction. I feel compelled to first say what this book is not: it is not an expose of the shocking cruelty taking place in slaughterhouses, nor is it a vehicle in which the author tries to convince you to become a vegetarian. This is basically a pig's story of his life and its grand purpose. This is no ordinary pig, however; he is a philosopher, political theorist, and sociologist blessed with amazing insight. Our unnamed narrator describes his current life inside a small enclosure at a slaughterhouse, referring back to his days of youth and continually looking forward to the day when his ultimate goal will be achieved. That ultimate goal is nothing less than his slaughter; he glories in the thought of his posthumous legacy as food for humankind. He devotes himself to forming the best hocks, ham, blood sausage, etc. He explains the course of his life, even providing a statistical chart showing his estimates of how much he weighed at each step of weaning, fasting, braking, etc. He knows full well what will happen to him when he reaches the butcher's domain, almost delighting in the communication of each step of the final process. Although he is alone throughout the course of his tale, he describes pig society, quotes famed pig thinkers, and laments those pigs who foolishly wish to make a mockery of their lives by resisting their glorious destinies. While he views the butcher as a god of sorts, he does have much to say about swineherds. He can barely tolerate these base men who see fit to come tramping nastily into his home any time they want and insist on putting his water bucket in the middle of his enclosure, where it naturally restricts his predilection for diagonal movement, rather than beside his trough. It is these same swineherds who have perpetuated so many lies about pigkind, he declares, while they are really the nasty beings who themselves, rather than hogs, live in sty-like squalor.He expresses thoughts of rebelling against the swineherd, often in subtle ways, but he has no use for mass porcine action against man. This pig is basically a political thinker whose complex views often ring with religious overtones--after all, paradise for the pig is found at the hands of the butcher. He disdains those pigs too shallow to understand their true purpose. Most interestingly, he decries the thought of being taken out of his enclosure and being allowed outside--he would resist this by all means at his disposal, even though he has fond memories of a short time in the meadows as a young piglet. The thought of his brethren escaping the slaughterhouse is an affront to his sensibilities. Such an act betrays the very heritage of pigkind.Clearly, this is political and social satire at a high level. One reading is not sufficient to truly understand everything the author is trying to communicate. The religious connotations immersed in the story are quite subtle and in no way offensive, but it is the pig's thoughts on politics and pig society that make this book so thought-provoking. I would say this is essentially a work of natural philosophy clothed in the guise of brilliant satire. Its originality, subtlety, and universality afford this short novel an honored position in my library of literary treasures."},{"Title":"A Killer in Winter (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)","review":"The excellent pseudonymal Susanna Gregory returns with her ninth installment of the Matthew Bartholomew chronicles and doesn't disappoint. From the prologue where the messenger Josse's accidental death turns out to be a boon for someone and the death of Norbert, laconic brother of the now retired Sheriff of Cambridge's, Richard Tulet, Gregory settles into her latest mystery with effortless ease, instantly creating a a tuly piscine tale with both plot and scene with that easy familiarity that is her hallmark.We plunge into a humorous opening with Michael's ridiculous attempts to spy on a Cambridge newcomer, Harysone, based on personal dislike and demanding Matthew declare the man's insanity without actually meeting him before swiftly finding another corpse in Michaelhouse's church. The anticipation of the coming Christmas means that Michael is forced to choose which murder to investigate first and Bartholomew's life is complicated by the return of his once-betrothed - Phillipa Abigny.Phillipa is drastically changed from the woman who left him to marry the fishmonger and Mayor of London-desiree, Turke and both she and her brother, Giles Abigny arrive to stay at Edith and Stanmore's house.Murder and mayhem swiftly follow as Christmas sets in, Michaelhouse electing Deynham its twelve day Lord of Misrule. Unlike in Gregory's previous offering up at Ely, the murdered body count is low this time (though the eventual tally is high after it turns out everyone was culpable to some degree and ends up dying to tie up all the loose ends). There is Norbert, the dead \`beggar' in St Michael's is discovered to be Gosslinge, Turke's servant and Turke himself dies suspiciously after literally skating on thin ice. Gregory kills off the old rivermen from preceding novels, Aethelbad and Dunstan as the harsh winter takes its toll (there's more snow that Cambridge has ever seen since!) and we unravel more of the shadowy political dealings that weave through Cambridge.Amongst it all runs the mysterious Dympna, a charitable organisation that ends up having a sideline, the Chepe Waits (comprising Frith, Makejoy, Jestyn and Dyna) a travelling band of thieving jugglers, the newly arrived and dislikeable Quenhyth, Sheriff Morice's corruption and a game of camp ball (ancient football). Ovying hostel gets a thorough runout with its head, Ailred. All of which has both Matthew and Michael scratching their heads at all the clues but unable to make sense of the sequence of events. The key to it all, in a delightful piece of murder mystery irony, is the Fraternity of fishmen and the protagonists relationships to each other.So, by the time Matthew ends up in a barn having a particularly nasty hayfork jabbed at him during his attempt to free both Michael and Kenyngham we have had a double denouement, the lengthy first answering most of the questions but not all, the second culminating in the fight and the final two culprits racing off with the charitable gold and falling into the icy river. At the end the body count is high (though most of them are a grim justice), Matthew's relationship with Phillipa is resolved (we get the hint somewhat to Mathilde's relief) and the twelve day debacle provides levity throughout.Right now, there is no better historical murder writer out there. Gregory's style, prose, plot and descriptive writing makes fourteenth century Cambridge immensely plausible, her characters are well crafted and empathic and, above all, the reader is left craving more. A truly fishy tale has been created here and Gregory has done nothing to make her audience even want her to lay down her pen. An author at the height of her literary powers."},{"Title":"A Killer in Winter (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)","review":"This is such an odd book. I've read all the Matthew Bartholomew books and enjoyed them a lot but this one has such a disconnect from the others that it seems that the author either has forgotten much that happened in previous books and seems to be reminding herself from notes of certain things or for some reason feels compelled to go over a lot of ground already covered. The character of Thomas Suttone appeared in \\"A Masterly Murder\\" but was killed off and now reappears with a completely different persona. The book is rambling and very off kilter. It's always easy to spot Gregory's villians because they are always the nicest, salt-of-the-earth types who turn out to be cold blooded killers. The fun is trying to figure out the motives which are often so convoluted that much time is spent explaining them. One wonders how Bartholomew and Brother Michael manage to figure them out since throughout most of the books they are almost willfully obtuse! The best part of the series is the historical aspect but this time Gregory seems to be trying too hard. She spends a lot of time explaining clothing which is unusual for her. It's almost as if she came across a book of costume and decided that she should be more descriptive regarding what her medieval characters are wearing. Just an odd and very perplexing book. Not up to standard, really. Too many mysteries in just one book."},{"Title":"A Killer in Winter (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)","review":"It's been too long since I read a Susanna Gregory Matthew Bartholomew book. She is my favourite medieval author out there, and as I read this book I remembered why. Her books are long, and there is a lot of detail, but it doesn't seem that they get too bogged down because everything she writes is in aid of her plots. This book has the best description of a medieval Christmas celebration, and a medieval winter that I've ever read, and believe me I've read a lot of medievals. In this book Matthew and Brother Michael are faced with a number of deaths, and only one of the three appears to be an actual murder, but they seem to strangely be connected in some way. Though how could one of Cambridge's students, and two seemingly unrelated strangers have anything in common is beyond them for some time. So now they have to try to find the murderer and they are doing it at the worst possible time. Cambridge is gripped in the coldest winter they've ever experienced and it is Christmas time as well. They set out to unmask a murderer and as they do that, we the readers meet a wonderful cast of characters. Come along for the ride and be a part of a Cambridge Christmas in 1354. Ms. Gregory's books are so real that you WILL feel like you're there."},{"Title":"A Killer in Winter (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)","review":"I was really disappointed by \\"A Killer in Winter\\". It was confusing and dull, and that's really not what I expect from Susanna Gregory.In December 1354 it's unseasonably cold in Cambridge, it's Christmas time, and there's more than the weather to worry about. Between slimy men looking to sell their treatises on fish, dead bodies in the church, dead bodies in the street, Rob Deynman being elected King of Misrule and a very dodgy band of entertainers, what are Matthew and Michael to do? Life is not easy in Michaelhouse as Matthew Bartholomew, Doctor of Medicine, and Michael, Senior Proctor and theologian, try to solve mysteries and prevent the university students from getting out of hand at this difficult time of year.I think it's past time Gregory's editor came down very hard on her. If she had stripped out some of the elements of the story and concentrated instead on prose and character, this could have been a much better book. As it is, it's overloaded with characters and elements, many of whom/which appear to no good purpose. What was the point of Sheriff Morice, misrule, Grey and Deynman, Harysone's book and strange dancing, etc etc ad nauseam, if they are not to play any integral part in the plot? Philippa and Giles are the supreme example of this. For the part they played in the story and the effect their reappearance had on Matthew, they could have been anyone. Other elements just did not fit. Why had no-one heard of Dympna before? The continual hostages dramas of the ending were frankly ridiculous. And please deal with Matthew's love life. Is he with Matilde or isn't he? When is that finally going to be sorted out?All the characters have the same \\"voice\\", and there is too much telling and not enough showing where they're concerned. They change to fit the needs of the plot, too. Why are Stanmore and Langelee such wimps all of a sudden? How is Philippa (who can be no older than twenty-five) now middle-aged, without independent means of her own, and totally different in character? How is Giles now a former student colleague of Matthew's, rather than a former Fellow of Michaelhouse? Gregory's prose needs more life and variety in it, a bit more scene-setting. \\"A Killer in Winter\\" is like having a single light in a dark room - whatever you can't see right now doesn't exist.I really hope the next book is more fun and better quality than this one - the way they used to be."},{"Title":"A Killer in Winter (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)","review":"Susanna Gregory is not as prolific a writer as many of the authors who write this style of book and the anticipation of waiting for a new title can be quite frustrating for the reader. However the wait is always worthwhile.Her choice of Cambridge as the main backdrop to her books is inspired. It seems to lull the reader into a world of spires and colleges inhabited by the students and academics who teach there. There is also always the underground rumblings of the inhabitants of the city who are constantly at loggerheads with the colleges and hate the students intensely, thinking of them as nothing more than thugs and bully boys.Christmas is coming and while Matthew Bartholomew's colleagues in the Cambridge colleges are preparing for the festivities, Matthew in his role of physician is struggling to help the poorer citizens through one of the worst winters in living memory.Matthew however, is given a brief respite from his duties when Brother Michael calls on him to identify a man found dead, probably from the freezing cold in one of the churches. The victim is servant to the husband of Matthew's lost love Philippa. Later, the husband himself is the victim of a tragic accident on treacherous ice. Or, perhaps the death is not the accident everyone supposes it to be . . .Susanna Gregory has a well proven formula and she sticks to it. Her books are well written, well researched and most of all they are enjoyable to read.

This work is a must-have for anybody seriously interested in 20th century American politics.Black and Black show, in plain-written text and easy-to-read graphs and tables, that the influence of the South on national politics has improved by a vast amount over the last decades. The descriptions of the republican struggle to gain popular attention in the South are exemplified by anecdotes about outstanding republican AND democratic senators and representatives on both the state and the national level.The authors are right in stating that the past rise of southern republicans can not just be drawn into the near future. Nothing is more unpredictable than politics and voter behavior. However, the Blacks show that the South indeed has won a position in the center of American politics and that southern political trends and events are more important now than ever before."},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"Given the Republican Party's recent reaction to the Trent Lott affair, this book is an excellent retelling of the rise of the GOP in the South and its sordid dabbling in racial politics. Earl and Merle Black are two of the most thoughtful and fair observers of Southern politics, and this is some of their best work yet. Occasionally dry and overly laden with charts, the book can drag in places."},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"This book provides readers a wonderful example of just what political scientists are SUPPOSED to be doing. Certainly, we write for one another, but in terms of books; one must be mindful of the amateur who might read your work. The Black brothers make a wonderful team and deserve much credit for reexamining Kevin Phillips' work in 1968 \\"The Emerging Republican Majority\\" however; this reader notes there was a conspicuous absence of Phillips' name in the text. To not mention him A SINGLE time in those 400 plus pages represents a obvious omission which should be brought to their attention.In any event; the charts and graphs were well presented and the trends appearing were nicely explained. I would comment however that the Blacks might have missed the boat on some important observations that could have been made about Florida and Texas by keeping the race question largely contained to the \\"black/white\\" paradigm. Certainly the \\"shell game\\" played by the Southern Democrats and their eventual flip to the Republican Party can be largely explained by the 1960s Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts but the demographics have definitely changed in the South and contemporary discussions of race and its impact on partisan politics must do more than allude to hispanics or asians. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a book to explore the trending of the \\"Solid South\\" toward the Republican Party this one will definitely 'draw the picture.' I thoroughly enjoyed it and even with the few shortcomings noticed by this political scientist (who wishes SHE could have written this book) their presentation of the data is \\"on the money!\\"I would and DO highly recommend this book to my students and to those curious about the \\"whos, whens, whys, and hows\\" of the southern dealignment.Great Job Blacks.... you have done us proud again!"},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"This book covers extensively the history of the South over the past century. Presidential and congressional elections are explored in detail. I saw an earlier review alluding to the lack of information regarding Hispanics and Asians; however, i found that the Black brothers DO cover this information, while at the same time admitting that the black/white race issue has been one of the most dominant issues in Southern Politics in the 20th century. If, by the end of this book, you have any remaining questions about the South's role in national politics, I suggest reading the other excellent book by the Blacks, &quot;The Vital South.&quot; between these two works, just about everything is covered. The Blacks are amazing--especially Merle!"},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"This books is astonishing in it's breadth and volume, tracing the transformation of the South from 100 years of Democatic dominance to the gradual rise of the Republican Party. Black and Black are detailed and thorough in the support of each thesis they put forth. In particular, the political scientists exhaustingly build upon the idea that racial composition of the Peripheral South and the Deep South played a large role in shaping the slow march to the mid-1990s, when the South fully became dominated by the Republican party. However, the authors contend that while Republican party was able to capture a faithful white electorate - often appealing to symbolic and explicit racism, the South has remained a competitive battleground, by virtue of biracial Democratic coalitions that mobilized in the 1980s. Moreover, the brothers argue extensively that presidential politics played a crucial role in transforming the political identity of white Southerners.Each chapter tells a different story, and are pleasantly self contained and clearly written. The brothers skillfully weave together the words of the South's own politician and journalists, juxtaposed with extensive use of quantitive visualizations. The end result is a detailed and complete portrait of Southern political history. This book is perfect for anyone wanting to understand the political dynamics of the South, and those wanting to understand the complexities of the \\"Southern Strategy.\\""},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"Merle and Earl Black have written an easy-to-read book about the rise of the Republican Party in the South after the Democrats, who had championed white rule, began to take the lead in ensuring that blacks had access to education, transportation, housing, dining, voter registration, voting, and all the other things to which they had been denied access, or equal access, because of their race. Progress did not come easy, nor did it come without pain and even bloodshed. It took many little baby steps over many years. The struggle continues to this day. At every step, as progress was made, the Republican Party grew stronger, the Democratic Party weaker. Merle and Earl Black chronicle this story and provide their own insights, references to and quotes from other sources, and an abundance of charts, statistics, and other data to support their conclusions."},{"Title":"The Rise of Southern Republicans","review":"All right, if you REALLY REALLY want to know about every southern US Senator or House member from the 1950s or so until today, this is THE book for you. To be honest, I think the Black brothers could have covered the important stuff in about 50-100 pages; instead, they walk you through just about every southern election. They should have developed a few instructive case studies rather than covered everything. But then, if I were so smart, I could have written my own southern politics book.Anyhoo, the changing political dynamics of the South are incredibly important for understanding the future of our nation. People are going to continue to move down here (I live in Columbia, SC), so the region is only going to become more important over the coming years in presidential elections and national politics. The Blacks' theory on why the South went from strong Democrat to Republican is interesting, but you can easily get the basics from the first and last chapter or so."},{"Title":"The golden bowl;: A novel,","review":"Set in South Dakota during the Dust Bowl, a drifter (Maury Grant) stops at the Thor ranch on his way west. Things are very rough there during these Depression years, but unlike the Joads in Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH (which it is often compared to), the Thors stay put and don't light out for greener pastures in California. Grant stays for a while with the Thors, then leaves. But he's drawn back finally, more mature for his experiences. Mansfield's style is deliberately very crude in language and character depiction: for some reason he portrays Grant as an insensitive tough. Other than this major stylistic flaw, Manfred is good at capturing the nobility of these exhausted but not defeated people."},{"Title":"I Was a Sixth-Grade Zombie (Ghosts of Fear Street #30)","review":"really good book. this girl and her friend sneak into this after school building and find out their friends are being brainwashed and turned into zombies.They find out they are being brainwashed too.
