McCourt begins the story as a four-year-old living in New York City with his parents and three younger brothers. The poverty stricken Irish family is unable to make ends meet in America and so they head back to Ireland in hopes of survival.They settle in Limerick where McCourt's mother Angela grew up. Malachy McCourt, the father in the story, claims that he will find work and support the family. However, Malachy's love of alcohol prevents him from finding or keeping any gainful employment. When he does work, he takes his wages and goes to the bars and drinks until all the money is gone. Meanwhile, the family is hungry, the children are wearing shoes with holes, and Angela sinks into a deep depression but remains obedient to her husband because of her Catholic faith. The family moves around Limerick frequently, renting dirty rooms with flea infested bedding, living on the floors in small houses owned by relatives, and even renting a house in which the bottom floor is constantly being flooded with neighborhood sewage. The family comes face to face with illness, death, starvation, and ridicule. The low point strikes when Angela must resort to begging on the streets to help her family survive.All the while, McCourt has the reader grow with him through the ages of four to nineteen. He shares the Irish tales he grew up with, the feelings he had toward his dyfunctional parents, his opinion of the Catholic Church, and the good and bad lessons he learned from his harsh schoolmasters. Never does McCourt wallow in self-pity, rather he presents the facts of his life in an honest, poignant manner. Despite the despair, it seems that McCourt has no regrets about his upbringing, for he was a child and had no control of the situation. As he grew, however, he came to the realization that he could begin to change things for the better. Unlike his father, he became eager to work. He struggled to support his mother and younger siblings in his teen years with after school jobs. He educated himself through reading and observation. He set goals and priorities and didn't give up until he reached them.McCourt takes what is tragic and presents it in a beautiful, descriptive language that leaves the reader spellbound. His story is obviously written unselfishly and is told to show that triumph can be the end result of tragedy. Each individual has the power to rise above and make his or her life meaningful. This is the essence of McCourt's message. A message you will not forget after reading Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt has such an intrinsic writing style, that progresses as he ages throughout the book. He takes situations and stories that would normally bring you to tears, and he leaves you laughing at the irony and the matter of circumstance. This book takes you back to your own childhood and our mentality that was once innocent, but somehow becomes enhanced with impurity and self-righteousness. Ancestry is such a gift that can only be best explained by the people that struggled to get to where they are today. Frank McCourt's story is a wonderful memoir that inspires its readers to create their own destiny and work to achieve the goals we set."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If we all could look at a cold and unforgiving world thru the eyes of young Frank McCourt and see a silver lining on the most grim events of our own times wouldn't the world become a better place for us all? Not only was I awstruck by the poverty laid out before me but at the same time warmed by the way a child can cultivate his interpretations of dire circumstances with the innocence of youth and a never-ending thirst for tomorrow. I raise a glass to the author for reminding me of the blessings of youth and for reminding me how lucky I am. If this book touches another as I have been than you are truly a product of the childhood you so couragously shared with us!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From the very first page until the last, I was living in a different world. McCourt's style of writing puts you into a trance. Everything I experienced, saw and heard during the time I was reading this heroric story, was profound.How this man can reach back into his childhood memories and replay events with such detail and emotion, as if they were yesterday, is soulful. Just when my eyes were full enough with tears that I couldn't read another line, I found myself laughing at his innocence and intense simplicity. I commend McCourt for his ability to truly live. He is an inspiration to me because of his light heart and strong will. Everyday I am grateful for a toilet that flushes!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a great book, brilliantly written! If it hurts to hear the truth about poverty and famine, just imagine what it must have been like to LIVE it, as Frank McCourt &amp; his family did. He tells the tales of his tragic childhood with candor, an eye for detail, humor &amp; yes, some hope too. I bought this book and have read it through twice, then loaned it out to all my friends who read books with an open mind. The world needed to hear this memoir. I applaud Frank McCourt.

I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book to find a look inside the life of a boy who lives such a hard life and actually makes it out of his dire straits. I've been to Ireland, found it fascinating, and this book helped me to understand the culture of the Catholics in Ireland and the &quot;melting pot&quot; of the U.S. a bit more. Angela's Ashes is a very different book in the way that it is written. It was a nice change from the ordinary style of commas and quotes. It made me want to keep reading! I highly recommend Angela's Ashes. It may be depressing, but no one's life is a field of apples and fresh cow's milk all the time.

WHile I believe that it has been over-praised a bit, it has a distinctive writing style that is very enjoyable.

First of all, it describes the live of young Frank McCourt, who grows up in unimaginible poverty in the streets of Limerick. He experiences the conflicts between rich and poor people as well as between catholics and protestants. Frank discovers friendship and even love, but he also suffers from diseases and from the death of some of his loved ones. There are funny scenes, too. This makes &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; an entertaining novel. You also learn hope and despair can make people do.Get this book. You won't regret it.

It is special because McCourt is so honest about his feelings as a young boy. It was sad because of the poverty and related deaths but it was really funny also. Now I know where the saying &quot;pissing contest&quot; came from. Frank told of his youthful experiences and thoughts relative to the Catholic Chruch and sex, a very rare accomplishment for an author."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If I discovered this book on my own, without all the media hype, I might have liked it better. The danger in media over-hype is my expectations were greater and thus my critical antennae tuned to a higher frequency than would be the case if this were a normal first encounter with a new author. Frank McCourt begins this book with prose that makes me fall in love--\\"The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges...\\" The first few pages are a feast for a lover of words, but this banquet doesn't continue beyond the first few pages. That's OK. Frank has a serious story to tell and his childhood was no bed of prose. Still I thought he lost control of his story-telling toward the end and simply got tired. The result is a book that goes down hill from a wonderful start. Do I regret reading this book? No. Do I wish the author more success in a sequel? Yes. I think he can do better and I hope he will."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In reading other reviews of Frank McCourt's Memoir, I was taken back by one that stated &quot;this was the best book I ever read!&quot; I found it easy to &quot;get into&quot; the book, however, I felt that the endless references to sexual escapades of both Frank and his mother at times was pointless and quite frankly a reason to put the book down for a break. I was disappointed with the ending...I expected a much different one with a &quot;glorious arrival&quot; in the US versus a sordid one. The book was recommended to me and I will recommend it to others...but...with caution."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could barely put it down except to eat and converse with those who insisted that they be spoken to - a terrible thing when you've just travelled 2000 km just to see your family! There a millions who have shared Frank's experience of family alcoholism, poverty and uninspired, rigid and dehumanising Catholicism (and I thank goodness things have changed - yes, it has), brutal education and grossly insensitive hospitalisation. This story will touch the heart and experience of all who have shared any one of these. That he should grow to maturity, to become a loving father and still be so aware of where he and his family have come from is a miracle. Come to this book and enter a world which we must hope is lost to our young today."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the best memoir I've read in some time. He crafts the language beautifully and he manages to change the voice as the child grows up, which is quite a feat. It's an immigrant's story, a tale of redemption filled with such wondrous and painful moments that it almost seems unbelievable. But it only feels that way because that reality is so distant for anyone, say, shopping online. I'm grateful to McCourt for conveying what it feels like to be hungry constantly. It's something, that in America at least, or in its well-fed portion, we have forgetten. He lets us remember how the other half lives. Deeply moving."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Despite being a child of Irish immigrants, I resisted reading this book for a long time, fearing it might be just another exploitation of America's love of all things Irish. What an eejit I was! This was one of the funniest, most personal books I have ever read. McCourt's exquisite use of Irish vernacular made me feel as if my parents and Irish relatives were leaping off the page to talk to me. At times I felt as if Frankie were me, or at least the boy I might have been had I grown up in Ireland instead. It has made me even more grateful that my parents chose to come to America for a chance at a better life.I think that, to truly appreciate this book, the reader must be Irish or of Irish descent. I have several non-Irish friends who didn't see the humor and found the book morbidly depressing. My brother and Irish friends, on the other hand, agreed with me that the story was hilarious and found ourselves laughing throughout.I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourts Memoirs were so beautifully written I hated for the book to end. I can't wait for his next book. Through the supreme telling of the story I felt what the characters felt and wept when they wept and chuckled out loud at some of the child's observations of young Frankie. This book was a great read and I am suggesting it as a suggestion for our reading group for discussion. I reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memoir about the troubles of his childhood was a good read, and I would recommend it.However, it was not perfect. The story lacked an emotional connection for me. I was able to be concerned about his problems, to care for him, and hope the best for him, but I didn't experience his feelings or feel his pain.I think the reason for this is the writing style McCourt used. It detracted from the psychological connection, but the style was also it's best asset. Instead of viewing the world from the outside, he presented it to us from behind the filtering eyes of his childhood. At first it was something of a distraction, but after about the first fifty pages the language became transparent and let me see what Frank saw. It was a simple vision that didn't see detail and didn't convey much emotion, but it was a direct connection. He didn't waste space by using quotes around speech, it was simply presented as a part of the stream of input. It was just a method to connect our minds, while fatally disconnecting the strong emotion. The language also grew in time letting me see life through the eyes of a growing child, but it just didn't allow me to feel with him.On another front, the subject of his sexual awakening has been criticised by some, but it pales in comparison to that as described in a number of other books. I personally feel that if McCourt had left out the subject altogether the book would have been incomplete. There was no graphic description of his acts, just the fact that he did them.In all it was a good book, just not the 'Best Book I Ever Read!'"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a journalist, I can appreciate Mr. McCourt's efforts to tell the truth, no matter how unappealing it may be. His story is a truly horrific one, although I grew up in an environment in which many of the same tough childhood stories are real. As for those who don't care for Mr. McCourt's blunt style, you are entitled to your opinion. I thought it made the story even more realistic and would suggest this book to anyone who understands that life isn't always an episode of &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; and is willing to hear the truth."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I will read it again, and anxiously await Mr. McCourt's next book.

I loved this story and was constantly recharged as he grew up and experienced the poverty and hunger associated with the &quot;lower class&quot;. Actually, we all know that class has nothing to do with anything...people should take care of people, like Frank did with the sick people he delivered telegrams to....one good turn deserves another...and I want to know how he became the wonderful writer he is today."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Is a better book that I readed reciently, It's very human, the language used is very common, and real, I almost cry with the of malachy junior, further I love Ireland is the more beatiful country in the world,"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Those who found this work depressing or the adult characters to be weak are correct. But to say this is the complete sum of this work is highly inaccurate. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; does three things: 1. takes a very unconventional storytelling approach (namely the lack of quotes) and still manages to give each person a distinctive voice as we witness a young man's growing love for storytelling. 2. Demonstrates the amount of love and forgiveness and joy that can exist in the least likely of situations. and 3. Tells the story from the boy's point of view. The repetition, the way it slowly dawns on Frankie that he's not just poor but destitute, the way he discovers the emptyness in his family's life, the way the same events look different to him as he grows older ... it's searing and poetic and powerful. If you never want to read about imperfect people, and you only want happy endings, then don't look here, and don't pay any attention to Irish folktales and songs. If you love a well-written comic tragedy, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is for you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's portrayal of his childhood spent in poverty left me with many vivid images:Two small boys picking up coal from the road to boil their charity pigs head for Christmas dinner; A distraught grandmother dragging a five year old boy off to the priest for confession because he &amp;quot;thrun up the body and blood of Jesus&amp;quot; into her backyard after his first communion.I was especially impresssed with the realism and humour of the dialogue.I look forward to reading the sequel when its written."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a devoted reader of fiction, I reluctantly decided to read Angela's Ashes, by FrankMcCourt. Praised by all who had read it, I was skeptical. Not only was it nonfiction, but it was also a story of a young boy in Depression- era Ireland. I also wonderedjust what the title, which referred to the author's mother, actually meant. I certainlyhad grim thoughts! My first reaction was that it would be a depressing, &quot;uncomfortable&quot; story to read.What a wonderful surprise I found! Yes, the story tells of a time in which one wonders how anyone could survive,(and there are plenty of those who did not), but the way inwhich McCourt tells of each character and the surrounding circumstances is done with an optimistic slant. I found myself reading of grim happenings, and then in the next minute,laughing aloud at a description or a statement made.Thank God that McCourt did survive so that he could bring us this wonderful story.

I feel a new insight into the plight of the poor of Limerick in the 1930s and 1940s now - a better sense of what their priorities were, their hopes, dreams, and the harsh reality of everyday life.

I will never get the picture of Angela, staring into the ashes, unable to save her life or the lives of her children out of my mind. Being of Irish ancestry, this story touched me as no other probably could have. I personally recognized so many of the sayings, ways, and behaviors of the Irish. I felt shame at the way the McCourts treated their children and at the way their Irish neighbors turned their cruel backs to each other. I did, however find hope in the few individuals who saw intelligence and sparkle in the little boy who stood before them starving and ugly.

As I looked at the cover and read his line, &quot;Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood. Worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.&quot;, I was more intrigued then ever. Even though the story was deeply moving, his struggle to make his life better inspired me. I cannot wait for the sequel to this book to pick up in New York with Mr. McCourt. This book should be an absolute read for anyone feeling depressed about their circumstances. Mr. McCourt's vivid descriptions made me feel like I was standing in his house at times. Thank you for sharing your story with us."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I finished this touching memoir, I realized that a man with these gifts chose to teach in the New York City public schools. Perhaps there is hope for our schools after all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Can't believe anyone could actually survive such terrible living conditions! But Frank McCourt writes in such a way that even though I feel sorry for the family, I also feel a whole lot of respect for their resilience. I like the way Frank McCourt writes- as if he is talking to you as a child. He manages to describe his living environment so as to enable us to have a clear and vivid picture of his hometown, but at the same time he doesn't bore us with complicated details and long-winded &quot;talk&quot;. I also really enjoyed the innocence and humour which seems to have been an important part of the writer's life. I think this keeps the tone from turning into one of self-pity. I think Frank McCourt is a great writer and I hope there's a sequel to this wonderful memoir."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I kept having to remind myself, again and again, that the events recounted occurred during the 1930/40's and not a century earlier during the Famine. Very powerful; I read &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; in one sitting as I could not be distracted from the story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I must say this was the best book that I have read in a very long time. I picked up Frank McCourts book not knowing anything about it just that it took place in Limerick, Ireland where parts of my Family is from. I loved this book I could understand why my family made its way to America and leaving Ireland behind. I laughed and I cried as many others had and thank Frank McCourt for making me realize how special family is."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a native Irish person I can only describe Angela's Ashes as the most moving book I have read in the last ten years. I feel that Frank McCourt has given me an education in an important part of twentieth century Irish history in the most effective way possible, through his personal experience of &quot;a poor catholic childhood in Limerick&quot;.It is a lesson to us all that the poverty and disease suffered by the McCourt family in Limerick were not merely caused by the drinking of Malachy but also by heartless government officials.The strenth of the book is the upbeat style of Frank McCourt. As each incident of suffering is recounted by him as a small boy, his reaction is that of surprise and almost acceptance rather then anger and indignace.The way in which Angela McCourt strives to preserve her dignity at all times is heartwarming. We can never despise the irresponsible actions of Malachy McCourt at any point in the book. Also noteworthy, is the way Frank McCourt portrays the influence of the Catholic Church. On the one hand providing guidence and education, and on the other hand, instilling ignorance and fear into a young boy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"FRANK McCOURT'S STORY IS THE KIND THAT HAD TO BE TOLD AND I - ALONG WITH MANY OTHER READERS - AM VERY THANKFUL THAT HE CHOSE TO DO SO. FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS ELOQUENTLY DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE I FOUND MYSELF ENTHRALLED. AS I READ ON ABOUT FRANK AND HIS POVERTY STRICKEN FAMILY I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS BOY WOULD EVER FIND HIS WAY THROUGH IT ALL, THAT HE WOULD EVER SEE MANHOOD. THROUGH EACH PAGE I FOUND MYSELF TRANSPORTED TO A LIFE OF HARDSHIP IN NEW YORK TO UNSPEAKABLE SHAME, CRUELTY AND ENORMOUS SUFFERING IN THE SLUMS OF IRELAND. I TRULY FELT AS THOUGH I WAS THERE WITH HIM. SEEING IT, HEARING IT, TASTING IT, SMELLING IT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - FEELING IT. MR. McCOURT'S WONDERFULLY DESCRIPTIVE WRITING HELD ME IN RAPT ATTENTION THROUGHOUT. AS DIFFICULT AS IT WAS TO READ AT TIMES, I ALSO FOUND THAT I DID NOT WANT THE BOOK TO END. WHAT A JOURNEY! WHENEVER I FOUND MYSELF WITH TEARS WELLING IN MY EYES, THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE WOULD HAVE ME BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING, MR. McCOURT STILL FOUND THE HILARITY JUST WHEN HE NEEDED IT MOST. AT THE END OF THE BOOK, WITH MR. McCOURT STANDING ON THE BOW OF THE SHIP WHICH FINALLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO AMERICA AT THE AGE OF 19 I FOUND MYSELF WANTING TO BE THERE TOO. TO BE THERE FOR HIM - AND COOK HIM UP A BIG PLATE OF MASHED POTATOES AND SOFTBOILED EGGS - BOTH SLATHERED IN SALT AND BUTTER - ALONG WITH ALL THE LEMONADE HE COULD EVER HOPE FOR!

I laughed, I cried, I felt ill; all while I was driving from part of the city to another. Poverty as seen through the eyes of a child is heartbreaking, but humorous as well. Highly recommend the unabridged version as every minute is fascinating as well as entertaining."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is a must - if there ever was a must! The tale of the author's childhood is simply told brilliantly."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Well, I hadn't even heard of Angela's Ashes until I read a paragraph over someones shoulder, and was allready pulled in. I proceeded to read it, and I definately wasn't let down. Although this is a story of hardships, whilst reading this I found it still very easy to smile because of the humourous style of this story. I also found it amazing that Frank McCourt was able to recapture his child like wonder. This novel is a story of suffering, but even though the McCourts are poor, the family is still absolutely fantastic to hear about. My favourite bits were &quot;Italy&quot;, and the &quot;Angel on the seventh step&quot;."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes was a very moving and emotional book. It was the heavy story of Frank McCourt's Irish Catholic childhood, yet it was written in such a witty way that it doesn't wear one out when reading it. McCourt's style, especially with the converstaional sections in this book, adds a world of meaning to a very witty text and paints a picture of all of the characters in this book. When one reads the way the old Irish folk songs and poems are woven into the story, one cannot doubt that the author really did live this life, and that all of the details are truthful to fact. I, as a reader, would recommend this book to anyone who is a serious reader and is prepared for an emotional jorney through the life of the author, Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After seeing Frank McCourt on 60 minutes and the Today show I was curious about this book. Once I got it I wasn't sure I would like it, but once I started I couldn't put it down. McCourt writes so beautifully that I could hear the Irish brogue and see the backdrop of his story. I liked it so well that not only have I read his follow up, but I rave about this memoir to strangers in the book store!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Often while reading this book I felt the hunger pains in my stomach. It really makes you thankful for whatever you have, it has to be more than what Frank and his family survived on."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt has created a wonderful, warm and witty memoir out of a life that could have justifiably and easily been turned into a miasma of self-pity, depression and angst. His humor and sensitive insights coupled with stunning use of dialect lift this book way above the level most memoirs. McCourt's also got a keen sense of perspective about him, not letting hindsight and the obscuring lens of maturity bog down the childhood years."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a very interesting book, it make us think that the poverty, misery, alcoolism are an important problem, and the children are the principal victims.

It took longer than I anticipated.

Frank McCourt's style adds to this poignant memoir of a poor boy growing up in Ireland. Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. Not because Frank McCourt and I share an Irish history, but inspite of it. It was a truely riveting book, that makes one not only think of how good you have had, but realize how bad he truely did have it. His accomplishment is all the more diserved because of what he has experienced. It is only a shame that his mother did not live to see it. Great work Mr. McCourt"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Having grown up Irish-Catholic, Angela's Ashes made me laugh and cry, every other page!

I want to know how he did it!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For some reason, I resisted buying this book--it looked depressing. However, when it finally came out in paperback, I decided to read it. I couldn't put it down. I hope everyone who reads it understands how it feels to be a child in want.

What should be a thoroughly depressing subject, is almost enlightening because of the child's view point, the stark honesty, the gifted, casual writing style that makes this book so incredibly enjoyable and easy to read. I simply couldn't put it down. I have urged everyone in my life to read it ASAP, and those who have so far, have sent emotional e-mails or called with a sniffle in their voices to say &quot;thank you so much for insisting that I read this&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I first saw this book, I wanted to read it. I was convinced that I would read it once it either came out in paperback, or my public library had it in. Neither has happened yet, so I'm glad I spent my twenty-dollars on the copy that I carry with me everywhere. The pages are stained with spaghetti sauce. The corners are starting to curl, and the jacket is tattered. It looks like this book has been kicked around in someone's basement for twenty years. I read it whenever I need a reason to smile or a reason to cry. It seems to capture every human emotion."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a paradox. It is both sweet and pungent. One sees the utter resignation to poverty in some characters and the absolute tenacity of the human spirit in others. The story is depressing and heart wrenchingly sad one minute and achingly funny the next.My husband is from Limerick and many at home felt the book painted the people of Limerick with a very black brush. However, I would remind the readers that the same story was probably played out in any number of depressed areas in the 20's and 30's and in fact, is probably repeating itself today in other parts of the world. It is not the content and setting which make this a delightful read, it is the style in which the story is told that makes it unique."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Just a big thank you to Mr. Mc Court for sharing his story. All I can say is read it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"everyone in the world is reviewing this book, but i'll get my two cents in as well. the author deserves the pulitzer prize just for coming through this. what i dont know is how he could re-enact it by writing down every last detail. i would have been off to the nearest hypnotist to induce total amnesia, and i'm not joking. there is certainly no question here about authenticity or writing what you know about. the detail is so graphic it made me sick more than once (why 4 stars). this is not a criticism; good writing makes you care about what is happening. it was particularly interesting to me as i had just finished a book on nonphysical abuse in families; while this father did not beat up his wife or children, and professed to be loving and caring, he most certainly abused them by keeping control of the money, which he spent on drinking, allowing the family to literally starve and go without the most basic necessities. i wonder if this woman and her children thought of the father as abusive. in those days probably not. the other thing worth mentioning is that it seemed strange to me that people still find the U.S. such a paradise. although these people were living in the most terrible poverty, that no one anywhere should have to live in, there seemed to be no gangs, drugs, guns, or violent crime. in the U.S. these things are not even limited to poor neighborhoods any longer, and even in the 1930s, the author mentions crime and gangsters and gun violence in America. i think this is an important book and you dont have to be Irish, Catholic, or poor to relate to it. Although it wasn't pretty, I'll be interested in the sequel."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, the next book you read will have to be My First Cousin Once Removed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I managed to read most of this book on a plane to New York and could barely look up to eat my in-flight meal. FM's hero has all the helpless raffishness of JP Donleavy's Darcy Dancer and inhabits a world populated by absurd characters who could almost pass unnoticed in a Flann O'Brien novel.I know it is annoying when a neighbouring passenger bursts out laughing, but in my defence I would say that Angela's Ashes has some of the funniest scenes I have seen in a novel in an awfully long time. (&quot;Forgive me father I have sinned, it has been 2 minutes since my last confession&quot; is a wonderful line)There is sufficient pathos to give the book balance and charm and the pithiness of some of the death scenes make them particularly moving.I have deducted one-star from the review for the very unsatisfactory ending. The whole pace and balance of the book is dented when our hero, Frank arrives in America.Suddenly, McCourt shifts into a grab-it-now-while-you-can-mode and the final page leaves us with the impression that he is saying to us &quot;You've paid your money, you read the book, so now clear off!&quot; Or maybe this was a metaphor for Frank's new world and I simply missed it.A must read!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have never been so haunted -- by both the power of words, and the power of McCourt's, and my own, past. That I am a descendant of Irish immigrants has never meant much to me except for the occasional knowing laughs at Irish jokes and speech oddities. I have, since reading this book, wept for the grandparents I never knew, for the poverty, the joy, the indomitable spirit, the self defeating political dissention that still exists and the heritage that has expressed itself in me. As a high school teacher of English myself, I wish that I could assign this book to all the &quot;victims&quot; of our culture. Perhaps their troubles would come into clearer focus while they too shared in the abject sadness coupled with the wonderful Irish wit and lyricism of this work of art.

As cliched as it sounds, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Despite being dissimilar to McCourt in virtually every respect (ie growing up upper middle class and Jewish in Canada etc) I think everyone can identify with his description of the boy-man struggling to make sense of the cards life has dealt him; few, if any, however have written about it with such compassion and skill.

Be assured that if this man had been a sliver better off in childhood, he could have been Shakespear. This book rang in my ears for the week I read it. I called my parents 2000 miles away in Irish Chicago and read them a paragraph and they were after it the next morning. All who have had an Irish Catholic childhood recognize themselves in the scene when Frank and his friends pray for Brenda Spellacy to hang on and not die of the &quot;galloping comsumption&quot; till school starts and her brother can get a week off for the death. We can all nod at the final lesson to Mikey who is carried off himself! Angela's Ashes sings in the face of the worst disasters with the lilt of a brogue and the bitter sweet wit and defiance that is Irish Catholic strength and weakness at the same time. I laughed out loud and cried. For those sad realities haunt the Irish here whatever their station. And, Frank, now it's done and I'm lost. When do I get the next book? Thanks, Frank!

You'll be changed forever, I promise you. You will never think about poverty, Ireland, beautiful writing--or life for that matter--the same way again.

The ability to turn a tear into a smile within the same sentence is a gift. A gift passed on to him from a father who gave him little else. I gave this book a nine instead of a ten because Frank McCourt, by making us care so deeply about his family, made us a promise to give us the end of the story. What happened to Angela, the brothers or his father that I want to hate but can't. I was left hanging and wanting more.

It is impossible not to laugh at points, despite the intense sadness of the memoir. Although the father is a full-blown alchoholic who abandons his family after wasting the wages on booze a number of occasions, you can't help but appreciate his kindliness. It is so humorous because of the casual recollection he tells. It is a must read for Irish and non-Irish alike!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could not put this book down. Even with the despair and heartbreak of a childhood of abject poverty, McCourt writes in a style that at first appears to be dispassionate, but underneath we feel all the emotions of an intelligent Irish boy who witnesses much more than the average citizen ever will.

Simply put: it is the best book I have ever read, and I've read a fairly extensive amount. McCourt has written a book that has everything. He tells the story of a poverty-stricken family that desperately tries to fight off their environment with such humor and eloquence. By the end of the book, McCourt's writing evoked so many different emotions. This was the only book that I have read where I forced myself to put the book down. I did so because the story and writing style were so amazing that I actually wanted to prolong the reading experience. If it were up to me, I would have given this book far more stars than just 5. Regardless of the genre you may normally choose, if you can buy only one book for the next several years, buy &quot;Angela's Ashes.&quot; You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could hardly put it down!

Firt of all, I am no Irish (I'm an asian) ; I had no idea how bad growing up in Europe would be like in those days. I've seen movies and all ...but with this book, I can actually not only picture his life, but feeling the hardship he and his family went through. He showed me very clearly life in Ireland was at the time...and at the same time, showed me how beautiful Ireland is too !.It made me realize, no matter what you are, where you come from, who you are, what your belief is,..the concept of life is the same everywhere. He made me looked back on my own childhood and really value it.I have also read the sequel &quot;'Tis&quot;...and I can't wait for the next one &quot;The Teacher Man&quot;..will be released in November this year!.To me, he is a very one of a kind writer. I definitely agree when one of his professors told him he's got a 'rich past(childhood)'.

McCourt first lays down the foundations of his story in the events.The book moves rather quickly from event to event: the reader sees his father and mother mourning over the death of their young daughter in America and then sees the entire family sleeping in a prison in Ireland because they have no money. McCourt so wonderfully recounts his memories, such as his experiences in the hospital to his adventures as a mail courier, with the same tone and opinions of his younger self that the reader can almost hear the young Francis talk to the angel on the seventh step or read aloud his composition to his class. McCourt manages to describe the most dismal situation with a tongue-in-cheek comment or an optimistic ending. Along with the tone, the imagery in this novel is vivid.McCourt recounts such unique details, such as the newspaper wrapping of a hog's head falling apart to children competing for a teacher's apple peelings, that the reader is pulled into his life because it so different from their own and because there is so much emotion invested in these details. McCourt makes sure that when he describes his life, it will be totally singular in its description.Overall, Angela's Ashes was simply amazing. Even though the reader is swept into a unique childhood full of hunger and starvation, McCourt manages to a \\"silver lining\\" in his despair."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In Frank McCourt's childhood memoir, Angela's Ashes, the writing so clearly depicts his emotions from his past that is amazing what great detail is captivated in his memory. As the story progresses, young Frank grows into an older, wiser, more mature, and more responsible young man. He works hard for what he believes in and he is very helpful to those around him and also to himself. The way that McCourt recollected his story was so believable and realistic that it was very easy to read and relate to. He fights through the stereotypes of his nationality and social standings all as a young child.At a young age, Frank understands that his father has a problem with his drinking. He has been sent out to watch his father and to drag him home from the pub and he knows that his father has done no good for him. He loves to hear Malachy Sr.'s stories though, and he would give anything to keep his mornings with his father forever. While relaying the story of his younger years McCourt says:I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's show but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? (260)The innocence of this shows that it is how he felt as a child whether or not he agrees with it now. At a young age, Frank just wanted to be with his father no matter what was wrong with him and the unbiased way in which he wrote this along with other parts of his story really added to the authenticity of his storytelling.As he grows older, this statement holds true in that he expresses how he feels at that time. When Frank's father is supposed to return home one year for Christmas, Frank is not even surprised when he doesn't arrive. He really shows the reader that he no longer gets his hopes up when it comes to his father when he tells his mother, \\"He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England\\" (338). Frank has finally looked past what he wants (a father who is always providing for him) and realizes that he'll have to deal with what he got.After Frank gets past the reality of his father, he begins to form dreams of his own. He wants to support his family so that they have a warm house and food to eat, but ultimately, he wants to go to America. He saw his father as the stereotypical drunken man and he chose the different path. The easiest thing he could have done was followed in his father's footsteps, but thankfully he had men like Mr. O' Halloran, Pa Keating, and Mr. Timoney telling him to pursue his dreams. For a young man put through death and tragedy at such great intervals, it is venerable that Frank resisted them.Another thing that Frank fights with is his poverty. At one point in his story, he has an outburst against the \\"respectable boys\\" saying, \\"We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world\\" (343). Because he grew up in such low class conditions, he knows he has little hope of a higher destiny. He never stops pursuing his dream, but he keeps in reality. He is not allowed to stay in education because the church shuts him out, but instead of sulking he becomes a very high positioned messenger boy and for the first time, he can provide his younger brother Michael with a healthy meal. That is more worthy of praise than inheriting a business through family ties.The thing that made this book so good was that the story was true. It is so inspiring to read of a young boy that worked hard to help his poverty stricken family when his own father didn't work hard to do so. He conquered his dreams and made it to America and lived the life that he wanted to live. He never once left his family behind although he probably had several chances and he didn't let the burdens of his past keep him from aspiring to be a very adequate man."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read McCourts book and it is so real. It brought me back to my Irish roots. I could see my great grandfather in so many of the men who went off and left their families behind with no money . All because of the drink. It was the women who were the back bone of the Irish. Just as it is with other ethic groups .And of course the Catholic church shows itself worthless again and more like the mafia then saving souls.May their souls rot in hell.Mr. McCourt captures the times , the emotion, the pain and the laughs like few have done in the past.

I imagine myself living his life of immense poverty and suffering and I know I'll never be able to go through what he has gone through in his childhood life. Frank writes with such uniqueness and passion about his childhood that not one single soul who reads his memoir will be left dry-eyed. This book deserves 10 stars instead of 5!!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If one keeps an optimistic attitude, then one can certainly overcome some of the highest hurdles found in life. This theme is powerfully shown in Frank McCourt's touching memoir, Angela's Ashes. Frank McCourt writes about his life as a boy up until his early years of adulthood. McCourt tells the story from the 1st person point of view and his style of writing dramatically changes as the character progressively gets older. Frank's father, Malachy McCourt is a self destructive alcoholic who pisses any money he makes at local pubs and leaves his family to desperately search for meals. Frank's mother Angela McCourt is a humorous but loving woman who never pities herself or her family. The story opens in the late 1920's in New York City. Malchy and Angela have already had four boys when they decide to move to Limerick, Ireland. Limerick is a town ridden by disease, poverty and as Frank so vividly describes it, rain. Frank's little brother Malachy, named after his father enjoys Frank's company and the two often take pleasure in adventures together. Frank tells of his times in Limerick from the perspective of a young boy and gives little opinion, this adds humor.\\"It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\". Frank's childhood is one of deprivation and poverty. He and his siblings often have little to eat and sickness spreads through the family. Frank's father, Malachy continues to drink away his wages. As Frank gets older he struggles to deal with a severe case of typhoid and he is placed in the hospital for months. Frank is forced to befriend literature when no one else available. As Frank becomes a teenager he begins to work at several different jobs to help support his family. Despite all the problems Frank and his family face, optimism still prevails. McCourt does a marvelous job at laughing off the tragic circumstances that existed in his childhood. Frank's mother is forced to make sexual sacrifices to help support the family. Despite this, Frank still dreams of making enough money so his family will never have to suffer again. McCourt also makes many references to his Catholic upbringing. He accepts the rivalry between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland and does his best to be a good Catholic. When Frank grows older however, he is haunted by his sins and ultimately does his best to distract himself from his guilt.Angela's Ashes is a great book which helps one appreciate their life and not take for granted the luxuries in our lives. McCourt does a brilliant job of making the reader cry and laugh while displaying his tough upbringing in Limerick. I personally would recommend this book to anyone especially those who love a good read with great characters and a satisfying ending. The reader will close the book with a smile, a tear and a rewarding feeling that reminds them of how powerful optimism can be."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes recalls Frank McCourt's Irish Catholic childhood. He and his family suffer disease, death, alcoholism, and poverty. McCourt's style of writing is so affective. It is a good memoir making each scene come to life. This book may be compared to other coming of age non-fiction writing, but it is unique in its setting and style. McCourt's creative non-fiction style is strong. It has both imagery and reflection. The writing has great chronological structure and organization. Because it is written from memory, there are some gaps, but it can still be read as stream of thought. The gaps also make the writing realistic. No one can account for every moment of their childhood.Reading this book was enjoyable. It made me aware of historical situations that I did not have knowledge of previous to reading this book. The writing is unique and compelling.

A relatively good ending was incomplete for my taste - I needed to know what happened with the rest of the family - and I feel that I was left hanging in the wind and with no other option than to buy the sequel rather than to move on to happier subjects (for a change). The book in general was quite good, even though repetitive at times.

McCourt proclaims the beginning of the book, \\"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\" Angela's Ashes shows the truth of his statement through the horrors and hardships of Frankie McCourt's miserable Irish Catholic childhood. These feelings are shown through many small memories and some more important experiences of Frank McCourt's childhood and teenage years. Despite the sadness and depression displayed in the memoir, McCourt is able to laugh at his poverty and is constantly using irony and his dark humor about his upbringing in Ireland.Frank McCourt is born Irish Catholic in New York City, but when his only sister dies soon after her birth Frank's family decides to move back to Limerick, his mother's hometown in Ireland, thinking times would be better there. They could not have been more wrong, the depression is at its worst, and the rest of Ireland is trying to leave while they are returning. Malachy, Frank's father, is a severe alcoholic, and cannot provide the family with any money except what the dole, a payment given to the unemployed, gives him. Even then the family of six has to live off practically no money. The children's diet consists of solely fried bread and tea, hardly enough for growing boys to live off of. Their tiny apartment is constantly flooding and the McCourt's are forced into one room with one bed for most of the year. After a year of extremely meager living conditions the two twin baby boys of the family die of malnourishment. Frank's dad, eventually leaves to work in England in a munitions factory, but only after leaving his wife with two more baby boys to feed. As expected Malachy never sends back any money to his family who continue their poverty-stricken lives.Frank's home and school life is extremely structured around his Catholic religion. During Angela's Ashes Frankie McCourt goes through many rites of passage in the religious world, as well as in the Limerick community, which mark his growth into a man. His first confession, first communion, and confirmation were all ceremonies in which Frank and the town of Limerick looked upon as great events which marked moments in a boy's growth into a man and a member of the Catholic Church. But also in this memoir McCourt mentioned occasions which meant the most to him while growing up. The time of the most pride for Frank is when he starts earning some money when he is a young teenager and is able to help feed his family. That however was short-lived and he soon has to return to school. When Frank finishes school as a young adult he begins a real job at the Limerick Post Office as a message boy. Also as a tradition in Ireland he had his first pint of beer the night before he turned 16, an acceptance into the man's world in Limerick.I believe that Angela's Ashes is a great inspirational memoir as well as a very entertaining story. McCourt not only writes in the perspective of a child or teenager, he makes it convincing that the writing is coming from an adolescent, not a forty-year old English teacher as he is. However that does not stop him from using wonderfully descriptive language and intelligent writing which is consistent throughout the book. The incredible story of his childhood kept me captivated, and funny anecdotes made me laugh out loud, and stopped me from being too depressed by Frank's sad tale."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a great book for anyone who likes to read. It takes you through the life of An Irish family, who's kids were born in America, with the family now back in impoverished Limerick, Ireland. Working hard, trying to find jobs, money, food, shelter, and even friends in the community. Author (Frances)Frank McCourt; is the oldest son in the family, and the story is told through his eyes. It is very interesting, and has a lot of Irish and American history. I highly reccomend this book, and although it is depressing for the most part, it is a real uplifter afterwards, and your life doesn't seem so bad all of a sudden. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have friends who found it impossible to finish Angela's Ashes because they found it relentlessly depressing with its heavy themes of aching poverty, absent drunken loving father and long-suffering mother - classic themes, it seems, in Irish literature.But in spite of the truth of those parts of the story, it's impossible to finish this book without feeling a sense of triumph for the human spirit, even when surrounded by the realities of McCourt's Irish childhood and young adolescence.It works, I think, because he writes the entire book in the child's voice - not an easy task to pull off, but he succeeded. And a child, of course, doesn't have much against which to hold up his own life; it's all he knows. So McCourt never comes across as sounding whiney, bitter, jealous, or put-upon.Scene after hilarious scene is interspersed with real heartbreaking and harrowing and demeaning eqisodes, but the overall feeling I was left with was joy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When most immigrants come to America from Ireland, they don't return. Frank McCourt's family did. After finding conditions in NYC less than desirable, especially when you have an alcoholic father who can't hold down a job, Frankie, who was born in America, and his family return to Ireland. His memoir of a family trying to survive during extreme poverty as he grows up is quite moving. However, for some strange reason, I felt the film, of the same name, did a better job of portraying Frankie's experience to me. Perhaps it had something to do with the author's style, which I sort of disliked. If you don't see the film, then you should read the book. And I really want to see what happens in the sequel, for you did really start to care for young Frankie and want to see if he will make it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book for school. If I had read it on my own, I don't think I would have finished it. The beginning was a little to slow for me, and it also took a while for me to understand the narative of it. It is not written normally with quotes, ect, it is written in free verse, unlike anything else I have read. Once Frank becomes older, he starts to lead an interesting life, where he is woken up to all of socitys wrongs. Personally I think this almost always interesting. From that point on, I enjoyed it. Overall, if I knew the entire plot, I would read it, but if it was as borring as the first 75 pages, I would not have."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One of the more compelling books I have read in many years.

Funny in many ways and yet one has a constant gut wrenching feeling. McCourt's tale of a childhood in misery is often revolting. There is never a feeling of normalcy as you sense there is yet some other forthcoming tragedy. The cast of characters is special in itself. Mother, father, brothers, friends, bullies, school teachers, religious and irreverents. They are all there and not one bores you. Through McCourt's eyes we see a careful portrait of an Irish town and its institutions. The church, the taverns, the poor and the less poor, the protestants, the benefactors, the food. Yes, the food. This is a tale of survival, of perseverance told with grand humor. A rare read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book definitely kept me entertained, if not preoccupied, during my Christmas break. But is it really worthy of the Pullitzer Prize? I dunno. This prize should be reserved for Books like &quot;Godel, Escher, and Bach&quot;, for e.g. - works which have intellectual merit. Not much of that here, though McCourt's characteristic fluid, easy style of writing is charming."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In my high school english class, I was taught that literature serves the purpose of broadening or deepening the reader's experiences of the world. Angela's Ashes achieved this purpose to a greater extent than any other book I have ever read. I have never known what it is to be starving, or cold in my bed, but Frank's descriptions of his childhood opened my eyes to a whole new world. Through his experiences of poverty and hardship, the reader experiences poverty and hardship. At the same time, Frank maintains an innocent humor- the world as seen through a child's eyes. Never does Frank resort to hopeless bitterness. When I finished Angela's Ashes I realised that life is never hopeless, and even the most horrible of events are balanced by the good. If there is any theme to Angela's Ashes, it is that hardship is not permanent, and everyone has the ability to turn his or her life around."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I entered a review earlier stating that I would read this book because so many people said it was great.

Her strength sustains this family through tough times, but also ensures a depth of character in her children one would think impossible. Despite abject poverty, she manages to occasionally let sunshine into the blackness of the McCourt household and the grayness hanging over the streets of Limerick. It seems that life has it in for the McCourts, but Angela fights back. The idea that humor and tenderness can live and thrive in the face of such adversity seems incredible. As you read this book, however, you feel the warmth that emanates from the ashes in Angela's stove. Best of all, McCourt successfully makes a few good swipes at Catholicism, too. Read the book. Read the book again. Buy the audio version. One must hear McCourt recount his childhood stories in his still-thick Irish brogue. His wonderful elfish voice brings life to all the family."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book certainly deserved the Pulitzer. The book is so well crafted, written in a way in which even the most callous reader can see that the man weaved his very soul into it.He doesn't spare the reader any of the pain he suffered in the living and I'm sure somehow in the telling of the story. He never succumbed to the modern ploy of speaking in adult psychological terms; we do not see 20th century American angst, although the American reader cannot help but engage in it while reading. He masterfully let the facts of his life define the tone and mood of the work. Yes, he did do his fair share of pondering, not as an adult, but as the child who was so often unable to understand the implications of what was going on all around him. We adult readers have no difficulty understanding the scope of his difficult childhood.Ah, but the pain ridden among us will say: &quot;You can never truly understand because you were never in his shoes... when he had shoes, that is.&quot; But is that really the point? The depths of his joys and sorrows we can never know, just as we cannot without assistance touch the very lowest point in the Atlantic Ocean, but we can become intimates with McCourt's milieu, just as we can cross the Atlantic at its widest and say we &quot;know&quot; that particular ocean.The adult McCourt denies us the exercise of the American habit of reading a book and being merely titillated by its contents, this book is no memoir of pain for pain's sake. This book is a book about undying hope, the unintended but pointed response to the Camus' and Weisels of this world.If you are picking this book up for the first time, please understand that this glorious work may very well end up taking you the most time you will ever need to read a book. Male or female you will probably spend as much time in reflection as in reading. Let this book touch you at the very depths of your being. Let this soul-full work teach you that pain isn't something you can avoid, but is certainly something you can use to let you live your life to its fullest."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It took Frank McCourt 20 years to write it, but it only took me two days to read it, and I'll never forget it. I'm not one of those people who give out 5 stars easily but this was truly one of the best books I've ever read. I feel like I really know Mr. McCourt and the Ireland that he knew. I cried with him and I laughed with him. It's a story about family, love, poverty, religion, human nature. I learned so much from reading this book. My husband and I agree that we are going to share this book with our children as soon as they are old enough just so they can see how lucky they are to live in a prosperous time (not that we are rich people - but I know our children have never experienced hunger the way Mr. McCourt and his family have). It's not how much you have, but what you make of it.I have also learned about writing from reading this book. His organization is superb and his writing style is very engaging. Even the saddest parts are written with wit and a sharpness that transcends beyond the emotions to get to the human truth. I cannot praise this book enough. If nothing else, read it and step into a great person's shoes for a while."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt joins the ranks of other talented writers like Mary Karr revolutionizing the way memoirs are written. Blending rich descriptions of the Irish childhood with personal insights into his own life, McCourt masterfully lures the reader along a path through his life leaving tears and laughter in his wake. What not only makes the book, despite its often horrific subject, readable but also a literary masterpiece is McCourt's ability to subtly insert good and happiness in small anecdotes amid the ruin that was the majority of his childhood. An example occurs midway through the book in a description of one of McCourt's neighbors. The boy is hunchbacked and deformed and has therefore decided he wants to be a radio announcer so that he can affect people and sound normal without being seen. Just after this beautiful idea is presented, McCourt relates how in order to raise money, the boy sold tickets to other boys allowing them to watch his sisters bathe. Startling and yet poignant, to me this anecdote is a summary of the book. A young boy trying to find hope in the dismal world that was Ireland."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The name Frank McCourt might not mean to much for some people. If he were to be seen on the street, no one would think of him any differently then the rest of the people in the world, but Frank is different. Frank went through many hardship during the younger portion of his life and is shared in the book Angela's Ashes. It a very compelling book and the 364 pages seem to disappear. Even though this book was pubished recently in 1996, it has earned many awards, even a pultizer prize. Recently a movie was made from this story by means of getting the consent of the publisher company, Simon &amp; Schuster, and the consent of Frank McCourt himself. Frank McCourt is not only the author of this book, but he is also one of the main individuals in the book. Angela's Ashes tells of Frank's life in Limerick, Ireland after leaving the United States at the age of four. Frank, his parents, a brother, Malachy, and a set of twins requested their grandmother to send them the fare money to go over to Limerick after the recent loss of Frank's sister, Margaret, sent his mother into a deep depression. Frank's grandmother wasn't pleased to send the money, but figured that she should at least help her daughter out. Due to the fact that their grandmother gave them the money, they could never forget that because she would remind them often and they knew that they were forever in her debt. The quote, \\" When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all.\\" Seems to be the main thought that sticks in the readers mind. Frank and his family were at such a poverty level that is heartbreaking. There was never enough food on the table to eat. The clothes they wore were so raggedy that most of their skin was showing. The living conditions were harsh. In the winter, they would have to live upstairs, also known as Italy, because their first floor, Ireland, was under a winter flood. All these things could have been improved if Frank's dad, Malachy, would bring home the wages he made instead of drinking them away. This was easy said then done because of the fact that his father was an alcoholic and it was hard for him to pass up an opportunity to drink. Frank's main dream through this whole book was to get to America one day. He wanted to get away from all the suffering and pain he has witnessed and felt in Limerick. Frank had dealt with death a lot in this book. He was there when three of his siblings died due to lack of proper nutrition, shelter, and clothes. Frank himself was hospitalized many times due to the fact that he lived in an unsanitary home and didn't have the proper nutition. He didn't mind the times in which he was hospitalized because he got decent food, bedding, shelter, and he got to read books. Frank's main plan was not to be like his father. His father's alcoholism not only affected his father, but it affected his whole family. He could see the pain in his mother's eyes. Frank could see how tough if was for his mom, Angela, to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, which gives some aid to the poor families. He could see how Angela's pride had suffered and for this reason, Frank knew that he wanted to do something better and to help out his family. Frank went to work at the post office. The money he made, he gave some to his mom to help out the family since his dad didn't bring home any, and the rest of the money he put away to save up for his trip to America. The book was very interesting and keeps the readers attention. The one downfall is that the dialog in the book was never in quotations. It was hard to follow sometimes and paragraphs had to be read over again to figure out who is saying what. The title itself, Angela's Ashes, also seems a little confusing. Frank's mom's name was Angela, but with the word \`ashes' the thought of death comes to mind for Angela and that doesn't occur in this book. Maybe \`ashes' has a different meaning. Maybe it meant that Angela was all burnt out and all that was left of her was ashes. If that was the meaning behind the title, then it suits the book. The book makes the reader reflect on their own life. There are many things that individuals can do to help out in the world. This poverty level was back in the 1920's or so, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't go on now today. The reader feels compelled to do something to help, but realizes that they, themselves, can't do it all. The book shows us that every little bit helps. Even the smallest little bit of giving goes a long way and is remembered for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The McCourt brothers and their use of our shared language deserve every bit of attention they get. Frank tells stories of crushing poverty with such a lyrical witty writing style you almost forget to be sad, remember I said almost.

I couldn't wait to finish the book so I could see the movie. My husband (who had not read the book) and I saw the movie this week, and it was true to the book. Mr. McCourt's writing is so descriptive, that I knew in my mind what the movie would look like before I saw it. Many times during the book I found myself near tears, and then something uplifting would occur. I found the book so gripping, that I could barely put it down.

I kept thinking I wouldn't finish it because it was so depressing, but McCourt captured me from page one. It took me a while to see past sad stories and realize the triumph of Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you're reading this review for the purpose of deciding whether to read 'Angela's Ashes,' I'll save you some time by suggesting you read the first page. The author tips his hand very early:&quot;When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while.&quot;If this sounds attractive, by all means read on but be warned: when he says miserable, he *means* it.Before confronting misery, though, I must comment on an aspect of this best-seller I've not yet seen discussed in any great detail: that this &quot;memoir&quot; must be largely a fake. I simply refuse to believe that Mr. McCourt can remember childhood details (like word-for-word parental conversations on important subjects) at the tender ages -- not to mention conditions -- that he claims. Ask yourself if you can remember exact accounts of when you were three or four-much less whole adult conversations-and you'll see my point. Simply put, a lot of this probably didn't happen -- at least as meticulously written.And so what? One could easily claim he got the gist of it right, and aren't the Irish a bit prone to, as they say, a bit of embellishment anyway? Well, sure, but a memoir is a memoir and you can't have it both ways. Make no mistake, however--in the area of Irish license Frank McCourt is dead on. Having had an Irish Catholic upbringing meself (though not the tooth and claw version practiced in the home country), I can verify many of his details personally. In describing everything from eccentric relatives to the bewilderingly complex nature of Catholic sacraments, the author betrays a sure hand. While this doesn't quite excuse passing his book off as an autobiography, McCourt still engages and entertains.The author's means of bringing details to the surface deserve particular attention. The book's rambling, conversational, stream-of-consciousness style seems custom-made for his subject:&quot;If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.&quot;While occasionally hard to read, this self-evoking grammar ultimately can't be divorced from McCourt's story and certainly brought his characters to life for me far better than stiff formal dialogue.Between these exchanges, McCourt also has the opportunity to exercise his considerable descriptive powers. While I accuse the author of some creative forgery, in an evocative capacity he's nearly redeemed; I heard and especially *smelled* what he describes. A world of smoky, sticky pubs and homes in squalid lanes lacking indoor plumbing comes pungently alive.With style as his strong suit, Mr. McCourt also brings considerable power to his substance. The substance, however, is so bleak it borders on suicidal. This is a very dark, naturalistic, and occasionally horrifying book. Nearly everyone--save the children--is devoid of simple human values. Adults are portrayed as maniacally depressed or angry and hardly shy about attempting to destroy the psyches of everyone within earshot--especially the children. His parents don't escape notice; Dad is the very definition of alcoholic (to the point of drinking away money for his family's basis subsistence), Mam a desperate nebbish ultimately reduced to begging and prostituting herself--and it's far from clear that she's doing this exclusively for the family's benefit. I certainly share the author's astonishment at his survival; if you can stand over 400 funereal pages of this, then by all means dive in.And maybe survival is the point here, but it's surely a bleak one; every triumph (Dad get a job, the author finds a soulmate) is swiftly crushed within a few pages. Even so, McCourt ends on a high note and rather obviously sets up a sequel. And though I've not read the follow-up (&quot;'Tis&quot;), if I ever did it would be with some trepidation. Having endured a childhood littered with demonic authority figures, the author leaves us on the cusp of his own adulthood. I shudder to think of who he might become -- but of course we already know, since this continuing &quot;memoir&quot; can only come from the same gifted writer before us."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this book because, 23 years ago, I was one of the many students who took Frank McCourt's very popular Creative Writing course at Stuyvesant High School. Frank stressed a particular theme in his teaching: good writing is suprising. Forget every lesson previous English teachers have taught, or else you'll produce platitudes, not creative writing. He hammered this lesson home in everything he taught. He made us read satire. He assigned writing tasks that sounded prosaic and made fun of us if we wrote something prosaic. For example, he asked us to write a love letter and a hate letter. He liked my love letter to a dead dog. He adored Jonathan G's obscenely funny hate letter to a public figure. Frank was completely at ease with students, he was charismatic, he entertained us, he spoke with us and never down to us, and yet he was always an authority figure. And he talked constantly about his brother Malachy, who at the time hosted a New York area radio show.The first chapter of _Angela's Ashes_, about McCourt's earliest childhood in Brooklyn, New York, brought me back to my high school friendship with Jessica O'C. I recall Jessica, who was so proud of being Irish-American, because her family's troubles sound so much like those of Frank McCourt's family, and Frank McCourt sees these troubles as characteristically Irish. Ireland, devastated and robbed repeatedly by the English, beset with European class distinctions and snobberies, structured by the inscrutable Roman Catholic Church, cursed physiologically or culturally with a craving for alcohol, had only a harsh life to offer many of its people. Disabled or alcoholic fathers allowed their hard-to-find jobs to lapse, their families to starve; babies and toddlers died from parental ignorance, from cold, wet, crowded, filthy housing, their immune systems weak from months or years of gradual starvation. In these impoverished conditions, however, just as in my friend's family, surprisingly educated intelligences flourished, songs and stories were traded, and dazzling bits of beauty were rendered tragic by their surroundings.Frank McCourt describes all of this through the eyes of a gradually maturing child. At first the child sees only what is immediate: his family, the relationships that are the substance of his life. As his circle widens, he begins to glimpse the social and religious conditions that structured his childhood. He learns more about his parents' lives and begins to appreciate the tragedy of the unforeseen turns their lives have taken. Irish songs and myths animate his telling of the story, anchoring it culturally in the pleasure the Irish take in recitation, in the ways his own life repeats the songs, in the interpretive lens these songs and stories must have offered his earlier childish understandings of life.McCourt takes seriously the principle he taught his writing students: go for the unusual, the surprising. The story unfolds through what looks on paper like Irish idioms, Irish customs, Irish understandings. As the story's narrator matures, the perspective always shifts slightly. And the reader is always a bit on edge emotionally, as McCourt shifts back and forth between the comic and the tragic, never allowing the reader to become bored with an emotional plateau. (Just when I thought I couldn't take any more dead babies, for example, just as tears were streaming down my cheeks and I was about to put down the book for good, McCourt launched into a wonderful satire of the Catholic Church, through the eyes of a little boy studying for his First Communion.)The book jacket also says &quot;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize.&quot; I agree, it's a good book. It hardly matches an old Pulitzer prizewinning book I read recently, Annie Dillard's _Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_ for philosophical depth, scientific breadth, or even sheer literacy. But it drew me into its world. Bits of the book kept popping up in my memory, and I often mistook them for fragments of my own recent dreams. Scenes from the book seemed to play on the horizon of my den as I attempted to engage in routine activities, like building block towers with my children. Not only did the book draw me in, however, it also dumped me back out into my own world with some fresh understandings about Ireland, poverty, childhood, character, determination, satire, my high school writing teacher, and, of course, writing and storytelling themselves."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a beautifully written and humbling story. Sometimes we all need a little humbling to make us grateful for what we have.

Most of the story is told by Frank from his viewpoint as a child in Ireland. Angela, his mother, does all she can to hold the family together. A number of her children have died, and she watches helplessly as the other children deteriorate because of poverty. The senior McCourt is a happy-go-lucky fella who rarely works, and who needs only an alcholic drink to make life tolerable. The family is uprooted several times, and is ridiculed by those with more resources. They have withstood cold, hunger, lack of medical attention and inadequate housing ---- and through it all, they keep their sense of humour.A heartwarming story of human resolve to survive each day by putting one foot in front of the other.

Unfortunately, conditions are actually worse for them in Ireland. Add to the equation that McCourt's father is an alcoholic who thinks nothing of drinking away what little money they come across while his family starves ... well, the book gets more than a little depressing.And that's the real magic of McCourt's writing. For as awful as things are (and they get pretty awful), McCourt's wicked sense of humor has you laughing at things that shouldn't be the least bit funny. I actually felt guilty at times as I couldn't help but chuckle at McCourt's description or use of dialogue.Make no mistake, however, like in his memoir Teacher Man, McCourt does not try to deceive us into thinking he's the hero of the story. He's tough on everyone, but he's toughest on himself. He reports to us misdeeds and lewd thoughts that most of us would never dream of sharing, and that sort of honesty is quite refreshing.Though funny, the book was also so disturbing (especially McCourt's father) that I really wanted to get through it as fast as I could. I absolutely appreciate both McCourt's humor and charismatic writing, but I won't lie to you and say this was one of my favorite reads. But, life is hard and disturbing for many people, and my perspective of the world improved thanks to the Pulitzer Prize winning Angela's Ashes.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Imagine being crammed into a one bedroom home with two siblings, an alcoholic father, an exhausted mother, a flooded downstairs, and the constant threat of tuberculosis, or even worse, death knocking at your door. On top of it all, imagine being so poor that going days without food is normal and an egg can be considered a delicacy. No matter how difficult that is to imagine, it was nevertheless the life of young Frank McCourt.Frankie grows up in the slums of Ireland where begging is commonplace and children must find jobs at the age of 14 in order to support their entire family. Frankie struggles to overcome his destitute life, the death of three siblings, and a father who drinks away all of the money needed in order for the rest of the family to survive. This is the world that you experience as you begin reading Angela's Ashes, a true-life memoir of Frank McCourt.Angela's Ashes takes place during the Great Depression where poverty runs rampant through the streets and even the most proud of families is reduced to begging in order to get a simple lump of coal. However, Frankie has the seemingly unrealistic dream of eventually travelling to America and starting his life anew. Throughout the course of the novel you are left wondering how Frankie can gain the physical or mental power to accomplish his goal.One aspect of the novel which I found very intriguing is Frank's use of \\"comic relief\\" in order to keep his otherwise depressing life hopeful and at least somewhat upbeat. Mikey Molloy, a cross-eyed friend of Frank who suffers from \\"fits\\" (seizures), is one such example of this sporadic humor. Frank even recounts one time when Mikey fakes one of his fits in order to sneak into the movie theater. \\"...I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream...That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.\\" Scenes like this really kept me smiling throughout the sadness in Angela's Ashes.McCourt's writing style also provides a relieving mixture of both comedy and sorrow. At one point, Frankie contracts typhoid fever and describes his experience with the doctor in charge. \\"It's dark and Dr. Campbell's sitting by my bed...He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.\\" Through the innocence and naivety of Frank's voice, I felt as though I could really understand and feel what the author was feeling while recounting his life.Despite all of the comedy throughout this novel, the author never loses sight of the main aspect of the story: the sorrow. Frank basically has to support his entire family by himself at a very young age because his dad is always at the bar drinking away every penny he earns. From the age of three to nineteen, Frankie moves from one house to the next, and each time the conditions get worse and worse to the point where Frank and his family have to live next to an outhouse which is shared by the entire street they live on. Not only that, but Frank's mother, Angela, has to spend all day scrounging the streets for whatever scraps she can find to help her family survive.Angela's Ashes has become one of my favorite books. Although I would suggest it to a more mature audience due to some of its scenes, I would still recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Frank McCourt's struggle growing up in Ireland. I would easily give this book an \\"A.\\" I never lost interest in the plot no matter how depressing it was and the characters always kept me compelled to learn more about their plight and hardship.

The book captures what life was like in Ireland in the early 1900s for Frank and his family growing up. Through good times and bad, the reader seems to be able to relate to the story in one way or another, which seems to draw them to the book even more. The story starts out in America where Anglea and Malachy McCourt are trying to start a family. Frank is the oldest, followed by Malachy Jr., then the twins, Eugene and Oliver, and last Margaret. The first tragedy occurs when Margaret dies suddenly and the McCourts move back to Ireland. They settle in a poor neighborhood, where Angela's mother reluctantly helps them settle in and get started. Soon after, the twins die and the McCourts once again move to another poor neighborhood. Later on, Angela gives birth to two more boys, Michael and Alphonsis. Throughout the story, Angela tries to make ends meet while her husband spends all of his wages at the local pubs. She somehow manages to feed and clothe the family just enough to survive. She even manages to send to boys to school. The reader remains awestruck that they manage to survive. Malachy McCourt later leaves his family to go to England for work. He remains there for many years and only sends home wages once. Frank goes through many odd jobs trying to be the man of the family and all the while going through changes as he grows up.

Just imagine if you had to live like that. Most of us have never had to live with a brother or sister dying let alone three. How many of us in this country have had to go with out food or live in one room? How many have had to go without shoe to wear to or had to make sure that there were no fleas in our bed? There have not been as man of us begging so that our kids can have something to eat or shoes on their feet or a bed to sleep in. This bool helps you to really see what we have and how lucky we are that we live in a warm house, with shoes on our feet, food in our belly, and healthy and happy kids at our feet. Also this book gives me more appriciation for my mother and everything that she did for us. Frank's mother did somethings for them,but, other things that should have been done she never did. She relied on the kinds of strangers a little TOO much. The things that she did with her cousin is outragous. There is nothing that would cause me to do that. I would rather cut my arm off, than have to sleep with someone, let alone a cousin of mine, to keep a roof over my kids head. I would have found another way to live."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've already given my review of this book, but I must add that this is Frank McCourt's LIFE, not just another novel. For those who say this book is depressing, I think it might do you some good to find a slum in your city and walk around a bit. Mr. McCourt has done an amazing thing by bringing his chilhood to print for all of us to experience through his words. It would also do you a bit of good to reflect on your life, where you came from, what was handed to you, what you really had to work for. Frank McCourt has truly lived a life that he made from nothing. I look forward to &quot;'Tis&quot;, and hope that those of you who have a hard time with depression and poverty never get thrown out of your house or high-rise. Won't you be shocked."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When this book first came out, i was quite reluctant to read it. As I am a native of Limerick City which is where McCourt is from.However, once I began to read the book. I couldn't put it down. Every scene in the book was so well described, I could feel myself going back in time. I enjoyed the way each of the characters were portrayed. However, cruel he was to his Mother.What appealed to me most about this book was the way in which he described his school days in such an animated and fun way. Its hard to believe in parts that he is no longer a young man, long gone from his native city. I found myself laughing loudly as he described certain events that happened at school.All in all, this book is a great success for its wit &amp; also for McCourts amazing ability to vividly remember his childhood, even though it was not a happy one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One of the best books of the 1990s-this beautifully written memoir tells of the suffering of a poverty stricken childhood in Ireland of the 1930s and 40s-written in such a way that it captures the sadness of the suffering of the family, and yet retains a seismic wit that will make you cry and laugh in turn.Always written from the point of view of the child and teenager Frankie, at the age he is at the time, never from the perspective of an older man looking back, this is a book you wont want to put down and will stay with you forever.This book takes you from the eraluest memories of the auhtor as a toddler to the angst and burgeoning sexuality of his teens.Frank is the son of a alcoholic father who squanders the few wages he ever gets on drink (while making his children swear to die for Ireland), and a mother who struggles to keep the family together. It begins with his life until he is four in New York during the Great Depression, and then the family's return to the greater depression of their homeland, Ireland, where they live on a tiny government dole, and the charity of begrudging relatives.what makes this memoir so compelling is how the author juggles the different emotions, always with a ready wit, which makes this book a classic, and yet always at the same time displaying to pathos and misery of the Ireland of this era.McCourt describes the loss of his baby sisters with heart wrenching realism. He has three more brothers, the more charming and easy going Malachy, the king hearted Michael who brings home beggars and stray dogs to the family's humble abode, and the youngest Alphie.Always pervasive is the grinding poverty, the oppressive and guilt-inducing all pervading presence of the Catholic church and education system ,and the fierce patriotism and resentment at Realm of the time of the 800 years of English domination and cruelty.But what always shines through is the refusal to forget the humour and hope, the appreciation of small things and nature, through such crushing circumstances, and always the hope. The memoir closes with the realization of Frank's dream and goal to emigrate back to the America of his birth. Ultimately it is a book of the life of life, and refusal to ever be sunk by circumstances-what makes it more inspiring is a true life story of the authors' childhood."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one heart wrenching story. Told mostly in the first person, little Frank mcCourt is talking to you, and when you listen (whether you like it or not, you listen), you get transported to New York with him and then to Ireland. He truly is a gifted story teller, his simple words paint a picture of his life and you feel the pain and hunger he talks about. Makes you want to hug that little boy, give him and his family food and tell him everything's going to be allright. He also surprises you with humor when you least expect it, and you find yourself laughing out loud over his escapades.Starting in New York, you meet Frank, aged 4, his brother Malachy, 3, the twins, 1. His alcoholic father can't seem to keep a job and when he does, he spends most of the money drinking in pubs, whilst his children are left starving and cold. The family moves to Limmirck, Ireland, and the father keeps his old ways - you know the father means well, Frank knows it and he loves him despite the circumstances they're in, but you can't forgive him for what he's doing to his family. Frank takes you with him as he grows up, you take in the surroundings, the utter hunger they feel, the house the live in, his mother's grief, and the sole lavotary in the lane which is right outside their kitchen window.For the longest time after finishing the book, I'd still hear the little boy talking in my head.

TheMcCourt's live in Limerick, Ireland in a beat up old house on Roden Lane. The story is about Frank McCourt living in a poor family. All he wants to do it make it to America. If I could of wrote one line it would have bee this,&quot;A mothers love is a blessing no matter where you roam keep her while you have her, you'll miss her whe she is gone.&quot; page 357 The cover is a picture of a little poor boy. I think that the little boy represents Frank McCourt. I think that the title of this book represents Angels and how when she look at the fire there is never anything there but ashes.

Attention to little details such as qutaion marks makes any story more readable. I am far from being a grammar Nazi, and can usually forgive minor things. But perhaps that is because I have read many a 12 year olds online fanfiction stories that have more flow and better grammar than Frank McCourt's writing does.I felt so little pity for the mother who seemed to be constrained by her religious beliefs that a mother should stay home, out of the work force but had no problem having a \`knee trembler' with a man she had just met that night. If she were brave and bold enough to take that type of risk, why did she not try to find work of her own? It was far from unheard of, especially in New York City in 1938. I have read far to many and have personally known many people who have found themselves in similar situations but instead of fleeing from place to place, they picked themselves up and did what it took to make life bearable, most even made life better.How was it that the extended family members able to send money for cross Atlantic travel, but could not find the resources to help the struggling family once they reached Ireland?I am sorry, but all I can see are the mistakes in this story.

Thank god I borrowed this work of maudlin stereotypical crap from the library so I didn't actually fork over any cash for it.

In fact, before I took it back to the library I inscribed in one of the early chapters, &quot;WARNING: MORE CRAP AHEAD&quot;. I didn't consider that defacing library property, I considered it a public service."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I ached for him many time for the horrors he was exposed to from his Catholic upbringing, even though I was married in the Catholic church. For instance when he wanted to pray at a very traumatic point in his childhood, but didn't have a coin to buy a candle. How awful that unBiblical practice is! But, it was laughable when he threw up the communion wafer and since he was taught it literally turned into Jesus' actual body, they didn't know if it was okay to clean up the vomit! Also, when he was afraid of the abuse by the Catholic priest, it broke my heart.It's no wonder that today, Ireland was the first country to shut down the Vatican's embassy. Many were shocked that Ireland is where this has started because for centuries, you couldn't say Irish without thinking Catholic. (To see Dublin's TV News report about this, Google: Ireland in Row Over Catholic Church, YouTube--The announcement comes on right after a brief scathing comment from Parliament.)I communicate by email with a woman from a small village in Ireland who left the Catholic church to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and because her children were the only ones not to participate in confirmation, the priest held such power that he visited the hotel where her husband worked as a manager and warned the owner that if his manager didn't get his wife back to the Catholic church, he would ensure that their hotel didn't get any more business--and he could do it, too. (She told me that it was uncovered that 57 of the priests from Ireland who had been moved around to other parishes rather than being prosecuted after molesting and raping dozens of children, were sent to the U.S.A. to be priests here, so we should beware.)She said Angela's Ashes only touches on the awful truth. There were also forced slavery from unwed mothers to work in laundries and suffer abuse by nuns that has come out, too. (To watch a movie about that, see: The Magdalene Sisters available on Amazon.) Being poor, if you went against the Catholic church in Ireland in times past, you would often go hungry, the priests held so much power and control over you which was abusive, according to my email pen-pal.Back to the book, it's very good and so much better than the movie. I was disappointed in the movie after reading the book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"You know how sometimes a book is just so good, when you see you are nearing the end, you want to slow down and savor those last few pages?\\"Angela's Ashes\\" by Frank McCourt, was that for me. It is a wonderfully beautiful memoir and an engrossing story. McCourt tells the story of his life as a boy, growing up dirt poor in Ireland. And he tells it in a way that makes it impossible to stop reading. I always had a hard time finding a point to stop turning the pages, I had to know what would happen to Frankie McCourt.The writing is incredibly honest. It flows from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, page to page. McCourt puts himself right back into the mind of his younger self, and seems to be talking and thinking just as he would from ages 4 through a young man. He speaks of his family. His father that couldn't keep his wages in his pocket on pay day, and could not make it home without stopping for a pint(or two) along the way. Yet a man who seemed to understand his young sons, and always had what seemed sage advice and a great love for his children. His mother's suffering, with the loss of children dying, trying to make do for her family by begging, and did whatever it took to keep her children warm and fed. He writes quite honestly about his schooling, his relatives, the many illnesses he and the family went through, his taking to petty thefts to keep from starving, discovering his sexuality, the jobs he had to do, and his great desire to go back to America, where he was born.The stories are sad, and will tug at your heartstrings, but the humor he uses in describing the sometimes dehumanizing events(having to empty and clean disgusting chamber pots among them) make this a stand out read instead of a woe-is-me theme.The characters jump off the page, you can hear them speak with their thick Irish accents, or in some cases New York. He writes of all the doors that were closed in his face, when he needed help, but you can feel the tenacity with which he continued to move his life forward. There are many laugh out loud moments of little Frankie's adventures, and other times you may need to have the Kleenex handy.One thing for sure, you'll be thinking of Little Frankie McCourt for a long time after the read. Through thick and thin(mostly thin) this was a family rich with love. A love that is contagious.Enjoy the Read....Laurie"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book is sad and amazing at the same time.

His story is told through his own experiences and he does not skimp on descriptions of how life was for for poor Roman Catholics that lacked economic opportunity; were mired in religious biggotry, superstition, and hatred of England; in poor-quality housing, often with insecure occupancy right; and often with tenuous access to secure sources of nutrition. Only McCourt's inherent good humor made this story enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"UNabridged, if you can find one. There was never a finer use of audio to enhance the experience of a book. The book itself is indisputably a masterwork; enough has been written about that. I just want to emphasize that for this book in particular -- an epic autobiography told almost entirely in the first person present-tense -- Frank McCourt's own voice is indispensable. Reading the words on the page cannot convey the difference between the southern and northern Ireland accents that he renders intuitively, adding a deep layer of characterization and color. His rendition of other people's voices -- neighbors, teachers, relatives, classmates -- enhances our understanding of those relationships. And most importantly, his *inflection* of each line of his own thoughts and dialogue conveys his actual experience of a situation in a way the written words could not: resignation where a reader might mistakenly infer desperation, the true intensity of the shame and guilt that pervaded so much of his childhood -- and yes, occasional wonderment, pride, even joy.Angela's Ashes is my single favorite book, which I own on CD and listen to every year (when it starts to rain in northern California -- fans will know why).

You probably will too!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As the memoir credited for propelling the genre into the 21st century, Angela's Ashes is a must-read for any fan of memoir-writing. McCourt's voice is distinct, and not just for his lyrical Irish lilt that sings off the page. I found myself replying in ayes, ochs and \`tises in just about every household conversation a week after setting the book down. The dialogue subtly hints at the accent without beating us over the head with it. I know this is a very difficult balance to strike. You can lose a dialect in dialogue, or you can saturate it to the point of distraction. McCourt adds authenticity to his character and his story through his true voice. The other remarkable feature I found was McCourt's ability to subtly age his character over the course of the book. In this memoir, we rarely hear a \\"voice behind the curtain\\" or a foresighted comment. The narrator retains the world view and knowledge of a five year old at the beginning of the book, and he grows in perception and comprehension as the story goes on.Sticking with the growing-up-as-he-goes narrative strategy, McCourt does not comment negatively on the behavior of Frank's mother or father until much later in the book. We watch Frank's father drink away the family's pittance week after week until abandoning the clan altogether. We see his mother beg and spiral downward into deeper and deeper desperation. Staying true to his upbringing and religion, Frank does not question or begrudge his parents until he enters his angst-ridden teen years. It's at that turning point, after losing his innocence in multiple ways--seeing his mother begging at the church steps, having sex with Theresa, being beaten by his mother's cousin--that fully-grown anger and resentment begin to bubble forward. He curses his absent father, doubts his religion and slaps his mother. That pivotal slap, one that we as readers ache to bestow upon both parents, is a terrifying moment for Frank. Although he can (and does) confess and repent, the innocent child that respected his parents and accepted his life is gone. There is only moving forward and beyond, which for Frank is a move to America. As we are allowed to \\"grow up\\" with Frank's voice and eyes, his transition and move is much more understandable. Angela's Ashes is a cornerstone coming-of-age memoir, a heartbreaking charmer."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a charming and touching true story of a young boy growing up poor in Ireland in the 1930's.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It involves the story of a young boy in Ireland and his struggle to survive the harsh realities of poverty. That little boy's name is Frank McCourt, an immigrant from Ireland to America, and back again. The story's plot develops itself slowly, but once you reach it, you can finally see why it's written in a first person, biography format. He is telling you the stories, the cold facts, of his childhood as a boy. He doesn't sugar coat anything, but he never directly comes out and says certain things. When he talks about his experiences with love, he never says, &quot;I love her&quot;, he says, &quot;She takes up space in my heart and I cherish her every word&quot;. The book's underlying emphasis on Catholicism and it's power in Ireland is clear more towards the end. You learn of the intolerance the people there have towards the Protestants and the English. It's also a matter of accepting the fact that they believe Catholicism to be the one and only religion. The book won a Pulitzer Prize, it's not hard to see why. The description and imagery are great, and the memories it brings back for the reader are incredible. The one thing that this book really does, and really pounds into you, is that you have to realise how lucky you are. &quot;Frankie&quot; came from nothing but poverty and a broken family. He had nothing to start with, but slowly worked himself up to become a respected man. It's no wonder you cheer for him the whole book. I wish that I had read this sooner, when my grandmother had recommended it. I thought I wouldn't like it. The dark humor shown is a little disturbing at times, but like any TV show or movie, it's gone and voer with before you have any second thoughts. It's the underlying sense of self-determination and self-reliance that will really hit you in the end. There is one fault with this book and it's style. There are no quotation marks. You don't have any knowledge that someone is speaking in some places so you have to go back and re-read it to make sure you didn't miss anything.

Dont get me wrong: I do think it's a very good book. The best thing about Angel's Ashes is its lack of sorrowfulness - you dont see an author sobbing over a painful childhood and asking for your sympathy. Instead it's treated with great humor (this book does have some of the funniest passages you'd read in a serious autobiographies) and a lack of egoism. The narrator describes things for what they are and show a geniune interests in the psychologies of others. Even when it comes to an unsympathetic character, the protrait is drawn with great understanding and warmth. The oceanic existence of the child is particularly well-done, with great immediacy, that we get drawn into his universe in great sympathy. These are among the greatest achievements an autobiographer can have.The only thing I am uncomfortable with is the ending. It's a very deliberate construction of McCourt 'giving up' Ireland (symbolized by the Priest) for U.S. and its values (think of the woman who grabs him - and the affirmative answer he gives to the question: isn't America wonderful?). The book ends well - but I can't get rid of the feeling that it is a bit too 'market-oriented', which undermines the previous narrative a little bit when you go back to read it again."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If this book does not touch your soul, you may want to wonder if you have one at all.

We readers can simply revel in McCourt's literary achievement by treating ourselves to more of his unique kind of prose. In addition to Angela's Ashes, his astonishingly short writing career has produced two sequels - 'Tis and Teacher Man - that entertain us further as we take in scene after enchanting scene of this man's extraordinary life.And an extraordinary life truly 'tis.To read McCourt's memoirs is to experience the art of the possible and the power of the human spirit to triumph over even the worst of hardships. What McCourt accomplishes as an adolescent and then as a man in merely surviving a childhood of abject poverty and despair is remarkable. And then to achieve critical acclaim and the height of commercial success as an author is nothing short of spectacular! Winning the Pulitzer Prize is but icing on the cake!If a memoirist's place in the world can be secured through his ability to spin an eminently readable story about his life that both edifies and entertains, then McCourt has more than secured his place. Generous and deeply satisfying are the lines that seemingly leap without effort from McCourt's pen. His writing has a uniquely winsome style that both charms the reader and leaves him craving more. We so enjoy reading about the McCourts that we wait breathlessly to find out how a given situation will play out.McCourt draws us in with sentences that are light and airy and that refuse to collapse under the weight of an editor's pen. Punctuated sparingly, McCourt's writing reads much as a child relating a story would speak and delights us in its lighthearted tone and earthiness. A refreshing honesty permeates his prose and leaves us wondering how long it took this unusual author to perfect his storyteller's gift. An irreverent, distinctively Irish brand of irony also underlies much of McCourt's work, and in Angela's Ashes it fully grabs us and refuses to let go.But McCourt's genius as a writer extends infinitely beyond his writing style.His work is defined by his gentle handling of the depressing and the desperate, the miserable and the forlorn, the painful and the unspeakable. With uncommon humor and grace, McCourt relates the events of his childhood amid poverty, disease, and neglect in Limerick, Ireland in the 1930s. Hunger and disease stalk the McCourt children from the shadows of the Limerick 'lanes' they call home. Every day brings another test of wills with the vermin that multiply and flourish in the foul, squalid conditions.A test even for stoic, young Frank, three of his siblings die as small children. Yet despite their difficult circumstances, Frank, Malachy and their younger brothers never succumb to the despair of the downtrodden nor do they accept the hopelessness of their lot in life. While their mother 'stares into the fire' and continually ruminates about her family's plight, the boys play on, finding ways to entertain themselves even in their destitute state.Their father, Malachy, sometimes employed, more often than not, 'on the dole', frequently succumbs to the pull of the bottle and in the process fritters away what little money he earns as an itinerant factory worker. He is seldom employed for longer than a few months and eventually drops out of his family's orbit altogether while working in a London munitions factory. Frank seems to endure his father's chronic alcoholism and irresponsibility with a sort of world weariness that masks a deep, unrequited love.Perhaps most poignant in McCourt's writing is this peculiar loyalty the McCourt boys have toward their father that extends beyond what could or should ever be expected. Ironically, the boys continue to hold their father in high esteem while he repeatedly demonstrates all the reasons they should not. In Angela's Ashes, McCourt never blames his father for 'drinking the pint' while his children go hungry, preferring instead to portray his father as an eccentric study in contradictions. (Malachy refuses to accept handouts, for instance; it is beneath him. Yet he readily accepts public assistance from the Irish government.)With his father out of the picture and his family sinking further into poverty, Frank resolves to assume the role of breadwinner. His determination results in a series of jobs that put food in his brothers' bellies and pride once again in their hearts. Frank reaches for responsibility as much as his father studiously avoids it. Thankfully for the McCourt brood, Frank is a serious-minded adolescent who deeply loves his brothers. He will stop at nothing to keep them alive - even petty crime.By turns raucously funny and painfully sad, Angela's Ashes is a joy to read. Through a gifted writer, we experience the resilience of children trying to make sense of the world in deplorable conditions, choosing to reject their impoverished state rather than be condemned by it. And we are witness to the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. Their father alcoholic, their mother depressed, their home rife with infectious disease and gnawing hunger lurking around every corner... the McCourt boys somehow find a way to beat the odds.That they are alive to regale us with their stories is both a tribute to the unquenchable spirit of the Irish and a gift to all humanity.To see the humor in life's most desperate circumstances is to learn life-affirming lessons. To laugh along with Frank McCourt is to be let in on an exceptional author's 'wee bit of fun.'Magnificent!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Without hope and a goal to live for, Frank McCourt could have become a member of the IRA, but instead he became a Pulitzer Prize winning author in America.In the powerful memoir Angela's Ashes, the author, Frank McCourt, details his tragic and trying upbringing that compels him to strive for a better life for himself as well as his family. Living in poverty in Limerick, Ireland, during the 1930s and 40s, the McCourt's struggle to survive in a crowded drafty apartment. Frank's mother, Angela suffers from depression having witnessed the deaths of three of her children. His father, Malachy, is a constant disappointment because of his irresponsible drinking. McCourt contrasts his mother and father by writing, \\"The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.\\" After being confirmed at church Frank is struck with typhoid fever. At the hospital, he is introduced to Shakespeare and we begin to see his passion for storytelling. Even with his father's negligent behavior, Frank still looks up to Malachy due to his entertaining stories about Irish heroes and Frank wants to develop his own talent for weaving a tale.With the arrival of World War II, Malachy, along with many other men, moved to England to work in an artillery factory. Once again demonstrating his negligence towards his family, unlike many of the other men, he drinks away his earnings as opposed to sending them back to support his family. Frank, being an exceptionally smart student tried to continue school after graduating, which wasn't easy given their impoverished second class position in Ireland. He soon takes on multiple jobs that gave him a sense of responsibility. Even with the addition of his earnings, the McCourt's get evicted, forcing them to move in with Angela's cousin. While all this is happening, religion is the one thing that keeps him sane, keeps him fighting, and keeps the readers entertained; I continually found it amusing and ironic that Frank would constantly feel guilty about doing things that kept him alive and happy. He would go to confession many times throughout his childhood. This is also fascinating because it shows that with all the misery, they still believe in God, who remains their number one priority. Frank begins having an affair with one of his clients while working as a messenger boy, but again experiences heartbreak when the lady dies of tuberculosis. Frank works through everything imaginable in a great attempt to make it to America and create a decent life for himself.Frank McCourt, as shown through this memoir, can accomplish anything. To bring this story to life he writes as if he were a child, as if he was writing in a diary. By doing this the reader is with the character every second of every day; the reader sees, hears, and feels what the author went through. Due to phonetic spelling and pore punctuation it is sometimes easy to get lost in the words, literally. Without McCourt's eloquent writing style that expresses much detail and humor, Angela's Ashes could have been a complete and utter bore, but he certainly pulls off this depressing and yet uplifting book with both attitude and irony. We begin the story in a state of weariness, but once we see that the protagonist is able to push through and have the strength to travel a different path then his father. We as readers are also given hope, which is the key to winning the reader's heart."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If that title had not already been taken it would have fit this book perfectly. I resisted and resisted and resisted this book, but sometimes the masses are absolutely correct. This was a brilliant read and totally absorbing. I read it in two days time. At moments, I was in tears, the scene where the surviving twin searches the house for his brother is burned into my brain forever and at other moments I found myself laughing. This is the single best memoir I have ever read. Pick it up, now."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was one of those best-sellers that truly lived up to its hype. Frank McCourt's prose and his incredible story of growing up very poor in Ireland, is one for the ages. Over 1,800 reviews of it here on Amazon tells you something.If you missed this book - and the hype has longed died down over it so there is a chance you may not hear about it these day - take the word of reviewers here and take notice of all the awards the book won: this is good stuff!Rarely I have read a book with so much sadness, humor, sweetness and tragedy all rolled into one.The storytelling here was so good that a movie was made (almost word-for-word with the book). a sequel to the book was written and documentaries have been made about the McCourt family. In addition, Frank's ultra-crazy brother Malachy also wrote about his adventures.I know it sounds like a cliche, but this is a story you will never forget."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book already has a ton of reviews that give the gist of the storyline, so I won't repeat that here. I do, however, feel compelled to share that this memoir is extremely well-written and I found myself teary-eyed several times. When I was about 3/4 of the way through the book, I found myself busting out my checkbook to get donations out to charities that I've been putting off for awhile. It has opened my eyes to the struggles that so many go through that I have no concept of here in my middle-class suburban world. Angela's Ashes is not only a great read with emotional pull, it likely will change the way you look at the world and the place you have in it. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really can't say much more - it was just an outstanding story in every way.

I love that the story was narrated by Frank McCourt himself with his Irish accent. The fact that you can feel his feelings as he reads his own story it makes it so real. I could almost see him at times on the lane he lived on. I felt for him and everything he want through but I love his perseverance to make it even after his near death experiences. He still went on to make something of himself.

Unless you really don't have the time or inclination, do yourself a favor and buy (or borrow) the unabridged version (12 CDs). It really is a delight and privilege to listen to McCourt telling HIS story. One gets so much more insight into the mood of each event whether it be heartbreaking, frustrating or funny. I cannot speak highly enough of the book, and even more highly of the audio book.

Frank McCourt tells the reader about his own very scarce childhood in Ireland. He retells how he lived as a little child and eventually grew up into a man by making sure that his family was provided for as best he could provide as a teenager. As he grows into a man he begins to realize how important his contributions are to his starving family.In this very personal recollection Frank McCourt shows the reader true pain and suffering. He really brings you into the situation and makes you feel the cold and the damp. Although this is such a heart-wrenching story this is by far one of the best books I have read recently."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Very good read.

I come from a background as opposite and different from McCourt's as humanly possible. And because I am not Irish, have no Irish blood in my family tree, and am not Catholic, I truly did not believe I'd get &quot;into&quot; this book. I hate to admit when I'm wrong, but boy, was I wrong! Truly amazing writing. I am in love with &quot;little&quot; Frank McCourt. And yes, we ALL want the sequel. Give him time! Perhaps we'll get it yet!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, Scribner, 1996 (first publication), 365pp, Hardcover.How Green Was My Valley, Richard Llewellyn, Aeonian Press, First published 1940, 447pp, Hardcover.One of my favorite Monty Python skits is the one in which a bunch of middle-aged fogies sit around a table mumbling about how hard life was when they were children. When talk turns to walking uphill &quot;both ways&quot; to school, one cannot help but laugh at how the older generation always has to talk about how tough things were in the old days. It makes me wonder if we'll be complaining about how we only had 10 MIPS workstations to our grandchildren.Well, here we have a couple of books about growing up deprived. McCourt's autobiographical account of growing up poor in Ireland in the thirties and forties, and Llewellyn's fictional depiction of growing up in Wales as a coal miner's son in what could have been the same period (there was no mention of world war two, though there was mention of Churchill, so it could have been in the twenties, or might be set before the first world war). Llewellyn himself had a career in hotel management in London and Venice, and spent a few months as a miner as part of his research in writing his novel.Despite the superficial subject and narrative (both were told from a child's point of view: Frank McCourt in the case of his memoir, and Huw Morgan, in the case of Llewellyn's story ) similarities, these are very different books, and very different stories.. The differences show up early. Here's McCourt, telling us about the Irish birthright:&quot;People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fir;...;the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years... Above all-we were wet.&quot; (McCourt, Chapter 1)Huw Morgan, on the other hand, looks back at his childhood with much more nostalgia:&quot;There was a smell with that soup... It comes to me now, round and gracious and vital with herbs fresh from the untroubled ground, a peaceful smell of home and happy people. Indeed, if happiness has a smell, I know it well, for our kitchen always had it faintly, but in those days it was all over the house.&quot; (Llewellyn, Chapter 1)Both books are written well---Llewellyn's voice by itself will bring you to Morgan's beautiful green valleys of times past, and his careful use of foreshadowing jerks you back to Morgan's ugly present. McCourt's voice is not as distinctive at first, probably because he is American, but as you read along you realize that he is pulling you back to his consciousness of childhood, and he is almost embarrassingly honest, but so straightforward that you cannot help but laugh at the situations he describes, and then afterwards wonder how you could have laughed at such a horrible situation.Yet if both books are written so well that I would be hard put to rank one above another purely on style (I'd rank Llewellyn as a better writer, but just by a hair), the moods the authors try to achieve are miles apart. Perhaps it is because one knows that McCourt makes it to America and does well (He taught writing at Stuyvesant High School in New York), so one can look forward to hearing about how things do get better for him, even as suffers &quot;pompous priests&quot; and &quot;bullying schoolmasters&quot;. McCourt literally looks forward from his childhood out, and gets you to laugh at the contradictions and insanity of a Catholic upbringing all the while. When he finally &quot;succeeds&quot; in his plan to emigrate, you cheer for him.Llewellyn, on the other hand, has Huw Morgan look back to an idyllic state while hinting at the sadness to come, establishing a melancholy mood for the entire novel. In the hands of a lesser writer, this mood might have overpowered the rest of the story, but Llewellyn succeeds in aligning your interest with that of the characters, which compels the reader to turn page after page, wondering &quot;what happens next?&quot; You cringe, when Huw says he's going to be a coal miner &quot;just like Dada&quot; when his own father knows that there's a limit to how much coal there is left. As Llewellyn sneaks in the growing intrusion of the mine into the valley and the lives of its people, you slowly identify with Huw Morgan's horror at the desecration of his childhood home.Even the depiction of religion differs between the two stories. For Morgan's family, religion binds the family and village together, and the village preacher is very much &quot;one of them.&quot; For McCourt, the priesthood made a mockery of charity, and religion was an irrationality used by the priesthood for their benefit. For Llewellyn's characters, it is the mine owners and the invading English who are the villains. For McCourt, it is the character failures of his parents, as well as the harshness of society around them, that led his family into poverty.As an immigrant (though under much less dire circumstances), I identify much more with McCourt and his story. The irrationality he faced as a child mirror my own experiences going to a Methodist missionary school. McCourt's cheerful optimism about better things to come despite the circumstances makes his memoir a more authentic experience compared to Llewellyn's novel about losing the idyllic life of times past. But Llewellyn's use of language is so beautiful that I'm going to have to buy a copy of this book (and there I was thinking that using the library would save me on book costs!). Just be sure to clear out hours from your schedule if you plan to read either of these books, because both are compelling and it would be a shame to have to rush through either of them."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was kept in stitches by Frank McCourt's candid, colloquial style, in which every dreadful episode of his childhood was viewed with the sarcasm that made his English classes at my alma mater, Stuyvesant High School, so enjoyable. If only the ending of the book had not degenerated into the hackneyed naive-immigrant-loses-his-virginity-to-the-vixenish-socialite episode, McCourt's saga would have rated an unmitigated ten."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes paints unforgetable scenes of poverty few of us have seen. McCourt's ability to share his families lowest points and show humor is a true gift. I cried buckets on one page only to laugh at the next. I enjoyed his ability to write from his &quot;child's eye&quot; view and not offer excuses for each character's behavior. Periodically, while reading, I would approximate Angela's age. Poor Angela. How could you not cry for such a young woman, eroded by her environment, who lost so much dear to her. Written as both vulnerable and strong,Angela used every option available to take care of her most valuable possessions-her children. The ending was disappointing to me because McCourt stole money and abandon his mother and brothers to pursue &quot;a better life&quot;.

It is funny, for I have never been to Ireland, nor met anyone Irish, but have grown up in another poor European catholic country (Croatia). The paragraph that stroke me the most as very familiar is this one: &quot;The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live.&quot; That was almost enough for me to love this book.

In part, the trouble stems from it's essentially autobiographical character, and just how much and what the author should tell. I suspect that Angela McCourt would never want anyone to know of her liason with her cousin -- but her son has chosen to tell the world. OK, she's dead and gone now but somehow it seems exploititive. As for the ending of the book, this was the greatest letdown of all. A gratuitious and shabby encounter with the wives of married men is supposed to somehow represent the hope and promise of a new land and a new start.

Frank McCourt, the oldest child, tells the story of his family in Ireland and their unfortunate poverty and depression. The father is a mean, cold-hearted man who constantly spends his and his children's money on liquor for himself. The mother, Angela, is without a doubt the backbone of the family; she makes sure they eat and worries about the rent and the well-being of her children. Throughout the story Angela teaches her children the importance of pride and dignity. The ill-starred family is continually struck with the death of very young family members. Even though several children die from starvation and cold before the age of five, McCourt manages to portray these tragedies and shows the family's ability to move on with life. Although the memoir, in general, is an incredibly sad one, the humor of McCourt's style makes the book bearable. Because McCourt's writing style is so descriptive, the reader is able to feel the families sorrow and unhappiness, and we see the world in which they live. Unfortunately, Angela's Ashes did not shine through in the recent holiday film released by Paramount. The film showed the importance of McCourt's humor by not incorporating it into the adaptation. Without this humor, the film was dark, sad, ugly and unbearable. The book on the other hand, may be sad, but is at the same time uplifting."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A gripping tale of a very pathetic childhood.

ANGELA'S ASHES is an inspiring book that is beautifully written. I recommend it highly to everyone."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt did a wonderful job bring his readers back to his tragic childhood in Ireland. Poverty was something that his family struggled with and it did not help the situation as his father was a hard-core alcoholic who prefers to spend his dole money on drinks even though his family is barely surviving. McCourt also had to deal with the deaths of his sibblings due to improper care and lack of food.I like this book a lot because it makes us think of how fortunate we are, to have food, loved ones and at times, we don't appreciate what we have. This book also gives a good perspective of how difficult times were after the Great Depression and how World War II were able to provide jobs for a lot of people and helped to boost the economy.I think this book is quite funny too besides the problems faced by the McCourts.

I received it as a gift from my friend. I read the first sentence, and suddenly I was captured in one adventure, full of emotion. Frank McCourt really could make the reader visualize the situation at that time, though we understand nothing about Irish history. Nothing about the Great Famine, nothing about the conflict between Catholic and Protestant, nothing about its culture and perspective. We can start from zero, and understand a half of Irish history and culture.This is a very good autobiography. We are trapped in his feeling, a child's view, a child's emotion seeing his mother struggle to live and to earn living for her children amongst the death and the living. A child's perspective toward his brothers' and sister's deaths. A child's acceptance toward a hard life.

A great book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a memoir of a heroic child, Frank McCourt who survives a miserable Catholic childhood. As you read the book, the author manages to make you feel the happiness and sadness experienced by that young boy. With reading each page you get to know him better, and your heart will reach out for him. Born in America, Frank spends the first few years of his life there, until his youngest sister, Margaret, dies. Their living status declines and they are forced to go back to his mother's hometown, Limerick, in Ireland. The book tells of his struggle to survive in a town where he and his brothers are considered outsiders. Not only are they Yanks, coming from America, but also their father is from the despised North Ireland. As if that is not enough, their poverty makes them the laughingstock all over the lane. And worse of all is having an irresponsible father, who is a regular drinker not caring whether or not his children were fed. Matters get from bad to worse and there is nothing they can do but survive the harsh conditions where death hovers above their heads and ailments are nothing but neighbours to him and his family. Some of them win the game but other loses. Frank builds himself a dream of going to America again and pursues it with all of what he got, a thinking mind between his shoulders and the clothes on his body. The book is told with genuine truth that it will touch your hearts, and you will want to cry with that boy whose childhood was not of that of a normal child. The boy who holds back his tears because he thinks he is a man, and men don't cry, a boy who manages to survive and live despite everything else."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really loved this book, except the last chapter when it turned when it lost it's rich literacy and turned 'cheap'.

It can't hardly dwelve into the depths of McCourt's mind, which is an endless canyon of heartache, desire, warmth and unsolicited humor.

The reader becomes McCourt's diary, listening to his confessions, his fears, his hopes, and his thoughts. Frank never encountered luck in his life, he always had to look out for himself. One plaque after another fronted Frank to test his strength and his will to survive: moving back to Ireland, watching his younger siblings taken away by the Angel of Death, facing poverty caused by an alcoholic father's carelessness, relatives who did not &quot;give a fiddler's fart&quot; about Frank and his family, the church slamming doors in his face, one disease after another, and his father abandoning his family to rot in the lanes of Limerick. The Irish suffered during World War II, but by shear determination, Frank McCourt escaped his nightmare to the &quot;land of opportunity.&quot; By telling his life story as it happens, the reader becomes much more involved and interested in the life of Frank McCourt. The pizzazz would have disappeared if McCourt would have written his story as a memoir. By making his novel into a diary, the reader gains more interest and emotions from each and every gauntlet Frank had to face in his life. Frank's choice of narration makes the book more informal as if the reader were having a conversation with young Frankie. The only other title for this book would have been &quot;My Struggles.&quot; Frank McCourt is the epitome of man. His strength and his will to live amaze me. At a time when most people would have thrown in the towel, Frank refused to succumb to his adversaries. After reading this book, anyone can see that goals and dreams can be reached even in the darkest and most miserable of situations. Angela's Ashes is a champion among books and Frank McCourt is a champion among men."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt's method of recalling events and his total avoidance of quotation marks to set off dialogue makes Ashes a refreshing and delightful book to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a well-crafted piece of literature that tells of a very real childhood. However, I must admit the only reason why I rate the novel an 8 instead of a 10 is the &quot;depressing&quot; facture;the subject matter of the novel tends to weigh heavy on the heart."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes should be required reading for any teen growing up in less than desirable circumstances. This book appeals to all races and nationalities....it is a 'must read' for those who have ever faced adversity or poverty, and is a demonstration of how the will to survive and endure can triumph. I admit that much of the material was difficult for me to read, and that I was, on occasion, angry with &quot;Angela&quot; for her tendency to wallow in her victimization. Nevertheless; having grown up in an irish catholic family, I understood that she was a product of her upbringing...I often observed a similar over-reliance on faith, and less reliance on self in overcoming life's obstacles. Again; this is a compelling story, and one I would encourage anyone to read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a wonderful way to bring to life the struggles of the people of Limerick during WWII.

I can't wait for the next piece of perfection from McCourt!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the best books that I have read.

This is truly a story that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be well written, I did not find it inspiring as so many other readers did. I thought that while Frank made it out of Ireland it offered no chance for anyone else. he made it out through luck and good timing, but not through means accessible to others. The entire time he worked for the lady he eventually robbed, he claimed to be ashamed of himself but felt nothing for robbing her? I do not think we should be inspired by a thief. Also, he left his family no money, if he didn't mind stealing money for himself, why couldn't he buy them food? I did enjoy the book though, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a description of Ireland and poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am a first generation Irish-American who was profoundly touched by Mr. McCourt's novel. I have vivid memories of a Catholic Church in Brooklyn, NY in the 1960's who barraged my recently widowed Mother for a tuition payment that was only days late shortly after my Father died and left my mother with a seven year old brother and myself (I was five years old at the time). His story made me remember alot of growing up without(not to his degree) or with very little. Eventhough we had little we had a wonderful Irish Mother who could make her $15.00/day wages for cleaning houses stretch to the point that my brother and I thought we were rich. There were many cans of Scotch Broth soup that were turned into fine meals. We created our little &quot;Italy&quot; in Brooklyn. Thanks Frank for making me remember the good and the bad and for better yet for making me feel proud of succeeding. &quot;Tis&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Even as a very young reader, I found this book to be extrodinary. I was amazed at how Frank McCourt lived through the poverty and tragedy he faced throughout his childhood. I'll be honest and admit that some parts could have been better written, but in a way it adds to a certain flare that exists in his writing. Overall, I found this book to be truly outstanding, and I highly recommened it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In a time where Irish step, Celtic art, traditional irish music or almost anything associated with Ireland is popular, McCourt's book addresses less the various issues of his life than the cultural idiosyncracies that attract mainstream audiences. Like Michael Flatley or The Chietains McCourt has taken a base of Irish culture and Americanized it. His style is so appealing, it is unfortunate he used it in such an unappealing fashion. I sympathize with the McCourt family's plight, but there are so many stories that Mr McCourt could have used his talent to tell without having to take advantage of the current run on &quot;Irish Culture.&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"this book was non-stop.

I really recomend this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a great book, so graphically written, and easy to read. It was not difficult to visualise Frank's life, and truly appreciate your own. My only two criticisms are that it could have been slightly condensed and I didn't like the abrupt ending. I also found myself getting extremely depressed, a sign of a good book! I look forward to the continuation of Frank's life story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought Angela's Ashes and read Angela's Ashes in two days..in between living my own life, I also lived Frankie's. I was stunned, moved and felt, finally, jubilation at his triumph over a childhood so appalling as to beggar belief. Whenever I begin to believe I am a somewhat inadaquate parent, Malachy and Angela can make me believe I am doing okay thankyou. I no longer have my copy of the book. When I had finished it for the second time, I gave it to my 19 year old son and said to him that if he only ever read one more book in the whole of his life, to please let it be this one. He is a typical 19 year old male, jeans short hair etc. but this book has affected him in the oddest manner..for the better! So I have lost my copy because it is doing the rounds of his friends...I can't think of a better testimony to Angela's Ashes than that it has the ability to affect teenagers in such a fashion. He, and I, and everyone I know is the better for reading the harrowing account of Frank McCourts life and I say 'Thankyou Frankie' from the bottom of my soul."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Of comments here, no one has mentioned the hospital scenes. In the fifties, I was hospitalized at age seven for expended periods and these scenes mean the most to me. The isolation and the power of goodness and literature....in fact, for both Frankie and me, these hospital experiences shaped us in positive ways. Irony: a serious, painful disease that brings enlightenment, self-discovery, intuition, and will to survive.Also: Compares to THE GOOD EARTH in showing the effects of famine, disease,universality of themes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memoir is one of the best memoirs i have read (given that i have only read one or two other memoirs). It tells the painful tale of an alcoholic father and neglecting mother. Strict and cruel realatives and school teachers, disease, famine and bitterness. The bitterness of the people around him is overwhelming. What makes this book so painful is the inhumane suffering that he and the people around him have suffered. yet this book is compelling in that one reads on in hope things take a better turn. I found that reading this is like watching someone in quick sand up to their necks and continuing to sink at a rapid rate. This is quite an easy book to read, it flow's quite nicely apart from the rules of grammar that seemed to be ignored. I did find myself having to read things over. But overall a very good book and I givve it high reccomendations."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The sole merit of this memoir is Frank McCourt's perserverance through poverty, famine, and filth. Humanitarianism and altruism are replaced by sanctimony. Any alleged humor existing in this story is lost on me. Desperation leading to absurd circumstances hardly qualify as humor. It really is amazing how much suffering humans can endure. McCourt really is a Robin Hood of hearts. The story teaches an important lesson-- gratitude --- and succeeds inspite of itself. The prose and narration of the story is dismal at best. McCourt's style is one of a middle-aged man attempting (and failing) to write in the style of a young boy growing up in destitute Ireland. Often, he fails in this endeavor. There is a peculiar mix of old and young story-telling which truthfully doesn't work. Incessant, excessive italicized poems and recitations do little to enhance the reader's appreciation of the rich Irish culture or even, to elevate the story. After the first dozen, I ignored these automatically. Endless pages describing excrement and other bodily secretions are repulsive and unnecessary. The point is clear, yet it is made over and over again. Though I felt a sense of relief at the end of the story because of McCourt's opportunity in America, I was also very disappointed. Perhaps the editor should have eliminated the entire middle section (tedious) and included a last BRIEF paragraph on McCourt's life in America--where he attended university, marriage, relationship with his family, how he decided to write the memoir.... Even considering all these negative elements of the story, I still believe that McCourt deserved the Pulitzer for his intensive compilation of all these memories, if not for his style of writing. He is a great man, and very rich as he deserves to be."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes effected me by changing my outlook on life. Frank McCourt's stories of surviving extreme poverty, and overcoming cruelty from extended family members and many others, are inspiring. Even more amazing is the fact that he had the strength and discipline to write down the memories of his bleak upbringing. This should be required reading for any member of &quot;Generation X&quot; or any overindulged teenager who dares to complain about life. A co-worker loaned me the book, but I am buying my own copy because I never want to forget some of the people Frank described. I did find the ending abrupt, however, and I want to know more about his life, and his family. A sequel, please!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am 25 and Irish. I grew up in comfortable middle class surroundings and never wanted for anything really. This book opened my eyes to just how different my upbringing was to that of my parents. I finally understood the stories from their childhoods about walking to school barefoot and &quot;going without&quot;. My mother said that she found this book too difficult to read in parts as it was a little too close to the bone! I was amazed; I always thought being poor was slightly romantic. When I read the book's graphic descriptions of poverty (even if it was through the eyes of a child), you can imagine what the parents must have been going through - the shame of it all. That's why the father drinks constantly. It's not just the fact that he was weak, he needed an escape and drink and dreams of Ireland being free provided that. You could say the parents should have been stronger but how? It was like they were cursed, everything always seemed to go wrong. No matter what they did, the situation just seemed to get worse. Ireland in those days was a terrible place and I'm just glad it's got a lot better. Now, people have choices then, they did not. The only slight critism I have of Frank McCourt's wonderful book is the ending. I didn't feel part of it. Up to then, I went through all the pain, humiliation and humour with him. But at the end, it felt very detached. Is this because he had to detach himself from his home and his family to go to America. I think so but am not sure. All in all, what a great book. A homage to Ireland, warts and all. I wonder if the brothers and priests would turn their backs on Frank McCourt now?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Growing up Irish, catholic in the mid-50's- this book really hit home. Just when you think your own life growing up Irish-catholic with an alcoholic father and a weak mother was too much to bear and you start to feel sorry for yourself; then you read Angela's Ashes and realize that compared to his life - your life was almost paradise. I laughed and I cried, but mostly I cried. Once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down. I am not an avid reader, but this book was wonderful.

I do not know what I was expecting, but that was not it.Yes, it was a good book overall, and I would recomend this to anybody who is in the mood for a good cry and laugh."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Born into a poor Irish Catholic family, Frank grows up in the slums of Manhattan and Limerick facing problems such as a drunk father, family tragedies, consumption and poverty. Although this book gets a little boring sometimes, it is quite exciting cause at any time one wants to know what happens next to Frank and his family.The author Frank McCourt did an excellent job on writing about his childhood and how he went through it.JUST LIVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD THAT FACED PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY YOURSELF."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is so depressing its funny. Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a memoir full of thought and detail with descriptions that draw you in and have you turning pages. Frank McCourt makes it clear that with out pain and suffering there would not be joy and happiness. One of the best qualities in the book is the character. The characters in the book are so real and defined that it is easy to feel that you know and can relate to someone you've never even met. They are full of life and have you laughing and crying. One problem with the book is that although the humor was hidden amongst the hardship was that it is to depressing. The sadness that often made the memoir moving sometimes gets really depressing and will fall in to ruts that make you want to stop reading. This doesn't happen often but when it does the book becomes fairly uninteresting. It is hard to not read a book that is written with words that flow off the page and are almost as beautiful as the joy and happiness sprinkled within this book. The Irish dialect in the memoir really is a part of what makes this book great. This memoir was a great account of childhood and it is amazing the way the author can remember and describe everything in his early life. I would definitely recommend this book to reader who was looking for humor within tragedy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Innocence. Growing up in Ireland Frank MCcourt was deprived of his childhood innocence. He was forced to grow up fast and pass over what could have been a world full of fun and exciting childhood memories. His life was hungry for more than just food. He was hungry for childhood. Innocence in childhood simply skipped.One quality that this book possesses is that you really feel as though as though you are growing up again with Frank MCcourt. You travel through his experiences by his side through the streets of Limerick. You almost feel troubled with his difficult events. You almost want to help him. So buckle up in for an emotion roller coaster.Another quality of this book is the incredibly vivid detail and description. You as a reader are able to visualize the scenery. You are able to feel the emotions of the family in a small degree. You get the hunger for life reading the book.A quality that I didn't like was the tendency to drag on a topic. I felt that even after the thought had been rung out and dried up they were continued a bit to long. This quality made it difficult to read because it was a challenge to stay involved in the story. The plot was drawn out and quite over used. Angela's ashes was a remarkable story about a young boy becoming a man. A boy supporting his family at the age of thirteen. It is sad yet beautiful the way his heart is true."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes was a moving, charming and a fine example of an Irish childhood. He describes the thoughts, ideas, and feelings of himself living in the Old Irish country. He goes through adventures, tragedies, and everyday life and puts it in to a form to read so everyone can share the experiences he had. One of the many things McCourt illustrated was how he balanced his positive and negative occurrences. For example, when he would get the money to eat toffee and when his brothers and sisters were born. To when his father would drink the dole and his mom would smoke woodbines by the fire and mourn over her lost children. So, basically,McCourt displays his life in an elaborate yet simple design and balance.The next achievement of Frank's is the ability to remember what is was like to be a child and describe it from that point of view. It's hard to imagine what it was to think in the very way you did decades ago. Also in such a way that people would understand it. That is one of Frank McCourt's hardest obstacles to get over.The final accomplishment that he made was the placing of the Irish accent. The Irish accent is a hard thing to copy especially to put on paper in which readers could understand. The accent also added charm to the memoir and helped us get into the characters and stories better. That's why I think placing the Irish accent was Frank's greatest accomplishment when writing this book.Overall Angela's Ashes was a spectacular memoir. It had all the charm and adventure I would expect from Frank McCourt as a writer and I hope his sequel\\"\`Tis\\" is as good as the first."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"hey :)i've just finished reading angela's ashes and all i can say is WOW!! :) i can't describe how much i enjoyed reading this book, and i can't wait till i read Tis! i couldn't stop reading this book. the way he describes his childhood is amazing. it's hard to understand a book like this if you've never had any real struggles in life, but... well, it's just great. he wrote this book in a way so that mostly anybody could enjoy it and understand it. i mean, it's his life! :) i didn't know wether to cry or laugh sometimes... this is definately a MUST read book! i hate writing reviews for books 'cause i'm VERY bad at it, but i just HAD to let everybody know that this is a GREAT book! if you want to know more details about the book you can email me at: rivas_juanita@hotmail.com. later, take care"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is such a splendid work of literature, that one's eyes cannot belive what they have before them.

You may think it was nasty, but, ah, this was only part of the early childhood of Mr. McCourt and his family.

Cathy's selction for me was Angela's Ashes. A truly inspiring read that takes you back to old school Ireland and lets you experience the world through the eyes of a poor young boy, Frank McCourt. His 'youthful' yet witty language made it a joy to read. Throughout the story, Frankie reveals the daily strugles of living with a drunken farther, in deplorable living conditions, with little money for clothes or fun. And through it all he still manages to make you laugh with stories of his youth.It the kind of book that you hate to finish and it's sure to make you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading the first few chapters of this book, you will be tempted to abandon this exercise in emotional stabitlity. For it is not easy reading for those who are compassionate and prone to vivid imaginings. Once you start reading, however, you take on a mission. You need to see Frank through all his difficult times and assure yourself he will not succomb to such deprivation. You are at one with this child in his search to 'be' where he must first survive. This book is a wakeup call to the complacent who refuse to hear the 'silent needs' of the very young. It serves to remind us that all children, then and now, desperately need a sense of belonging and a source of security. It illustrates the ability of a boy to derive the simplest of joys in the weariest of circumstances. Final note: You will be less self-consumed as you reach the end of the text. You will probably set a box of tissues adside as preparation for the finale. This is not necessary. The ending is anti-climatic in contrast to the emotional echoes rendered within.&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a book full of wonder and dismay. It is an experience not to be denied."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this just to see what all the fuss was about; I am generally not a fan of directly autobiographical material. This book absorbed me very quickly and would not let me go until I finished... and now I can't wait to get the sequal. McCourt tells his life beautifully, using a child's-point-of-view style of narrative that his honest, cute, and humorous. He brings all the characters around him to life and gives them enough personality to make you feel like you know then; and perhaps you do in the carnation of a friend or relative of your own. Insightful of his own past, without letting a trace of his future voice enter, McCourt has entered into the literary world a memoir to be heralded and studied by all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I finished this book months ago, and it still haunts me. I plan to be the first in line (on-line?) when the sequel is released this fall. Although born and raised in this country, I am Irish through and through, and I responded deeply to the absolute authenticity of McCourt's voice. After finishing this book, I felt that I understood my mother's family much clearly. Yes, just as you've heard, terrible things happen in &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, many of them, but just when you think you can't take any more, McCourt turns the tables and leaves you laughing and crying all at once. In thinking back on this book, I can't help but quote (sort of) that other famous Irishman with a fine appreciation for black humor, Beckett: &quot;We must go on.... I can't go on...... I will go on!&quot;Now that's Irish for you. So quick -- get the book!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really like this book.

Reading some of the other rewieves on this page, specifically from the person who on 5/24 gave this phenominal book 1 star, I had to write one of my own. The essential part of reading this book, regardless of how you viewed the finished result, is that if Frank McCourt had not retold every &quot;ugly&quot; detail of his youth, there would be no story. NO life is void of disgusting events. Every life, including that of the McCourt family, has to endure pain and suffering inorder to come out on top in the end. It is the fact that Frank McCourt is able to look back on the events of his childhood and write about them with a mixture of agony, laughter, and triumph the speaks volumes for the character of the man that is Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a phenomenal story of life in Ireland...all the struggles and hardships and Frank still managed to come out strong.

Angel on the 7th step is an enduring image. Having been in areas, years ago, similar to McCourt's Limerick, I found the grimness and perserverence very believable. His stories caused me to share some childhood reminiscenses of my own(however not so dour) with my children.

It makes us all realise that most of our day-to-day problems are nothing compared to what Frank McCourt went though as a child. That he survived his childhood and succeeded in life is nothing short of a miracle. Having been brought up Catholic, I loved that aspect of the book. I also love the lyrical and imaginative ways of the Irish, ie: to get rid of the fleas in his bed, young Frank is told to turn the mattress &quot;upsoide down&quot; and that will confuse the little beggars!!!

Anglea's Ashes offers a necessary dose of the reality of Ireland and an explanation for why our Irish predecessors left what we think is &quot;heaven on earth&quot; to came to America. As the old-timers say in Butte, Montana, one of the most Irish cities in America, &quot;Take me home to the green hills of Ireland, but when I die, bury me in Butte.&quot; All Irish people must read this book if simply to witness the strength of an Irish family.

I had a difficult time putting it down. It's not action packed or full of excitement, yet there's something about the way it's written that makes it hard to stop reading. It follows the life of an Irish family and thier bouts with daily problems. It is an interesting view of the life of Frank McCourt from childhood into adulthood. I especialy enjoyed the informal way in whch it was written, using a child-like manner of speach without quotation marks. This seemed to illustrate the innocence of the characters themselves.

He points out more than once in the book that redemption, hope, and salvation appear in the same places as the horror and cruelty. We have Father Gregory, the Franciscan priest who hears the unconfessable sins; Seamus, who was kind and perceptive beyond his station in the typhoid ward; O'Halloran the headmaster who extended respect as well as expectations to young Frank's lively mind; and most of all there was Malachy, Frank McCourt's father. Excluded by his &quot;odd manner&quot; and northern origins from the community that might have embraced him, drunken and selfish and irresponsible as he was, he also shines out from the book in two of his three forms -- a very Celtic image. He filled young Frank with stories and the love of a well-told-tale, with Irish history and world affairs, with dreams and goals. &quot;When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning, you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.&quot; It would have been easy for the author to make this book a diatribe of resentment against one or both of his parents for the life he lived as a child.

And while you're there, you'll be reliving FrankMcCourt's childhood in the Ireland of the 1930's and 40's.It's an almost stream of consciousness style of thought,but then again, clear and concise and explicit. Mr. McCourt manages towrite poetry as prose,while he recounts his childhood of nearstarvation in impoverished slums.The dialog flows with the beautiful rhythms that only the Irishcould ever make out of English. And while you drink a cup oftea made of used tea leaves, swing on the chains by the RiverShannon, soaking wet and wait hungry with him for Pa to bringback the pay which he never does, you'll find yourself there,back in time, living it with all the empathy you've got.Reading this book, it's childhood again, no matter where youlived it, or how.

Maybe it's all the hype that puts me off. Nothing can be that good, I think. But, Angela's Ashes is. This is a book that truly lives up to all the media hype (and the Pulitzer Prize) lavished upon it and, surprisingly, deserves even more.Angela's Ashes tells the story of one of the world's most dysfunctional families through the eyes of a child. This is a family crippled by alcoholism, poverty, misery, illness and just about every other sort of deprivation one could possibly imagine. Yet, its characters remain heroic, resilient and even humorous. In the second paragraph, the author recalls, &quot;When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood; the happy childhood is hardly worth your while.&quot; An unnerving but wonderful beginning; I have no doubt that these very lines will be remembered verbatim for many, many years to come.The author, Frank McCourt, is the oldest son in this collapsed, poverty-stricken family. His childhood, the one from which he managed to extract so very much, is a childhood where nightmares disguise themselves as reality and walk about in broad daylight.Angela's Ashes begins a month after Black Tuesday, the beginning of the Great Depression, in Brooklyn, New York. Angela Sheehan, newly-arrived from Ireland is taken with Malachy McCourt at a neighborhood party. Malachy is a man possessed of a &quot;hangdog&quot; look, having just spent the three previous months in jail, but Angela, unfortunately, is attracted to this &quot;hangdog&quot; look and she and Malachy experience what the author calls a &quot;knee-trembler.&quot; Predictably, a child is conceived; a hasty marriage follows, then alcohol, drunkenness, debt, destitution and, also predictably, more children.In fact, after just four years of marriage, the McCourt's have five children. Five children who are victims of infection, disease, malnutrition, parental neglect and abuse. Angela's relatives do the only thing they can to help; they send money for the McCourt family to return to Ireland.The year 1934 finds the McCourt's back in Limerick, Ireland and the memoir then covers the years up until 1948. Malachy McCourt does find work in Ireland, in fact, he finds many jobs as he never seems to be able to hold onto any one of them for more than three weeks at a stretch. His alcoholism, even by tolerant Irish standards at the time, is &quot;beyond the beyonds,&quot; and he creates havoc for his family, leaving death and destruction in his wake.At the age of ten, the author is hospitalized with typhoid fever for more than three months. Something wonderful does happen during this hospitalization, however. The young Frank McCourt meets the fourteen year old Patricia Madigan, a girl who is dying of diphtheria. It is Patricia who introduces Frank to both poetry and Shakespeare, subjects that will become lifelong loves. Frank tells Patricia that Shakespeare's words are like having jewels in your mouth. Some of those jewels must have been lavished on Angela's Ashes because this book, and especially this section of the book, contains some of the most elegant and eloquent, passages ever written, passages that encompass a cadence and prose of which Shakespeare would have been proud. In fact, the book^s most touching scenes all occur outside the family setting: in the hospital, at school, during moments of tender young love.There can be do doubt that Malachy McCourt suffered from a surfeit of both Irish pride and Irish whiskey, a deadly combination when taken to extremes and take them to extremes he did. Malachy intimidated both his wife and his children with demands for &quot;dignity and respect.&quot; He was a man who drank his paycheck before he ever got home, who then indulged in melancholy Irish ballads and stumbled into his children's bedroom to force them to swear they would &quot;die for Ireland.&quot; He isn't really hateable, though, as he seems to be a man who could simply never make the connection between his horrible behavior and the misery he inflicted upon his family. We want nothing more than to sit him down in a chair, sober, and make him repeat the Gaelic proverb: Is milis da ol e ach is searbl da ioc e (It is sweet to drink but bitter to pay for) until he finally learns to live by its dictates.Of course, Malachy McCourt never learned to live by this proverb nor any other; his severe alcoholism was made even worse by his inability to see the world in anything but black and white. His lifelong hatred for the English, whom he viewed as his eternal foe, reaches back some 800 years; he never tires of delivering final judgments or pontifications; his follies are grandiose but his deeds are spare and wanting. Only when sober and with his children (not surprisingly, these times are few) is he able to transcend the demons in his own soul and become a genuine Irish storyteller and spinner of tall and fabulous tales that would cause even Scheherazade embarrassment.The author likens his father to the Holy Trinity; Malachy is definitely not divine, but he does have three separate and distinct identities: the man who quietly reads the newspaper in the morning; the man who tell fabulous stories and legends at night; and the man who carries about him the indelible smell of whiskey. Sigmund Freud must have had Malachy McCourt in mind when he said that the Irish were the only people who could not be helped with psychoanalysis.While Angela's Ashes is a first-rate memoir (one of the best ever written, as far as I'm concerned), it is also an astonishingly detailed portrayal of the Irish poor in the 1930s and 1940s. McCourt beautifully and deftly ties the happenings of his own family into the happenings of his neighborhood and the happenings of the entire Irish race. The language employed in Angela's Ashes is evocative and brings forth strong and lasting images. The tone, however, remains conversational and easy-to-read. This is a forthright book that tells an unvarnished tale that is captivating, harrowing and humorous. While Angela's Ashes is a memoir, it reads more like an extremely well-crafted novel of the highest order, bringing forth genuine laughter and tears. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Here's a book which, if it wasn't claimed to be a memoir, would be universally put down as a collection of all the usual trite stereotypes of Irish people and Irish-Americans -- the drunken, maudlin father who spouts off at the drop of a hat about the IRA, the long-suffering mother with multiple children who beats her breast at her husband's drinking, the religious and overbearing aunts, etc. etc. Then there is a supporting cast of stereotypical Jewish mothers, and Italian grocers, and, well you get the picture.The author shows a wee a bit of humor (which is why 2 stars rather than one), but spends most of his time wallowing in self-pity. The writing is an example of mawkish excess. No memorable images to speak of -- Irish men get drunk at funerals, women act catty toward each other, bureaucrats show indifference.You will read this book, and then not remember a thing about it a week later."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a great story of Frank McCourt's childhood in Ireland. The experiences and anecdotes that he tells the reader are horrific, hillarious and every degree in between those extremes. However, the way that McCourt recounts his story is done in a way that was tiring to me as a reader. The writing style is so bland. It has no color, no excitement and no way of holding my attention for very long. I had to take this book in very small doses. The writing in the first 15 or so pages is the only part of the book in which the reader is reading the writing of a mature adult. The rest is told through the eyes of an innocent child. Granted, this does have some possitive effects on the book, particularly when McCourt's parents withold the facts of life from their children. However, because of this writing style everything is a euphemism. Not sex, but knee-trembler. Not masturbating, but \\"going at yourself.\\" This makes for a tiring read, not an enjoyable one. For me, any books' enjoyment relies greatly on the writing style and the manner in which the author tells the story, not the story itself. That's why this book was just a little too bland for my tastes. A slow read, not because it was a hard read, but because I would grow weary after about twenty pages. If you really want to consider reading this book, take a passage out of the middle of the book and read at it for a while. If the writing style seems too childish, you won't enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If there ever was a book that caused you an emotional dilemma where you don't know if you should cry for the pain and suffering Frank McCourt and his brothers and mother experienced or if you should be happy that they survived it and are now better from it. Nonetheless, this is an excellent book. Frank McCourt has a very distinct style of writing that's sure to grab your interests and never let go.Frank McCourt never had it easy. First off he was an illegitimate child and it's really heartbreaking when he finds this out and that he was condemned from birth according to the Catholic faith. The fact that he looked and acted like his father who was from the North and not as respected, didn't help him in any way either. He witnessed first hand his father's careless behavior and when he got his first job he remembered how his father was and vowed not to be like that, he even witnessed the death of his only sister, twin brothers and another one of his brothers who was just a baby. While just a young teen he was the sole bread winner and went on to work in America remembering his mother and brothers back home who he had to support.Frank McCourt is in my eyes a hero and anyone reading this book will no sooner agree."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an autobiography that made me want to write my own. It's so wonderfully written until I cried and laughed at the same time. He's like singing his sadness.

The memoir of his oppressed childhood demonstrated that life should not be taken for granted, the negligible things deserve appreciation. The story was vividly written making the reader able to emotionally feel the experiences of his misfortunate childhood. Born in Brooklyn he was the eldest of seven children, though only four reached the age of three. As the family moves from New York to Ireland in hopes of a more prosperous future the situations continually deteriorate. Living off the dole with random employment the family has just enough to barely stay alive. Poverty drives Angela to accept charity from the Saint Vincent De Paul Society while Malachy's addictive drinking habit nearly destroys the McCourt's. Frank related illnesses that occurred on his first communion and confirmation as bad omens and he hated carrying the sins of life upon his shoulders. This brought him to the assumption that the worse scenario of life was being brought up as an Irish Catholic boy. In Conclusion, Angela's Ashes was a realistic recollection of what life in Ireland was like for the poverty stricken population in the 1940's. It was a well written book yet very depressing to read how anyone could have survived under these conditions."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes appeals to people of all ages, an aspect which I think has greatly affected its popularity. When the story begins, Frankie McCourt is a young Irish-American boy traveling with his family back to Ireland from New York City. He tells his tale of hunger in poverty stricken Limerick, Ireland where fleas are always more plentiful than food, of never having shoes or winter coats because his father would drink away any scarce money they could manage and of his pain in dealing with the constant loss of siblings. However, though the tale is laiden with depressing events, a happy tone comes through at times and you see that no matter how poor or sick the family becomes, the family is still as strong and loving as ever. You hear Frankie mature in his storytelling as the memories go on and as his voice is as strong and clear as any. This is a major element to the book because it gives it a true life and character. At the start of the story Frank is a very young child and you can tell it by how he uses language in the book. His words are smaller and more simple and many times when talking to adults he will say that he \\"doesn't understand what they meant\\" by something or guesses at what they mean and comes off very juvenile. For instance the way he took his father seriously when he said that there was an angel on the seventh step of their home. As the book then progresses you see Frank's words become more complex, ideas more mature and his understanding of why things happen become more apparent. Also he seems to understand the situation his family is in, namely their impoverishment. This was something that early on in the book he is completely oblivious to.I enjoyed this book and I think that everyone should at least give it a try. It really made me realize how lucky I am to have a house with a roof, a fridge full of food and clothes that haven't been patched up with tire scraps. I think that after reading this I have a better appreciation for all I have and the family that will always be there to support me.-NGonwa"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is an astounding novel written by Frank McCourt who writes about the arduous times he goes through as he relives his childhood. Taking place in the 1940s, the reader is aware of the hardships bestowed upon the unfortunate. When Frank was only 4, he moved from America because of their poverty stricken state, to Ireland, the country of his forefather. At his very young age, McCourt recalls his father drinking up all their money to where their mother who has kept her pride turns to begging, just to keep bread on their table. Being the oldest child, Frank is treated like an adult and watches over his siblings and is strong for his mother who mourns over the death of her babies. Frank McCourt writes his novel in his Ireland voice using terms such as \\" fiddler's fart\\" that shows his colloquial diction acquired from the streets of Limerick, and \\"tis'\\" which demonstrates his formality. As he grows up living his life with endless hunger and poor health, he is determined to move back to America where he can get a job and support his family. He is aware that his father never brought home the promised wages, and he feels it is his duty as the oldest, to be a man and care for his family by bringing in the wages. This story made me laugh as Frank learned how to deal with situations as he grows up and cry as I felt pity for him when he feels deserted in life and doesn't have a scrap of food to come home to.

Frank McCourty's writing style is addictive and poignant; through Frankie's eyes, readers can understand and sympathize on a whole other level than the little boy who accepts the poverty and everything along with it but dreams of something better.My only complaint about Angela's Ashes is that it goes on a little too long. And pretty soon there is a big jump from the years that were developed and slow to all of a sudden Frankie being grown, and the writing style is still the same.

At times it was slightly confusing, at others it was annoying.

However, the unbelievable suffering and emotionally excruciating pain he went through never stopped him from making himself a better man. He chose the high road in life and filled his mind with knowledge and wonder, always desiring to learn more. He has taught a powerful lesson in this book, and that is no matter where you come from, no matter what circumstances shaped your life early on, you can still achieve your dreams and heart's desires...you just simply must never give up."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I don't suppose it really needs *another* review, but I do want to give this book my five stars!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a book of tragedy, humour and will power.

Depressing that the rich and religous could treat them so badly, as if it were their fault to live that way. Inspiring that there was still some happiness, joy and motivation in spite of it all. That the children chose to live in horrid poverty rather than with the mean and abusive relatives says something about the human spirit.

I just hope the movie will be as good as the book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is such a wonderful, wonderful book, the kind of book that makes me cry if I think about it (not just because it's sad but because it affected me so much), the kind of book that makes me want to go to Ireland - meet the writer - do something about how some people live.

He describes the characters in the book briefly, because their dialogues, moreso than their appearances, say a lot about their personalities. I learned about what life was like for the middle-lower class people of Ireland, about their struggles, ways of adapting, and beliefs. This book truly is a gem. I'd like to thank Frank for sharing his adventures."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourt's style of writing is unique; it's not traditional, but honest.

Although this book is meant to have you crying, there are many times when you can't help but laugh. He writes in just the way he would speak. You hear the voice of a child when he writes. This is my favorite book of all time and it helped me learn a little about my heritage."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourt wrote a wonderful book about a very sad subject. His biography of his younger life shows how hard he had to try to obtain the life most of us were given and take for granted. The character development is spectacular. The story is sad, but is also triumphant as McCourt shows the loss of family members, the loss if his respect for other family members, and his struggle to save what little money he can for his journey back to America while trying to support his entire family on a meager income.The story reads slow at times, but will retain a hold on your attention. I was shocked at how distant the writer made himself sound from the emotions he must have felt growing up. I thought that there may have been an attempt to leave emotion out of the story, and that may have hurt my opinion of the novel a little but all in all, in my opinion it still remains a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book!

His troubled world is full of death, disease, and starvation which is further complicated by his father's drinking problem and the depression of his mother. Frank is forced to become an adult at an early age taking on the responsibility of supporting his family while his father is in England squandering away his earnings. Through all his hardships Frank learns to see life in a new light and dreams of the place where he can leave all his troubles behind and start a new life.Frank McCourt's tale leaps off its pages creating a vivid picture of his early childhood.

I have included Angela's Ashes on a reading list for the genealogical course I teach and I have requested our small college library to add the book to our holdings. I have purchased many copies to give away and I have found that all those whom I have talked into reading this fine memoir have also found it to be one of the best books they have read. Many have purchased their own book to keep. I am hoping and waiting for a sequel and a movie!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I avoided and dreaded reading this book, because my own life growing up in Ireland in the '40's and '50's were only five notches above this situation. Imagine a country rampant with tuberculosis, few job opportunities, no birth control, no social service agencies, no therapists to help parents cope with the depression over the death of a child, no understanding of alcoholism, no children of alcoholics support groups, no health care to speak of, no health department, little or no food, no clothes, no heat, no Needies Fun or Toy Drive at Christmas, and a skewed education system. Imagine having a separate school, the Leamy's School for poor children, the Christian Brothers for better off children, and the Jesuits for the well-to-do? After finishing the book, and loving every chapter, I was not depressed at all. It is a great book; a memorable story of trials, tribulations and triumph for some members of a family forced to live in subhuman conditions.When the onion is peeled back on this story, one finds a close-knit family. There is little or no evidence of physical or sexual abuse inside the family. Malachy, the father, was a reader, a good writer and storyteller. During those priceless mornings at the fire, and when he was able to be sober, he sowed these seeds of interest in his children, resulting in Frank's thirst for knowledge, Shakespeare, and writing which took him all the way to a Pulitzer prize. If Malachie were an executive in the US today, his alcoholism problem would be accepted and treated while he kept his job, provided he had the right health care insurance, of course.Frank, was the entrepreneur in the family making money by deliverng coal, selling papers, reading to the visually impaired, writing threatening letters for the &quot;collection&quot; agency, and delivering telegrams. His generosity to his family and his kindness to the old and infirm to which he delivered telegrams tells us he never became hard and indifferent in spite of his own daily hardships. I'd say his biggest legacy will be in what he passed on to his students all the years he was a teacher in the Stuyvescant High School. He could slip into the shoes of his students and truly understand their lives. They would feel and know that Mr. McCourt was on the same page with them.This book would be very beneficial as required reading for social workers, teachers, doctors, nurses, clergy, or anyone working with the poor, disenfranchised, refugees or immigrants. It would help them to look beyond what they see standing before them; and see the person, the family, the lives being lived. Poverty exists in every country today, including the USA. These same stories can be heard today in every country where people are out of work, where there is child labor, where there is child abuse, alcohol and other drug problems, and in cities, town and villages that have Neediest Funds and Toy Drives at Christmas. Didn't someone say &quot;The Poor Will Always Be With Us?&quot;I'd also recommend a brief overview of the History of Ireland for people reviewing this book so they could have an inkling about the social, economic and political conditions in Ireland at that time.For people who appreciated this book, another great book will be coming out in the USA next year. It is entitled &quot;Are you Somebody,&quot; by Nuala O'Failoin, a young girl growing up in a Dublin family. Another masterpiece. Watch for it.- 30 -"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book is well constructed and crafted.

Although amused by some of the antics of the main characters, I could not associate any with the characters my parents spoke so lovingly about in their years in poor Catholic familys in two different counties in Ireland. Unlike Mc Court's account, the characters my parents knew were hard working, even though sometimes hard drinking, and all had much more pride and were much more responsible about their families. I grew more and more suspicious about the so-called true accounts of life in a poor Irish family. I could hardly call this book literature. It seemed more like an attempt by Mc Court to create a best-seller rather than an attempt to truly interpret life in Ireland."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I listened to the tape of this book on a trip home in the car this summer. I knew I had to read the book. As I read, I can still hear Mr. McCourt's beautiful Irish brogue. I hate to put it down, but I don't want to read it too fast because I don't want it to end. I am telling all my friends about it and encouraging them to read it. As a Catholic educated in the 40s &amp; 50s, I can appreciate so much of what the author has to say about a Catholic education.

It is one of the most fulfilling literary experiences I have ever had."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Can the reader really believe this story is true in its entirety? Or is it overdrawn? I want to believe it is the latter. The sheer breadth and depth of injustice portrayed takes it toll on the reader, especially if you believe in God, the Church, and the basic goodness of man. Yet, we all know what great hunger and poverty exist in the world today and how we fail to care for each other. This lack of caring was, for me, the crux of the appalling sadness in McCourt's tale. Despite all this, I highly recommend the book for telling the bold, detailed, depressing and degrading story of an Irish family. It can be the source for personal meditation on our own lives."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read dozens of books about growing up in difficult circumstances. Most I've forgotten, a few linger and fewer still stay fresh. Manchild In The Promised Land, read decades ago, floats close to the surface.The books of this genre that succeed are those that capture the specifics of person and place within a larger historical context. Angela's Ashes, on first reading, appears to have done this fairly well. I know in an important way that the poor Irish Catholic boy of Limerick and the poor Black Protestant boy of Brooklyn had little in common except their misery and their joys.Is Angela's Ashes an important book?

It was very subtle in it's progress, so much so that you didn't realize it was happening.To know that such poverty and sadness was survived and overcome is the reason one MUST read this book. I would recommend buying the book if only to contribute to Mr. McCourt's pocketbook!!I only wish I knew what happened to Mam and the rest of the family.

Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From the beginning when McCourt mentions that there is nothing worst than the Irish childhood, you can't help but to be hooked by such bluntness. As the story continues you see the tragedy, horror and misery that no child should ever have to live in.Born in America to Irish immigrant parents, little Frankie lived in Brooklyn with his three brothers, baby sister, emotionally detached mother and the stereotypically drunk and chronically unemployed father. When tragedy strikes, the McCourts move back to Ireland (as Frank put it, the only Irish family going away from the statue of liberty) to restore their luck. Unfortunately the family encounter an even worst predicament than in America. Forced to be on welfare because the father cannot keep a job due to his drinking problem, the family suffers from constant deaths, starvations and illnesses.The catholic church plays a large overbearing role in Frank McCourt's life. Taught by abusive priest, the poor kids are brought up on contradictory messages that it is okay to be poor, yet shunned by the priest for being poor. The priest beat their students and tell them about sins, but I feel the worst sin of all is keeping the Irish community poor by blaming all their problems on the English persicution centuries before.By the end of this book you'd have read so much misery in Frank McCourt's life that you'd wonder why he just didn't commit suicide and end his suffering. A movie adaptation has been made of this book that is okay but it's best to read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" for the full sad story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. It's pure, honest, and will shake your own depressing life out of you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is an amazing autobiography about Frank McCourt and the tales of his life from childhood to his late adolescence when he returns to America. Frank McCourt was born in Brooklyn, New York, the 19th of August 1930, and lived there with his brothers, sister, and his parents. Frank grows up with the natural instinct of questioning everything he sees. Once a neighbor of his sees Frank and his brother Malachy in the playground on a cold day and says, \\"they don't have a glove between them,\\" and Frank writes, \\"that makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly.\\" Having to help his mother bathe his other siblings at a young age and his father always drinking the weekly wages was considered normal to him. Even as a child Frank understands some emotions of his mother. He knows that she tries to provide for him and his siblings with the little money Frank's father brings home. Frank struggles with deaths in the family, along with the on going poverty he is faced with day-to-day. He has one shirt for his every activity. His shoes have holes in them and uses what he can to repair his them, along with his clothing. He tries to be a good Catholic and prays because of his wrongdoings. Frank grows up with theses surroundings and to him it is home. He dreams of growing up so he can become the man of the family and take care of his mother and siblings. He wants a better life for them, so that they never have to be ashamed. His story is a tearjerker, bursting at every moment of the book. It makes one realize how blessed one is and how the lives of others sometimes aren't. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As horrible as much of the circumstances in McCourt's novel are, this book was incredible. This was one book that when I sat down to read it, I didn't do anything else until I had finished it.The words and descriptions within this novel are so amazing that you can see, hear, smell, and taste the situations that McCourt and his family were enduring.To go through the life that they had, and for Frank McCourt to make so much of himself, should be a lesson to everyone that feels as if life is unfair or treated them unkindly. Just because you come from poverty and unimaginable agonies, does not mean that you cannot proper and achieve your goals."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes, tells the heartbreaking tale of a young boy who lived an impoverished life in Limerick. Growing up he hoped to go to America, where he would lead a good life, with a steady job, and money to give to his family. Throughout his story, which is told in a first person play-by-play fashion, McCourt gains the reader's trust by describing the bad things he did, such as \\"grabbing a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and running down Myrtle Avenue\\" (32), along with the good. While it is hard for me to relate to his story, since I have never had to deal with the death of a sibling, or a father who drinks away all of his paycheck, the way he describes his emotions makes it possible for anyone to connect. Everything about his story is real: from the questions he has about life, to the amazement he expresses when he first reads Shakespeare, which to him is like \\"having jewels in [his] mouth\\" (196), to the concerns he has about his sins. He has to deal with the internal conflict about his father's behaviors; he loves his father when they drink tea together in the morning, but when he has to fetch his drunken father from the bars, he cannot deal with emotional pain it causes him and his mother.The story's chronological order gives the book a sense of organization, which makes some of the chaotic scenes easier to understand. Only 364 pages long, McCourt's memoir covers about nineteen years of his life. The scenes he chose seem to be about the most influential experiences or people in his life, and how they changed who he was as a person. Every character he describes is brought to life by an interesting detail that helps us understand what they meant to McCourt. Mikey Molloy, though McCourt often mocks him, is a sort of role model because of his knowledge of girls and his ability to do \\"anything his bloody well likes\\", such as eating \\"so many sweets and buns he threw up\\" (117). McCourt never has the ability to do this because of his lack of money, but looks up to Molloy and enjoys his company. The detailed description in this book made me feel as if I'd been to Ireland and back, as well as greatly inspiring me to never stop trying to achieve my goals."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is the best memoir I have read since Dave Eggers' &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,&quot; though the books are hardly comparable. In this book, Frank McCourt has delivered an entertaining and poignant work. Not having seen the movie or heard anything about the book, I had no idea what it was about until I began reading. I was quickly reeled in by McCourt's smooth narration and dialogue as he described his childhood, first in New York City, where he was born, and then back in Ireland, where his family moved when Frank was still young. McCourt does a wonderful job of describing his poverty-stricken upbringing without seeming to fish for sympathy. I really enjoyed the insight into the plight of the Irish poor in the mid-20th century. But it was the anecdotes and daily activities that McCourt writes about that kept me most entertained. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a wonderful book written about the author's childhood.

The slang expressions used by the characters are comical (i.e. &quot;arse&quot;). The book deals with serious issues like alcoholism and religion, and sometimes it's depressing. The way the author uses flashbacks sometimes can confuse you, especially as the family moves back and forth between America and Ireland. Overall, the best part of the book is the easy storytelling style and the family love, which exists despite their problems."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt was a memoir of his childhood and teenage years. it took place in Ireland, where he grew up in poverty with his mom dad and siblings. His father was an alcoholic, his mother couldn't work. He grew up with four brothers and one sister, many in which died. Overall the book was interesting to read because it gave you look at a different way of life, but we feel it was very redundant in this way of life. This book allows you to enter a totally different world. A world that makes you appreciate what you have, when you see how others appreciate what little they have. It was interesting to see the way Frank handle each situation that he faced when he was a child, and as a teenager. He had to be more mature than most children should be. But growing up the way he did, made him into a stronger person as an adult."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourt describes his life in Limerick, Ireland. WOW! What a book. His story is incredible and really demonstrates the true greatness of the human spirit. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A Burning Portrait: Angela's AshesRebecca GinsbergAngela's Ashes is the profound, heart-warming autobiography of Frank McCourt, who describes the harsh conditions of his impoverished childhood in both America and Ireland. His story begins in Brooklyn during the time of the Depression. His recent immigrant parents, Angela and Malachy, force Frank to take care of his younger siblings, and watch them die. He must be his mother's strength as she waits for her drunken husband to come home every night without food. Little Frank continues to have hope as he his family moves to his parent's homeland of Ireland. As his dreams of a rich life in his new home diminish due to his father's continual drunkenness, he is able to find optimism in his father's tales of Cuchulian, an ancient heroic Irishman who saved his country. Every week Angela is forced to beg to a council for food and clothing. Because of the overwhelming poverty in their small town Frank learns to live with shoes repaired with tires, a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and having to take two jobs to provide for his family.This book is recommended because of the genius of Frank McCourt's writing. He is able to capture the essence of a poor Irishman's life with humor, satire, and strife, while at the same time telling a touching story. As he writes of his everyday life the accents and culture of the Irish can be felt. McCourt also brings out diverse emotions, from laughing at his father who would make him wake up at all hours of the night to sing about his \\"Pride for Ireland\\" to crying as Malachy holds his dead daughter in his arms due to lack of medical attention. This book also opens one's eyes to the life of poverty, and the obstacles that must be overcome in order to survive. Before reading this account, I was never aware of the struggles that people must go through if they do not have money. The fact that Angela is forced to get down on her hands and knees and had to beg for money to go to the doctor is preposterous. I was educated and my eyes were opened to a whole new world as I read the horrific details of having to live in solely the upstairs of a house because of flooding on the first floor of the poorest lane in Limerick, Ireland.While this book is entertaining and heartfelt, it is also incredibly depressing. Learning about the grim realities of Frank McCourt's childhood is extremely difficult. I often would have to put the book down because of the intense sadness that came through the details of his life. Particularly memorable was Frank's description of the extra jobs he is forced to take in order to provide for him and his family. The fact that the McCourts are forced to plead for boots three sizes too big, and scrounge for the next meal is sickening and extremely sad. Reading about the hunger they were forced to go through because of a father's addiction really stings the heart.Angela's Ashes makes me realize how petty the obstacles are in my life, and how inspiring Frank McCourt is to have survived such a life, and then to go on and win a Pulitzer Prize. When anyone is feeling sorry for himself he should pick up this book, and realize how fortunate most of us really are. This memoir is a superb portrayal of the difficult life uneducated poor people lead in order to survive, while at the same time providing insight into the Irish culture, and creating a moving, earnest story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a worthwhile read.

It had been recommended to me several times so I decided to buy it and read it. I was bowled over by the tremendous poverty of the Irish people and many times near tears. Surprised by the discrimination within their own country against each other based upon wealth, religion or birthplace. There are great moments of humor within this book that at times are hard to laugh at but one has to see them through the eyes of the child. This is a book you love to hate or hate to love.

I won't rehash all the same compliments posted by others, but I must say one thing about this book: the biggest complaint people have about it is that McCourt's life was too poverty-stricken/ depressing/ repetitive /whatever. LOOK. This isn't some kitschy happy-ending novel. It's a PERSON'S TRUE LIFE STORY. If you wanted an exciting, glamorous life, go read some dumb Danielle Steel. McCourt spent 20 years living the life portrayed in this book. If you want to enjoy it for what it is, the mere hours you will spend entwined in his story will put a lump in your throat, but it is probably nothing compared to what McCourt went through in his own mind putting it on paper. The amazing thing is that it makes you laugh, and makes you think as well.

If I had to criticize, I would say that McCourt (as is the case with so many writers) lost the pace at the end of the book, or maybe did not know how to wrap up a story that had so much more to tell.

But when I began to realize that he never complained, never lashed back on those who were never there for him, I began to learn what an extra ordinary little boy (person) he really truly is. What a gift he has for telling a story of his childhood, the days of filth, the sickness, the deaths of his little siblings, and his father - an alcoholic. This book is about a real person living a life so unreal with so many hardships I truly believe its a miracle that he could survive. But the human heart does overcome such horrific hardships especially when the heart is small. I really thought the author deserved a Pulitzer!

I think it is hard for some people to experience the great poverty in this book, and their pain prevents them from experiencing the great love, humor and irony that is present in this book. I personally found that it read like poetry, but I was amazed that many did not see that. It seems that some people were almost angry to have to read about someone else's poverty. It made them uncomfortable, especially given their own level of riches. I found it funny that they spent much of the time criticizing Angela for not properly caring for her children... as if we all would be so much better at handling it.

The novel touches upon the religion, poverty and alcohol issues prevalent in the irish working class of Limerick. Also covers themes such as \\"pulling yourself up by the bootstraps\\". The character Angela frustrated me in her poor choices but then I think she never recovered from the tramatic tradgedies presented to her in the beginning of the novel. So maybe she become numb to her decisions later on in life."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a book like no other. Told from a child's point of view, it is very basic in text but very deep in meaning. The story is about an Irish family and the troubles they have to go through in order to survive. Angela, the narrator's mother, constantly has to deal with one hardship after another and remains helpless as she watches her family endure poverty and hunger. Her husband throughout the book wastes most of their family's few shillings on the local pubs just because he needs a drink to keep him sane.The book itself is captivating and moving, however, the tone of it may bore those who are \\"thrill-seekers\\". Since the book is told from Francis' point of view, most of the story is told without meaning and from a child's perspective. This book is one that you may want to put down, as it is depressing to read about any family that has to go through such a horrible life. What kept me reading is the fact that in disregard of all their troubles, they bring humor and life to every situation they have to encounter."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt, the author of the touching memoir, Angela's Ashes, commences his life in Brooklyn, New York in 1935. There, his mother, Angela becomes depressed after the death of the newly born, Margaret. The family returns to their homeland, Limerick, Ireland. This concept is bizarre because then, most people departed Ireland destined for a new life in America; however the McCourt's do the complete opposite. Many problems arise in Limerick, and their entire lives' change.In Ireland, they move into a two-floored apartment, which is in terrible living condition. During the winter, they have to live upstairs because the downstairs is flooded. The weather changes the mood for everyone and is a symbol of many different feelings including sadness and loneliness. It sets the tone for Frank's life. In the meantime, Angela is impregnated with more children, most of whom die in the end. The father, Malachy, is an alcoholic and spends all his money earned on himself rather than his family. He shares numerous stories and legends with Frank and is able to gain his love and respect. Malachy is from Northern Ireland and everyone in Limerick, including Angela's family, dislikes him for that reason. The McCourt family is very Catholic and after Frank is confirmed, a feeling of manhood is noticed. The brothers attend an all-boy's Catholic school in Ireland; however, because they are not as privileged as many of the other boys, a feeling of lowness is perceived. After Frank becomes sick, he acquires a love of Shakespeare and his ability of language is noticed by his school, along with his talent of storytelling. Frank's father heads off to England to make money for the family, which he is supposed to send back. However, the money never shows up, except for one time. After visiting his family once, Malachy never shows up again. Frank is able to develop more as a man because in a sense, he is the man of the house. While this is happening, the family's apartment is taken away from them and they have no choice, but to move in with Angela's cousin, Laman. Laman is a horrible, obnoxious man who Angela sleeps with. Frank becomes discouraged and angry with everything that is going on. Therefore, he gets a job as a messenger boy and becomes involved in a sexual relationship with a customer named Theresa Carmody. However, she dies of consumption, which leaves Frank depressed and heart-broken. The still thought of moving back to New York stays in Frank's mind throughout the entire memoir.McCourt uses the first person point of view in his gripping memoir. The novel is made up of English writing; however he includes much dialect of the Irish, English, and American. McCourt matches up his tone with the narrator's age perfectly and as the book unwinds, he becomes more serious and mature. His humor, modesty, and down-to-earth way of writing makes the reader feel alive in the story.Frank has to undergo many different deprived feelings. He has to suffer hunger, disregard, the depressing weather, his father's alcohol problem, disease, poverty, and many deaths. Many people look down at him because of his social standings. He receives hostility from the schoolmasters, priests, his family members and sometimes, himself. He wants to rise up from poverty more than anything.The authors writing style is unusual. An excerpt from the book that greatly displays the authors style takes place on the first page of chapter one, when McCourt describes his life, \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood...the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters...Above all- we were wet\\" (11).In a way, the author is misleading the reader because he is using humor, when really the story is not humorous, but only depressing, sad, and cheerless. McCourt has a strong adult opinion at this point in the book, but this is the only time, because after this, the book takes the opinion of a child and their perspective on life.Personally, realizing how deprived a child's life can be, I am able to realize how privileged I am. I am able to eat, have shelter, have a family, be clothed, and able to afford proper medicines. Frank McCourt has to endure many hardships; ultimately, his childhood is a hardship. However, he is able to make the best of his childhood and fulfill his upbringing dream. After reading this memoir, my perception has changed and broadened. It helped change my outlook on life, my anger, my sadness, and most of all, myself."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love Frank McCourt's writing style. He does not use quotations, just tells it like it is.....I could hardly put this one down! Excellent reading! Some parts were hilarious, and at other times very depressing, but the book is unforgettable. It will definitely leave you with more compassion for those who suffer through poverty and lack of hope."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book tells the story of the childhood of Frank McCourt. McCourt was just an ordinary boy, born in New York City of Irish immigrant parents. After a family tragedy, his parents returned to Ireland with the children. And that's how this little kid from New York City ended up growing up in a lane in an Irish slum, learning essential survival skills like how to keep his belly full and his feet dry. It seemed that everything that could go wrong did- -Frank's father was a drunk who couldn't bring home a paycheck for more than a few weeks running, the house where they lived was flooded each spring from the lane's common privy, and educational opportunities were quite limited for boys without funds. In such circumstances, the only way to survive is not to fret about tomorrow or what the neighbors might think, but to go ever forward with determined independence.As I listened to this story as read by the author, I kept hearing my own grandfather's voice. Yes, I'd heard all the stories about childhood deprivation and inner strength, about drunken fathers and run-down houses, but I'd never really listened when my grandfather told them. \\"He's exaggerating,\\" I thought, \\"Nobody ever lived like that.\\" But after hearing the details of Frank's childhood, I realize that my grandfather wasn't complaining about his childhood or looking for sympathy. He was just trying to paint a picture of the experiences that he lived through, which were so very different from my own. There was something about my grandfather's style of speaking that made him sound different from everyone else I knew. He was born in the US so he didn't have an Irish accent at all, but there was something peculiar about the rhythm of his speech and the style of relating to others that I never noticed in other people's voices. As McCourt narrates conversations between his parents and aunts and uncles, I can hear my grandfather jumping into the fray, a bit drunk, but not so drunk that he couldn't come out with a witty remark that still leaves people laughing when they remember it forty years later. I understand now- -my grandfather was simply Irish. This book is a wonderful telling of childhood with all its ups and downs, honesty and deceit, grief and joy. McCourt's writing draws the reader into Frank's world, where they can hear his father singing in the pub and smell the bread and onions frying on the stove."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It is so funny when I get to read page 305 : Little Frank was dreaming &quot;.... about virgin martyres in bathing suits in the News of World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile...&quot;.

This book's author is amazingly forgiving of neglectful parents who are emotionally crippled by a backward time and place where intense poverty is reinforced by a senseless class system.I was able to walk through the cold wet streets of Limmerick with Frank McCord and wonder at his tenacity and his families ability to keep going in an otherwise hopeless situation called their life.Where were my Irish Catholic ancestors in Frank Mc Cords stories? Were there white lace curtains in their windows or did they suffer the neglect, extreme poverty and starvation of the Mc Cords? So this is where the fierce often misplaced Irish pride comes from...I always wondered.Read this book. I started and stopped five pages in and then a month later started the book once again and could not put it down.Read it, it is a study of the persistence and survival of the human spirit. If Frank can survive so well and with such grace an! d wit after his childhood experiences, we all can survive...No complaining...just living through the good and bad..and learning from the experiences.Read this book...you won't feel sorry for yourself for a long time...puts our cushy American life in perspective."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"How can an author have you crying on one page and laughing on the next. Especially when everything written is true. This book is clearly, the best and most memorable book I have ever read. Readers who consider this a depressing read just don't get it. Find someone who blames their problems on a disfunctional childhood and give them this book. My admiration and respect go to Mr. McCourt and his brothers."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This memoir is very moving. I love biographies and I have to say that this is the best one I've read so far. The story being told through the voice of a young child really brings it to life! I think that this book should be read by everyone who has a spot in their heart for a child in need. It has challenged me to make the life of at least one child better so that they don't have to live like the McCourts did."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"You do not have to be an Irish Catholic Male to see the beauty of this book. The human spirit can be understood by everyone. Mr. McCourt tells his story so that it is every persons story. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is the best book I have ever read. I think that most who endure such poverty are either not well educated enough to write about it, or do not live to tell the story. The honesty is apparent without being sensational. I believe the book will eventually become required reading for school children. How refreshing to read something so honest and so well written."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's life story if filled with personal tragedy and desperation, yet there is still the hint of hope and determination as he moves from america to ireland and begins to really face life's hardships at a young age. The fact that this is a true story makes it even more amazing, knowing that he truly went through all of those struggles. I admire Frank for triumphing and sharing his story with the world."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For the 3 days i spent reading this heart-rending book, my heart was gripped by the family's rage and desperation. i was no longer the objective reader, the impassive outsider, i was drawn in to feel like one of the family-- mind-numbingly poor victims of alcoholism, fleas, hunger, and cold. Makes you wonder if hope is a fantasy or a drug in communities like Limerick where there are as many churches as pubs. i marvel at the human spirit's ability to survive despite all adversity."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read the book because my friends told me that it was a fantastic book. I was very disappointed. This is the reason why I am spending a few minutes typing this review. Warning: you have to be mentally and emotionally prepared to read this book. While I do agree with the view that some parts are well-written, it is just too dragging. It took me weeks to finish it.There are also inconsistencies in the way the writer talks about his surroundings from a child's point of view. In some parts of the book, Frank talks about Catholic practices that I thought were too esoteric for a kid. Manage your expectations well so you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Simply put, this book was written for Americans. It does not convey the hardships the Irish endured as they happened. The authors storytelling is repetitive babble, but the storyline was okay. However, if you want to read a good Irish book choose something written by an author who still lives and always has live in Ireland. There are many other great Irish literature works."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a great book to read. There's a little Frankie in everyone of us and the book takes us back to a time when we were younger and less fortunate. Well written in first person prespective I recommend it to anyone who would like to write a memior of their own."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was great. It was a very sad, deppresing tale with humor and hope keeping the family alive. At times you could feel tears forming in your eyes and at other times you would laugh aloud. It was a great book. I recomend this book for serious reading, not at night, it gave me bad dreams. A must-read book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. Mccourt was my English teacher in Stuyvesant High School, back in '82 or '83. I remember him talking about making a movie about this material, but he was told it wasn't &quot;Hollywood&quot; enough. I wonder if he Hollywooded it up."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There aren't enough words in the English language to describe the range of emotions I felt while reading this enchanting story. As for the reviewers who lambasted this work of art, I truly for sorry for you!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Read this book if your looking for some 'too deep'journey into the , sick and depressing childhood of a poverty stricken irish catholic boy and his family that are a disgrace to their religion and heritage. Frank M. overcame a lot and I will give him credit for that, but there is little inspiration in this book. Why so many found it inspiring and uplifting boggles my mind the only reason I finished this book was because I was sure there was something good in it, I wasted my time and money by searching for something that wasn't there. There are some things that 'should' be kept private, that people should not be proud of. Frank seems to write off every bad thing anyone does in this book as 'understandable' and thats a shame. Forgivness is good but condonement is an entirely different animal. Adultery, abuse, masturbation, fornication, alcholism and idleness are not an acceptible part of life, I feel that he promotes all of them to an extent. This book is a good example of an incredibly gifted writer that is able to use his talent to make anything 'seem' okay, and apparantly thousands of people have believed him. I have always enjoyed memoirs and novels pertaining to rising out of opresion, but this book was one of the worst I have ever read. I wish I had never read it, he could have made it much better and still gotten his point across without being so lewd and offensive."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There's a lot of morbid fascination going on here. Maudlin, depressing. Abject bleakness and no hope gets hard to take with little humour or light shinning in. A sob story. The reason why people read it is so they can say &quot;at least that's not me.&quot; That's what I thought."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Being a teenager, Angela's Ashes didn't automatically appeal to me. It sounded more like a book my mother would enjoy, especially because it's a \\"memoir\\"- kind of a scary word for a young person, because it seems to predict a drab, boring life story. The beginning of the book was difficult to get into, mostly because about a million characters are introduced in the first fifty pages.However, after I got into the story, it was really easy reading. It's a very well written book. The main characters have many dimensions and lots of personality, which is probably because the story is a true account of Frank McCourt's life. The story is about an extremely poor family, and their move to Ireland, where the father and mother were born and raised. The McCourts face many hardships, such as the death of children, and the fact that the dad, also named Frank McCourt, drinks away the little money they have in Irish pubs almost every night.I found I was most drawn to the father as a character. He is depicted as a wonderful dad who would do anything for his family. All of his sons look up to him a great deal, and they see only the good qualities in him. He turns right around and betrays their trust, though, by acting as though he doesn't have a family to support. Through a flurry of job loses, caused when he drinks too much on his pay days, and not being able to get up the next morning, he ruins any chances the family has to live normal lives. He is continuously forgiven for his mistakes.Although Angela's Ashes is at times very sad, it is also tremendously entertaining, and in many cases, funny. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There's no food to eat, and dad drinks, babies die left and right -- but worst of all is of course the rain!I'm pretty sure this story was exaggerated, it can't have been quite that bad. And I've heard Irish people say he really overdid the suffering. I find the best way to read this book is to take it with a grain of salt -- and sort of accept the comedic aspect of it all. People all seem clownish, especially his father who wants him to get up and die for Ireland every now and then -- more often than not, in the middle of the night."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the most impressive books I ever read. It tells the story of poverty without being sentimental or judgemental. Frank McCourt has such a way with words that you can see his life unfold before your eyes. Some of his stories and sentences are real jewels. Like the way he describes how an illetarate man brings him poems from the pub while Frankie is in hospital Or when the McCourtbrothers have to move to aunt Augies' house because of the illness of their mother. Their aunt tells them to grab some clothes and hurry up.The boys don't move as they don't have any other clothes than the onces they are wearing. I'm definitely going to buy McCourts next book 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is filled with realism and authenticity. The obvious focus of most readers is on the undeniable sadness, but the true inspriration lies in the message of hope that lies beneath that surface of despair. Frank McCourt is a survivor and a brilliant storyteller. I laughed. I cried. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The human race stands before us in McCourt's memoir of abject poverty, disease(and God bless 'im), dreams, desires and a sense of humor. It's grand and gorgeous: no preachiness, no gags, no sympathy vote, no pretentious shock value. It is a pure and true book, and its tone matches in perfect beat as absurdity rules little Frankie's life. Yes, folks, there are some extreme and horrible realities for the family in this book, but then again, this is planet earth. It is sorrowful and bleak. It is also a memorial, with McCourt's pint raised, to all those who believed, endured and/or lost. And if you don't believe it, you're an &quot;eejit&quot;."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Entertaining and lively...but the end was anti-climactic. The last 10% of the book felt out of place, didn't seem like the same writer and seems to be an ackward transition into a sequel...which I found out is in the works."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago when it first hit the bookstores and I have to say although it was a good read I found it repeated the contents a great deal and boring at times. It was not the type of book i just couldnt put down. It took me a while to get through because much of the story seemed the same chapter after chapter. I am interested in seeing what the film this fall will produce."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a third generation Irish descendant, and a Catholic to boot, I could not wait to read this book when I discovered it. However, Mr. McCourt's desriptions of the struggling Irish Father and Mother starting hitting too close too home and I became unsettled. Further, when I read about the poor conditions and the fate of the children I had to put this book down and get away for awhile... soon I will gather my courage and pick it back up... McCourts description of the characters are SO real and as I read I can hear the old stories I heard as a child (without a care in world about them and their plight) about my elders and how it was in those days. Strong book Mr. McCourt. I am gathering myself and will return to it soon."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved McCourt's book, it's amazing how he can remember everything in such great detail. He certainly has a gift for writing and I look forward to reading the sequel, his life in America. I'd like to talk about the book with anyone, email me if you want."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In the pits of desperation and hunger they were happy to be out playing in the rain. What a life that was simply written"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A very good read. A good yarn, often illuminating, and sometimes truly brilliant, (e.g., the part about his father reminding him of the holy trinity; the second paragraph of the book, which the jacket pretends is the opening paragraph . . .), but . . .This book was a bit hard to swallow. The voice is so affected sometimes, especially when he reaches for the little-boy heartstrings. A bit manipulative, a little too self-serving. And as it progresses, sometimes just a little dull. Voice is central, and this voice just didn't quite ring authentic. A nice read, but hardly a masterpiece.I'm a little distraught that nearly everyone on this list gave it one star or five. The one stars make it clear it's just not their cup of tea, but all those five stars--come on, where's the discrimination? There's lots to love about this book, but just because it provokes an emotional response many times, that doesn't necessarily make it great art. There are a lot of problems with this book, too."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The life of Frank McCourt is a story that can leave an effect that still resides days after you read it.

Think about your childhood. Can you remember 1/100th of the details that McCourt apparently has at the tip of his tongue -- or fingers?Give me a break. If this book is worthy of the Pulitzer Prize, we all are in trouble."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I wasted one of my Chrismas wishes on this book, which my husband paid full price hardback for! McCourt had a miserable life, no doubt about it, and it was amazing that he, his brothers and mother could still hold out hope every time Dad reappeared. For the life of me I cannot recall anything humorous in this book, despite the reviews of others citing this. It was the most depressing book I have ever read, and I several times had the misfortune to be reading during a meal (that'll teach me!) when I would come upon graphic descriptions of the chamber pot and its contents or the lavatory. The most moving parts of the story to me were the deaths of his siblings and when the horse went down. It did show how poverty is literally &quot;grinding&quot;, and I cringe to realize there may be similar situations going on today in this country. Bottom line: If you must read this book, get it from the library."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I waited until the book was in paperback to buy and only bought it then because I was going to Ireland and thought it might be interesting. Not much here. The family was poor, the father was a drunk and the mother had little inclination to better the situation. Once you have this figured out the book repeats it over and over. Its one redeeming feature: The narrative flows easily and one does not need to concentrate very hard to read it, so it doesn't take long to finish."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had to read this for my book club and it turns out I'm glad they were all checked out at the library and all I could get was the audio tape. That way, I listened to McCourt drone and whine while I sat in traffic and I didn't have to waste valuable time reading it. I'm not Irish, but I was raised Catholic and he used jokes and bromides most of us had heard by the time we were ten. As a society, we deplore poverty, alcoholism, wife and child abuse, yet what voyeurs we become when some opportunist writes about any of the above! McCourt should be applauded for so adeptly using the American reading market to make money off his misery, but as a writer, he offers no more wisdom, insight or inspiration than Joan Crawford, Roseanne Barr or any other come-out-of-the-closet-dysfunctional-family-member who ever wrote a book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really must be missing something.

He insisted I listen as well. I'd heard all the ecstatic reviews and was planning to be in the car for several hours, so I agreed. What a mistake. Not only do I find it incredible that someone can &quot;remember&quot; so much minutae from early childhood, but I kept waiting for the story to develop along the lines of actual literature. I suppose that in a memoir you can't expect to follow every guideline to plot and character development. But if you can't follow any of them, is it really worth publishing? Essentially, it read like this: &quot;We were poor and dad drank. Then something bad happened to me. Then we were still poor and dad drank more. Another bad thing happened to me. We were still poor, and dad was still drinking. And more bad things happened. Then I did bad things too. The end.&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is without any redeeming value that I can find.

I used to wonder why this was so. Then I realised it was because of people like Frank McCourt. Never mind what McCourt writes. This book has nothing to do with Ireland. If all you Americans would read the GOOD Irish writers - Patrick McCabe, John McGahern, Frank McGuinness, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, and the cultural analyses of Declan Kiberd (who, along with McGuinness, lectures at my college, University College Dublin) - you might know what the world is about. It all stems from the complete inability of Americans everywhere to think about anything except themselves. Think about the rest of us - who are forced to live and breathe American culture from the day we're born. Now who's pondering?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read Angela's Ashes late (December 1998) after it had been on the best seller list for ions. And I read it as a treat to myself while on vacation. I have to say I am a reading junkie and generally like writings that have been given outstanding awards rather than books that are popular in the general public. But this book I really did not like. I grew up poor, though certainly not to the extent of Mr. McCourt, and I'm sure that influences my opinion, but this book just made me angry. I was angry at the mother, I was angry at the father, and more than anything I was angry at the catholic church. Any church that can see its members starving and tell them to reproduce infuriates me. And his mother never did anything I considered good for her children except prostitute herself for their lodgings once. Mr McCourt must have been in therapy for years not to be riddled with anger and to be able to find anything humorous and good about his childhood. But he certainly did give his readers enough information to hate his parents. Maybe this book is his way of healing and getting even. The book is written with talent, I was just so angry I couldn't enjoy it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! This is one of the most depressing, filthy, repetitive, boring books ever to be published. The people are well aware of their situation of being in poverty yet do nothing to try to better themseves.

I listened to the audio edition on a road trip I took alone. However, the immoral ending astounded me. People may say \\"He tells it like it is,\\" but I find the things that the author chooses to emphasize particularly demeaning. To call this book \\"Angela's Ashes\\" is an insult to his mother.Perhaps someone can clarify for me, but I did not quite understand why the author chose to end this beautiful and poignant story with a jarring and explicit sexual encounter with a married woman, in which he loses any semblance of the penitant attitude he displayed back in Ireland. What is he trying to say about himself? What is he trying to say about America?This book is not appropriate for all ages, as some reviews attest. the movie was rated R for a reason."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a yawner!

There is no shame in being ignorant or poor, but it is no great honor either!Mr. McCourt trivializes his dysfunctional childhood, buffering it with satire in what one might say is nothing less than adolescent giddiness. I don't doubt Mr. McCourt's recall prowess. What I question is his motivation for writing this book. For the time it was published, its genre was quite fashionable.With regard to his writing technique, I found his turn of phrase trickery - repetitive and gnawing.I trust Mr. McCourt wrote this book as he saw it, however, his subjective, defensive - albeit descriptive - representation is simply nothing more or less than pathetic catharsis.If one wants literature, read &quot;The Hours, by Michael Cunningham&quot; and see what award-winning writing should be about!The only thing I possibly have gained from purchasing this book is that my first edition may be of value someday. In this way, Mr. McCourt and I have had a successful venture... but it's not all about money. Now, is it...?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My parents are first generation immigrants from Greece and lived a life very similar to, if not worse than, Frank McCourt's. Therefore, I am very accustomed to hearing stories of poverty, misery and starvation. I do, however, also hear stories about a simple, carefree and down-to-earth lifestyle that I can never even imagine having been born and raised in New York. My point is that noone's life is 100% miserable and McCourt's book is lacking and incomplete in this way. The bottom line is that although McCourt's life was a rather miserable one, his story is anything but unique. What sets McCourt apart from anyone else who was raised in similar conditions is the fact that he decided to write a book about it. His writing style is better than adequate, although slow at times. And, I must admit, it is rather impossible for a man his age to have such a flawless memory of his youth. Basically, I don't think McCourt meant to write a history book or a guide on Ireland and the Irish and therefore his writing should not be judged in this way. People seem to forget that THIS IS A MEMOIR. Therefore, it is subjective and it is the world as seen through the eyes of the writer. Admittedly, this is not Pulitzer Prize-worthy literature. But then again, what is nowadays? Simply put, this is a nice book to try. If you like it, finish it.

I tend to agree with a reviewer from Calif on Mar 18, who questions this &quot;biographical&quot; work. I can't imagine anyone remembering in such vivid, thorough detail, his life from the 30's.The pages are filled with endless chatter! The beginning, middle, and ending had similar storytelling. You can't distinguish one from another, pages just run on and on. It is hard to know his age at times unless he points it out, like age 8 is really different from age 10. I forced myself, I repeat FORCED MYSELF to get through and gave up at the end chapters.It is difficult to visualize and distinquish one even from another due to the excessive &quot;dialogue&quot;. Literature? I doubt it! I asked five people who read it &quot;what is the story about.&quot; Not one can tell me the sequence of the book, what it means, or if there is any substance.

He reads it straight, just as it is written, with no theatrics. I laughed. I cried. And I could not believe such poverty existed anywhere. The story is through his eyes, as a little child, as an adolescent, and as a young adult. Through out all his pain, he always found a way to hope.

Throughout the course of the book, one is immersed with cataclysm of profound emotional trauma and yet you can still relish the impact of such ordeal because in Frank McCourt's eyes the experience is uplifting as it is unnerving. Who else would have much authority to savor it as the one who actually experienced it? I hardly doubt the author's innate compassion for the poor and poverty-stricken for he himself has transcended the horrors of such. It is honestly this point why I love the book; the combination of two opposing points - life and death - the horrors and tragedy embraced with compassion, acceptance and altruism. The narrative is such a roller-coaster ride that you couldn't contain what emotion you are experiencing; whether to weep, laugh or &quot;finding yourself experiencing both at the same time&quot;. Frankl! y, the book's plot is not as complex as one might suggest for it's stunning reviews, but flow of words is enough to reconstruct the somber tales of Frank McCourt's life.

This is one of the few books I've ever read where I didn't have to skim a paragraph here or there because of irrelevent rhetoric. Every word was precious and interesting, and what gave it greater value is that it is a true story. I loved little Frank McCourt, his courage as a child, merely reporting the facts of his impoverished existence and never once complaining or judging, not even his hateful grandmother. I loved the way he so candidly shared his most private experiences in such a eloquent, simple manner which makes this book accessible to every one. I gave it to my mother, who never reads, and she couldn't put it down. I am going to insist that my fourteen-year-old son read it this summer, as should every child, to make him appreciate just how much he has. This book opened my eyes to pre-WWII Ireland, the prejudices and poverty, and the twisted role the Catholic Church played in peoples lives. It is so utterly human. I laughed and cried throughout. I read the end slowly, savoring every word, not wanting it to end. When I was finished I was moved to write Mr. McCourt a letter, urging him to write a sequel. I want to know how, once he returned to America, he got to be a school teacher, when he was never allowed a higher education in Ireland because of his social class and what happened to his father, who had not yet returned to Ireland from England. Was he able to rescue his mother and siblings from the poverty of Ireland? The only problem with this book is that it diminishes everything else you read once you finish it. A book this good is rare."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"To truly feel the suffering this book portrays, it must be listened to on audio cassette narrated by Frank McCourt himself. He brings every chapter to life as though he was living it all over again. Anyone born in the U.S. can never imagine such a childhood much less live through one. This book had 10 cassettes, but I didn't want it to end. I listened to them on the way to work, and again on the way home. I actually sat in my driveway for 30 minutes just to hear the end of a chapter.I was so hooked on this book that I didn't listen to any radio until the last tape was done."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The audio version was especially moving. His voice, the story, you were there! I drink tea everyday and I think of the little boy who loved the sweet tea and I know what he meant. I don't think the book could have done as much as the audio. I thirst for a sequel. I genuinely want to know what happened to the rest of the family. The book touched the feelings that might have been present in my Italian/Scotch/Irish backgound when they came through Ellis Island. The ending &quot;Tis&quot; just sent me over the edge and brought back the memories of Grandma and Grandpa Migliaccio talking about how great it is to be an American. Mr. McCourt, please finish your story. Thank you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this memoir by Frank McCourt. The remarkable account describes the ups and downs(mostly)of a &quot;miserable Irish Catholic childhood&quot;. McCourt brings us along on a heart-wrenching journey full of laughter and tears. I think his writing style makes the book even more extraordinary. He allows us to experience his childhood through the innocent eyes of young Frankie McCourt. McCourt informs us of his early years: &quot;...but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters...&quot; (11).McCourt revists the tragic deaths of his siblings and the poverty and sickness of their home in Limerick. His detailed descriptions provide a link for us to his past. The St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Leamy School, worn clothing, stories of Cuchulain, and the scarcity of food contribute to the unforgettable images of his life. I also enjoyed the book because of the range of emotions McCourt weaves through his memoir. Disappointment, heartache, pride, love, grief, shame, and sadness play a role in the book. The people in his memoir seem so vivid-the boys at Leamy School, Aunt Aggie, Malachy Sr., and others. As I read the book, I felt as if I knew them personally. I rated this book 9 because McCourt did not provide us with follow-up information. After reading his memoir, I would have liked to known about the current lives of the memorable people in his book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love to read but lately I have been struggling to find the time to do so. I decided to try some audio tapes so I could make better use of my time on the road. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was one of the first audio books that I bought. I grew up in an Irish, Catholic home and thought the story sounded interesting. I was not disappointed.For those of you who have read the book, I HIGHLY recommend the audio tapes. Frank McCourt himself reads to you and it is indeed a treat. The sounds of his voice and his accent bring the story to life. Tis a fine listen! WHAT IS IT, BOYS? Tis a fine Listen, Sir! I think I'll buy the book, too!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Beautiful and moving. Lingers in the mind after the story is done. A friend said they had trouble with McCourt's writing style and I told them to read it like you were reading music lyrics...because in a way it is a song or a collection of them. Very bittersweet. I won't retell the plot, you already know by now, doubtless.He paints a picture of life so bleak that it's hard to believe it's occuring in 20th Century Europe and not some Dickensian urban setting. I never in my life knew that an egg could be so highly valued until I read this memoir. It's good soul food for the eyes. Read it.I also might recommend Helias' The Horse of Pride if you're interested in the history and ethnography of fading European cultures."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is an autobiography of a boy suffering from a poverty-stricken life. This little boy is Francis, born in America, but a descendent of the Irish. He had five other brothers and one sister but they all had died before the age of four, except for his three brothers Malchy, Michael, and Alphie. Their mother, Angela, tried to feed and warm her children, but times were harsh and it didn't help that the father, Malachy, rarely worked. When he did find work, he \\"drank his wages\\" and never brought home any money. Even when his children were starving.This story begins when Francis is only a small boy around the age of three. At the end, he is near twenty. His tales of life lessons and the pain and suffering of living in the slums of Ireland are presented wonderfully in this thought-provoking book. It makes the reader consider what it might have been like to live the way they were forced to."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is probably the most pivotal book I have read in my entire life. And I have read a lot of books. Frank writes so well that at parts in the memoir I almost felt that I was experiencing what he was. If you ever read a memoir, there is none better and more thought-provoking than this one. Get it! Read it! And let it change your life!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The non-fiction read of Angela's Ashes captured our attention with an infinite barrage of pure human emotions and experiences. Author Frank McCourt captures extensive details in his writing by illustrates the poignant severity of the poor Irish Catholic childhood in Limerick Ireland. The sentiment exhibited throughout the book by virtually all members of the McCourt family allows the reader to connect with \\"old\\" Ireland. The vivid imagery of the depression and stark hunger of Limerick is articulated so well that at several points during the book readers can actually identify with the family's humiliation. An Example of such an occasion is the Christmas Eve dinner. Due to sever poverty, the family is forced to beg for extra food. The only food that can be spared is a pig's head that the mother (Angela) cooks up, eyes and all. Frankie himself faces ultimate shame when, in carrying the pig's head home, it sheds its newspaper covering which draws mocking disgust from surrounding pedestrians in downtown Limerick. The general position of the family in society only worsens as the father flees shortly there after, the weekly doll of sixteen pence canceled with his desertion. Frankie's life is full of trials: from his father's love of alcohol to the boys' rubber tire soled shoes; from his first love Theresa to the first time he loses trust in his Mam, his life is full of a tremendous amount grief. Through out the book Frank McCourt is constantly overcoming overwhelming adversity that surely would have ruined a lesser man. Though we consider this book to be rather depressing in nature, it also shares with the reader a substantiated love of life."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a magnificent first-hand account of being Irish, Catholic and poor! With his wit and charm, McCourt brings life to a very gloom atmosphere of Limerick, where boys are forced to &quot;interfere&quot; with themselves when there's no oppotunity for a real &quot;excitement&quot;, but --thanks to confessions and St Francis of Asissi!-- they can be absolved in order not to go straight to hell; where fish and chips can also be &quot;licked&quot; up off newspapers; where a goat's head can make Christmas --indeed!-- a merry occasion.Growing up in a Catholic environment myself, I can empathize with McCourt: making up &quot;sins&quot; for Saturday confessions, burdened by guilt after &quot;interfering&quot; with myself, tormented by fear of dropping the Lord's &quot;body&quot; to the floor while receiving Communion. But unlike McCourt, I was lucky to be accepted as an altar boy -- a oportunity to taste the Lord's &quot;blood&quot; in sachristy!&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; gives an insight of how (not?) to be a Catholic, and a poor one at that!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I kind of hate writing these for fear that I will give away to much or to little of the story and ruin it for whoever is contemplating reading or purchasing this book.Angela's Ashes is a memoir of a young boy, Frank, growing in a poor family in Limerick, Ireland.I really enjoyed reading it, though parts of it had a habit of dragging in such a way that I had to put the book down for a while and allow my mind a break before I could get back into it.Many of the experiences throughout the story are ones you would find in any tale of growing up and discovery of ones self. The tales of extreme poverty and fear of death and diseases open up a new worlds that many of the readers have never faced, or haven't dealt with to such a full extent.That is why this book can a appeal to different age groups, from people who grew up during that time, to middle aged persons eager to do the trendy thing, or ready to learn more about extreme poverty. Or even to help them remember their own troubles and confusion while growing up. It also can appeal to the teenager, ready for adventure, or learning more about themselves, their bodies, their oddities, and needing someone with whom to relate.If you reading this book review in order to nudge your opinion to buy or read it in one direction or another, then you probably should stop reading here. I want to tell my absolute favorite part. I'm not sure why I love it so much, except for it holds the same writing style that I sometimes write in, and that connects me to the book at a personal level.I absolutely love that part where he has been held back due to the time he spent in the hospital and is required to write a composition. Something about how his composition is written, with such blatant truth and such a humorous tone, I just love it.&quot;It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place Because if He was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have learned about catechism and write compositions about Him.&quot;I think the reason I like this so much is because after the teacher and headmaster heard it, Frank got moved up to the correct class.All in all, this was an interesting read, and I would recommend it to most people. But I feel that, like with any book, some people may not see the true human feel it contains, and may only read the surface of it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In this book Frank McCourt opens the reader's eyes and heart to the struggle of a young boy and his family trying to get by during the depression. After the death of his only sister in America, Frankie and his family move back to Ireland. Unable to deal with watching his family waste away, Malachy, the father, continually drinks all the wages and any money he can gets his hands on. As the oldest, little Frankie is froced to deal with the knowledge of their poverty and shamefulness of their begging. Many times he is forced to take responsibility and care of his younger brothers when his father is out at the pub and his mother is in bed sick and mourning for her many loses.I have gained a new understanding of what it is to not have from this book. I read in horror as a realized the babies were living on sugar and water because milk was too expensive. I can't imagine having a childhood filled with such struggling and questioning as to wether there would be any clothes and any food at all the next day. As I read further I realized how brave and determined Frank was. Many times he could of given up hope, like his father, but he never stopped believing that things would get better.As well as being a account of the obstacles Frank McCourt faced as a child, Angela's Ashes is also a touching and somewhat humorous book. It catches the attention of the reader and installs a desire in their mind to read on through all the pain and hard times and through this boy's childhood journey in search of hope."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am 13.

The recollection of his childhood with added humor which only hindsight can provide is truly heartrending. No child in this world deserves to grow through this. But I have my own doubts whether all the content was real and not a fiction of his imagination. I did ask some Irish immigrants to the US and they were upset about the stereotyping of the hard nosed Irish Catholic in this book. In many parts, the book seemed to offer whatever you want to hear and not what actually transpired.I read a very similar book about poverty in India told with a distinct sense of humor - &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; by Rohington Mistry. If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes then you will definitely like this one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was of course, a miserable childhood.&quot;Frank McCourt expresses his life emotionally and physically through his novel, Angela's Ashes. Using his Irish dialect, he helps readers to experience his life full of poverty, death, sickness and simple pleasures.Resulting in the death of their precious baby girl, his family moved back to their homeland, Ireland. Their hope for a better life perished before their eyes. Malachy, the father, continued to &quot;drink away the wages&quot; at the local pubs with the money they rarely had. Angela, the mother continued to give birth to their children that they couldn't support. Over the next fifteen years and six brothers and sisters later, Frank found ways to make the worst times better. He worked at an early age after his father vanished to England, and even did the simple things like taking dance lessons to please his mother. Finally, by the age of nineteen, Frank had earned enough money to fulfill his dream of going back to America for a future full of opportunities.We feel that Frank is one of the most determinded characters that we read about. He was able to see beyond the poverty, hunger and necessities in order to make him and his family's dreams come true.Angela's Ashes represents many different types of emotions. Times of need brought tears to our eyes, while a few experiences and comments made us laugh at his humor. His variety of vocabulary was endless, and the writing style was very detailed. He did a wonderful job of drawing the reader into each environment, and almost allowing us to experience his feelings ourselves.A negative aspect of this book was the lack of quotations when a character spoke. Only a few quotes were used, and it confused us, the readers. It left us trying to figure out in our own minds if someone was either saying it, or thinking it. Also, the beginning of the novel seemed to be drawn out much more than necessary. McCourt gave us more information than we actually needed.All around, Angela's Ashes was a depressing story. It introduced us to a life during the Depression, from people without an American point of view. It represented the lives of many who suffered in this time of need and desperation, and how they overcame their problems in order to make their dreams come true."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was incredibly well-written in my opinion!

McCourt's descriptions of not onlyLimerick but also of Brooklyn were wonderful. While I don't usually like humor in my books, I loved McCourt's humorous writing style. No one tells a story like Frank McCourt. It's so from the heart. Now the fact that I'm part Irish, lived in Brooklyn and am Catholic probably added to my enjoyment of this book.

A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A suberb performance from a master story teller. Mr. McCourt tells his harrowing tale without a hint of bitterness, but much humour. My only mistake was in purchasing the abridged rather than the unabridged tapes. I soon found coming up with reasons why I needed the unabridged; the extra listening time was worth the added price."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I first bought this book,I had no idea what I was getting into, because I had not heard about it.I started reading because of great interest in knowing about people.I cannot but admire the author not only for his courage to be witty about a childhood spent in utter poverty but also to come out of it and become renowned as he has. From the place where I come people who are poor are supposed to gather sympathys from the more fortunate brethren whether that comes in the form of money or then pity is all welcome. I want to know how could one get so educated and write such a beautiful book as this one?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt touched me by his use of simple, straight forward use of vocabulary. In his writing, it was easy to tell that he wrote his true feelling while growing up, holding back nothing. When I read the book, it was like I was being told the story from a little, poor Irish boy, not an older man. McCourt's ability to do this created much more of an impact on the reader. It is amazing that he could remember such detail from his childhood. I started to feel like Frank McCourt, poor, hungry, and abused. At the same time I told myself never to complain about hunger or the need of clothes or shelter again. Not many books can do that for me, but this one did."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have just finished reading this book and could not put it down. From the time I first bought it, I grabbed every spare minute I could to get another page read. I always thought I had had a rather poverty-stricken upbringing (compared to people I was in school with) until reading about Frank McCourt's life. His book has made me realize there is a difference in growing up poor and growing up with absolutely nothing. And yet Frank sustained the courage to go on every day, always believing there had to be a way out of his plight in life. His love of the written word from an early age mirrors my own - it was always a wonderful way to escape one's surroundings. I will make this book a summer must-read for my four materialistic, take-it-all for granted, Nintendo-playing sons. It is the biggest eye-opener I have ever experienced."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Not many of us could survive the abject poverty and ignorance that Frank McCourt's autobiography reveals. This tale of his Irish, Catholic upbringing in the lanes of Limerick could be one of the most depressing books you'll ever read. However, McCourt's strong character and innate sense of survival come shining through with his ability to bring out the humor in the most desperate of situations. The Irish, Catholics have often had many misfortunes visited on them, but this book gives you a first person account of the truth as seen through the eyes of a child. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. It was really sad and funny at the same time.

I didn't have the courage to tell him how much I liked Angela's Ashes, so I will praise his wonderful book here.McCourt's portrayal of an Irish Catholic boyhood in the slums of Limerick is lovely without being precious, and heartrending without descending into melodrama. Scenes such as Angela singing a tune with her old sweetheart, or the McCourt's Christmas dinner (which is a bit like the Cratchits, only more Dickensian) are presented in a style which seems both rough and elegant, like the warp and weft of a thick fabric. The misery of the McCourt's poverty, the betrayal of Frank's alcoholic father, and the resigned nature of Frank's mother are rendered with poignance and simple grace, without descending into cliche.I hope that this book continues to sell well over the next few years.

Through its seventeen chapters, the author takes a reader from the most basic elements of C++ all the way to more advanced topics such as linked lists, function pointers, templates, and more.The book is laid out so that it is easy to \\"start where you need to\\": if you are a newcomer to C++, start in Chapter 1. If your skills are more advanced, scan through the chapters to find where your knowledge is lacking or your confidence in your skills in that area is weak. (However, even the more advanced programmer may wish to at least do the programming exercises at the end of each chapter, as they do provide an excellent review).One thing I found refreshing was Mr. Prata's style in writing. In a book this size on a topic of this nature, it would be easy for the material to be dry. Sadly, many programming books are exactly that and can make the study process tedious at best. However, Mr. Prata (Dr. Prata? Forgive me for using the incorrect title if he is a Ph.D.) approaches the topic with a refreshing humor that is lacking in books of this genre. Also, the end of chapter programming exercises are well thought out and very relevant to the material contained in the chapter.This book is by no means an exhaustive treatment of C++, particularly as pertains to such advanced topics as error and exception handling, STL classes, and templates, and the author says as much at the end of chapter 17. However, a book that WAS an exhaustive discourse on all that C++ offers would more closely resemble a set of encyclopedias.By all means, I would recommend C++ Primer Plus to ANYONE who programs in C++, would like to learn, or would like to learn more about this powerful language."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I started first with \\"C Primer Plus, 5th Edition\\" by the same author and was already convinced about the quality of the information presented by Stephen Prata.

Well written, a lot of very useful examples, a lot of humor, as usual.If you already have a background in C, this book will be easier to follow.However, some parts are more difficult to understand because of the complexity of C++. In my opinion, C++ is a complete different way of thinking, and not only because of the OOP.But do not panic, Stephen Prata is there and will present you complex functionnalities in a such way that you will get them rapidly !So, if you are looking for a quality book about C++, you have found it !"},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful book to get your feet wet with C++ programming.

I got nothing out of it and only got as far as writing half a program afterwards. I bought this book wanting to give it another try and was not dissapointed at all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a solid grasp of the language whether you have some or no programming experience. The author writes clearly and covers all the angles. There is a very short example on almost every page demonstrating the new concepts so you get a good idea of how to structure your code. Stephen Prata makes it look a lot easier than it is, but thats what the practice exercises are for at the end. The examples are so consistant (written with good structure) that it rubs off on you when you start writing your own code (which is the idea). I'm not in school, nor do I work with programmers so its vital to have clear, well written code to learn from. The practice exercises at the end of each chapter help you reinforce the material you've just learned so it sticks with you. The sequence of the material is laid out in a way that its easy to absorb and progress step by step.What I disliked the most about the book was that not all the practice exercices are answered in the downloadable document. It will list 2 or 3 out of 6 which I don't understand. I can work my way around almost any programming problem, but it can be sloppy and that can lead to bad habbits. Since hands-on is the best way of learning anything, I just don't understand why he didn't take the time to write out all the solutions so that after you solve it you can review where you made mistakes or how you can improve. This does not outweigh the good at all, I just thought it was odd. Also towards the end of the book, Chapters 15-17, you start seeing more and more typos. I'm surprised these simple mistakes didn't get ironed out in the editing (but again these do not draw away from the effectiveness of the book)If you want to learn C++, this is the book to get. The author not only goes over the technical syntax, but goes in depth about the general approach of Object Oriented Programming. C++ is a huge language and you cannot absorb it all from an online tutorial. With this book, you will not only learn how to write effective code, but you'll understand why its effective. I have a much better understanding of the OOP philosophy and thats extremely important because that can be applied to many other languages. And these philosophies are reiterrated again and again throughout the book to help you understand them. I also gained a better perspective on the differences between C and C++. If your like me, I don't want to just copy lines of code, I want to have a thorough understanding of the reasoning behind the code.If you are new to programming and want a solid foundation to start with (whether its C++ or another language your interested in) this is the book you should get."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This is a great and affordable introduction to C++. C++ is a large programming language which will take years to master, but the hardest part is getting started. Getting started can be particularly difficult if you are not trained in computer science or competent in another medium level programming language such as C or Fortran. There are two basic components to learn in C++. First you need to learn the syntax, then you can learn object-oriented design. One would think that learning the syntax would be easy. However, if you purchase a C++ book dated before 2003, it is highly unlikely that any of the sample code will compile. THERE ARE A LOT OF C++ BOOKS IN PRINT FOR PURCHASE AS \\"NEW\\" OR \\"CURRENT\\" BOOKS (IE NOT OLDER EDITIONS) WHICH WERE PRINTED BEFORE 2003. If you are a beginner, you do not want to purchase any of these books. Start here."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"As an educator, I have read dozens of books that do their best to teach C++, but this book stands alone as the best. It is written for the C++ beginner, makes no assumptions about prior programming experience, and offers a wide variety of review questions and programming projects at the end of each chapter.It is not a good reference book, but it does not pretend to be. It is a primer, aimed at getting newcomers to C++ on their feet and writing programs swiftly and expertly. If you are looking for a place to start, this is simply it. Look no further.This book was independently chosen as the official text book for the C++ Beginners website (www.cppbeginners.com), unaffiliated with the author or Amazon.com."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"It is probably the best C++ book if you are looking for a bible-thick, encyclopedic book. For that, it serves both as a reference book and as a very complete textbook.However, if you are looking for a quicker read on C++, but still with sufficient material that actually allows you to start writing fairly complex codes, Accelerated C++ by Koenig and Moo is a better option."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Why would I call \\"C++ Primer Plus\\" the best primer available? I have read the start of perhaps 50 programming books (closer to 100). All of them left me dazed and confused: \\"HUH???\\" After reading several pages, this is the first and only book that has given this complete non-programmer concrete insight into programming.The world is divided by those that program and those that do not. For the first time I have a certitude that I will cross that great divide, and create the game of my dreams on my terms, the way I want it to be. Need to learn programming? Look no further, you have arrived.In the unlikely event that I am unsuccessful in learning to program using this well written lucid book, I promise to report that here. I doubt you will hear back from me. The way of Winklevoss is behind me! I venture forward upon solid ground, I see the heights of the peak before me within reach!"},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This book patiently and thoroughly explains C++ to a degree that is refreshing.Anyone from a background in other programming languages should take the time and absorb Stephen Prata's insights. The rational and process for C++ is discussed without airs or attitude, but with respect for the goals behind the design features.The Author also does an excellent job of adding some light humour in just the right places in the book. This humour adds just the right amount of punctuation; allowing one to ponder the concepts just given.Readers will learn about how cout's streaming works and a host of other things in the mechanics of C++.If you buy this book I recommend you let go of your time a little bit and enjoy every page written, recognizing the care that went into the text.For school students, this might be the perfect summer-reading book to add new tools to your programming toolbox.For the layperson this book has some insights in a computer language that runs a lot of the world, well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"Mr. Prata displays a great sense of humor, in addition to a very excellent style of discourse.

Great examples, code has been flawless, and even brings humor to the table. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I'm using this large blue book to teach myself the language and so far I think it is a good resource. The author assumes that you have no prior knowledge of programming. It has lots of examples with good step by step documentation describing what the example program is doing. There are also tons of nerd-friendly jokes. The learning is a bit slow if you read straight through without skipping around, but that's because the author gives you details such as when to use a particular function as opposed to another, potential pitfalls you can encounter and the differing ways you can do the same task. In short, using this book will take you longer to learn the language than it would if you used a shorter book, but it will make you a more knowledgeable programmer."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"*important: before reading this book I had lots of experience with [...] and Basic.I bought this book almost two years ago. On my first run I read the thing up to Chapter 9, this only took me less than a month, for it is written in a very relaxed way. In that month I was on vacations, and I gave three to four hours for of my daily time to this book, which is not very much considering you have to work through examples and stuff. As I was reading it I was conscious that I was becoming in love with the text and explanations, and more importantly, I was loving C++ (well, more C up to that point). Once I entered college as a freshman I had to stop because it was way too demanding for me to seriously work on the book, but in my programming classes I was a complete master. This book is so detailed that even if we worked in C and not C++ (Introduction to Programming was the course) I was able to achieve an A+ without breaking a sweat. This particular course is known to be a serious slut in my college: almost 50% of the class has to retake it.As timed passed I kept coming back to reread some chapters that had valuable information and that proved to me how good a reference this books also is: the first time I read it, I thought that you HAD to read it from beginning to end, but jumping into chapters is very possible. I was also beginning to advance through the book although at a very slow pace. Until a year ago I was still on chapter 14. This time I took Object Oriented Programming course, and here too, I was top of the class, even If the course is given in the Java programming language. The concepts of OOP are so universal and Prata does such a nice job teaching about the public interface, containment, encapsulation, and other concepts, that even when exposed to a very different language, I was able to succeed.Two years later I decided that I had had too much and read the whole deal in two weeks. Yes, from chapter 1 to 17 and the appendices. Finally, after reading the \\"What now?\\" section at the end of chapter 17, I felt that it was right to write the review, but hadn't had the time. Now I do, and I think my weird experience with it gives me the right to recommend the book in two lights: as an amazing tutorial and reference. Yes, you'll probably have to work through other books (Effective C++ by Meyers, Algorithms in C++ by Sedgewick, STL by Josuttis, and finally The C++ Programming Language by Stroustrup) to be a good and efficient C++ programmer, but this is your best way to start.Some people say that after reading this you should read C++ Primer (no plus). Well, this was not the case for me. I have worked through all the books mentioned in the parenthesis above, and I never felt lost, never (Stroustrup's was read last I must add). I have read books on DirectX and 3D math (more specifically, Luna's and Dun y Parberry's), and on others topics too (that require some C++), and this book did me much justice.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I'v have some experience with C, C++, and C#(my favorite). I bought this book to build my knowlage of C++. I have learned alot from it. It can be read cover to cover and it makes a good reference also. Even though im mainly a C# programmer it helps to know C++. This book is pretty easy to read and the aurthor explains everything in plain english and has plenty of simple examples to complement what he is trying to teach you. Although I couldnt understand some things like explicit template specialization."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I have extensive knowledge of C, but wanted to start learning C++. Since I used Prata's C Primer Plus book to learn C (which is another excellent book from him), I figured what better book to get than to learn C++? I was correct, this is another great book.However, it does suffer from the same problem as his C Primer Plus book, packing way too much information into one chapter. A lot of the chapters could easily be broken up to make the material less overwhelming and easier to swallow. That being said, this book is thorough and will get you to at least an intermediate level with C++, given of course you put your end of the work as well ;)Overall, a great book to start learning C++, regardless of what your level of programming experience is. Clear and concise programming examples with full explanations make this book a winner."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I bought this book because I first learned how to program using 'The Waite Group's BASIC Programming Primer' when I was 13 and figured this would bring things full circle. Although by a different author, I hoped the strong legacy left by TWGBPP would compel this volume to find a similar style and purpose. To a high degree it did just that.In what may be both a word of caution to old hackers and encouragement to beginners, this book is very thorough in what it does cover. The five W's (none related to George) are addressed nearly with individual character-level granularity when examining code. It takes great pains to explain why you need a 'main' function, for example, and the specific significance of terminating (not separating) statements with a semicolon.While this degree of explanation does become nearly maddening if you've programmed anything (even BASIC) before, it does lend a degree of insight into the language that may otherwise be missed in more casual tomes. The treatment of such things often taken for granted without explanation is what lends the book as a powerful refresher for teachers. At the same time, such long-winded dialog covering the most basic of functions and their syntax (as well as the mechanics of syntax applicable throughout the entire language) introduces C and C++ to the absolute beginner at a rate that keeps the level of fear to a minimum.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a true understanding of the C and C++ languages, and who prefers to enter the pool one step at a time instead of bring thrown in headlong."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I found the book to be very useful. Coming from a self tought background of python, php and vb.net, I found the book adequate to answer every unknown concept I had run into teaching myself other languages.I wouldn't suggest trying to learn a language like C++ as a starter language, but after reading through most of this book I can not see how I could ever become more than a novice programmer without a little of this type of knowledge.Some of the later chapters suffer from what I call 'sample asphyxiation', but that is a trend that I noticed in all of programming books I have read."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"This is one of the most thorough and complete C++ primer learning books on the market today as well as the most popular by far.

But when a really awesome C++ opportunity presented itself I had to go for it and I needed a book to do a quick review. This book was a great review for me. It brought me up to speed quickly and covered most of what I would expect in a very logical order. There are tons of sample programs where you get the complete listing, followed by a discussion of that listing. Most of the important topics are covered. I would have preferred more coverage of the STL but the book does hit the most common classes and algorithms. All in all it was well worth the money."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I can't really say much about the Primer Plus books. Other than they are the best training texts ever written. This is the first C++ book I added to my library but have purchased others such as C/C#/Java2/vb.net They all stand out above the rest.

If you are new to C++,read the book \\"C++ primer plus\\" first. It is so funny that the book\\"C++ primer plus\\" (which is also a great book) is really an introductorybook.

(or many)! This book is good...no, not good...GREAT! A book doesn't last 20 years (yes, 20) through various editions (5 obviously) without being something special. And this is no exception. This is unqeustionably the best beginner/intermediate book on C++ I have ever read (it pains me to say it...but it has dethroned Object oriented programming in c++ by Lafore, ISBN 0672323087 in that respect). Maybe it's just me, but Prata has a tone (a way) that just makes it VERY easy to relate to the concepts he is trying to explain. He doesn't belabor a point, nor does he treat you like a gumby or one of his colleagues to impress with his knowledge of the arcana of C++. He, oddly enough, seems more interested in teaching you (properly) then trying to get paid (look at the size of the book! if he were looking to get paid, cut the book in half, sell it in two parts or sell one reduced size part for the same price).Prata offers fair coverage of the language: particularly the basics, as well as some nice software engineering opinions along the way (not in little colored boxes like Deitel with an Ant picture...which is cool: the ant analogy just annoys me- loss of identity, no individuality, part of a hive, etc...). Obviously he can't cover everything. Check out the chapter listing to see if he has what you want! But what he does cover-> the ++basics are extremely well done. There are programming exercises at the end of each chapter of course (with answers).Prata has adopted a friendly, welcoming tone, laced with humor (not insipid humor, or just plain lame). He doesn't lambast microsoft or push any particular product/compiler. He provides little tips if you're using new or old, non-ansi-c++ compliant compilers. This is just a really helpful, useful, good to learn from book. I've read it to recover some obfuscated c++ knowledge lost from spending too long in java land (a nice, highly productive place...but just a little too safe if know what I mean: everything is fenced in and there are no pointers for self navigation!), so my opinion may be from somebody who is not a beginner. Nevertheless, having taught people, i would suggest this: this is a pedagogically sound work that offers achievement and understanding for anybody willing to step up and take a serious whack at c++. Read it and enjoy a true rarity nowadays: someting that not only lives up to its promise, but goes beyond it. This is money that is sure to be spent in a non-resentful manner: there's no buyer's remorse here! There's nothing about this book that I find weak.Very well done Mr Prata!Definitely Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"The decorously named &quot;C++ Primer Plus, fifth edition&quot; is a book for C++ beginners and those who would consider themselves a C++ virtuoso. C++ Primer Plus doesn't follow the trend of being the type of programming book that you either learn from and set away forever on a dusty shelf nor the type that you can use as a reference guide but can't use it to learn from. This is one of the few programming books I have read that I have both learned from and can still use as a perfectly suitable reference guide.In C++ Primer Plus, you are lead through the &quot;cin's&quot; and &quot;cout's&quot; of C++. In this book you will be given well guided lessons with examples from the basic to the advanced features of this wonderfuly capable programming language. You will learn the common C++ programming idioms and techniques as you turn the pages, each example constructed clearly and professionally. One of the great features attributed to this book is the dedication to teaching its readers C++, one being each example code given to you touse was carefully crafted to be compitable with most popular and even a few less heard of, C++ compilers.The author is also good at explaining each piece of code with wonderful precision and patience, so well in fact they don't have to provide constant screen shots to show what they are trying to explain - unlike many other programming books.If you have ever wanted to learn a programming language that is greatly respected in the business world, then I would of course suggest picking up C++. If you want a great book to learn from and use as a guide throughout your programming life for C++, then I suggest picking up &quot;C++ Primer Plus, fifth edition&quot;. Just as much as I appreciate this book for its ability to teach people directly, I equally would recommend this book as agood teaching text for those of you who may already know C++ but find it hard to teach others. I myself hope to use this book to teach others by one day.-Rift-"},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I'm a very picky kind of guy when it comes to buying books on programming. To see what I think of this book, you should read my little story.When I entered the wonderful world of programming, I chose Visual Basic .NET. This language was famous for being easy to learn. What I didn't know was that it had grown into something more complex, and .NET is a bit tougher to learn than any of the previous versions. So I thought it would only be natural that I needed to buy a couple of books to master the language.The more books I bought, the more I got sick and tired of authors who weren't able to follow simple naming conventions. Another annoying thing with .NET books is that you can find one sentence in almost all of them saying, \\"You don't need to know this\\" when it comes to using built-in functions. Whether I need to know something or not is my decision, not the author's decision. So the author's job is to explain it, and if I really \\"don't need to know it\\", I can skip the section. But to make matters worse, most authors didn't even switch to .NET and continued writing bad code as they did with previous versions of Visual Basic, which has nothing to do with .NET. In consequence, I switched to C#, hoping that things would get better.After the switch, I could still use my Visual Basic .NET books because the syntax is so similar. But I decided to buy some C# books since I hoped that quality would get better. In fact, quality did get much better. But another problem was still the same: most beginning .NET books are too trivial, too superficial, and too incomplete. For a good start with .NET, you need quite a couple of books. The nine books on .NET I own range from beginner topics to advanced topics, but I still find it's incomplete and much too superficial. Not even all the books together give me the information I want.In terms of syntax, C# and C++ are quite similar. If you can read C# code, then you can read C++ code and vice versa. I know that many C++ book authors go a bit deeper, so I decided to buy a book on C++ to see if that could provide me with the information I want and need. After some research, I ordered C++ Primer Plus mainly based on the excellent reviews here at Amazon.The reader arrived quickly, and I started immediately. After the first chapter, I knew I had wasted a lot of money - on the nine books I own, that is. This one is a beginner's book, but it goes much deeper than all the other books I own together. If I had known this before, you can be damn sure that C++ Primer Plus would be the only beginner's book on my shelf.The author has written a true jewel - coherently, concise, and fun to read. It even covers topics that you can't find in advanced .NET books, so I guess another switch is about to happen.If I had to vote for the best beginner's programming book, this is it. No matter at what level you are, this book is great to have on your shelf. You'll appreciate Stephen's talent to get you started in case you've never touched programming before. If you think you're advanced, put this book on your shelf - it's great for reference as well. Fed up with superficial .NET? Come over to C++, Stephen makes it so simple. Want to continue with .NET? No problem, I have nine books for sale."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I was learning C++ in order to program music applications.

I haven't had any problems compiling the examples in the book that I've chosen.However, when I reached Chapter 13, the binding broke. I now have two books loosely connected by a thin strip of paper. I'll have to rebind it, probably as two different parts. For the cost of this book, I expect a better quality product. None of my heavily used O'Reilly texts have ever had their binding break. So I've subtracted one star for that."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I'm a veteran C programmer and have been given an assignment in C++. I thought the jump would be a piece of cake, because I had sort of looked at C++ many years ago never going much beyond Hello World, and because I had done 2 years of C# programming. It turned out that C++ is considerably more complex than I had expected and it has evolved over the years. I did have Lipmann's C++ Primer in its second edition but nearly every time I tried to read it I would fall asleep. Somehow Lippman's style didn't grab me. I also had some other advanced books, but they were rather dated, and were perhaps the wrong place to start. I had bought C++ in a Nutshell and didn't like it at all as a way of learning C++. So I decided to get an up to date book that focussed on the concept and saw that this was highly recommended.When the book came in the mail I was shocked at how big it is. I had to take the lift to get back to my apartment ;).I had been expecting a book around 400 pages, it is 1200 pages. I guess that it's the language's fault.Since I had a special need: to find a thorough explanation of references as used by functions, I jumped straight to the chapter, and found its style was wonderful. It could not be better. The text is full of reminders of concept he uses, just in case you had not read them very carefully before. I'm finding the style most engaging unlike Lipmann. It reads so well that the extra pages don't matter so much.I've tried various topics and have found that you can go straight to the topic and get by quite well, because the author is constantly reminding you of the assumptions.Unlike some other introductions to C++ this one does not stop early, and it insists a lot on what is going on behind the scenes.I also noticed that it's very usable by people who do not have much programming experience. I would not recommend that anyone start programming with C++ however, it's just too complex. You would be better off starting with Python or Java.Based on what I have read, it seems that Prata's place in heaven is assured.The Devil learns C++ in Prata. (sorry I could not resist that one).Update:I have been reading this book a while now, and I must say that it's not wonderful as a reference, because it's hard to find information on a specific topic without having read a considerable amount of what was said before. It's also rather hard for me to skim tough the pages to find the explanation of something, so I'll have to use the index. But it's not meant as a reference, (However it does have a few very good reference sections, like the one on the STL) but rather as a teaching book where you go through the chapters one after the other.I've just been reading the section on Iterators. It's simply the best explanation I have ever read of this topic. I found it much better than Ivor Horton's text on this point.You will probably want several C++ books, including a reference book like C++ in a Nutshell.

The concept2. The code3. What the code is doingOther useful tidbits are compatibility warnings for older compilers (the book even shows how to get the code to work in those situations) and summaries of the key information in each chapter.With this being the 5th edition, the examples and concepts are of excellent quality.Even so, there are some 'very' minor errors/typos in the text (haven't noticed any in the code yet) that a careful reader is sure to spot. Unfortunately I've yet to see an errata listing on the website for the book. So far this has not been an issue for me at all.TIP:The website for the book has changed in the last week. If you visit the old site you will be redirected to Informit's site where you will have to register in order to get the code.

So far, I've enjoyed this book. Only one problem though. Ending a chapter with programming exercises is great! However, the author does not provide example answers in an appendix at the end of the book like he does for the review questions, -so you are left to speculate whether your answer to each question is correct, something that could lead to confusion. Aside from that, I couldn't find a thing wrong with the book! I really enjoyed the hand holding that goes on throughout the text and feel this is necessary for a beginning book.

Most other books with tell you a few basic things, but never explain the details well enough for any practical purpose. Not this book. The author goes through practically every nook and cranny of the C++ language, explaining all the little quirks about each feature. It really is the most complete text I have seen, but also explained in a way you can understand. The book does not assume you have any prior C++ experience, in fact, you don't even need to know how to program at all (though a little experience obviously helps). I really wish I would have read this book first, and not a bunch of \\"Learn C++ in 2 hours\\" types of books that barely teach you anything but the basics.

Do you want to learn to program in C++? Do you have little or no previous knowledge of the C++ language? Well then, I would highly recommend this book to you. It is very well written, has many relevant code examples, exercises and a wealth of thorough explanations to guide you through it all. The author does an excellent job with providing beginner friendly and thorough explanations. In addition to all this, the book is of excellent value for the money. I wish that I had known about this book much sooner! I struggled with a couple of other \\"catchy\\" C++ book titles out there that appeared promising. I was a bit reluctant to purchase this book at first so I checked out a lot of customer reviews. If I had only one book to recommend for beginners, and even those with previous knowledge in the C++ programming language, this book is indeed the ONE and ONLY. If I were to name just one of the many great attributes that stands out in this particular book, it would be the fact that the author takes no shortcuts or compromises in his excellent teaching techniques. Study time in this book is very productive from page to page and no information is redundant. The author re-emphasizes important subject information by including it, where applicable, in the comments following all the code examples, (a good strategy to help instill new structures of knowledge to long-term memory), which is something I have not seen consistently in the other C++ books that I have studied. It is evident that a great deal of resources have been invested in producing this book. If a newer edition comes out, I will be in line to purchase it without hesitation.If I was able to rank it higher than 5 stars, I most certainly would have.

With the code examples and fine attention to detail with a \\"Try-It-Yourself\\" approach, one cannot read through the text without gaining vast knowledge of such an arcane art as computer programming. I've read tons of books on programming, but Primer Plus is special, here's why:1. The most basic of subjects are explained to you.2. After the subject is explained to you, you then must DO that which was explained to you.3. After you do what was explained to you, you must then do it on your own in a similar manner.4. After the basics, you move on to more advanced subjects that build upon your newly acquired foundation.5. Repeat steps 2-3.HOW HARD IS THAT?!As I said before, the man is a genius and his mastery of explanation is better than the cryptic creator of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) himself!

Each chapter deals with a few related concepts and illustrates them through some simple examples. Although the example codes are easy to follow, they do provide valuable insight into the nitty gritties of the language. However, I do feel that some prior experience in coding, preferably in C is needed to follow this book on your own. Also, this book is not for the impatient as almost each and every page has some important technical details, be it the differences between instantiation and specialization or discussion on scope.

Books on computer code are written by experts in the field, people who have years and years of experience. Too bad most of them can't write a real, understandable sentence to save their lives. I've read so many bad coding books looking for this one. Some bad books plod through poor examples and dry, dry text then barely cover difficult topics. Others just show you an example code and what it outputs, not telling you why or how it works. This book is totally different. Examples are plentiful and well described. Sections are not only written with the beginner in mind, but also the more experienced coder that just forgot how do do this or that. It strikes a balance between the two that I've never seen elsewhere. One other great feature is that the book is not written for one specific compiler (coding software). So there's no compiler specific code. Because not everyone is using the newest compiler, the book even gives you alternative operations sometimes, just in case.All in all, it's a well organized, well written and just plain great book.It's even amazingly light for being so thick."},{"Title":"C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)","review":"I bought this book without a lick of knowledge about C++ or C.

And to someone who is trying to give themselves a refresher course in C++, this book is perfect. The author comes from an science/astronomy background so many of the excersises are geared in that direction. He has a good sense of humor and keeps the discussion lively.

In other words, the book shows you how to write C++ code that is portable (requires little to no modification to run on different operating systems); powerful (gets the job done error free); easy to maintain (spend your time designing and coding--not trouble shooting); and educational (gives you lessons in structrual and object-oriented programming methods).But that's not all!...The author demonstrates a genuine committment to developing your knowledge, skills, and abilities by providing background information on C++. In fact, the author even discusses the similarities and differences between C and C++ so you can better understanding the language.If you want a superb foundational education in C++; one that isn't intimidating; one that is useful; one that is fun, then this book is for you.Beyound a shadow of a doubt...I highly recommend this book to beginners and intermediate programmers.

I still wish it had been . . . although a book by all of Roger's friends would be a very thick one; I don't believe there was anyone who knew him personally who didn't love him - and I think everyone who knew and loved his writing felt they had lost a friend when he died.I won't comment on my own story, but there are plenty of others of outstanding quality, well worth the price; John Varley's is my pick for best of the bunch, with Walter Jon Williams in there pretty close . . . but really, you could hardly go wrong just opening this book at any one of the stories and beginning there.The cover is, admittedly, butt-ugly; and this should have been a hardback - as much money as Roger made for Avon in his lifetime, you'd think they could do a little better by his memory - but never mind; the contents more than make up for the exterior.If you are one of those (us) who cherish Roger's memory, buy this book as your expression of appreciation for his memory. Or if you're just looking for a lot of damned good reading . . . ."},{"Title":"Lord of the Fantastic: Stories in Honor of Roger Zelazny","review":"Lord of the Fantastic doesn't contain any of Roger's Zelazny's work. Instead, it's a big wake being held in his honor, where various writers stand up, tell a story they think Roger would have liked, and then share some of their history with him. The stories are good, and the memories add a bittersweet tinge to the collection.A few stories that stuck in my mind:\\"Calling Pittsburgh\\", by Steven Brust, is an interesting piece about a gambler trying to win back ownership of the earth, piecemeal, from the aliens that now own it. The only problem is, you're not a good gambler unless you can figure out from how your opponent is acting whether he's bluffing or not.\\"Southern Discomfort\\", by Jack C. Haldeman II, is about a fairy kicked out of her homeland for playing mean pranks. All she has to do to come back is to perform one unselfish deed, but she likes it here.\\"The Flying Dutchman\\", by John Varley, is a nasty piece about how sometimes you really can't ever get home again. But maybe you can make a connection in Cleveland?\\"Ninekiller and the Neterw\\", by William Sanders, is an adventure piece set in Egypt, featuring a pilot who is forced down in the middle of the desert with a archaeologist who is more than he seems. Luckily, his dead Grandfather hangs around to warn of trouble.\\"Call Me Titan\\", by Robert Silverberg, is a short piece about one of the original Greek titans escaping his prison to get revenge on Zeus. But where do you find the king of the gods in 1998?\\"The Halfway House at the Heart of Darkness\\", by William Browning Spencer, deals with a new form of addiction in the future - if virtual reality can be anything you want to dream of, why ever leave it? And what if rehabilitating you was illegal?\\"Only the End of the World Again\\", by Neil Gaiman, is another of his short brilliant pieces. This one involves a Mr. Larry Talbot, late of Innsmouth, Mass.That's only a few of the stories, and not even all of the best. Heck, even the worst stories in this collection are pretty good - Martin Greenberg is a good editor of collections, but in this volume he's really pulled off a fine job. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that every one of these authors were inspired or helped by Roger Zelazny, and came up with their best to honor him.My verdict: Well worth the time and trouble to read, both for the marvelous stories and for the peeks at how one man has cast his shadow over so much of the science fiction and fantasy landscape."},{"Title":"Lord of the Fantastic: Stories in Honor of Roger Zelazny","review":"I enjoyed this book, and although not EVERY story was great, they were very good. I think that it makes a fine book by itself, and a great book in memory of the late Roger Zelazny. This is a must have for Zelazny fans."},{"Title":"Possibilities and Paradox: An Introduction to Modal and Many-Valued Logic","review":"In Possibilities and Paradox, J.C. Beall and Bas Van Fraassen team up to present a rigorous introduction to modal and many-valued logic. After presenting a brief motivation for the development of modal logic (chapter 1), the authors provide a discussion of set theory (chapter 2), logical semantics (chapter 3), the tableau or \\"tree\\" method of proof (chapter 4), normal modal logics (chapter 5), and intuitionistic and non-normal modal logics (chapter 6). These chapters prepare the reader for future topics, including many-valued logics (chapter 7), the Sorites and Liar paradoxes (chapter 8), and supervaluations and continuum-valued logics (chapter 9). The final section is devoted to metatheory and includes further tools for understanding and working with, among other things, functions, sentences, and soundness and completeness proofs.For the student with only a basic logic course or two under his or her belt, Possibilities and Paradox is going to be a tough read. Despite its brevity (233 total pages), the book is extremely information dense--the philosophical equivalent of Grape Nuts cereal, if you will. Virtually every sentence of every chapter contains an essential point or concept that merits a careful reading, re-reading, re-re-reading, and perhaps two or three readings on top of that before an exam if it is a required text, as it was in my case. While this makes the book exemplary when it comes to an efficient presentation of the material, since it is an introductory text it would have benefited from at least three additional features. First, I would have liked to see the authors provide more of a \\"big picture\\" framework for approaching the mechanics of logic- what a good logical language should do, why we'd want a syntax to work a certain way, etc. The authors do a fairly good job of this in the later chapters, but bit more attention to this in the first three or four would make the book even more accessible to students. Second, a chapter or two on proofs would be especially helpful to students without a strong background in this aspect of logic; something like a brief, modal and many-valued version of Daniel Velleman's, How to Prove It. Finally, a chapter or two on quantification would be a nice addition to future editions of the book.One last thing (note well): as of the writing of this review, a helpful list of corrections to various errata is available on professor Van Fraassen's website."},{"Title":"Office Yoga: A Quickie Guide to Staying Balanced and Fit in the Work Environment","review":"The book arrived as we were about to leave for Munich.

Ross exhaustively researched his material to give us a feel for the sights, sounds, smells of the crowded, sometimes squalid tenement that Brownsville was, complete with Yiddish expressions and verbiage common for the time.Brownsville spawned both Murder Inc., the Jewish Mafia, and Albert Abraham Davidoff, better known as Bummy Davis, a dynamic lightweight boxing contender with a thunderous left hook. Murder Inc. was headed by Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter. He used local Jewish thugs such Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles, \\"Pittsburgh Phil\\" Strauss and \\"Buggsy\\" Goldstein to enforce policiesof protection, loan sharking, extortion, prostitution, and bootlegging. They terrorized the community using murder to keep everyone in line.Davis, whose dad was a local merchant, had an older brother Willie who was a Lepke henchman. Davis who was a loyal, thoughtful, industrious and respectful guy, could never shake a negative image brought about by the exploits of his brother. After working as a fruit peddlar from a pushcart at the tender age of 10, he soon discovered that his fighting skills learned on the streets could be honed into productive boxing skills.He turned professional at 16 lying about his age and became a money making prize fighter with exceptional skills. He used his money to buy his parents a home and refused to be controlled by the mobsters in cohoots with Murder Inc.The story goes on to chronicle both the rise anf fall of the Brownsville Jewish mafia. Unfortunately the storied life of Bummy Davis was also abbreviated. At the tender age of 25 having retired from boxing due to the rampant corruption and prejudices that existed and about to begin a new career, he was gunned down in a bar room stick up trying to protect his friends."},{"Title":"Bummy Davis vs. Murder, Inc.: The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Mafia and an Ill-Fated Prizefighter","review":"Ron Ross masterfully recreates the world of the \\"Brownsville Bum\\"-which is how WC Heinz referred to Albert Davidoff in hiswell known sports story.Ross takes Bummy-who Ring Magazine rated 54th of boxing's 100 best lb. for lb. punchers of all time-tothe next level,in quite possibly the best \\"factional novel\\" everwritten-at least about boxing,gangsters and Brownsville,Brooklynin a world that dramatically changed in 1945,when Bummy's life ended trying to prevent a bar holdup with his fists.And Davisalso didn't take any crap from Murder Incorporated either;Rossbeautifully recreates the scene in which the leaders of MurderInc. drive up to Davis after a fight they lost money on-and Davis drops his gym bag,ready to kayo all of them in the street;this showdown finally gave people the courage to testify against Murder Incorporated in court.The final bar showdown-if this gets to the movies-could be the best final showdown in movie history;I'm looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Bummy Davis vs. Murder, Inc.: The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Mafia and an Ill-Fated Prizefighter","review":"I seldom reread a book; this book I have read twice and bought three copies to give away.

Jewish readers will especially love this book; we know these people though we have never met. I fell in love with Bummy Davis and when he died, I felt a loss. My gangster imagination loved reading about all the mob characters, though I am not a fan of violence or boxing for that matter.

I couldn't put it down, and found something to chuckle about or a phrase to admire or an ironic comment I loved at least once on each page. I finished the book today (March 29, 2007)and did something I never did before (and I am 80 year's old). I noted from the book jacket that the author divides his time between Oceanside, LI and Boca Raton, Fl, and even though it is 4 years since the book was written and the author's name is a relatively common one, I called information for his Boca Raton number and took a chance that it was the right Ron Ross. I left a message that if this Ron Ross was an author, would he please call me, and I left my number. A few hours later I received a call from Mr. Ross and we had a delightful conversation for 10 minutes or so. For me to have taken the time to locate Mr. Ross and call him is an example that actions speak louder than words. Believe my action and go out and buy, read, enjoy, and love the book.

Tolkien","review":"This is a fun book written for and by fans of Middle-earth as is its sequel, More People's Guide. There is something for everyone, whether your favorite people are Hobbits, Elves, Men or Dwarves. Many of them are thoughtful essays on various aspects or themes of the books and fantasy in general and there are reviews of the first two films. One of my favorites was Tehanu's \\"We Cry at Beauty\\" which speaks among other things about the tremendous impact this story has had on people's personal lives, how they have held on through their own struggles because Frodo did. My very favorite though is Quickbeam who wrote in \\"...And in the Closet Bind Them\\" contains some of most beautiful words I've read about Frodo and Sam's loving friendship, another salvo in the battle to say that they were not lovers but brothers. He's also the reason that I finally watched the much-maligned Rankin-Bass animated production of Return of the King. Yes, it is quite silly. Elrond looks ridiculous and the Orcs are even more, singing \\"Where's the Whip There's A Way.\\" Not at all threatening except for the one that whips Frodo in the tower. But there is much that is very good also in detailing Frodo and Sam's bond, the tower scene with its loving reunion which is my favorite scene from the whole story because of the that and the constant support they gave each other on their perilous journey to the Fire. I am glad I saw it and it was because Quickbeam spoke of his love-hate relationship with it and recommended it for the very reasons I state above. Go see it, you'll laugh but you'll also be touched."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"I purchased \\"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien\\" thinking I would find interesting facts and information regarding Mr. Tolkien. I was very disappointed and afterward felt that this book's title was very misleading since the book is mostly about LOTR and not Tolkien himself.It is compilation of comments that are posted on a LOTR web site. As you would expect, there is little information that could be accepted as reliable. The writing style is difficult at times and occasionally very arrogant.There is very little about Tolkien himself in the book. What it does provide in lieu of information about Tolkien are many opinions about LOTR books and movies. In fact, it spends a great many pages providing reviews of Peter Jackson's recent films.It appears that little effort is made in the production of this book other than organizing the web postings into categories and adding cartoon illustrations of LOTR characters.Regardless what the title suggests, this book doesn't provide information about J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"This book is a must-own for any Tolkien or Inklings fan. The debates and controversies are excellent; indeed, I especially appreciate the open dialogue in here. And, the discussion ranges over a vast number of things, all Tolkien. Green Books and TORN have each been a treat for a long time on the web, and it's gratifying to have these thoughts--almost every paragraph a gem--in a tangible, published form. Just as with the websites, this book is full of intellectual insights without beginning weighed down by inane academic jargon. These writers live and breath Tolkien, and the results are certainly rewarding. I look forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R.

The TORN staff do a great job compiling some of the best stuff from their website for this. I couldn't recommend it higher.Matt Tinaglia- editor of Parma Endorion and Understanding Middle-earth"},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"Virtually every fan of J.R.R. Tolkien has been to Theonering.net, the massive fan website that contains far-reaching news, rumors, info and discussions about Middle-Earth. Now the webmasters of that site have compiled essays, film reviews, much-asked questions into the &quot;People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien,&quot; both for and by &quot;the people.&quot; (Meaning the fans)After a foreword by the foremost Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, the book launches into a series of essays by the very kind Tehanu, Anwyn, Quickbeam, Ostadan, and Turgon. They examine charges of racism and sexism, explore the relationship between Sam and Frodo, defend escapism, study the effects of 9/11 and Tolkien's world, Christianity's indirect impact on Middle-Earth (&quot;Wake up and Smell the Dogma&quot; being one of these), its relationship to Arthurian legend, its mythological roots, analyzing Tolkien's &quot;Letters&quot; book, the real hero of &quot;Rings&quot;, nature's place in Middle-Earth, and many other ideas and concepts.And, in keeping with what's going on now, there is movie analysis. First they handle the ghastly Rankin/Bass film and mediocre Bakshi film. Then they go over the new live-action Peter Jackson trilogy, and the multiple viewpoints on the films themselves are great (Anwyn's is probably the most in-depth). Among the essays is Quickbeam's visit to New Zealand in 2000 where he checked out sets, filming, and actually met Jackson himself (as well as talented actors Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Bernard Hill and Orlando Bloom). The end of one section gives us an unusually sweet, romantic glimpse of Jackson and Fran Walsh. (Too many interviewers treat them just as coworkers, and not as a loving couple with two kids. Both sides can be seen here)That's not to say that it's all serious analysis: There is the &quot;Merchandising Hell&quot; chapter, full of nightmare cash-in merchandise (&quot;lembas&quot; nutrition bars sold at health clubs, Gollum toothpaste), gaming, a C.S. Lewis-inspired &quot;Screwtape&quot; letter, and the reclaiming of the word &quot;geek.&quot; (Geek pride!) Finally there is a Q&amp;A section handling questions like why hobbits aren't inclined to use the Ring's power, or Elf astronomy. (Not to mention the extremely cute &quot;Yes, Elanor, there really is a Gandalf!&quot; letter)The &quot;People's Guide&quot; benefits both from the authors' knowledge of Tolkien, and their knowledge of who they're talking to. The book isn't overly complicated or nitpicky, but it's far from dumbed-down. It's conversational, but instructive. Even people well-acquainted with Tolkien's work may come away with new perspectives on it, and new fans will find insights for the first time.Perhaps one of the best qualities of this book is the sense of familiarity it provides. Readers (assuming they've been to the website) will already be acquainted with the authors. You know they're not going to pull anything deranged out of their hats or show any scholarly contempt; you know they're genuine fans, not just analysts. Oh yes -- they're geeks too, the best kind of fan. (&quot;Are we not geeks?&quot;)Whether you have been a fan for years, or watched the new movies and were hooked, this is a must-read. If you buy one nonfiction Tolkien book this year, this should probably be the one."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"A beautiful, dynamic collaberation of essays, reviews and the like, it deserves greatness. Now I can sit in my bed reading the timeless essays and writings of fellow normal LOTR fans (and abnormal *cough*), in my own bed rather than sitting at a computer. I really enjoy and recommend this book to anybody. The range of opinions in this book is amazing (ie Cliff's review of FOTR compared to Anwyn's ;)) and it gives pros and cons of the movies. Next to that, is great essays about good, evil, and whatnot, with splindid artwork, my favorite of which is the Q&A. By the way, the Q&A puts things into different perspectives that I have not previously thought of before, providing much more in depth looks then my mind could go. I recommend this book to anybody interested in Tolkien, just be warned of MAJOR spoilers if you don't want to be spoiled."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"I found this book to be fairly enjoyable with some thought provoking ideas. I would not recommend it as the first book to read about Tolkien's works (such as Shippey or Humphrey), but as an adjunct to primary sources. Others have compared it to Harvey's Origins of Tolkien's Middle-Earth for Dummies, but I found that strewn with errors which detracted from the experience. Not so with this book. I did enjoy some of the writers over others, but the mix of ideas kept me reading."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"Well, I feel compelled to defend this book. Yes, it is a collection of writing from a highly popular fan website, written by \\"amateurs\\" (by which I assume is meant someone who is not a university professor with stacks of publications to his/her credit). The book's title is the key here, the \\"People's Guide\\", not the \\"Academician's Guide\\". I may be old-fashioned, but I really prefer holding a book in my hands to reading from a computer screen. I like to underline key passages, put tabs on pages, return often to something that caught my curiosity. As a collection, the book is a mixed bag. Some writers are better than others, some chapters are frivolous, some are humorous and some are as good as anything you're likely to find in a scholarly journal. That's what makes this book so interesting, it's the voices of all the website creators, who are the people. I put myself in the same category, Tolkien fans who are educated, literate and don't have a university appointment but do have a lot of ideas. So I admire their bravery for putting their thoughts on paper and on the Internet, for others to tear down or hold up. Also, I want to express kudos to Cold Spring Press for a very elegant attractively designed volume. The publisher obviously put more than the ordinary effort into the production of this very nice trade paperback."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"This is an awesome book. I was not let down by it at all! This book provides great insight into the works of Tolkien. This is a must have for any fan of the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, or the Silmarillion. TheOneRing. net did an awesome job putting this book together. This book is great for reference or for just sitting down and reading from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be what its title says it is: a GUIDE and introduction to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien. Well, guess again! This is NOT a &quot;People's Guide,&quot; nor is it any other kind of &quot;Guide.&quot; It is simply a collection of essays in which a group of fans associated with the website http://www.theonering.net spout their personal opinions on various issues connected with the books and movies. This book does NOT provide any sort of &quot;Guide&quot; to Tolkien, nor is it an introductory work by any stretch of the imagination. It actually presupposes a substantial amount of Tolkien knowledge, and those who lack that are not likely to get much out of reading it.I'm sure this book will be enjoyable for many readers, notably those who are big fans of the website for which its authors write. I found some of the material in it entertaining myself. But I must strenuously object to its has being so misleadingly titled. With the burgeoning popularity of the books bolstered by the release of the Peter Jackson films, I'm concerned that there may be lots of people new to Tolkien looking for something to read that will help them make sense of it all, who will be attracted to this book because of its fallacious title. To anyone who is new to Tolkien's world, I can't emphasize more strongly that this book is NOT going to help you become oriented to the history, geography, mythology, of anything else concerning Middle-earth...or do much of anything else other than confuse you.Fortunately, the helpful folks who put out the &quot;For Dummies&quot; series have risen to the challenge and provided a REAL guide to Tolkien's work, which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who is looking for a clear, systematic introduction to Tolkien: The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies. I would urge bewildered Tolkien newbies to check out that work and stay away from this one for the time being.Bottom line: this book will be amusing reading for some Tolkien geeks, but I think anyone who is not already pretty well versed in Middle-earth lore would be much better off investing their money in the &quot;For Dummies&quot; book than buying this one. And to the publishers of this book: if you ever put out a second edition, PLEASE give it a less misleading title!"},{"Title":"The People's Guide to J.R.R.

And do we really now need to preserve in book form reviews of Jackson's first film that speculate what the sequels will be like? But despite erratic coverage there's some good stuff here, more of it about Tolkien than about the films, earnestly and engagingly written, often on-target and at worst honestly wrong.

I for one have found mistakes in nearly every Tolkien resource I've ever read, but _The People's Guide_ is totally accurate.Perhaps _The People's Guide_ is a bit more informal than most of the stuff on the shelves, but it is an easy and engaging read, yet by no means shallow.

It's a bonus that they are closely connected to the filmmakers; which only adds to their insight. Their moving entries span from humorous to emotional. There's something for everyone here.

Regime dynamics regarding e-Commerce and taxation; investment and intellectual property; content, privacy and jurisdiction are extensively discussed in the core chapters in Franda's book. Franda rightly points out, as is the case with every other aspect of information technology, that the Internet regime functions more effectively in some areas than others. When the security of sovereign states and privacy of content are involved, acute mistrust and inter-state conflict has been the norm, making it impossible to develop consistent regime rules and procedures in these subject-areas.Governing the Internet has sections on Information War (IW) and the ways that public and private users of the Internet are trying to slowly but surely build more robust regime norms to facilitate inclusion of both aspiring as well as already &quot;digitalized&quot; states. Students of cyberspace and leaders of both governmental and non-governmental, national and international organizations using the global Internet will immensely profit from reading Franda's book - perhaps the first in an almost virgin field.(Reviewed by Talukder Maniruzzaman, Professor of Political Science, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh; with technical help from Raguib Muneer,Analyst, Environmental Data Group, Kentucky.)"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I wanted to cry after reading this, which is unusual for me.

Mar&iacute;a was a remarkable woman, but she was nothing like Julie Andrews in the movie. Their escape was made by train to Italy and then by ship to travel to the USA where they were going to go on a concert tour. Hiking through the Alps to escape certainly would not make much sense for a woman who was at that time pregnant, with two very small children as well!

I am inspired when I read about Maria Von Trapp. She has such a positive outlook on life and is optimistic even through their challenges and trials. It has helped me keep perspective at times when things have been difficult in my own life. She is also very clever and witty in her writings so it is an entertaining book as well. It tells about what really happened with the Von Trapp family which is (often) quite different from \\"The Sound of Music\\". (It's still my favorite movie) I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Having been raised on The Sound of Music, I have always wanted to read the book on the family that inspired it. This book is beautifully written, with rich detail and light humor, by a voice you can't help but love. Maria's attention to detail, along with small inserts on folk/country life makes the book an easy, fun read. It's historical accuracy makes it a must read. I absolutely love this book and recommend it to anyone, absolutely anyone."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I purchased The Story of the Trapp Family Singers for a 12 year old granddaughter. She has every kind of electronic modern devise, she is getting a \\"classic\\" education (Latin, etc.), but doesn't read much. I was a non-reader through elementary school until a nun insisted I read the Trapp Family book. I found myself reading until 2 a.m., crying and laughing, and loving the book. The true-life story, family biography is inspiring and encouraging as well as explaining history from a personal family experience. What more can a grandmother do to encourage quality traits in every aspect of a child's life?"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The real Maria writes about the Von Trapp family story! Very interesting, full of great history, and a story full of love even through hard times."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"If you are obsessed with the Sound of Music like me, then this book is a must-read. It answers all of your questions about the film and about the real lives of the von Trapps, such as: Did the family really climb a mountain to escape? Did the Captain really use a whistle to summon his children? What happened to their enormous home in Austria?I loved the fiesty side of Maria that came through in her writing, and I chuckled as she relayed her struggles with learning English.Maria also discusses the places she lived and visited in Austria. If you ever get a chance to go to Salzburg, go, go, go! There's nothing like running through the gardens or spinning on the Alps. And even if you can't, this book makes you feel like you're right there with Maria."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"When the movie \\"Sound of Music\\" came out I went to see it and was instantly entranced. I was also horrified at the harshness and reality of the Nazi occupation of Austria. Since then I have learned that although Hollywood produced this remarkable movie, it was not entirely factual. I live in Vermont where the VonTrapp family settled in Stowe after fleeing German Nazi occupied Austria. Maria VonTrapp was not pleased, to put it mildly, with Hollywood's version of their life story. This book is Maria Augusta Trapp's true life story as written and recorded by her. Included is the story of the VonTrapp family's singing career. It is a remarkable and very interesting book, highly recommended for anyone interested in the VonTrapp's."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Thank you!

A little jumpy in places, a lot of religious documentations, but enjoyable. Made me smile and cry."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This was a very enjoyable book about the Von Trapp family. It was fascinating to find out how many things in the film, The Sound of Music, actually happened, as well as how many things were different. Maria Von Trapp also shares the role faith had in sustaining the family through some very difficult times. I recommend this to all who would enjoy a relaxing and positive book. The second half of the book does lag in spots, but the overall reading experience makes the book worthwhile and fun reading for ambitious upper elementary students through adults."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is an easy read. It is interesting and there are many entertaining parts. Inspiring, uplifting? Less so. One soon realizes that Maria is the &quot;Captain&quot; here. Such amibition, enthusiasm and hard work is admirable but it becomes a little tiresome when piously clothed in &quot;the will of God&quot;. Clearly all of this is the will of Maria. Read it for part of the &quot;real&quot; story. See the play and movie to see how great artists can make a story come alive and inspire us to better things."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I'm a huge fan of the movie \\"Sound of Music\\" and finally got around to reading the true story.Now please don't take my next comments badly. I love that she wrote this and was able to get it published. I am. But the writing style I found very distracting. There seemed to be a lot of jumping around and at times almost felt if it were being told by a young child, it was almost like reading a stream of consciousness. That may be just me.There were many places I wanted more detail, more information. For instance, I was hoping to learn - through her eyes - more about the how the Nazis came to power in Austria, that sort of thing. One thing she did touch on was the Nazi's deceitful intent in trying to convince the rest of the world that the Austrians were happy and celebrating the take over (holding people at gun point to ring church bells then playing the bells ringing over a radio broadcast for all to hear the \\"joy\\" in the streets). Makes one think about a group these days that are attempting to infiltrate under the guise of peace and innocence, claiming those who kill in their name are \\"radicals\\".This is definately worth reading, though. A truly amazing family with an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I, too, saw the A&amp;E Biography of the Von Trapp family, which revealed the &quot;real&quot; story. So, while reading Maria's book, I had to be somewhat skeptical when she characterized herself as a decent, noble, loving mother, always ready to do the will of God, (Well, she probably was, at least in part.) Despite this skepticism, I still enjoyed the book. Parts of it are quite humorous, and others are filled with richly detailed descriptions of Austrian folk life and thier celebrations of holidays. Some parts were even a little moving, too. It was nice to hear what really went on, even if Maria left certain things out conveiently. There's no reason why anyone shouldn't read this, especially if they're interested in the story behind The Sound of Music. Even if it isn't the complete true story, it's still throughly engaging. And it's got to be at least half-true, so, oh, well."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"You will enjoy this true story of the \\"Sound of Music\\" family. It is both historical and charming. The family's adventures and trials will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"One of my favorite books. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was the best movie ever so I had to read the book it was based on. this book was great and I loved all the extra info that was not in the movie. A real inspiriring story."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Excellent writing--My mother has enjoying reading the book. I have enjoying reading it also."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"....in the german language - but that's not important.The story is written very good. But the cover is sign in on the false side. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is the story of the Trapp family as told from Maria's viewpoint. It would be interesting if we could read the honest appraisal of the children. For example, in the 1949 book, Maria tells about meeting the captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to what we saw in the movie. She even tells how the captain used a whistle to call the children.In 1972, however, she wrote a book called &quot;Maria,&quot; in which she states that the captain was not at home when she arrived, and that &quot;Baroness Matilda&quot; introduced her to the children.OK, which was it?I suspect there are deep divisions in this family (as there usually are in second-marriage situations), and so far, the children have been too polite (or too psychologically mixed up) to tell us the real truth. Evidence of the division is found in the fact that the movie does not use the children's names, and mixes up the order of their births (e.g. in real life, the oldest child was a boy, not a girl). Did the children refuse to grant the right to use their names?"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is a personal family history of the Trapp Family Singers. It begins with Maria's days in the convent, traces the migrations of the family during the War years, and finishes in their family home in Vermont.Ever since seeing The Sound of Music for the first time, I have always been curious about what happened next- -did the entire family manage to safely climb the Alps to freedom? How did they pay for their journey to the US? And what connection do they have to the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont? Maria Trapp answers all of these questions in this book. While the musical version of their life did convey many of the main episodes, the storyline of the musical compressed these episodes so that they seemed to happen one after the other: Maria leaves the convent, teaches the children how to sing, marries their father, and they flee the country at the outbreak of the war, all within 2 hours. Phew! Like the musical, this book also starts with Maria's last day in the convent, but more than a year passed before she and the Baron were married, in 1927. They were married some 12 years and had 2 additional children along the way before leaving Austria. Yes, as unknowns, the family did win a song festival, but that was in 1936, and by the time they fled Austria, they were already quite well-known and had toured Europe as a family singing group. Indeed, one additional reason for leaving the country when they did was that they had been invited to sing at Hitler's birthday.When driving past the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, I have always thought of it as a ritzy place, and assumed that the money to purchase it and develop it had come from the Baron's family fortune. In reading this book, I found that that was not the case at all. The Baron's fortune was lost before the family left Austria, and they arrived in the US on borrowed money. In their new American lives, they had to restart from the very bottom of the social ladder, digging themselves out of debt before they could even begin to think of buying new clothes or a home. For years they dressed in the same simple clothes they had arrived in, and they built their first house in Vermont from the foundation up with their bare hands. That is, the girls did, since the two boys had been drafted into the US army and were fighting in Europe at the time.This book relates all of these details and many more, with a considerable sprinkling of humor. Maria comes across as a determined optimist, a young girl barely out of her teens who arrived on the doorstep of a house filled with grief and dissension. Through her personal character and upbringing, she created a family with strong bonds to each other that was able to withstand remarriage, loss of fortune, becoming refugees, and establishing a home and a livelihood in a distant foreign land. The two elements that were her constant guidance and source of inspiration were her faith and the music. This book is peppered with remarks that ring true even today: \\"The family that sings together, plays together, prays together, and usually stays together.\\" \\"Our age has become so mechanical that this has also affected our recreation. People have gotten used to sitting down and watching a movie, a ball game, a television set. It may be good once in a while, but it certainly is not good all the time. Our own faculties, our imagination, our memory, the ability to do things with our mind and our hands- -they need to be exercised. If we become too passive, we get dissatisfied.\\" The Sound of Music is a great story, but the story presented in this book is much better."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is simply one the most uplifting books I have ever read! I adore the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but this book is even more amazing. The von Trapp family went from immense wealth to poverty in a very short time, but throughout their trials they never lost their faith that God would provide. I was also impressed that they were so easily able to recognize the evil around them (Hitler, etc.) for what it was. My favorite part of the book is when Georg gathers his family together and tells them, &quot;Children, we have a choice now: do we want to keep the material goods we still have. . .our friends, and all the things we are fond of?--then we shall have to give up the spiritual goods: our faith and honor. We can't have both any more.&quot; The family chooses to relinquish their wealth and retain their honor. This is the best example I know of a family that stuck together through thick and thin."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"My mother ran the gift shop at the Trapp Family summer camps in Stowe in the late '40s, and I spent my summers with her when I was three and four, the youngest child there. Agatha, the oldest daughter, appointed herself as my caretaker during those two summers, and I have many clear and wonderful memories of those times - Cor Unum, their home which later became the original Lodge, just completed; singing and dancing all day and evening, indoors and out; hiking Pico Peak singing; the family with their dirndls and braided crowns; and always, the figure of Maria, the Baroness, looming over all, larger than life, laughing and singing and leading the fun.That said, this book was one of my earliest attempts to read a &quot;big people's&quot; book. I loved it - still do! - and the way it captured the characters of the people I knew. But I also recall my mother telling me that while the Baroness was a wonderful raconteur, her book, like all memoirs, was somewhat skewed and biased. She was not the holy innocent who had no idea that the Captain was in love with her and who meekly married him only because it was the will of God. She was an immensely strong-willed woman who knew exactly what was going on and also knew that she was entirely ill-suited to contemplative convent life. Which isn't to say that her account is untrue; light that passes through a prism is still light, although bent, and her account, while similarly bent, is still fundamentally true. There is some truth in all she says, but some of the details have been fluffed up a bit.The family probably wouldn't have survived without her strength, will, and humor, and there is no doubt of her religiousity - she turned to charismatic Catholicism in her later years and was speaking in tongues. As is the case with all strong people, some people, including some in her family, had difficulties with her. And of course, the play and film bear very little resemblance to reality - the very fact that the family names weren't flossy enough for Hollywood tells you that the producers felt a need to tart up the story.But I've always loved this book, and will continue to recommend it - forget the movie!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Though our whole family loves the movie &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; the book -- as usual -- is much better! It includes so much more detail and personal and historical facts to add to the story. The movie covered only the first HALF of this book -- and the second half is the best part! I've often wished they would make a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; to show the wonderful &quot;rest of the story!&quot; This is a great &quot;READ-ALOUD&quot; book for families with even quite young children, an excellent &quot;historical read&quot; for older children, and fine entertainment and inspiration for young and old alike!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is my all time favorite book! I have watched the movie a million times since I was two years old, portrayed Maria von Trapp in the musical play and read this book. I find it extremely engaging and entertaining.

I reccomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The true, complete story of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is even richer and more riveting than the film. The book goes into much deeper historical detail about Hitler's persecution of believers in God. The book is an excellent primary source for teaching history. When teaching high school students about the Second World War, I always read my classes the sections in the book where Maria describes how the family's life in Austria was changed once the Nazis rose to power. I hope that the publishers will put this gem of a book back in print and back on the shelves of America's bookstores!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I read the 1949 edition of this book, and in doing so I got to share in Maria's heart, her mind, her faith, her family. I feel as if I know them all! Too bad the movie didn't come even close to being as real as this true story. I can't help but feel like America was fed a fluff story of little substance with &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and too bad everyone knows the stars but not the real Trapps! May the remaining original Trapps be blessed and honored, wherever they may be living out their years."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Aside from so many more details than a movie could ever give, this book has other small treasures hidden in it. My favorite part of this book is Maria's humorous relaying of her difficulties with learning a new language- English. Her misuses and others people's misunderstandings had me laughing out loud.Maria also gives details about their family traditions (how they celebrated birthdays and religious holidays, for example), many of which I hope to adopt for my family. Her faith and simple lifestyle inspire me. She has her priorities straight and knows what's really important in this life."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The book was a joy to read, one filled with hope, love, struggle and triumph through faith and hard work. The true value is in learning how different the Trapp family's life was from the Sound of Music and quite different indeed it was.I was unaware of just how musically gifted the family really was, how much of a struggle their early years in America were and just how deep their faith in God was throughout their lives.I would have given it 5 stars but the tale of the romance between the Captain and Maria and their escape from Austria were brief to non-existent . I would have liked to have heard more from Maria on those chapters of their life.On the plus side, her writing is from the heart, and filled with wonder on her part on the goodness of people wherever she went.The path of a family who succeeded by faith, hard work and personal responsibility was a real inspiration.Pick up this book, read their true story, and be inspired."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"...and while I have loved the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; since I first saw it when I was 16 years old (24 years ago), I must say the book is a better story. My 19 year old daughter read this aloud to us a while ago and my 2 younger children (ages 9 and 3) LOVED it and begged to have more than one chapter each night. I love WWII history and so I loved this book for that reason too. We found it very interesting to learn so much about what it was like to be Catholic. It seems this family loved each other very much, and their faith was amazing too. One time they had a need and the family took turns for many days to pray around the clock, each up and praying for an hour I think it was. You could tell they LOVED God very much, and depended on HIM for all things. And He never failed them. Their life was not without trials and heartache. I recommend this book highly as a family read-aloud.

In spite of her best efforts to adapt to the contemplative life of a sister, she developed health problems that a doctor attributed to the sudden and tremendous change from the active life she had left behind. So Mother Superior decided that the would-be postulant must go back to the world for a time - just on loan, as she put it - as live-in teacher to the invalid daughter of Baron Georg von Trapp. Maria quickly grew to love not only her pupil, but the widowed Baron's other six children. When God asked her to spend the rest of her life with him, as his second wife and stepmother to his brood, it was the last thing in the world she either expected or wanted. Yet it launched her on a long, rich, and intriguing life, one that this book chronicles (up to its 1949 publication, at least).I read this as a girl, and I loved Maria's story so much that I found I could almost quote whole passages decades later when I came across a copy and picked it up again. \\"The Sound of Music\\" is a wonderful musical and a fine film. But this, the story on which it was based, is so much better! The wealthy von Trapps lost first their fortune, and then their home and country, as the Nazis took over Europe. They learned to make their living doing what they did best together, by singing, and they had to do so in a foreign country. Faith in God, love for each other, and the love of friends saw them through. This book ought not to be missed. It's a gem.--Reviewed by Nina M.

A great deal more of the spiritual character of Maria and the Trapps are seen in this book than was even hinted at during the movie.

After nine years ~ and continuing the tradition of watching the great classic musical every Thanksgiving ~ my husband is just enamored with the film... So much so that he would get online and research the actors and the movie...This book was a Christmas gift that satisfied so much curiosity for him in ways unforeseen upon purchasing... Within a month he finished the book (which is HUGE since he works 10 to 11 hour days).He loved reading the history of this family through Maria's eyes... As he told me, the movie only touches on a very small part of their lives...but the general premise is true...they're a singing family who really did have to skidaddle out of Austria right under the noses of the Nazi authorities...Here's one thing he told me that really stuck... The Von Trapp family didn't have much money when they got to the States (not going to spoil it so I won't state why). They didn't know where to settle for a little while when a friend had suggested building there...and the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont is their actual former house...the one they built!! How cool is that?!?!?!?!!! Ahh...history... It's a beautiful thing :)If you like the musical...and are interested in learning more about the family's experience (after Maria's arrival) this is a fabulous book that cleverly tells &#34;the rest of the story&#34; :)"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I bought this book for myself for Christmas last year & read it immediatly. Like so many little girls, I fell in love the 1st time I saw the movie in the movie theater when I was a small girl. I'm 51 now & &#34;in my time&#34;, we didn't have dvd or video. You watched it at the theater & hoped they put it on tv. I watched it every chance I had & was so happy when it came out on vhs. It was a must-see for my kids to see also. I never knew about this book until I found it on Amazon. I never knew what happened to the family after they escaped & I had absolutely no idea they had such a long entertainment history in the US - and I was amazed that they even traveled so close to my childhood home in Arizona when I was young! I absolutely enjoyed reading every page of this book, learning their history, hearing their stories. Reading between the lines, it was obvious there were more to the stories than what was being said, that things were maybe 'bent' as someone else said. But the basic facts are the same. And if Maria was a tough woman, that's probably what saved them & I admire her & all of them even more. Reading the true story & having to grow up & realize my beloved movie was not actual fact in many ways was a bit disappointing. But in no way did reading the book detract from how much I still love the movie, which is what it was made to be after all - entertainment. In fact, I love it more, knowing more about their real lives. I think the book was more special, because my mother's grandfather was an educated man from Austria & he left his family behind when he came to the US as a young man. I've ehard stories about how he lost touch with his sisters during the war & never heard from them again. Reading this book gives me a better idea of what my ancestors must have gone through. And I love the book. Some people don't like it because of the way it's written. You have to realize the book was written by a woman who #1-was not trained as a writer, #2- grew up in an entirely different era & #3 who's main language was not English......so of course the writing style & use of language can be rough at times, but I think that makes it even better because it wasn't handed over to be re-written by a professional, so as to be more acceptable. I would recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in this family, or maybe even the history of that time."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Along with everyone else who has read this book, I loved \\"The Sound of Music\\" and knew that it was a glossed over account of their real life. I picked up this book, hoping that there would me some truth to it. While I am sure that the majority of the events DID happen, they way they are presented leaves much to be desired. I got the impression reading this book that there was yet a 3rd side to the story that is not presented here.This is the story of the family, as told by Maria. This is the book on which the movie is based. The book leads the reader to believe that everything was sunshine and roses and that whenever anything bad happened, God provided the opportunities. While I am not doubting Maria's faith, I also think that she worked her tail off to get some of the opportunites the family recieved.This book is very moving. Some of the antics of the little kids made me chuckle and the story of Georg's death brought tears to my eyes.

Their faith is tremendous and each time I read it my own faith is strengthened. I love the humor in the book- it leaps out at you in unexpected ways.

In this part it was very easy to understand how lost and confused they surely felt in the first days of being there. But also in this part of the book we can see how brave they were, because although they had a lot of problems, they had success in their lives in the american continent.The part in which I was almost moved to tears was the ending, because there you can see what friends are for and why you have to have some."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"What a wonderful book!

So, being so indoctrinated to \\"The Sound of Music\\" I was excited to learn that my aunt actually knew the real Maria Von Trapp, and that she would be the guest of honor at a charity benefit my aunt was hosting. My mother took me with her, and I was thrilled both at the possibility of meeting my first celebrity, and the thought that I might get some extra credit from my teacher if I \\"interviewed\\" the real life Maria.The big moment arrived and my aunt brought over Maria Von Trapp to introduce her to us. At first glance I was let down, I had expected kind of an amalgamation of Mary Martin and Julie Andrews, this tall, strapping, robust, ruddy complexioned woman clad in an old world peasant style dress with a kerchief tied around iron gray hair looked nothing like either one of them. Also to my eleven-year-old eyes she was \\"really old\\", (she was in fact sixty years old, four years older than my current age!), and she spoke with a heavy Austrian accent. However, she had a beaming smile and twinkling blue eyes as she shook my hand heartily. I will always remember how remarkably attentive and charming Maria was to me, the schoolboy solemnly explaining that I could get extra credit in my school if I could interview her. With the passage of time I mercifully don't remember the questions I asked, fairly inane I'm sure, but she was delightful, patiently answering each one, never rushing me, or patronizing me. Before we parted she had signed a program for me, which is tucked somewhere in my old desk in my parent's home.I had read this book just before I had met her; we had it in our classroom library, naturally. Since then I have read it several times, obviously gaining a deeper appreciation than I did as a callow boy. However the charm of Maria's writing style is that it is simple enough to embrace readers from pre adolescent to adult, but also is an engrossing tale told by a natural storyteller that bridges an age gap. It's very readable, and I think holds the reader's interest from beginning to end, the first time I had reread it after meeting Maria, I felt as if she were chatting with me again recounting stories of her family and herself. Be sure you read the \\"The Chapter Before the First\\" which is really a forward or introduction, but has a engaging little anecdote that is pertinent to the book.For anyone that loved or has an interest in \\"The Sound of Music\\", this is a must, since you will get to know and have a better understanding of the real Trapp Family Singers, and admire them that much more. Also, although most of the basic facts of the film are true, the events portrayed are telescoped and run together, and dramatic license is taken. The timeline in fact from when Maria arrives at the Villa Trapp to the family's fleeing Austria from the Nazi horror is about twelve years, not the several months shown in the film. In that twelve year span, not only do the Captain and Maria marry, but they have two daughters of their own, in addition to the original seven children, lose their fortune, and begin their singing career and start to earn acclaim in Europe. The Captain himself is a kinder, gentler character than the initial frigid autocrat of play and film. Maria is pregnant with their third child when the family departs Austria in a much less dramatic fashion, but they did turn down three lucrative offers from the Nazis and were in peril if they remained in their homeland. Also, they did escape by the skin of their teeth, since the Nazis closed the borders the day after they left. Shortly before they decide to leave Maria recounts a chilling vignette where the Captain and she sit at an adjoining table next to Hitler and his storm troopers in a Munich restaurant and witness firsthand the appalling banality of absolute evil.Happier events are recounted; I especially loved her vivid, enchanting descriptions of the celebrations and customs of an Austrian Christmas and Easter, so different from what we're used to in America. It's disheartening to realize these lovely traditions from the 1920's and 1930's are most likely not widely practiced any more in this nuclear age, so much has been lost in man's march of \\"progress\\". Since my parents emigrated from Ireland in the 1940's, I could identify with the Trapps' immigrant experience as they struggled to assimilate and establish a home and some security in their adopted homeland. Some of the stories that she recounts about other immigrants in addition to her own family's wrestling with the attempt to learn English quickly will give you a good chuckle!The thread running through her memoirs is Maria's strong faith; trust in God's grace, and acceptance of His will, even if it may not seem to be ours at the time, the title of the review is a quote she uses that exemplifies this fact. After Maria's death in 1987, stories came out that she was not as \\"sweet\\" in real life, among other things she was supposed to have a hot, violent temper and be very headstrong and dominating towards her family. That well may be, but I don't think she comes across as a saccharine, shrinking violet in this book; she's a definite force of nature, and her strength and determination are quite apparent. They had to be, the Von Trapp family totaled twelve in all, plus their musical conductor Father Franz Wasner, they had to support themselves. In addition, I read later on that Maria lost her mother as an infant; her father abandoned her to harsh, uncaring relatives who physically abused her during her childhood. Under the circumstances it's amazing she turned out so well. While perhaps the whole story of the Trapp Family Singers is not presented, and this may be a whitewashed version, it is still an absorbing, uplifting biography penned by a remarkable woman.Though our paths never crossed again, I will always have a warm memory of our encounter so long ago. I did visit Salzburg, Austria as a young man and see Nonnberg Abbey where Maria had been a postulant, plus several other sites from the film. I also visited her grave while on vacation at the Trapp Lodge in Stowe, Vermont several years ago, and said a silent prayer for her, remembering her kindness to me. And yes, I did get extra credit from my delighted schoolteacher for my report back to the class and Maria's autograph!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, and I realize now that Maria Von Trapp wrote it in the style of an earlier time in which the main characters look unfailingly noble. While we can admire the family's stand against the Nazis, the details that have been left out, which were recently revealed by A&amp;E's &quot;Biography&quot; make them more human and realistic. For in reality, we learn that Maria was the stern, tempermental, dictatorial one and the Captain the more mild mannered one, and that it was against Maria whom the children had to fight for their independance when they wanted lives outside the singing group. The A&amp;E version also gives a more detailed account of Maria's harsh childhood, that she hadn't always been so religious and in fact had been an atheist at one point, her stepchildren's true feelings about accepting her into the family, and the way Maria took her husband for granted. Her account of their lives resulted in one of the world's greatest musicals, and is a clear monument to virtue in the world, but as part of a modern audience, I don't mind a touch more reality and humanness to such stories. Without it, they seem a little too lofty and untouchable."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"\\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\\" is the wonderful life story of the Trapp family singers. Maria details how she met and married the Baron Georg von Trapp; loved and cared for his children; and went on to have three children of her own. The first half of the book is set against the background of pre-World War II Austria, with charming details of holidays and the annual Salzburg music festival.Then the Baron loses his money; and the family uses their musical talents to earn a living. They become more and more successful, but when the Nazis invade Austria, the von Trapps must choose between material success (on the Nazis' terms) or freedom (and starting over) in America. Their choice proves to be an inspirational one.The second half of the book deals with the von Trapps's new life in America. There are many comical scenes of Maria's struggle to learn English. And they also face the problems of continuing their careers in America, as well as dealing with publicity, agents, etc. But their faith in God sees them through all difficulties.I really found this book inspiring. The von Trapps never gave up, even when they were tempted to, many times. They were --and are-- a strong family."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The Sound of Music is my favorite movie, so I HAD to track this book down and read it.I was not disappointed!Maria inspired me with her faith in God and his help through all the trials of life. She also had SO MANY MORE STORIES TO TELL THAT NEVER MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE. One example: I was interested to know that their mansion in Austria was made into a Nazi Headquarters after the family fled. Once, when Hitler was visiting, he overheard one of the German soldiers whistling a tune which happened to be of Russian origin. Hitler was so enraged that he ordered all the German guards present to be shot.This book is one of the best books that I have ever read.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The movie itself is one of my favorites. It was so nice to have a better insight (without the glamour of the movie) of how the family lived."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I read this for the first time in high school and really enjoyed it. I watched the movie again for the first time in probably 8 or 9 years and found myself frustrated because it ends with only part of the story told. The book is written by Maria herself, and goes much farther than them escaping Austria. The movie version is great, but I find myself gong back to the book to get all the fun details and the full story over and over."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Growing up in the 60's, one of my favorite movies was \\"The Sound of Music\\". I've always wanted to read the real story, and now I have. It is quite different from the movie, but I enjoyed thrilling over the adventures just the same. It is an amazing story of a family that had to endure many hardships and overcome many obstacles and still kept on singing. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how to live life for the Lord in spite of the turmoil going on in the world about you."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I've probably watched the movie 20 times but never actually read the real life version of the Von Trapps. This book was very interesting reading, if a bit heavy on the religious references. However, what I learned from this book that I did not know from the movie is that the family actually sang a lot of religious music and not the more folk/showtune music that Broadway/Hollywood made their story famous with. This was apparently a point of discord with the actual Trapp family themselves. Maria Von Trapp, however, was an excellent writer and her story engages. You get the sense that her ability to write a good story is an extension of her interesting, compelling, and strong personality. Several times during the book, I almost laughed out loud. I would have loved to have actually met her. The Austrian history that the book often includes, as a prelude to WWII, is also very interesting as an aside to the Von Trapp story. If you have any interest in this family, the movie, or the historial period, I think you'll enjoy this. It's a relatively easy, engaging read."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is the original book that was written before \\"The Sound of Music\\" was ever thought of. It is written by Maria von Trapp herself and has the story of their lives before, during and after the period reflected in the film. The energised personality of the writer conmes through clearly, making one think about the difference one's outlook on life can bring to those around you. If you ever wondered what came before and after \\"The Sound of Music\\" this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I enjoyed every page of this book. It's inspiring, interesting and even funny! I was so glad I could buy more copies at amazon to give out as presents, they make an excellent gift!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I had borrowed this book from my local library after having read another book on the same topic by Agathe von Trapp that I purchased at Barnes & Noble with a gift card I received for my birthday. Decided that I wanted a copy of this book for my personal library as well, so ordered it from Amazon. It was excellent and meant a lot to me since I am not only a fan of The Sound of Music but have also visited Salzburg, Austria."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Lovely, inspiring, TRUE story filled with uplifting testimonies about a life lived in faith. I laughed and cried with this one. Then I turned around and recommended it to my entire family. I really enjoyed learning about the romance between Maria and the Captain. I enjoyed the chapter about the family's summer vacation while they were still in Austria. I also enjoyed hearing about their musical tours and how they developed into a successful singing group. Read it and pass it on! This is a great book to share."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"A really wonderful story.A bit disillusioning as the real story is a bit different to the movie,but still an amazing family with an inspiring tale to tell"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"When I received this book I began reading it immediately. I could not put it down until I had finished with it .Hope to visit their home this Aug. When I go to Maine for a month, to visit family."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The book's always better than the movie, right? Well, in this case I'd say they're both pretty close. This is the true story of Maria Von Trapp - how she met her captain and how the Trapp Family Singers became world famous. Maria is a feisty character. You can see why the beginning of this book became a stage play and the greatest musical of all time. You'll see the differences in the true story versus the movie. You'll wonder why some of the best parts were left out of the movie. You'll laugh out loud and you'll enjoy Maria's singular writing style. If you love \\"The Sound of Music\\", you must read this book!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"When I started this book I expected to discover that the film is very different from the reality of the Trapp family. I was surprised to find that much of the film is accurate. Notable changes/omissions in the film are the children's names, the date of Georg and Maria's marriage, dealings with Hitler and the Nazis, the family's devout religious practices, and the \\"escape\\" from Austria. Much of the book deals with the Trapp family's struggles and triumphs in America. In its Biography of the family, A & E tv implies that Maria paints a rosy picture in this book and glosses over some of the darker chapters in the family's life. I did not find that to be the case. I feel that Maria tells her story, warts and all. You will love learning about Georg's first wife, the true story of leaving Austria, Maria's effort at grasping English, the fascinating religious rituals, and the recurring reality of how music truly saved their lives."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The Sound of Music is my favourite film I have seen it at least 25 times. But when I read the real story I liked it more. I think Maria was a great woman who kept the family together with her love. It was the most important thing for her. When I am sad and fed up with all the things around me I always read the book /of course only parts of it/ and after reading I always feel better. It is One Of My Favourite Things! I would recommend to everybody to read it. It is about love and history."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"In the late 1960s, when I was maybe 9 years old, my mother let me ditch school to attend a lecture by Maria von Trapp. I'm guessing that the author was promoting a newer edition of her book at the time. She struck me as an opinionated, very strong personality, but one who had twinkling eyes and who encouraged me to continue my piano lessons. The baroness autographed my EZ-Play &quot;Sound of Music&quot; piano book, but sternly made sure that I realized that the movie was not REALLY what her life was about--that it was just Hollywood stuff. When I grew up and became a music teacher myself for 15 years, I wish I'd remembered this book, because I would have recommended it to every student of mine. I just found this copy in an antique shop, but THIS one won't be recycled or resold!What comes through on every page is the dedication to a will and purpose higher than any human's will. This was not meant to be a &quot;religious&quot; book, but a history of a family who made a huge difference in the world by their faithful service to God. Being willing to work hard, submit their discomfort or inconvenience to God's will and have Him turn it into great blessings and lessons for the family and indeed the world, are truly building blocks of faith, hope, love, and encouragement.In addition, the stories of the family's dedication to their profession and the pursuit of excellence are inspiring. To attain such stature and not have one's nose in the clouds is an accomplishment in itself! (Ever meet a music scholar or highly-educated performer? The humble ones are few and far between.)I agree with the other reviewers that Maria probably was the Captain of the family, but look what happened to a country peasant girl who was truly noble, not just assigned the title!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book was truly an inspiration to read, seeing the hardships the Von Trapps went through after leaving Austria. It reminds us all of what our priorities in life should be. Knowing that this was a true story and not fiction made it all the more inspiring, that a family could go through such hardships and still survive without being bitter."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Okay, \\"War and Peace\\" it ain't, but what it is is a charming rendering of the Trapp Family history. Told in an almost childlike voice, it was refreshing to learn about this amazing woman and her struggles to keep her family afloat during a turbulent time in the world. After hearing so much about Paris Hilton and Tori Spelling these days it was refreshing to come back to reality and see how insipid today's youth can be. Maria was a strong woman who didn't flinch in the face of adversity. I enjoyed hearing about her faith, as well, being a rather lax Catholic, my interest in my own faith has been inspired by reading her book. I enjoyed her exuberance over the simplest things and it made me appreciate everything I have. I would recommend this book to everyone...young, old, religious, atheists, etc. There is something to learn from Maria von Trapp and this delightful book now goes on my short list of \\"All Time Favorites\\". Read this book and share it with someone you love, or better yet, share it with someone you hate."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This adventure is full of human laughter, tradition, and inspiration. The true story greatly surpasses &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in humor, candor, and joy. You also get the rest of the story: after they flee Nazi Austria, they come to the United States to share their traditions and song, and it would inspire anyone to read how they survive through financial struggles, tour the nation singing, set up a humanitarian organization to aid severely depressed Europe at the end of WWII, and start music camps in Vermont. This is one of my three favorite books"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"One of the best books written of all time. It will make you cry, laugh, and just make you feel good inside. i first read this book at the Trapp Family lodge in Stowe, VT and I just fell in love with it. This is a great book for all! Please rate my review!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Our whole family --six of us, including three teenage boys-- enjoyed this story and have read it several times. And the reason I bought this copy is because we loaned our other one away, and it never came back, and we just had to have it in our home library.We appreciated the author's descriptions of the many celebrations and festivals in their family life that were so closely tied to their devout Catholicism. Being Protestant, we knew little and understood less about the benefits of \\"hand-on\\" reminders and \\"helps\\" to our worship. The knowledge has expanded our thinking.Plus the story is just that --a great story."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Seeing as how this book came out in 1949 and the musical didn't come out until 1959, Maria Augusta Trapp is the one that gave the world the story of \\"The Sound of Music\\". If as other reviewers have pointed out that this was a book not all together truthful, I ask \\"Who Cares?\\"So, maybe we can't believe everything in this book, but why does it matter? The book is a great read. Maria Trapp gave us some of herself in this book. It was a great way to spend the weekend.Besides, the observations about the modern world she made in 1949 are just as meaningful now. I say, take knowing the truth with a grain of salt. I guess if you are historical purist, this book isn't for you. If you want a great read, then this is your book."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"It was amazing comparing the book to the Sound of Music and to read what an amazing lives the Von Trapps lived"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Ever wonder about the real story and not the Hollywood one? Well this book will answer that. The faith described here is remarkable. I would have loved to meet Maria and visit with her. The Trapp Family is really remarkable."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I have long wondered about the story behind the movie and now my curiosity has been satisfied. An interesting story, also interesting to see how the movie makers 'played' with the story to get it on screen. The movie is such a small part of the whole story ...and slightly skewed. It was good to get the 'facts'."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I love this book. It is a lot different from the movie because the names of most of the characters are changed so its kind of confusing in the beginning. I would recommend this book to people who love the story of The Sound of Music. It goes further in detail of the life of the Von Traps."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":".........Yet I did find the poignant ending teary.

Sad when it ended. Wonderful story. Mrs. Trapp had a great take on life. Inspiring, and a fun read many times over the years."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I bought this book at the intermission of the Sound of Music musical I recently attended. I was curious how closely the musical followed the true story. The book quickly covers the material in the musical then focuses primarily on the family's adjustment to America. It covers the years of their touring and their eventual settling in Stowe, VT.The musical, of course, takes some artistic license with the story, in order to heighten the drama and tension. For example, the father isn't really so cold towards the children in real life (but he does use a whistle to call them!). The children's names in the story are different too. The escape from Austria does not involve scaling mountains. Unfortunately, the book barely covers this part at all - in fact, it is covered in a few sentences told in flash back during a family meal on the boat to America. I don't understand why it was written this way when other parts of the story were covered in such detail.The book was very much from Maria's point of view (of course, she wrote it!), and I did not get a strong sense of the personalities of the other family members. Another difference from the musical - Maria and Georg have 3 children of their own for a grand total of 10 children! Maria portrays herself very positively - she is cheerful, pious, optimistic, and indefatigable. She does not cover her past much at all. The book pretty much starts where the musical does.The book, at its core, is an immigrant story. The family was a bit atypical in that Maria and Georg had been rich in Austria (in fact, a Baroness and Baron), and the family was a professional singing group. However, much of the story is similar to other immigrants - the struggles with language, cultural differences, and a lack of money. It is fun to read of their introduction and adjustment to New York City.The Trapp family worked very hard to make it as a singing group - they were by no means an overnight success. The element that was holding them back was a lack of stage presence. Finally, one night a fly flew down Maria's throat during a performance and when she mentioned it to the audience, they burst out laughing and the ice was broken. It was not an easy life traveling with so many children (and so much luggage!). I felt exhausted just reading about all their tours and travels through the U.S. The book covers how they finally settled in Stowe, VT on a farm where they had to build a house almost from scratch. They also established a summer music camp there which was very successful. I enjoyed reading this part because I have been to Stowe and even to the Trapp Lodge.All in all, it was an entertaining story. I got a very positive portrayal of a strong, hardworking family full of love for each other. The family was enterprising with an admirable \\"can-do\\" spirit - a real American success story. One of the daughters wrote a book as well, which I hope to read."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I just returned from Salzburg, Austria and had to download her book.

NEWS FLASH: WICCA IS LESS THAN 60 YEARS OLD! For those of you advocating Buckland and Cunningham, please understand that these authors present modern WICCA, which is NOT the same as WITCHCRAFT! The \\"witchcraft\\" presented by Cunningham is a mix of superficial folklore, ceremonial magick, Amer-Indian spirituality and Thelema.This book however gives a good, is sometimes harsh view of Witchcraft in history. Certainly the bias of the times needs cnsidering, however, most withes were not simple old nature worshippers kepping the tradition of the Goddess alive. Realizing this fact does not invalidate Nature worship today. Presenting Wicca as a factual history of Witchcraft is retarded.

Most of this book made no sense whatsoever and I'm starting to wonder whether much of the content in this book was made up, randomly created in the mind of Mr. Ashley.

I should have read the reviews before purchasing...still...It may have been worth $.01 but is sure wasn't worth the $3.99 to have it shipped. I can see why the only positive reviews are from 15 year olds who know no better.

You will not find these changes in this book. Go to your breed's official website for updates on standards that might not have existed in 1979. Newer breeds such as American Curls, Selkirk Rexes, and Ragdolls are not included at all.\\"A Standard Guide to Cat Breeds\\" is interesting to read because it shows breeding as a work in progress. The Persians in this book still have recognizable noses, since the British Cat Fancy didn't go for the extreme smushed-in nose of the American Persian. So there are geographical differences as well as the deliberately encouraged breed traits that are too modern for this book. The standards are British rather than North American--another point to consider if you are going to purchase this volume.Outdated as it may be, \\"A Standard Guide to Cat Breeds\\" is still packed with useful information on how to raise and show your breed of choice. A history of the British Cat Fancy is included, as well one on Feline Genetics. Each recognized breed of cat is usually given its own chapter with standards, history, and personality types. Some lesser known breeds such as the Chartreuse must make do with a single paragraph and photograph.This book ends with a couple of short chapters on Feline Medicine and Feline Behavior."},{"Title":"Dream Exploration: A New Approach","review":"We all dream at night (or whenever it is that you chose to sleep). But not everybody remember their dreams, and of the ones that do, not everybody decide to spend time figuring out what the dream really was all about.Which is understandable, since dreams have a tendency to be completely illogical, very frightening, and simply too complex to return to. However, if you DO choose to try to interpret your dreams; learning how to remember them and trying to understand what they mean and want to tell you - then there's a whole new world out there, or rather in there, to explore.And in Dream Exploration Robert P. Gongloff, famous dream researcher, has constructed an easy-to-use method for anyone wanting to explore his or her dreams. Personally I never used it, though, since I prefer to simply write my dreams down and leave it at that. However, as I read through the book I got the impression that IF someone wants to explore their inner world, then Gongloff's ideas are a great start.But it's true, the term \\"dream research\\" can easily make you think about spaced out New Agers and yes, Gongloff does sometimes write in a way that's pretty spaced out. This doesn't mean, however, that he and his book should be disregarded straight away. Gongloff, after all, has some good things to say, for instance how one should not focus exclusively on what happens in the dream but rather what the strange actions and setting might symbolize, and also how dream dictionaries are a load of crap, since dream symbolism is objective and cannot be applied universally.So, if you feel the urge to start exploring your dreams, then Dream Exploration can be a very good choice. It's not a very long and the text is easy to read.Personally, though, I'll place my copy in my bookshelf and continue simply enjoying the fact that I'm able to remember my dreams, and leave it at that."},{"Title":"Storyteller's Sourcebook: 1983-1999","review":"Summaries of hundreds of folk and fairy tales, cross referenced with motifs and sources. A great help for writers looking for ideas, and for everyone searching for a good story."},{"Title":"Watch out for the Elephants!","review":"Angela and Ann Todd have weaved together a wonderful tale of their family's travels during the 35 years their father worked as a diplomat with the Foreign Service (US State Department). The sisters were born into a lifestyle where they knew nothing but moving from country to country and learning the language and customs wherever they went. Their story is all the more inspiring because it was lived out from 1945 to 1980 amid the social and political climate that impacted all US citizens -- no matter where they lived during those decades. Remember Ann and Angela's family adventures and solo experiences (at camp and boarding school at times) happened as technology was growing too. It will be hard for today's youngsters to imagine not being able to communicate with family members via e-mail and traveling by ship. The book will inspire the young to consider diplomatic careers, embrace foreign languages and learn geography. (Names of countries changed a lot too during their chronicle.) Older readers will be inspired by Angela and Ann's parents' (James and Norma) commitment to their marriage, children and the way they caused Angela and Ann to feel at home wherever they were. They used every move as a chance for the four of them to learn and serve. The journey their daughters share is delightful."},{"Title":"Watch out for the Elephants!","review":"REVIEWED BY: Wayne S. WalkerIn 1945, when racial tensions were still fairly high in the United States, James Todd became only the eleventh African-American man accepted into the United States Foreign Service and, with his wife of one year Norma, began a career with the State Department that spanned 35 years, ending with his retirement in 1980. Two daughters, the authors of this book, were born to the Todds, and the book chronicles the family's experiences while living in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and Southern Asia. Angela and Ann do not shrink away from describing the prejudice that their family sometimes encountered, both at home and in the field, but that is not the focus of the book. In fact, they say, \\"The truth of the matter is that Mom and Dad formed many lasting friendships over the years with numerous white American who were kind, decent, honest, and not racist at all.\\" Rather, they use everything that happened to them to encourage young people to be thankful for their blessings, turn life's challenges into learning experiences, approach life with a sense of humor, and enjoy the moment.This delightful, upbeat book is the daughters' testament to how their parents raised them to \\"count your blessings\\" and find \\"teachable moments\\" in everyday events of life. I especially liked the attitude expressed in the statement on the back of the book, \\"If our parents could do it as black Americans living abroad in 1945, you can achieve anything you want to in the 21st century and beyond!\\" In addition to several entries from Mr. Todd's journals and numerous black and white photographs throughout the text, there are 24 pages of full-color pictures in the back. This highly enjoyable book would make a really good source material to accompany a study of world history and geography during the mid-twentieth century. Since it is written especially for young people, there are elementary and middle school teachers guides available."},{"Title":"Watch out for the Elephants!","review":"This book is informative, exciting and quite a lovely recount of childhood memories.

I am glad we did! Although Kacee is 9 years old, she is an avid and literate reader...she still needed some help.All and all, this book was worth the price and worth the read.

Marcy, a small town teen-ager is not popular with boys, unlike her friend Liz. During this story, we get to watch as Marcy grows up and becomes more self-assured. It is a truly engaging story. Although it was probably written in the late 1950's, it still has a timeless element much like Daly's &quot;Seventeenth Summer.&quot; Be aware: Du Jardin wrote a sequel!

My purpose for purchasing this book was to learn about the origins of the great cultures that grew out of the African continent. I was partially satisfied.Whereas much of the information that was provided was new to me, the total package left me wanting more. The format (a series of lectures) was very redundant with many chapters repeating the same information.Being an American of African descent, I share the author's anger with the \\"experts\\" in the field that have re-written the history of Africa and her people to suit their own desires. However, I don't need to be reminded in every paragraph , in every chapter for 700 pages. I would have preferred more of the history and less of the diatribe."},{"Title":"AFRICA - MOTHER OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION","review":"Dr.Ben is an ethiopian jew by birth with knowledge of Hebrew, Greek,and Hieroglyphics, he is able to literaly read the hieroglyphics off the walls of ancient egypt and tell us how the people saw themselves and the world around them. He was a Professor at Al-Azhar University in Egypt teaching moden egyptians most of whom are descendants of arab invaders that ancient egypt is an african..i.e negro country, culture, religion, race,etc...Do you think they allowed him to do that to help him with his self esteem?...Or was it becuase he knew what he was talking about?"},{"Title":"AFRICA - MOTHER OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION","review":"It is true that African culture has been largely sidelined by European and US academics. The African contribution must in that case, by default, have been greater than Europeans make it out to be. However, to argue, as Dr Ben does, that all culture emanated from Africa and that Africa is the source of all Western Civilization is clearly nonsense. He goes as far as to maintain that Freemasonry has African origins. Why anyone would want to claim an aberrant system like Freemasonry as part of their heritage is beyond me!St Clair Drake put it in a nutshell when he wrote: \\"Ben-Jochannen's books challenge the reader to exercise alert vigilance to distinguish between fact, statements with a high degree of probability, and assertions based merely on a will to believe\\" (Black Folk Here & There, p.326)Most of Dr Ben's major works draw on a bizarre array of sources, including mystical and Masonic texts, and this is no exception. Anything he can find to throw at his ideological opponents he will pick up and throw, however jumbled and incoherent it might be.He argues for an African monoculture, whereas Africa is necessarily multicultural. He asserts that pre-Arabic Egyptian rulers were (apart from the Hyksos) Black people. He maintained that Egyptian culture has Ethiopian origins, that Greek culture had Egyptian roots, that monotheistic religion had its origins in Egypt, and that all science and art had African origins. Wow!The book also contains basic factual errors, which prompts me to ask why we should believe that everything written by Black representatives is automatically true. In the interest of labelling Queen Cleopatra as \`Black', Dr Ben overlooks the fact that her family (the Ptolemies) did not intermarry with their Egyptian subjects. While the Ptolemies basked in luxury and claimed to be gods (which is why they were allowed to practise incest), their subjects were downpressed and on the breadline. She was probably not \`White', the Makedonians being of mixed ancestry, having married into both the Syrian and Persian royal families. But that does not make her Black as understood today. Additionally she was actually Cleopatra VII, not Cleopatra VIII (as repeatedly stated on p.112). Also Dr Ben writes: \\"Cleopatra VIII committed suicide after being discovered in a plot with Marc Antonio (Mark Anthony) to murder Julius Caesar\\" (pp.112-113). In reality Julius Caesar had been dead for 14 years when Cleopatra committed suicide.As with all his works, he includes the charge that \\"white Jews' of the Western world are global impostors, having falsely hijacked a heritage which, according to Dr Ben, rightfully belongs to Black Africans. They have done this, he argues, by cunningly proclaiming their identity with the Israelites of the Bible. Consequently, he accuses them of propounding a racist creed from their very beginnings (pp.584-627).It is important to distinguish between Afrocentrism and Afrocentricity.Maulana Karenga writes: \\"Afrocentric means essentially viewing social and human reality from an African perspective or standpoint.\\" And that's fine! But, by contrast, \\"Afrocentrism appears more often in ideological discourse between Afrocentric advocates and critics especially in popular pieces on the subject\\". [Maulana Karenga. Introduction to Black Studies. (Los Angeles, CA.: The University of Sankore Press, 1993), p.35.]Afrocentrism is the notion that all civilization and technology had its origins in Africa. This is almost as much of a myth as Eurocentrism, which is a reverse mirror-image of Afrocentrism. A person can view things Afrocentrically without being Afrocentrist.If you want a serious study on the place of African civilization in human history, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"AFRICA - MOTHER OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION","review":"His section on Aristotle stealing ideas from black African authors that no longer exist is pure unsubstantiated conjecture that is highly unlikely as well..

As time went on I practiced with and learned from friends who are professionals and make a living with photography. Yet I found that I was still lacking somewhat. For some reason I was lacking consistency with my photos especially, when it came to exposure. So I had gotten this book and read it cover to cover, twice.

I had been an SRL enthusiast for many years and recently have revived my hobby with the purchase of a Canon 30D. I had a decent understanding of creative exposure, but this book brought my understanding to a whole new level. The book includes both theory and some short hands on exercises, which are very easy to follow. The exercises are particularly beneficial using a DSRL because of the rapid feedback you get with inexpensive, instant results. My only criticism of the book is it's coverage of digital v.s. film. It is very apparent that is was an afterthought. The result is that book ends very abruptly without any summarization or recapitulation--you turn the page to find the Index. This is a relatively minor criticism to an otherwise wonderful book. I still give it 5 stars and highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Well written with great examples.

I now get depth of field and shooting \\"wide open\\" or what macro shots look like and how to get them. Ultimately this book was worth a great deal more that the $15 I spent.

That would be unnecessarily redundant. I will however state that as a complete photo-rookie in my sixties, this book explained exposure very well. Simply stated: Exposure = Aperture + Shutter Speed + ISO. No book will ever replace one-on-one instruction from a trained professional, but this book is an excellent starting point for the budding photographer that doesn't know an aperture from an exposure compensation indicator.Read this book once!Read it again with camera in hand!Study it!Reference it!You will see what I mean!Then set that camera on full-manual with a 5.6 aperture as Bryan says and start shooting. Pretend that your camera has no other settings than manual and take some chances.If you want to learn photography basics, you MUST get off that Auto mode setting.If you want to take snapshots and don't want to risk messing things up, then by all means, go back to auto and take those shots, but remember to put it back on manual before you shut it down. Then reference this book again. I now feel guilty and have trouble getting off the full manual mode.Please note that this review is for the updated edition, not the most current 3rd edition, which I'm guessing is just as informative. And I will not compare it to any other book on the subject, as I'm not qualified to do so.Also, I'm an American citizen, and I can find fault with anything because of that.

Right?After learning about all the more technical specifications of cameras that meant absolutely nothing to me in terms of how to get the photograph I wanted, I finally picked up Understanding Exposure to give it a good read. I wish I had read this book years ago when I first bought it as a gift for a family member. Immediately the author relates the effects of a specific choice (aperture, ISO, shutter speed) to the effect on the picture. That is exactly what I need. Cause and Effect. I learn and work best with that type of instruction. The pictures the author places in the books are gorgeous and instructive examples.Twenty pages into the book and I had learned enough about the camera and getting desired results that I could use the information and produce photographs with intent rather than hope. I took my knew knowledge hiking and saw an immediate difference in my pictures.This book makes me feel empowered. I'm not intimidated by that crazy contraption known as the SLR camera anymore.

You can learn everything this book has to offer and then some by simply Googling around for how tos, photography blogs, and forums online.When it comes down to it, I just feel like this book was primarily published so that the author could show his work off. And there's nothing wrong with that, he's certainly an amazing photographer, but it's not really what I wanted to be paying for.

The vast majority of it is probably common knowledge to anybody who has looked up beginner guides for DSLR photography online. The book did a few things well:1) For each photo, the author commented on shutter and aperture setting and on how he metered the shot. This was very helpful in understanding the step-by-step process in taking a good photo.2) The author provided a few brief, but helpful pointers that made the book worth it. This included tricks for metering, how to approach different lighting situations, and a simplified approach for choosing aperature.Unfortunately, the brevity of this book leads to lots of confusion. The technical side of photography is glossed over, and I do not have a true understanding of exposure after reading this book. One example of this is his explanation of the various metering modes. The author repeatedly describes how he metered various photos using center-weighted or spot metering, but then recommends matrix metering to his readers. Never does he describe how matrix metering must be handled differently than the center-weighted metering he uses for the books photographs.In the end, the tips and pointers were helpful, but I'm more confused on some aspects of exposure now than before I read it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I read this book from first page to last and loved it.

Would highly recommend this book for any photography novice."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I just bought a DSLR in order to learn more about how aperture, shutter speed and ISO interact with each other, and this book really helped me understand how they work together and create different depths of field. He uses simple analogies to explain various topics like ISO, and through lots of pictures, he shows the effect of the different settings.He gives you exercises to try that help you better understand how each setting affects the outcome - this was a great way for me to actually see how aperture and shutter affect your images. He breaks up the book into separate areas (one on Aperture, one on Shutter, etc.) which helps you keep the information presented in an organized manner. Plus, once you master one section, you move on to the next building block.The other great thing for a beginner like me was to look at the photographs and learn how different focal lengths are used to achieve the various results - now I want to get a telephoto lens! He also has side boxes that describe various features that your camera may or may not have (Depth-Of-Field Preview, fixed lens, etc.) which, when applicable to my camera, helped me understand what these features were and how they should be used.The book has really spurred my interest in photography - I feel that in a very short time, I've learned to take some very creative pictures! To a beginner like me, this book was like taking a class in photography with exercises that actually further your understanding of exposure.UPDATE: I finished the book, and he gives you a lot of great tips on how to use ND filters, various types of lighting, exposures against the sky and green areas and tips on how to use gray cards to help with exposure. There's a lot of information presented which helps gives us beginners a direction to work with."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really cannot recommend this book enough. It's amazing! I learned so much from it including some unexpected but fun techniques in addition to the most important basic pieces of knowledge you need to handle a camera. Basically, it taught me what ISO is, which no other article, blog or book had done successfully. I had pretty much ruled out ISO as something that I didn't understand but had to keep low to avoid noise. But yeah, this is one of the many things explained, of course. :) I do think that a very, very simple understanding of photography may be wanted to follow this one like a breeze. It's a little bit more technical, which is great, and it's still totally accessible for anyone. You just might not follow as well if you know absolutely nothing about cameras. :) I also highly recommend Scott Kelby's digital photography books, they're even more accessible, but then again they don't give you quite as much understanding of your camera! Another plus is that the book itself is great, it's quite large and it's filled with beautiful photos by the author. One thing I found really great is that the aperture, shutter speed, ISO and focal length information are all marked up for every single photo in the book. It's great to see the techniques in action and really grow comfortable with all these settings and beginning to understand when to use what.So yeah, definitely recommend this book. It'll be completely worth your while. An absolute must if you are a beginner photographer. :)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book, it taught me about exposure theory and practice when it comes to photography. However with some caveats; a new edition is coming out so you might wait to check it out. this book as more oriented for analog cameras with spot metering while this is great as it was an important step in the evolution of photography, most if not all dSLRs have a very complicated matrix systems now that bypasses some of the tips and tricks in this book. However knowing the theory will probably enhance your understanding for exposure which is what this book is all about.

I picked it back up, and it IS helping me understand photography basics (I'm a newbie). I'm not always able to follow what he is saying without doing other research - he speaks in \\"photographer lingo\\" as if he's talking to someone who already has a solid grasp of the basics.

This book will help you do that. You'll understand the basic principles of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, type of lighting, field of depth, and so on, which will empower you to make good (if not creative) exposures (or photos) with your SLR--digital or film.I found this book very informative and exactly what I needed to know on the \\"HOW TO\\" of photography.

I have done some professional work and a lot of personal work. The best photographs I have taken are deliberate pictures where I have focused on perfect exposure. Exposure is broken down into two aspects, iris and shutter. For many, particularly novices, it is difficult to know to understand how to leverage the power of proper exposure. Understanding Exposure, the book by Bryan Peterson, dispels the mystery of shutter speed and iris. This book puts you in control over your camera. With the principles taught in this book, you can quickly go from photo luckout artist to photographer.Bryan teaches everything you need to know in order to take pictures on your terms. One of the most exciting aspects of Understanding Exposure is Bryan's photo samples. The book is full of pictures taken by Bryon himself. He lists his aperture and shutter settings for each photograph next to the images. This in itself is a wealth of knowledge.If you hope to consistently take excellent pictures, you must understand how exposure works.

Bryan really does a great job outlining how, why and when to use Aperture, Shutter or Manual mode. As you read through the book you will want your camera close at hand because you can't help but want to test your ability to create a similar exposure as his example.The biggest \\"lesson\\" I learned reading this book was metering. Metering is the secret to getting consistently exposed pictures and Bryan gives you great tips on how to do this consistently. Bryan believes that you should get the exposure correct in camera, a philosophy I share, with little post production work to be done in Photoshop. Not that Photoshop isn't a fantastic tool but getting the \\"creatively correct\\" exposure in camera with proper technic is what he preaches. Life should be spent behind the camera not in front of the computer.Last but not least was the overview of filters. Which ones to use and when. More good stuff here that you can certainly apply to your everyday photography.In summary, it's really a fantastic book. I read it and used it like it was a \\"Photography Class in a book\\". I read a chapter with my camera along side to see if I can take a \\"creatively correct exposure\\"."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book, though a little on the expensive side, provides excellent examples and explications of the tools and techniques of photography. If you are brand new to the field of creative photography, or you are looking to improve your creativity by really understanding the technical aspects of your camera, this is an excellent book. Bear in mind, however, it is a little difficult to absorb in a singular reading, as it may take a while to digest the material. Specifically, the allegory the author employs to explain the relationship of aperture, film speed, and shutter speed is the best I have encountered.An excellent book, and certainly worth the money."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"For both beginner and early-intermediate photographers, this book explains the mechanical operations of the camera and tells the reader HOW those operations affect the outcome of their pictures.With practical advice and hands-on practice lessons, Bryan really helps his readers take the next step in true photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have found this book informative, but not educational. It is not a beginners book, if I hadn't readDigital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))first I would have been lost.I rated the book 3 out of 5 stars, because as a novice I found much of the text a little too advanced for my limited grasp of exposure settings. I think this book is really designed for light hobbyists ready to take the next step, not for true beginners. So I may not be the target demographic for the book.It's not all bad though, even a novice can gain from this book. The book is set up in a way that there is a picture on each page displaying the concept that is being discussed. Now often the main discussion wasn't of much use to me but the pictures are incredibly valuable for 2 reasons:1. Every shot has the type of lens, f-stop, and shutter speed that was used. This helps you begin to understand the different relationships even if your not fully grasping the concepts.2. This information becomes very value though when two photographs of the same object/landscape are shown side-by-side with only small changes in one of the three variables (lens, f-stop, shutter speed). Even with my very limited understanding I found these side-by-side comparisons very valuable in understanding the effects aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings can have on the end result of a photo.***Bottom lining it, if you're looking to take the next step this is probably a useful book. If you're a novice, I would avoid this book unless you understand that you will need to re-read this book several times to really benefit from it.I'm not throwing this book away, I'm just waiting to gain enough experience that it can really start to make sense."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Although this book may at first be intimidating for someone who has never handled a SLR Camera, it is actually a thorough beginner's book. It is not overly &quot;technical&quot;, although any book on exposure will be full of numbers when talking of aperture, shutter speeds, ISO settings, etc. Once you begin to get a grasp of these concepts, the reading is easy and enlightening. (no pun intended)For those with a little experience, this book will clear up many of the exposure mysteries that you may have faced. I think it is a &quot;must read&quot; for beginner to intermediate shutterbugs."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Well, I never expected to write a review, but I did because this book is what I was looking for. I've been using camera for decades now, but I was mainly point-and-shoot photographer. Yes, everybody liked my pictures but I really did not know how to be consistent in the results. So I got myself a new Nikon D80 and undertook to learn how to take pictures with full control over the process. I browsed through Amazon in search of \\"become a concious photographer book for dummies\\" and I ended up buying this book and Ansel Adams's \\"Camera\\".This book has everything you need to move from amateur to prosumer photographer. It expalains what is exposure and light and how you can control it. It gives you hints on metering and some basic special techniques. What is very important is that it gives you plenty of color pictures with short stories on how they were taken and data on exposure parameters so you can check how they impact the final result.So get this one if you would like to buy one book which would allow you to undersatnd how to take beautiful and creative pictures! I guess that when you finally get it and read it you will be hungry for more information.

I ordy complete almost 10 years since i start learning photography, i read many books about that also i took a course through New york institute of photography, but this book no no no. Mr Bryan with highly respect to him, he must review himself before write another book..again i'll say sorry but this the truth what i feel."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The publication is very well illustrated, with many practical exemples, the text is cleared and concise. It should be recommended for all ages."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I ordered this book after a couple of years of being a serious amateur photographer. I can say that many of the lessons regarding exposure that I have learned the hard way over the last couple of years would've come much easier if I had read this book back then.To the book review -- The book focuses on three concepts and their inter-relationship of the concepts to come together and form an exposure:1) Aperture2) Shutter Speed3) ISOThe author is clearly extremely knowledgeable and has mastery of photography to where he can explain all of these concepts in very easy to understand terms. The book also has a very sincere and down to earth \\"feel\\" to it. It's almost like I can hear the author is sitting next to me and explaining the concepts.The book also helps the reader understand what he calls the \\"creatively correct\\" exposure. That is to say, the right combination of ISO, Shutter and Aperture to get the \\"best\\" picture.There are tons of full color examples in the book that illustrate what the author is trying to convey complete with shutter speeds, aperture, lens, film type etc --- very helpful.Back to me for a bit and how the book helped me after 2 years...In the last few years, I've progressed from using shooting in full automatic to shooting in Aperture Priority and in Shutter Priority. That is to say, semi-manual as I like to call it and I thought that's all I needed. Through it all, I stayed away from full manual mode.After reading this book, I'm shooting most of my shots in full Manual mode and am considering getting a light meter. It wasn't so much that I didn't know, its that the book reinforced the concepts I've learned along the way to where I've made the leap to full Manual mode.I still use full auto, aperture priority, and shutter priority but I find myself in full manual more of the time. So even after a few years of shooting -- (1 hour total shooting time by the author's measure), this book was still helpful to me......but I would've gotten here two years sooner if I had read this book back then. Mind you, I have no formal training in photography. I just got into it several years ago for a variety of reasons including avoiding royalty fees for pictures I needed for business presentations.I must say I didn't read the book cover to cover but used it as a reference -- skipping around until I had gotten it all.This is what I recommend:1) If you're a novice photographer and want to learn how to shoot good exposures, this book will help.2) If you're a semi serious amateur and haven't made the leap to full manual, this book will help you make the leap.3) If you already know all of this but don't shoot very often, get this book and use it as a reference.It's the easiest to understand book on exposure I have read to date mainly because it has enough full color examples combined with solid writing to help you learn."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I was a little stingy with my rating, because, to be honest, i was disappointed. If you understand the basics of film speed, shutter speed & aperture (he calls it \\"the triangle\\") there is little to gain from this book. If you are a complete beginner, please change that rating to 3 stars.About the only thing i found slightly interesting in this book was the discussion about depth of field, but this was nothing new to me either.The GLARING DEFICIENCY in this book is a total failure to discuss anything about the use of flash or artificial light. If you have even heard the phrase \\"fill flash\\" you will be disappointed with this book. This book covers natural light ONLY!Henderson (below) is right.... is that it??"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this thinking it would have a lot of in depth information about exposure. However I went through the book within 30 minutes and did not find anything new or quite interesting. It's a very basic book in understanding the importance of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture and how they work together. Not really much past that. I would definitely recommend this to beginner's, but if you want to save a few bucks you can learn all the information provided in this book via online resources, just use your favorite search engine ;)Was also kind of upset that they mentioned anything about digital cameras seeing as how there was maybe 4 pages at the end of the book that talked about irrelevant fluff."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in understanding the selection of good exposure to achieve artistic effects with my photography. I like Peterson's differentiation between \\"creative exposure\\" and \\"correct exposure,\\" and found his tips for deciding what you wanted to emphasize in a photo helpful.I also read the Grimm Basic Book of Photography at the same time, and although that book is *much* denser and longer, learned less about composing a photograph and selecting exposure while reading it. Peterson's many colorful comparisons helped me understand his methods and reasons for choosing his exposure.This book is a quick read, and is the opposite of the Grimm book in terms of depth of discussion of equipment and history (if you want to learn details about different film grains and all of the pieces of equipment you might want to buy for your portrait studio, by all means, get their book instead). However, for a very concise book with great examples on SLR photographic composition, I can't ask for much more.A final word for digital photographers. This book touches little on specific differences between digital and film photography, but does not ignore digital. Peterson makes a good point that digital retouching can fix a lot of mistakes, but that good composition and exposure saves a lot of time later, whether you're using film or digital. I have to say, though, I'm still looking for the book that will explain in-depth how to properly select white balance for digital SLR."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a reasonably good introduction to exposure for the absolute beginner. If you've had an introductory photography class or equivalent experience, much of what is written in this book will be very basic and redundant. (There's actually very little text in this book - you could read the whole thing in a couple hours or less.) Note that Peterson is exclusively a color photographer, so any kind of discussion of black and white tonality and contrast is totally missing. The book covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, and different lighting conditions (though it lacks specifics on how to shoot in these different lighting conditions), plus a little bit on multiple exposures and polarizing and neutral-density filters.A more thorough introduction to zone system concepts than this book provides would be useful. For that, I'd recommend reading \\"The Confused Photographer's Guide to On-Camera Spotmetering\\" by Bahman Farzad (which errs in the opposite direction, running these concepts into the ground) along with this book. If these two books were combined and a happy medium was found between Peterson's brevity and Farzad's beating to death of simple concepts, you'd actually have one solid introductory book on exposure.Other drawbacks - Peterson is mainly a stock/magazine photographer and his photographic style is, to my eyes anyway, rather boring, and I found little inspiration in looking at his photos. Also, his writing style is rather goofy, with lots of exclamations over less than profound photographic insights and silly terms for substitute reading methods like \\"The Sky Brothers\\" (various kinds of skies when used for exposure) or \\"Mr Green Jeans\\" (vegetation used for exposure).In the end, I picked up a few useful tidbits from this book, but turned around and resold the book right after reading it, as it really wasn't valuable as a reference."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"As a serious hobbyist with no formal training, I was a bit concerned about how much I could really learn from this book. My experience comes primarily from reading text books, how to books, and from hands on experience. Prior to reading this book I had a basic understanding of exposure already.Exposure is a concern for both film and digital cameras alike. A chapter titled \\"Film vs. Digital\\" helps to explain some of the differences. There are many inspiring color images showing both how your camera's metering is fooled, and the methods of correcting the exposure. Topics include filter options and exposing for low light, backlit, overcast weather and motion photography.After reading \\"Understanding Exposure\\" from cover to cover I can say without doubt reading this book changed the way I comprehend exposure. Bryan Peterson has a simple and clear method of explaining exposure. I didn't really learn as much as I gained a deeper understanding and a fresh perspective of the subject. I also learned a few tricks along the way.If you have mastered the subject, this book is not for you. However, if you are a beginner with no understanding of how aperture, shutter speed and ISO work together, get this easy to understand book. If you already have a basic understanding, this book will help fill in the missing pieces."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a reasonably good introduction to exposure for the neophyte, unless you've had an introductory photography class or equivalent experience, because much of what is written in this book will be very basic and redundant. Note that Peterson is exclusively a color photographer, so any kind of discussion of black and white tonality and contrast is totally missing. The book covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, and different lighting conditions (though it lacks specifics on how to shoot in these different lighting conditions), plus a little bit on multiple exposures and polarizing and neutral-density filters.This book is better than the previous edition, and expands on some of the topics that were only briefly touched on in the first book. One in particular that sticks out in my mind is that he explains the \\"don't care\\" apertures of F8 and F11 that he uses often. The old book mentioned it in passing, but I don't recall an explanation on why those apertures were useful. There is a short section on just that in this book and suggestions on when to use them.It is best used not as a guidebook on how to set the various exposure modes on your advanced SLR camera, nor how to set up a state-of-the-art studio with fancy lights. It discusses how to make *creative* exposures (not just technically correct ones) in natural lighting situations. I do wish the author had presented some clearer explanation on certain technical aspects, e.g., how to preset focus and how to get teh most out of a light meter, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it's a book that helps you think about how to create a photograph, not how to use every feature of your camera.Full color photos are used throughout, and are a great help in understanding the concepts that he talks about. Each picture has a caption with the information used to take the exposure. He shows you the same picture with different settings so you can see the effects the settings have on the exposure.This is all about how to capture the image, not processing of the image after it is captured. There is brief mention of pushing or pulling film and the effects it can create, but in general, this is about how to get take a proper picture. If you are looking for a book on how to process the picture after you have taken it, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I wanted a book that would teach me how to set up my camera to take great pictures. This book answered my questions and also taught me how to think about each shot, what to look for and consider when setting up my camera to take a good exposure. Bryan has an easy to understand way of explaining his thoughts behind his methods and also tells you the settings for each shot shown in the book. I read this book in less than 2 days and will now go back through again to make myself a little \\"cheat sheet\\" to carry with me for those rare situations. He covers a lot of ground and I found myself absorbing it all very easily. I only wish it came with a pocket guide. Unless you are a seasoned pro, I believe you will gain a lot from this book. I know I have.Thank you Bryan.Carlton"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson's \\"Understanding Exposure\\" is a book geared toward beginners, as it talks about topics (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) that any advanced photographer would deem \\"mundane.\\"However, the book is best used not as a guidebook on how to set the various exposure modes on your advanced SLR camera, nor how to set up a state-of-the-art studio with fancy lights.

Each photo is well captioned about the context, his thought process, and his technique. Again, this is not a \\"read and memorize the f-stop\\" kind of thing. It's all about provoking ideas, and Peterson includes a lot of exercises (some more useful than others).I've been an advanced beginner for almost 20 years, and my photography has not improved much. I hope this book can help me get over the hurdle and take better pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book has got an average rating of 4.5 stars, and is supposedly a good book on exposure. For this reason I checked out one from the public library once it became available. On the same day I spent a few hours going through the book--I could do this because I am already familiar with such concepts like aperture, depth of field etc. At the end, the conclusion, a disappointing one, that I formed in my mind is that, this is just a mediocre photography book, and in certain ways it is even misleading!The thing that I care about most, and that I am most confused with, is exposure compensation. The reason, which I learned from John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide, is that in the world around us objects are of various tonality, and your camera metering system tend to render everything as middle-toned gray. In this book, however, you won't find the term \\"exposure compensation\\" at all in the first three chapters (this book has six chapters), not even any similar or equivalent terms, leading one to believe that all you need to do is point your camera to your subject, take the metering reading, ajust aperture or shutter speed and shoot. Unfortunately, to make good photographs you have to do more. That's why I am still learning.You might see a hint of \\"exposure compensation\\" in Chapter 4 if you are an alerted reader. Even here the discussion is very limited, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"What a great book! This guide gave me the confidence to switch off of Auto and really put my camera through the paces. Great insight, pretty easy explanations, and beautiful pictures.My only 2 negatives, and neither were promised, so they don't count against the rating:1. Written (even in the revised version) heavily leaning to film photographers. Not to say there isn't a lot of commentary on pros and cons of digital, and some specific advice pertaining to them, but you'd be even happier with the book if you were shooting on a 20-year-old Nikon.2. No commentary or advice on the use of flash. Not expecting a comprehensive guide (because there can be a lot to it), but some basic pointers would have been good.Overall, well worth the time and money.Off to shoot..."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I'm glad this is the first \\"how to\\" book on photography that I purchased. It provides in clear words the effect your shutter speed and aperture have on obtaining the correct exposure. It also explains in an easy to understand manner why a photographer would occasionally want to go with different settings for a more creative exposure. Also it has great photos to help explain how the different settings will help you obtain similar types of work. I would highly recommend this book as a good starting point for beginning photographers. It should provide a good basic understanding of how cameras work before moving on to more advanced books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book and a must read, at least for the beginning photographer.

There are many examples of situations similar to the ones that gave me fits and I was able to dramatically improve my photography in low light, landscape with infinate depth of field, and many other situations.

Some parts of it are kind of technical for newbies (like me), but after taking the book outside with me and practising with my camera and the book at my side, it began to make sense.

It is not technical based but a stimulus for creativity."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I already had a book on composition by Bryan Peterson and I was so engaged by his informative yet simple style that I was looking for something else from him. The photographs in the exposure book I find stimulating and very relevant and I want to grab the camera and try to imitate what I see. However whilst the visual impact is significant it isn't what its all about. Many photographic books have super photos but I find quite a few leave me under-whelmed as the text lets them down. Bryan makes a story of it so you devour the text and want more.The structure is important and Bryan excels at making the \\"story\\" both logical and fun and also balances well the data and the context and then completes the 'picture' with the just the right focus on the compositonal aspects."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am new to DSLR, having only owned point and shoots in the past.

It also give the reader some neat ideas if they are naturally creative so they begin to see things in a different, more creative way.For advanced photographers this would simply be a survey of basic techniques and is more written for the amateur -- which I am so the book was great. The author has good wit as well."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"... this should be it!I'm not going into a lengthy explanation of why I think this book is great - it just is. For a beginner, I couldn't recommend anything better.It explains everything you need to know about the 3 all-important controls - aperture, shutter speed and ISO, and he also explains some very useful rules of thumb which I still use to date!It does not go into much about composition or framing, but that was not the intent of the book. He does have other books for that (Learning to see creatively etc.) but I can't recommend those as much as this one. Taking good pictures comes with a lot of practice and/or luck. Flickr is your best resource for inspiration!Good luck!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Don't waste time and money reading book after book looking for \\"recipes\\" for good pictures.

There is a way and this book teaches the path."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is amazing. It's the only book I've read that gives you a true UNDERSTANDING of what photography is.

Must have for anyone who has ever picked up a 35mm camera."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a good book on the basics of photography. It is not updated as well as it should be for digital photography. I was disappointed because I have similar books that are 20 years old. I was expecting some new revelations."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I found this book to be very helpful and easy to follow. The author gives a lot of great common metaphors for exposure processes, which I found to be perfect for the visual way that my mind works.

One day hope to shoot photos just as beautiful."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Before getting this book, I thought I understood exposure.

Some photography books have a tone like the reader is a complete moron, but this one does not. He talks about a point and then shows 3-4 example photographs, with specific comments on each. He gives you the technique clearly and succinctly, without lots of extraneous chatter.The book does not cover composition, the business of photography or studio lighting (this is not a criticism: I don't think it should, just an FYI).Lots of pictures, so if you don't want to read cover-to cover you can flip through and when you see something you don't know how to do stop and read about it.

Easy to understand, well explained, I learned a lot about photography in a simple but professional way.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It's an overall decent book with informative techniques and tips. The photos themselves are not spectacular, but they are not meant to impress and instead teach about the concepts. He does have a few very striking photos in the book which speaks about the author's creative talent. The book is slightly ruined by his elaboration on how much money he made off certain photos, and uncomfortable descriptives about his wife. Also, he overuses the term \\"who cares\\" aperture. I know it sounds cool and irreverent to say \\"who cares\\" but since the \\"who cares\\" aperture seems to have been used quite frequently, I'd say it is an aperture to care about. To be fair, he has a whole column on the f8 to f11 aperture which completely makes sense. The author also writes about little tricks (making fake rain) and mention very helpful tips (the brother skies). Coupled with his photographic examples, the author is successful in conveying his message."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is for beginners.

I highly recommend this to all beginners."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book already has plenty of reviews, so I won't go into detail as to what makes it a very good book. Being an amateur photographer, not really that interested in buying a tripod, a converter, filters, not to mention an expensive SLR, I was a little sad to see that some advice in the book was not for me (the author readily acknowledges when it is the case). It particularly concerns the latter third or so of the book. Mostly, it's the special effects and very tricky exposures.But a lot of what he has to say does work for both film and digital, and for point-and-shoot as well as SLR. I was particularly grateful for 1 page on how SLR apertures compare to the fixed zoom lens ones, of all the things I read before, none seemed to mention the difference. A couple of more smaller bits of advice on digital and fixed-lens versus film and SLR were \\"aha!\\" moments for me as well."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book contains the absolutely basics of photography. The basics would fit into 5 pages. The rest is just pretty pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was once a very good introduction to exposure for beginners. Alas the years go by and the book is seriously out of date. The concepts are still correct and somewhat useful. However, the book was written before the advent of serious digital cameras and before Photoshop and other programs were available to improve images. I think that if one looks at the dates of all the glowing reviews, you would see that they were written some time ago. I would look for a more up to date discussion of exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in helping me to understand the subject better.

It explains all the aspects of exposure in a very easy to understand way. It shows a lot of beautiful photographs and explains how they were taken.So happy I bought this book"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan has obviously written a good book explaining the fundamentals of exposure and spent more time explaining the holy trinity of photography (ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed) and how varying them impacts the photograph. The book is also full of educative pictures. This is the biggest strength of this book.Bryan does not come across as a great teacher like John Shaw comes across. The book also falls short (for me personally) on the metering techniques. There is very little space devoted for Spot, Matrix/Evaluative or Center Weighted Metering in the book and the pros and cons of each method. It also does not cover in detail the pros and cons of using an external meter.Overall a good read but I don't recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Based on the positive reviews, I purchased Bryan Petersons, Understanding Exposure and The Photographer's Eye: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photos by Michael Freeman at the same time.While both are good, Understanding Exposure is much easier to follow. The later is more dry and text bookish; however, it goes deeper into how to develop good shooting skills, not just explaining how exposure works. I recommend both.This book will take you through the basics of how aperture, shutter speed, and film speed work together. Apertures are split into groups, and explanations given for conditions that are best for each group.It points out differences between fixed lens digital cameras and digital SLRs; Such as, why there's a difference in depth of field when I used an f/2.4 on a fixed lens and an f/2.4 on an SLR. Advantages and disadvantages for both, when it comes to aperture, were enlightening.Tips are provided for most accurate light metering, filter use, and freezing or slowing motion, to name a few. Exercises are provided so you can experience for yourself what the author is describing.Although this book doesn't \\"need\\" another five star review, I'm giving it one anyway, because I definitely thought it was money well spent."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a good book for understanding exposure, very detail-oriented. But for me, it's a little bit too technical.

The chapters are well arranged and easy to read. You will not regret buying this one!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I understood what shutter speed, aperature and ISO did but I never grasped how the three worked together until I got just a few pages into this book. Just that alone was worth the money for me - he explained it so simply! I have read other books and articles but they only talked about what settings they used not how the settings worked together.We recently took a trip to New York City and although I didn't take a tripod I got some great photos both day and night. Not professional quality yet but the best I have ever taken and more importantly, out of 500+ shots I only took a couple on auto mode!Great book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"One of the most common misconceptions around is that by buying the most recent and most hitech photography gear one can come up with extra-ordinary exposures.This book has showed me otherwise. Too often amateurs like me get caught up with the jargon that we simply avoid doing manual shots for fear of missing those magical moments thus we end up doing machine-gun shooting.Fortunately I bought this book and re-learned the basics properly. At least now I know the fundamentals and have the confidence to experiment further.The book is very down to earth unlike other photography books who put too much emphasis on the author's ego and style. It starts off with explaining what is what and then proceeds to the different shooting scenarios.Even now that I've advanced a bit, I still end up going back to some specific chapter to re-read a page or two to explain why a scene is what it is."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this book after knowing quite a bit about my SLR digital camera, such as how to change the settings, and knowledge of what ISO, shutter speed, focal length and ASO are. This book was AMAZING. I learned so much within the first few chapters that I was ready to head outside and try them out, and they worked just like Scott said they would. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to sharpen their skills and take it to the next level. I will be buying his other books as well."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"When I first bought this book as an absolute beginner to photography (I didn't know the meaning of basic exposure terms, camera and lens features etc.) I couldn't get thru the book. I kept reading about photography from the internet and other books and six months later I gave the book another try. This time I breezed thru the book and found it gave me a very practical framework for putting together all of the info on exposure I had learned in the past six months.I know experts can find fault with the content but the value of this book is in its teaching effectiveness. The book does a five star job of teaching its main subject -ISO, aperture and shutter speed. The effectiveness does depend on your skill level. This book maybe too challenging for an absolute beginner and too basic for more advanced photographers but if your skills are somewhere in between you will probably find it very useful.This book is a keeper. I highly recommend it. It is one of my most valuable learning resources."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Its a great book with an easy to follow way of explaining. Great photos taken by Bryan PETERSON.He starts of by saying that the photos in the book have been taken with a low budget DSLR so by this way you can understand that you also can take these kinds of photos if you really wanted.All photos in the book have an info bar below it giving you the information about which settings were used to take that particular shot.I don have a camera yet and although I dont I had great time reading this book.Go for it with no hesitation!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A great book.

It's easy to read, it's not overwhelming (like some \\"technique\\" books can be), it's well-organized and, most importantly, it's easy to understand.This probably isn't the book for more experienced photographers -- it's pretty basic in its explanations of the elements of exposure. But, if you're like me and are basically just having fun teaching yourself photography and growing in your hobby, then this is a great book for your collection."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is well written and easy to understand.

I expected a lot of information in this book and hints on how I could best use certain camera settings in certain situations.

The writer makes some errors in what aperture he used and he makes some very strange analogies to explain things. He compares ISO values with bees carrying waterbuckets.. what the...!?I'm also not very sure for whom this book is written. It's definitely not for the pro, and as a matter of fact I believe that beginners will only get confused by reading this book. I think I'll sell it as soon as I can."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I took 2 semesters of photographic classes when I was in the college and I have the dark room experience with B&W films. I wish I have kept learning photography as I stopped after I was done with college. This book helped me get back into photography. With this book, i have better understanding on how exposure, f-stop, and aperture work. After reading this book, I realized I only had a very basic knowledge on this even when I was learning photography when I was in college. It is good that I found this book and purchased it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is great to get a handle on exposure, aperture and shutter speed. Bryan does a great job showing which which photos are better aesthetically even though they are all correctly exposed."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is the best book in my photo-library to this day. Bryan Peterson covers all the main subjects and then some. The tone is professional and still relaxed.I can only recomend this book"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is filled with very useful information, and while many technical issues are discussed, I found it surprisingly easy to follow. The author's writing style is great, and the book was a pretty quick read (though i'm sure i'll be reading it again!). The book is filled cover to cover with beautiful color photographs serving as examples of the material being discussed. Using some of the concepts I've learned, I'm already noticing differences in my photographs! My excitement just earned Amazon nearly $700 for a new lens. Its not a cheap hobby.For any amateurs, serious hobbyists, or really anyone wanting to know more about photography, you can't miss with this book. The one thing I will warn about is that while you can apply the lessons learned in this book with a point and shoot camera, you'll probably get more out of it if you have an SLR camera; film or digital is fine, the book isn't terribly biased either way."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I like Bryan Peterson's presentation style. He presents information on a subject. Then he shows one or more photos that depict how he used the information. I find that I am using my digital slr more effectively as a result of his instructions.Bill Brennan"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great book. A must for people interested in developing skills in the SLR arena. A good place to start for a noice enthusiast!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan rocks !Very easy to understand exposure settings for common situationsand for capturing 'take your breath away' images like sunrise, sunset, in the woods etc.I have learnt quite a bit - have shot a few roles and sent themfor processing. Will wait and see if I've been able to translate on film what I read in the book :-)All in all, a great read !"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Excellent book. I have been shooting with a DSLR for a year+ and before that with P&S; for many years.What the author says is very true - I was focusing on getting a correct shot, not a creatively correct shot. Very simple techniques laid out with necessary caveats. The rule of 7 options is very insightful and easy to work with.Overall, the book is a collection of many good techniques I had fleetingly heard about, but never knew the background of. With this book, I now know where I need to change.Very good book....."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Although it doesn't go quite deep enough into the topic, this is an excellent starter book for those who want to understand how cameras form images. Beginners will find it clearly written and quite helpful."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Due to my budget (or lack of) I have a habit of going to Borders and buying books and then returning them after I've read them. Yes - I know - terrible - so save me the comments...but I couldn't return this book. It is that good. I have been taking pictures for years and fumbling at the hard to get pictures. He explains how (and where) to meter with your camera to get the best results. It has fueled my passion to go out and try those shots that I never quite understood before from other books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is well written and easy to understand. Unless you are a very seasoned pro, I highly recomend it. It contains some invaluable tidbits of info. and is well worth the money. I loan my copy to anyone that ask me about a question about exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was a very informational book for someone learning about ISO, aperature and shutter speed. I had a little knowledge on the subject, this book made things much clearer. Written in a way that was easy to understand and then apply to photography. Great for the beginner, but probably too basic for the more experienced photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book. Covers how to put together a perfect exposure very well. Are you tired of always struggling becuase there just wasn't enough light in that shot? You just had a bit too much blur then you wanted? You just don't understand how shutter speed, film speed and aperature work together and which one should be modified for this particular shot? Then read this book and have fun shooting in manual mode from now on and stop hoping that auto mode will get the picture right. :)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was a very informational book and I learned from it, but the photos are of horrible print quality due to a poor selection in publishing."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I had read a couple of other books on digital photography, although they were not specific to \\"exposure\\", but have to say that this book goes above and beyond those others (but they were good in their own rights). Bryan Peterson does an unbelievable job explaining the difference between a \\"correct\\" exposure and an \\"artistically correct\\" exposure. He gives you examples of what not to do, in addition to how to correct the problems - and doesn't just put perfect picures in the book to say \\"look how good I am\\". He breaks the different parts of exposure down so that even the beginning photographer - whether you wish to be a pro or not - can understand the different aspects of exposure. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble understanding exposure or wants to be a better photographer. Very well done, Mr. Peterson!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great book clearly illustrating basic exposure principles. Explains clearly and illustrates with images all of the major aspects of exposure. A must read for any beginning photographer wanting to understand exposure (whether shooting film or digital--I shoot digital only), and a good brush up for intermediate photographers."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you are clueless in photography (SLR) and wants to learn the basic, this is the first book that you need to read!Very detailed and informative. Easy to understand for the average persons.Highly recommended.CheersArnold"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"At first glance I was disappointed with this book because I opened it up and saw a bunch of pretty photos. I thought I had bought a picture book with no real value of teaching me how to take great photographs.Since I had it I decided to read it. I have learned so much! If you read the text and then read the description in the photos you can learn so much on fine tuning your photography.I consider myself a novice photographer who, admittedly, takes more photos of the family than anything else. Nonetheless, my pictures have improved immensely under the suggestions of Bryan Peterson. I've even gotten creative and tried nature shots.Don't underestimate this book like I suspect many have with a quick flip of the pages. It has excellent advice and is wonderful."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Wow I love this book because the author just really broke the terminology down to its simplest form. I started film photography class in college and was kind of lost but after I found this book I have to say that I am really excited about photography now. My camera is a Nikon N80 and shooting photography with it is awesome. I am definitely going to purchase Mr. Peterson's other books as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an idea about the point and shoot concept but if you are looking to take your photographs further then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is an excellent source for anyone wanting to get into Photography or already into it! The book breaks down the basics which enables you to understand how it all works together.The best part of it, is the fact the author sends the reader into practice runs in order to solidify what has just been explained.A must have for anyone!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Peterson takes the reader step-by-step through the range of topics in understanding how to obtain the correct exposure for almost every conceivable circumstance. Plain, simple descriptions and explanations make this book easy and pleasurable to read. I enjoyed it and learned plenty in the process. One of the best photography books I've seen."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I had been happy with the pictures I had taken for awhile with a dSLR camera, but I felt like I wanted more. Everyone seemed to recommend Understanding Exposure so I bought it and now I understand its incredible popularity. The explanations are clear and concise and so in-depth. I can see a noticeable difference between the photos I took six months ago and the ones I take now.I feel like I see differently and approach photo opportunities differently and it's because Bryan Peterson taught me how to change up the way things look by playing with exposure.Two nice perks of the book are that a) he writes in such a way that you feel like you're listening to a friend explain and break it down - it's technically descriptive but he writes it in a conversational way, and b) the photos included in the book are just stunning. One would hope that photos in a photography book would be impressive but his work is just beyond incredible.If you're ready for the next level, I absolutely recommend picking this book up - you WILL see a difference."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It a great guide to improve your pictures. I highly recommend it. It is also full of examples you can use to practice all techniques."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"There are so many reviews for this book, but I will say that some of the lower ratings have points, but it is really subjective. This is great resource for photogs that have some slr,dslr experience and don't need the detailed technical descriptions. The author inspires one to get out and try his techniques which will bring you to find your own and get comfortable with manual mode. Anyone can get the correct exposure, but as Bryan points out there is the correct creative exposure and I find this inspiring and important if you want to make truly unique photos. Some people love the techno speek and really need that, but others of us become glazed over and want to just get to work. He is a visual describer and not technical. True, it is more based on film but is also applicable for Digital. You just need to get out there and shoot! There is no limit with digital."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Beautiful pictures, great tips & trick. I have this to accompany the Scott Kelby books Digital Photography Vol 1 & 2. I recommend all of them"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a very informative book with loads of information for beginners as well as seasoned photographers. I found it very understandable and would highly recommend it for anyone trying to make sense of exposure settings on your camera and how they work; both digital and film types."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you're looking a book to begin with in photography, this is it. I understand this is probably quite shallow for experienced photographers, but I also understand it's not the book's aim to teach *them* something. This is a book for people who are going from point-and-shoot to SLRs and wish to explore the potential -- but actually *teaching* them something, not just providing hints without explaining the why's. As such, I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is fantastic! I already had solid knowledge and understanding of photography before purchasing this book and I must admit, this book is really great! Not only does it look at the technical aspects of making a correct exposure, it also gives you same more creative ways to look at taking various shots. A must have for any enthusiast photographer!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Fantastic book; easy to read and understand whether you are just starting out or have been shooting for a while. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is another gem from master photographer Bryan Peterson. His no-nonsense approach to the variables that make up exposure will surely help anyone who feels (as I did) fairly intimidated by the subject. With great explanations and excellent photos, he shows what can be done when the photographer takes the time to decide what kind of photo is wanted, and then manipulate the variables to get it. Great book, and a permanent addition to my photo library."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a great primer to get you started understanding how exposure effects your photographs and how to take more control over your photos and make them more interesting."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Well written, concise overview of the most important concept of photography...\\"proper exposure\\" and how to \\"get there\\" !"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book based on recommendations from a photographic web site, I am on my second reading, it is a must buy for persons who want to know more about why your pictures are the way they are, the good and the bad. With knowledge and understanding, comes the power to improve and perfect your shots. The book is easily read, not too technical, and the photo's provide visual evidence of whats being discussed.A must buy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a Must Read for anyone interested in improving their photography skills. I purchased this book for my assistant and have read it myself many times. If you are looking for an easy to read and informative maual on the basics, this is the book for you.The photos in the book are beautiful, and the tips are great.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The author gives a clear explanation of the importance of different exposure combinations to provide different artistic results. It's fairly basic, but it is a good review with photos that do reflect the text.He uses the term \\"Who Cares\\" aperture for F8 and F11. His explanation of when to use those apertures is fine, but the term is silly, given that the whole book concentrates on how important making a conscious choice about aperture is."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I highly recommend this book, it was well written and explained photography in a easy to understand format."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great advice in simple terms! For the absolute beginner like myself, this book will make you use more of the features of your camera you've never used before, and look at the \\"everyday\\" exposure settings in a new way (the way photographers do, I suppose!). Furthermore, the book is filled with big, full colour photos by the author, which is very inspiring - he is truly an excellent photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a really good book if you want to get off automatic modes and start being more creative with your photography. Packed full of easy to read information and step by step guides."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I would highly recommend this book. It is great for beginners and helpful for professionals (although I'm sure most professionals have read something like this already.) It explains Exposure and the recommended general settings for specific situations in a language that is very easy to understand -- not too technical, more practical. And it does give you a brief overview of the technical aspects of Exposure, as well."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I found this book to be very helpful and understandable. I liked how he would explain something and then say \\"now go do this with your camera\\". After reading this book I now shoot almost exclusively in Manual mode and feel confident doing it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Being a home schooling mom, I am the type of person who knows how to use metaphors to explain things. They can make even the most complex of situations easier to understand and apply. That is what made this book so easy to follow and understand.Simply written without being elementary, this book is great for beginning photographers and beyond!The sample photos throughout the book are extremely helfpul in showing several techniques, and the step by step directions for applying those techniques are clear and complete.Anyone struggling with the \\"technical\\" side of photography would not go wrong with this book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"On the upside, I learned a few useful practical techniques from this book. Peterson's advice about how to get good exposures in a variety of circumstances is generally good and straightforward. There are also some nice pictures, though in only a few cases does he provide comparisons between the same scene shot well and shot not-so-well.On the downside, I get the strong impression that Peterson is good at practical advice because he really isn't that good at theory. He explains several basic theoretical concepts, but often in very simplified and occasionally potentially misleading terms. On page 37, he writes that smaller apertures give better sharpness, but fails to mention that too small an aperture will actually lose sharpness due to diffraction. In fact, he never mentions diffraction at all throughout the book. One cannot help but wonder if he even knows about it.His idea that f/8 is a \\"don't care about depth of field\\" aperture, while f/4 is \\"shallow DOF\\" and f/11 is \\"deep DOF\\", isn't completely wrong by any means, but it is badly oversimplified. At very wide angles such as 20mm, for example, f/8 at a distance of 10 feet provides all the DOF you are likely to need, while at 250mm, f/8 at a distance of 20 feet will blur a distant background fairly well. Oversimplifications such as these -- giving advice that may be reasonable for a 50mm lens and common subject distances, but that is incorrect even for some of the photos printed in the book -- do not serve the reader well.There are also some factual mistakes in the book that seem very strange coming from a professional photographer and instructor. For example, on page 36, he writes that the aperture of a lens is formed by \\"six overlapping blades.\\" He reinforces this elsewhere by saying that when a lens is stopped down, the out-of-focus highlights (he never uses the common term \\"bokeh\\") are \\"hexagonal.\\" It seems impossible that he could have experience with more than a few different lenses, since while some lenses have six aperture blades and therefore give hexagonal bokeh, many others have five, seven, eight, or nine blades, yielding pentagonal, heptagonal, octagonal, or nonagonal bokeh. Some even have curved aperture blades to more closely approximate a circle. How can he not know this after all his years of working and teaching?In sum, this isn't a bad book, but it really isn't all that great either. It's an okay choice for the beginner who wants to get some good practical advice without drowning in theory, but anyone who really wants to understand the subject and isn't afraid of a more complex view of what is inherently a rather complex subject should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Whether you are new to photography or have been in the hobby for a number of years, this book will improve your abillity to take great pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Excellent book!

The seller was NOT. Book was supposed to be NEW. This book was NOT new and had lots of sticky goo on the front and back cover. The edges also looked liked they had been thummed through by my 2 year old. VERY dissapointed with this seller."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you bought a DSLR and dont know anything about photography, this would be OK. If you have been around photography awhile, don't waste your money. The author seems impressed that he could learn some basic concepts and pass them on - that is how the writting style comes across."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The item took a while to get here (3 wks) the USPS lost the first shipment but the seller contacted me early and often to make sure the one he re-sent got to me. It was a bit bent up when it got here but I doubt it was the seller's fault. Great seller, maybe not the best shipping method."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really liked this book when I got it from the library, which must have had an older version or printing. The book I received was about the size of a piece of paper. The photos aren't nearly as helpful when they're so small. It's a great book, but given that it's a photography book it's kind of waste to make it so small. Try to get an older, larger printing."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an outstanding book by Bryan Peterson. I consider it a must read item. It explains the art of photography in simple terms. I wish I had read it a lot sooner."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you are a beginner in photography and wants to go a step further, this is a very good book. It explains all there is about, exposure (aperture, speed, ISO,...).Simple, light and with lots of examples."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"i bought this book partially because many ppl recommended it. I have to say it was disappointing. The pictures were fantastic however the information was sparse. There's like 5-6 pages worth of information the rest of the few hundred pgs are fluff. There are other better books that will cover the info in this book and more."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It may have just been me, but the book seems really basic. If you are like me, you read for hours online about photography; you know Digital Photography Schools inside and out, and have read countless tutorials. I feel like paying for this book taught me little I did not already know by reading dps. It is good information but you should be warned not to buy it if you read online."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"No matter how complex and smart are today's cameras, this book should be read by anyone who wants to make creative photos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is excellent in the way that the lessons are exposed. Very easy to understand and apply. Very well done!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is an easy read with plentiful illustrations and good use of white space. its target is the amateur making the change from 'point and shoot' cameras using full automatic exposure to manual, thoughtful exposures. While it won't tell you how to shoot great exposures it will show you how to get proper exposures in many varied situations."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Well written with a lot of good examples. The author came off as some what cocky to me with his writing style but I guess he's allowed this since his photos appear very nice and pleasing. I especially enjoyed his segments where to point your camera for metering with your camera in different lighting conditions."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I found this book to be a terrific resource for understanding how to shoot better pictures. The author has an easy to understand writing style and includes lots of shot specific details so that you really feel like you were there. This is one of the best photography books that I have purchased. I'd buy it again without hesitation."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book with so much great information. The example pictures are wonderful and there are so many of them. This is a excellent book for new and intermediate photographers, it clears up some of the confusion on getting the right exposure with straight forward techniques. I like the light humor and witty explanations that the author uses. The only draw back I found is that the author doesn't show the exact focal point where he meters his shots. I would have liked more details, all in all this is a very good book and you won't have any regrets in picking up your own copy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is good, it tells you how to properly expose for different scenarios and effects but its explained too much. Its aimed for begginers so it can be a little boring for the ones that already know the basics. The pictures in the book look old and I didnt like that. Overall its a good book for learning from scratch or maybe catch a few extra tips that you may not already know as an intermediate photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book over a year ago and have since bought several more copies to give to my friends that are into photography. It is by far one of the best books out there for teaching ANYONE about correct exposures!! It's a very easy read, I have read it through at least three times, and this guy knows his stuff. There are so many beautiful full page color photos to demonstrate what he is talking about and he gives his settings for all the shots. If you are just starting out in photography, or have been into it for a while, I feel EVERYONE can learn something from this book. After reading this book, obtaining a 'proper exposure' in-camera clicked for me. I gained a thorough understanding of shutter speed, ISO, aperature/f-stop, light, composition, depth of field and many more very important aspects of photography, everything made sense, opened up new creative doors for me. I still don't always achieve the perfect exposure, but I do have complete control over my camera and settings, the whys and how-to-fors. If you can only afford ONE book, this is the one. I rarely do book reviews, but this one deserves it! I submitted some of my own photos above, using various techniques in photography, all learned from this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I was looking for more detail and a little less pictures. Not much instruction involved. Really don't understand any more about exposure. It does have some very nice pictures though."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really learned a lot from this book. I can already tell a difference in my photographs. I bought a Nikon D200 and hadn't had to use any manual settings for so long cause I was using all the auto settings on my old camera. After reading this book, all that stuff came flooding back to me and then some. I learned some neat tricks to getting the right exposure for tricky situations. I would reccomend this book for anyone that knows nothing about manual operations of a camera to someone that is experienced, maybe not pro, but experienced cause I picked up a lot of good info."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great book if you are just moving up to a SLR Camara. This book easilly explains how set your exposure manually and the advantages of doing so. My pictures quality has improved by 100%, and I'm having lots of fun with my camara."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great product which explains all the ins and outs of how to get the right exposure and more!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is one of the most useful books I own. The author is straightforward, engaging, and dead on about exposure. I wish I'd have found it years ago. Highly recommended. If you own it, you know what I mean. If you you take pictures and don't YET own it, - you should."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is very impressive and informative. The author writes in a clear manner and shows sample photographs with corresponding settings. For this subject, this book is as got as it gets. \\"Mastery starts from knowledge foot\\""},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"After reading this book, I feel much calmer and more focused about what I am doing both with the camera, and about whatever scene I am presented with in front of it.This book removes a lot of the 'clutter' that can run around inside ones head while planning how to shoot a scene. By catagorizing certain shooting opportunities into a logical series of decisions that simplify the technical side, not only do you get the image you want, but it allows you to imagine the same scene in a variety of ways.The night photography section posed more questions than it provided answers for me, but on the whole, as a foundation for understanding exposure and getting you mind on the right track from the start, this book is very good indeed."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've been pouring through photography books for the past few months and so far, this one has provided the best rules of thumb to use in most situations you would encounter as a photographer. This is by far the best practical instructional guide I've found. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is essential for understanding proper exposure. Great examples and discussion. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take better photos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"this book is very informative. Its gives a semester's worth of knowledge in one book. I learned so much about how to take better pictures. More than I could have possibly figured out on my own."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is worth the money if you only look at the pictures. There is however more to this book than the pictures: much more. First Bryan Peterson has a great way of presenting the creative view of making pictures. He doesn't overwhelm you with technical data: just the opposite. He shows a picture, explains why or how he took it, and finally the focal length, aperature and shutter speed.This book is now five years since publication but it is still relative. That is due to his focus on creative approaches to his images and not a heavy focus on technical aspects of picture making. His down to earth style of presenting the material in this book makes it a pleasure to read. I keep going back to it for ideas or inspiration. In fact it is so good, I am going to purchase his other book \\"Understanding Shutterspeed: Creative Action and Low Light Beyond 1/125 Second\\" just based on how much I liked \\"Understandin Exposure\\".Bryan, great job!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"At last, a nicely written and easy to understand \\"how-to\\" photography book that is satisfying on several levels. While the author supplies some wonderful tips and examples that quickly served to help me improve my skills as an advanced amateur, this book is absolutely NOT over the head of anyone new to SLR-type photography. (It won't really help point-and-shoot folks unless they have advanced cameras with Auto-M-AP-SP-P settings.) I have loaned my copy of the book to a friend who has already threatened to not return it (!) and have recommended it to another. I heartily recommend this book to anyone in need of a really good and well-thought-out approach to taking consistently good pics. You will not be disappointed if you should decide to purchase it!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"As a newbie photographer I found this to be by far the best book to teach the basics of how to use an SLR camera. I appreciated most the outstanding illustrations used to explain the basic concepts of ISO, Aperture and shutter speed and there relationship with each other. I also appreciated his explanation of how to meter certain subjects to get superior results. With all the exercises throughout the book along with his explanation of how and why he took certain photos you feel like an expert by the time your finished. With the aid of this one book I have already seen outstanding results in my photographs. Obviously I recommend this book to anyone who is new to photography and wants to have a clear understanding of how to use a camera."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"As an advanced enthusiast, I have bought this book after reading quite positive reviews about it here and elsewhere. I was hoping that it would offer a lot that I was missing. Apparently, my expectations were too high.The book is good in terms of the general writing style, the examples & the explanations. The production quality (paper, typesetting, color separations) are also fine. I believe it contains a wealth of information which are presented nicely and in a logical order. This can make this book (considering its not too expensive price) a very welcome offer for \\"beginners\\". For \\"advanced\\" users (who might have read similar books before, who were shooting even before the digital age etc.) it has very limited appeal. This is probably fine since the author (& the publisher) probably had the beginners as their potential customers in mind. Unfortunately, this is not even implied by the title...The book is revised to accommodate some info on \\"digital\\" cameras. There is even a short chapter comparing film & digital towards the end of the book. However, digital technology evolves too fast to allow books like this to remain current for more than a year or two. Five years is too much in this respect... The comments on digital approach are offered in a sketchy manner here and there and there is still too much info on film which is used by a minority nowadays. I do use film and I am not criticising the author for including such info. What I am trying to say is that a revised version based on digital camera exposures with additional info on film would be much better.Peterson makes generalizations thoroughout the book. Most of these are necessary and helpful for the beginners and prevents them from getting confused by details and exceptions. However, he rarely declares that he is oversimplifying things. This can be misleading like his below sentences (from page 68) show: \\"To produce a background of out-of-focus circles, you must use a wide open aperture. This is the only aperture that is 100 percent circular in shape. All other apertures are hexagonal\\". The generalizations here are plain wrong. (Readers can see an image with an \\"octagonal aperture\\", for example, on page 91).These criticisms are minor as long as the potential buyer is a beginner since the \\"basics\\" of exposure are essentially the same for film and digital. This book provides the necessary information for them in a concise manner. However, for advanced shooters, there is little info here that they might have missed before."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was my first photography book read from beginning till end without getting bored and, more important, always learning something useful on every page, that I could almost immediately apply on the field. The examples given by the author are really helpful and self illustrative but he also adds enough technical detail (e.g. gives you several examples with different settings) so you can try both the technical and the 'artistic' sides of your next photo. It's not the technical perfection of a picture that makes a great photo but it's important to know how you can pursuit the image you want, and this book gives an important help archiving that step.I'm reading now the 'Creative Outdoor' and while being a little different, I would say that 'Understanding Exposure' it's much more fun to read and more to the point.Starting with photography? Then please buy this one, you won't regret. And if you would like to have some more technical background for your current knowledge then I would also recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you would like, you COULD search around the internet and get all the same information from varies sites/ authors. But this one book explains things in easy terms with compelling images to illustrate the point. Very easy to read and understand. I recommend this book to anyone looking to understand what their camera is doing rather than accidentally getting good exposures. I am no longer confused about ISO's and the use of f-stops to create depth.Summary: Great book, read in two days, every \\"photographer\\" in the office is enjoying the book now."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent book for beginners as well as advanced photographers. When I first got the book I flipped through it and I was disappointed in thinking it was mostly a picture book on how the photographer got the picture. I decided to go ahead and give it a chance. As I read it, I understood why the pictures are there and also learned how to create excellent pictures. It's one of those books you read several times as you get better and better with photography. It's great for those learning and great for those trying to improve. I thought it was easy to understand and have referred back to it many times."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is the best book on the subject of understanding exposure for a digital camera. The author breaks it down into a few basic components that are universally applicable. When you're done with this book, you will have an understanding on how your light meter and digital sensor work and how to compensate for their inherent characteristics. The digital sensor reacts to light differently than film and you have to know what it wants to do in order to get the exposure you want. This book logically builds on what the sensor wants to do and then walks you through a number of examples that you will encounter and how to handle them. As a photographer, I can't think of any info that has helped me more. I always recommended this book to people wanting to learn about digital photography. If you truly understand how your camera interprets light, then the rest (composition, the moment, etc...) is up to you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"No question, this is an excellent book. I am a intermediate level photographer, it is filled with great tips. Stop reading this and buy the book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Peterson delivers on his premise: \\"Learning to see the multitude of creative exposures that exist is a giant leap toward photographic maturity.\\"Finally! I just counted 12 other how-to photography books on my self. I've learned from them all and from workshops by pros with award-winning work, so I came with an intellectual understanding of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO and their relationship to each other. This is the book that helped me jump from intellectual understanding to instinctual control and creative choice.Understanding Exposure cuts through the jargon with concise explanations and just enough analogy, simile, and stories to make it stick. Peterson illustrates each point with his own beautiful and to-the-point photographs, often with alternate photos and settings so you can see the results of different choices. Read this book, do the exercises, and feel like a photographic grown-up."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really found this book a great resource. I started taking better pictures after just a few chapters. Very accessible, but not too elementary. He tells good stories, but not so many that you feel like you are reading a novel instead of a photography text. All about natural light as well, he really doesn't like flash. Really breaks it down into useful pieces of information so you don't feel overwhelmed and you feel like you can go out and do this stuff yourself."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book really takes you through all the ins and outs of camera exposure in cleverly designed way. I have read many technical documents that get into the math of dof and the science of the color itself, but this book simply takes you step by step through what matters to the camera each time you take a shot. It is illustrated with several creative exposures and often shows a plain one next to a creative one and describes how to achieve both of them and the conditions to attempt them in. After reading this book I have a much better understanding of things to look for when setting up for a shot, as well as a better knowledge of how my camera is going to interpret the different aspects in it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I read a couple of general how-to type books and realized that I needed a better understanding of how to creatively expose each shot. This book does just that. Plus it gives very useful and straight forward tips to ensure you get it right. Nicely done. Absolutely recommend it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book. Explains everything in good terms. It is interesting and easy to read and gets you to your goal of becoming a better photographer. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"No other book is so masterfully organized and written around the theme of \\"creatively correct exposures\\". Regardless of the medium used (film or digital), the professional experience of the author as a photographer and as a teacher comes together in this highly readable book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Unlike some of the other books I ordered, this book actually explains \\"why\\", not just \\"how\\". So if you are the type that just wants to be told \\"use f/8 for portraits\\", get another book. But if you want to understand _why_ to use a f/8 setting for portraits, this is your book. My only quibble would be that it didn't discuss enough about adjusting the ISO, which is useful for those of us that have digital SLRs."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It's a good book. More so for beginners, who have some idea about shutter speed, aperture, focal length and depth of field. This book will acquire you a much better understanding of how these four basic elements of photography correlate in each and every photo. The book provides easy-to-use tools for choosing different parameters for every given situation, or for every desired outcome.I do find it lacks some explanations beyond the basic \\"wide aperture for portraits\\", \\"stopped down for deep landscape\\" logics. As an advanced amateur, I was glad to get my thoughts and ideas organized, and that was done quite well, but was also looking for something else. Well, something I don't know, perhaps. Some theory, some star dust of life time experience."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book gives a great introduction to the use of aperture, shutter speed, and light in getting good exposures. The book is a very quick read and every page has pictures with many illustrating what not to do. He could have gone into a few things in more depth such as the chapter on metering light and ISO, and the section on special techniques and filters is so short it either should have been left out or expanded upon. Overall I am very glad I purchased this book (was pretty cheap too) and it gave me a good base upon which to build.BTW, this the author obviously loves to photo his wife!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you own an (D)SLR or point-and-shoot with manual settings, this book will get you out of auto mode. Make sure you know how to control the basic manual operations of your camera before you proceed.This is not a camera operation manual, and it is not a technical treatise on focal length or depth of field. This book is a detailed, well-explained guide to understanding how the myriad combinations of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, lighting, and metering mode affect the look of a photograph, and how to gauge which settings to use for your desired exposure. Peterson also tackles the concept of 18% reflectance, when to over- or under-expose, filters, and some more advanced techniques.Every sub-section (about 2 pages) explains a particular consideration or technique, with several illustrative photos that demonstrate the technique, with an desciption of the lens used, focal length, and exposure information, and why he chose them.This book is invaluable to those who want to get more consistent results and understand how and why their good pictures are good. The result will be less \\"chimping\\" and more shooting."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you enjoy photography, even point-n-shoot, but you want to learn more - this is where you should start. If you don't understand the relationship of aperture and shutter speed - this is the book for you. If you are unclear when you should use a higher vs lower aperture or shutter speed - this book is what you need.The book is short and to the point. The text is well written and practical. But the images are where this book shines. So many photography books have bad photos. This book shows you side-by-side comparisons that let you see what the author is demonstrating.I cannot wait to read his other books. This book was my big ah-ha moment in photography. Within 10 pages, I had my digital camera out and was taking better pics. By the time I finished reading it the next day, I had dug out my old 35mm film camera and started taking good photos for the first time ever, without wasting any shots on luck. All of my shots were perfect, and I was able to reproduce shots.This book makes photography based on scientific principles a creative project."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"There are those photographers who understand exposure and those who do not. Whatever your own level of experience with either (or both) digital or film camera, this book will, at one of the scale, teach the novice a great deal about the subject. At the other end, there will be few professional or highly competent amateur photographers who could fail to learn something from this excellent work. In short, there is something for everyone in this book and, even a brief flick through the pages, is enough to generate ideas.I particularly like the way in which the book is laid out. A great deal of thought went into a design which allows readers to build on what has been covered so far as they progress through the work. Beginning with; Defining Exposure, the author devotes considerable time to each of the main headings which also include; Aperture, Shutter Speed, Light and penultimately; Special Techniques and Filters. Finally, there is a discussion on Film vs. Digital which might be useful for those photographers who are still not convinced by the new technology.Speaking as a self-taught photographer whose own pictures have been widely published for over 30 years, this book has explained much that I did not previously understand as well as, perhaps, I should have.Approx. A4 size, with one of the nicest dedications I have ever come across, there are 160 pages containing 150 colour illustrations which cover just about every spectrum of the subject. These include sport, natural history, portraits, people at work, landscapes, close up, mood shots - and a great deal more. As I said, something for just about everyone.NM"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have read many photography books, and this book is my photography bible. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate. Both novice and intermediate photographers should not miss...It contains theories and clear examples with clear explainations. Following assignments in this book provided, you will get more understanding on taking pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"the author keeps this so relavant. Is like being in the field with him, as he gives you the way his brain works and then helps you to get the camera set so you capture the image correctly. The exercises are helpful and fun, and with digital you can tell right away if you're on the right path or not...His images are lovely, the tips he offers are very easy to comprehend and very useful, from setting the correct aperture, to tricks of the trade for action shots, macro and more. He also offers secrets of the pros to keep your images interesting and a bit off the beaten path so they are also noteworthy and memorable...As someone who has been dabbling in photgraphy, correct exposure has always been a tough part of the technical side of the art for me, but Peterson makes it accessible to anyone"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Although I've enjoyed taking pictures for years, I never really understood what I was doing. It was all the hit and miss approach. I bought this book several months ago as my first book in my attempt to understand HOW to take better pictures.For a beginner like me I think this book is excellent at giving the reader an understanding of the basics of aperture, shutter speed and ISO. The information is presented in a way that it is easy to follow and his writing style also makes it fun.I think this book was likely somewhat difficult to write (had to dumb-it- down for those of us who are getting started) and in that regard there are times when he could have explained things further. Regardless, this book has helped me \\"get it\\" and I find myself referring back to it often. I see myself buying additional books written by Bryan in the future. I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to work beyond the \\"hit and miss\\" approach to photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am new to photography. I have a great camera and have been using it like a point and shoot. I knew that I needed to learn how to use the manual settings if I was going to have great pictures, but I haven't had time to take a class. I purchased this book, along with \\"Learning To See Creatively\\" and couldn't be more pleased. These books are like having a teacher in my home. They teach the tools, give lots of examples and even have assignments to learn how to hone the skill yourself. My photography has gotten 100% better since reading these books and they are a great reference for me to go back to again and again."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book taught me more in the first 15 minutes of reading it than I learned from weeks of reading the same info from many different sources. It just has a way of wording things that really helped me understand how to do proper exposures. My camera hasn't been off manual since I picked this book up!! Highly recommend it for beginner dSlR users.For anyone who already understands how to adjust for proper exposures this book may be to generic. But for me it has been a fantastic find!!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"As a photo hobbyist with a Canon Rebel XT and several interchangable lenses I found this book to be very helpful in solidifying my overall understanding of how to make sense of exposure options.The best part of this book is how it is organized. It is very clean and does not rely on technical jargon or the author's personalized attempt at explaining \\"light theory.\\" Nothing in the book is revolutionary, but it is done exceptionally well with great examples and discussions of what settings typically produce what results.This book has demystified the full manual setting on my camera and given me the \\"creative control\\" the author speaks to, in addition to simply having the camera set exposure correct settings.It's quick reading with lots of full color photography. You can get through sections easily and I expect I will re-read several key areas as a reference book going forward.The material seems a touch dated in that the author walks the line between film and digital discussions but he is equipment neutral in his discussions -- and really, the subject matter here is independent of a particular camera or brand.Great book that I highly recommend for any photographer who has been using an SLR for a little while and has an understanding of aperture and speed if not all the rules committed to memory."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am a beginner and recently planned to take up photography as a serious hobby. I am not sure what else to add to all the glowing reviews. I actually learned something new from almost every single page of the book. The descriptions are short and always full of information. So, you don't tend to gloss over the book and accidentally skip the important parts. Even if you read one page a day, you will take away something very very practical. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"There is more to exposure than just matching aperture, shutter and ISO values. The first half of the book explains the relation between these three, and might be a little overdone for intermediate photographers. But the second half more than compensates for that.Bryan Peterson shows many tricks regarding finding the right light settings, using shutter time in creative ways, and how to get the most out of a picture by using the correct light.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Before reading this book, my photography was decent, but I wasn't nailing the exposure. Since reading \\"Understanding Exposure\\" I have really gotten the hang of where and how to meter the light in difference scenes. This book does a great job of going through a lot of different scenes and how to meter the light and get the \\"most creative exposure.\\" Anyway, I started to read this book and could not put it down. I read the entire thing over the course of about 2-days and then about a week later, I read it again. You will not be dissatisfied with this book. I have purchased several books to help me improve my photography and this one has helped the most! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Simply the best. When you apply the techniques that Lee shares with us, you my friend, will understand how simple it is to improve your photos and make them come alive."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I read the first edition and the second; the person that says \\"the author relies strickly on his camera's automatic exposure system\\" is SO WRONG it isn't funny. He talks about the importance of spot metering and measuring different portions of the scene for CREATIVE EXPOSURE; kindof hard to get creative exposures if you never take the camera out of auto mode. This book will be the best money that you've ever spent."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you want a basic guide to tell you about aperture, ISO, shutter speed, light metering and the like, then this is the right book for you. If you want a in-depth book about the physics of it all, then by all means buy the $100 book mentioned in one of the other reviews- it's a good one. But it's also $100. This one is much less!This book helped me begin to understand what I was dealing with in my 35mm SLR. Things were broken down into no-nonsence explainations and written in everyday english. It has enough information to educate the everyday familly photographer into taking non-blurry photos, but plant enough basic skills as to provide an excellent base for further study if desired.I would definatly recommend!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I recently purchased a digital SLR in hopes to learn aboout photography. Peterson's examples and photos are beyond excellent for the beginner. The concepts are clearly presented. I continue to use the book as a resource and my pictures have since gotten better and better. Before reading this book, I'd nod my head silently in conversations amongst other photographers, but now I actually can participate as I have a much better understanding of such terms as aperature, depth of field, and exposure. This is a must-have for any beginner, especially one who is coming from the world of point-and-shoot to SLR!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A friend recommended i read this book, so i purchased it and spent the next afternoon reading through it. The book was awesome, it very clearly explained a lot of the terms i previously didn't understand and helped me to better understand why pictures weren't turning out like I had hoped. It was a great beginner book to learn how to get the right exposure from the camera instead of having to digitally edit the photos later. I highly recommend the book for the beginner or for anyone who wants to improve their photography (oh and the book is written for anyone, digital or film."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have paid thousands of dollars and spent hundreds of hours in photography classes at the Art College in the city near my home. The college is amazing and i adore the teaches. I learned a lot going to this school but i never truly understood exposure until 3 days ago when i read this book. The entire world of photography feels brand new and exciting even though i have been taking pictures for over 30 years! And if i ever see Bryan Peterson, i swear i will kiss his feet because he has changed my life. If you love photography but you've been frustrated with exposure or your not sure how to use your camera off Program Mode - This book WILL change your photos -for the better - forever."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Like many of you I am working towards making unbelievable photography and maybe someday changing careers. I have read many books cover to cover and my photography has shown great improvement in a short time period. Understand Exposure is by far the best book that I have read so far. A beginner can get this book but with a little understanding of your camera and basic camera terminology this book could make almost anyone dangerous on a shoot. The author, Bryan Peterson, jumps right in to explaining and getting you out of auto modes. Luckily I was already shooting manually and had heard some of his techniques prior but with each new lesson he seems to reiterate his earlier teachings. Within the first 20 pages you are learning what may have taken you a few weeks to months to learn when you seriously started shooting. I would say buy it. I just want to also say I am not someone the author asked to write a review. I am merely a photographer serious about improving my craft and this book should be a must have on the shelf for anyone wanting to truly learn about properly exposing your photos. Take it for what it is, this is not a composition book or a how to use your camera book ... this is pretty much a \\"I want to pick up my camera, throw it in manual, frame a shot and come out with the \\"perfect\\" exposure every time\\". That is worth a lot when you may have one short period to get the great properly exposed shot. If you buy it ... enjoy it and I will see you in some photo competitions and if you don't ... good luck ... it can be done without a doubt but this book just makes it easier."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this book as a complement to my new Digital Rebel XT. It is quite excellent in providing information on standard photography- things that apply to both film and digital cameras. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more and wanting to use all of the manual features available on a good SLR camera."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Only finished first 20 pages, found it very useful. Not only for beginner as I've read lots of tutorial about photography and this book still like a charm."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I would definitely recommend this book to any photo enthusiast who is looking to expand their knowledge and thus lead to taking \\"better\\" photos. Very well written. Easy to understand. LOTS of photo's. Very Helpful!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Forget any other books about exposure. This is the best book that I have ever read or seen that covers how to use exposure and shutter speed so well. I recommend it even over the other books that Bryan Peterson has written. It cover the subject so well that no other book is needed. Highly recommended for any user of a camera, digital or film."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I last took a photography class 14 years ago. Having not owned an SLR in the interim until just recently, I had forgotten most of my knowledge. This book brought me right back to where I was then and took me even further. Definitely applicable to digital SLR photography in 2010 (though I hear a revised edition is coming out in August). Enjoyed the writing style as well. While the Sky Brothers and Mr. Green Jeans might sound cheesy, they stick in your mind and remind you of what you learned when you're out in the field shooting. Brilliant book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've taken a lot of photography classes and bought quite a few books on photography. What striked me from the getgo on my photography endeavor was the complete reluctance by everyone to give me some examples of how to make a correct exposure with my camera. Sure they would give me a list of measurements for each light situation but this book goes the distance: takes the photo and gives you the measurements. My only wish for this book was to have included the time of the day, but I guess that would have been a bit too much. For an amateur self starter like me, this books makes all the difference in understanding depth of field and of course how to compose the right exposure. The photographer takes a step back and tells you hey this is what I wanted to shoot, this is what I shot, and this is how I shot it. You will hardly get any other photographer to share that with you. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I feel it is a solid book on topic. The photos are tremendous. The text does a very good job of covering the mix between exposure and shutter speed. It also covers the depth of field relationship to exposure. His books are all solid well written texts. I spent years and years in film with none of the gadgets in exposure that digital cameras allow for use. He reminded me of what that experience means in using exposure as a part of the art of photography.Easy to read, and makes one look at the use of exposure to create the effect that one wants to capture. Good reminder tool for new or experienced."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book based on the other reviews I had read. I'm quite the \\"newbie\\" at a DSLR camera and hoped this book would help me understand the mechanics of photography and my camera. It did both -- and in a very easy to understand way. I see it as being a continual reference also as it is quite comprehensive.After I had already ordered the book I visited our local library which had a copy of it. Yeah, I could have just always checked it out whenever I wanted to reference something in the book, but I'm much happier knowing that I have my own copy. Again, very well done."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Always enjoy taking pics. I recently bought my first DSLR - Canon Rebel Ti1. I am very much a beginner who struggles to understand Aperture, Shuttle Speed, ISO, and my advanced DSLR camera features. On my quest to expand my knowledge, I went to Amazon. It search engine points me to Scott Kelby's book \\"Digital Photo\\". Too take the advantage of Amazon free shipping, I decided to add on this Bryan Peterson's book - that is, not my first choice. However, to my total surprise, I extremely enjoy reading this book. Even as a slow reader, I almost finish reading it in just one weekend. It is very easy to understand, very concise, with good illustration. I feel much smarter now, armed with knowledge learned from this book. I could have paid hundreds of dollar for beginner seminar just to get the same result as this $16 book.I took several pics in manual mode last night in my dark room, under difficult lightning, and quickly saw good results. I now know what a perfect exposure means and how to get it. Going forward, what I need is to turn off the auto mode of my camera, get more practice with Av, Tv, & ISO, to achieve the consistency. Looking forward to read more of Mr. Peterson's books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is for EVERYONE who shoots.

Alot of great pictures, and once again for beginners, this may be worth checking out. Depending on you, but, may want to go for the field guide if you have to choose one or other and its filled with more information.The way he explains camera terms Shutter speed, Aperture, ISO, etc is very easy to understand. Like in my other review, he keep things simple without so much of the technical terminology as he paints a picture as give you a better idea of what he's talking about.Pictures are well laid out and I find it interesting (when I was just first starting out) as I learn how to record a correct exposure. Shows you different ways to create 6 different exposures and one of them being a creative exposure with objects or person in motion. Even with waters in motion such as waves, waterfalls, and how to record them correctly. Its a good guide for beginners but, field guide has more information on this."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Recieved the book very quickly. It was in great condition and was certainly what was promised.Very happy with the book itself. It does a great job explaining the inter-relationship between aperture, shutter speed and light.Incredibly helpful!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is exactly what I needed. The way the book breaks down how you create a great exposure is perfect. I have never heard the relationship between Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO explained the way this book did. If you are just starting out, brand new or want a book with great exercises to help you expand the type of photographs you are taking, this is the book for you. The exercises really helped tie in the chapter I just finished reading. The photograph examples flow perfectly with each chapter and exercise. I am so happy that a friend told me to pick this up.

About more than an year ago, I graduated from the point-n-shoot to a DSLR level and bought a D60. Initially, I was happy with the crisp & clear pictures, but soon realized that there is lot more to learn & explore.Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)provides the knowledge and helps in understanding of the concepts of photography, and not the photo-processing. A good shot is the one, where you need to do as minimum processing to achieve the desired result. And right exposure is undoubtedly a must to get that ideal shot. The author who is a known photographer has done a terrific job in explaining those concepts and provided plenty of photographs to explain his points. These photographs also gives me ideas while shooting pictures.If you are serious about photography, don't think twice, just get this reference!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Not only does this book include beautiful images but it speaks to a variety of situations that the typical photographer will experience. Not too technical but useful. Most images include EXIF data. Practical.

You will be able to shoot in manual mode by the time you finish the first chapter.

Recommended by a podcaster to whom I listen and worth every penny! Even if one THINKS one understands the exposure triangel (aperture/shutter speed/ISO, one should read this book.

Good examples and easy and entertaining reading."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Regardless of your skill level with photography, this is a book every photographer should own. A friend recommended this book when I started shooting with a digital SLR and I've recommended it to many people since. It's a great primer for those just getting started with photography, but it also serves as a great review for those of us that have been shooting for a long time. Pick up this book every couple of months and flip through the pages, and you'll constantly be reminded of things you should be doing which may not be fresh in your mind as you've developed certain habits or a particular style. Even if you already know everything there is to know, you should still have this book so that when your friends come to you for advice on how to make their pictures better (you know they will), you can lend it to them to read."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book gives all the info and the explanation about basic photography principles that anyone needs. Read it, look at the photos, check out the different settings and then go and shoot."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a well written and easy to understand book, the kind of thing that should have been available when I was learning all of this back at school!The book goes into the finer details of learning to understand lighting and exposure and is a good read.It isn't light so be prepared to concentrate to get the best results but if you're happy to read you'll get an understanding of photographic exposures and the information contained in this book will help you create some wonderful pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"For those seek to create more interesting images, this book will have you understand how a camera works and how you can use that knowledge to create images with which you are more pleased. Written in an easy to understand manner. If one were learning photography and had only one book, your would not go wrong in having this volume be that book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book was amazing. Just after reading the first couple parts of it I had understood more than from the classes that I have been taking in college. Will help you understand more about photography in a shorter amount of time."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent book for newbies and seasoned photographers. The author's text is clear and concise, and the images he's chosen to illustrate his points are fabulous. My favorite example of \\"creative exposure\\" is the sequence of shots of the ferris wheel. A picture is, indeed, worth a 1,000 words."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is very good in explaining the basics of photography and how to use the settings of a camera. It gives basic information on the technical side of photography with real examples on how to take picures without using \\"auto\\" mode.I would welcome more information on how to use flash more effectively."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Works for film as well as digital; an excellent study on the subject of receiving reflected light that you want to capture."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Even though I'm still in the process of reading this book and read only first half yet, I can give you my thoughts.This book is really Amazing one.Either you're a novice in photography, or you already have some experience, or you're photography enthusiast for years, or you prefer shooting on film or you prefer digital, this book is for all of you.Real novice will learn how camera works - what's the apperture, shutter, ISO and how they interract. More experienced photographers will get new perspective on things they already know and I'm sure that everyone will find out some new things you've never known or thought of.Each author's explanation is documented with appropriate picture (including used lens, focal length, ISO, apperture and shutter speed) which will further help you understand the theme.A real Must Have Book. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Very basic book, mostly for those who are absolute beginners in photography or for point-and-shooters that are upgrading to SLR."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book for beginners and experenced as well. He pointed out things that I haven't thought of. And he put them in terms that are easy to understand.This book really gave me the knowledge and understanding that I was looking for."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If there was one book to get in photography this would be it. This book really gets into the the three main components of photography, Aperture, Lens speed, and ISO. These three components are the foundation of photography. It also adresses lighting."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you have any interest in photography, this is the MUST have book. It is a photography bible."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"!Excellent! Very good book. I'm taking a photography class and this book explain better than my teacher."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have had this book for a few weeks and am already taking better pictures. Very easy to read and to understand. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I learned so much from this book. I highly recommend this book to all beginner photographers."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book worked wonders for a beginner like me! I'm not a professional but I now have a basic knowledge of my dSLR."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a treasure troft of advice and expertise. I have ordered the other book Understanding Shutter Speed and I hope it is just as good."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book which is clearly written makes it easy to understand exposure. I also read 'Understanding Shutter speed'...both get the same review...buy it, you will dare to get off Auto...it is excellent!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan guide you throug the discovery of f/secrets and the right choiche for the shooting speed, with great and simple examples.Very well made, a pleasure to read. You have to buy it if you are a beginner, you may consider to buy it if you are at an intermediate level."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you want to get off AUTO and PROGRAM mode, you MUST GET THIS BOOK! Since reading it I have not hardly set my camera to anything but MANUAL mode! For everything from outdoor shooting to indoor weddings, manual is the way to go!My dream is to find a similar book to help with the harsh over exposing or heart breaking under exposing of external flash (i.e. speedlite) photography. Anyone have any recs? This book won't really help with flash photography, Bryan is mostly into natural lighting, which is great. But sometimes (a lot of times) you just have to power up the old flash unit."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Having just made the jump from digital P&S; to a dSLR, I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.The author does a good job of explaining the basics of photography, something most of us using P&S; cameras have little clue about.The book was very informative and helpful. The pictures in the book are stunning (especially Bryon's smoking hot wife!), as should be expected in a book about photography.If you're already knowledgeable about exposure, shutter speed, f-stops, etc, then this probably isn't the book for you.However, if you're just getting started in real photography, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"this book helps alot when it comes to the effects of exposure in photography. I'm still lost though. I can't seem to get my camera off the automatic setting yet. The book shows what happens at different settings it even gives examples of subtle changes. It clearly shows the results of changing the exposure settings and demonstrates alot of photos where the exposure is just OK but how to get the same photo to POP by adjusting exposure settings."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I read thru this book in about a week- I have had my DSLR for 1 year, never had a film SLR, & never took a photography course. I read this book and\\"The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography\\" by Jim Miotke - Both great books, easy reads with tons of info! Also they both have assignments that gets you to try out the techniques.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"What a gem of a find. I was reading an article in a photography mag, when one one its subjects mentioned how he learned to take such beautiful pictures by reading this book. Needless to say, it was my next purchase. This is a very easy to understand and well illustrated book. I wish I had found this years ago, for I would have been a much better photographer for it. The book is in depth, but not a tome. I finished it in less than a week of riding the metro to and from work, just a couple of hours a day. By the weekend, I was ready put what I had learned into action. You won't become an overnight Ansel Adams, but it will put you on the right path. With lots of great information, easy to understand text and exercises, I am sure it will help many a new photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"You can believe the hype - this is a superb book and worth every penny! The author has a laid-back charm in his writing and tells you exactly how to shoot the pictures he shoots - and they are gorgeous pictures. The author even explains photographic terms for those new to photography, but doesn't make it too simplistic for more advanced readers.This book not only has great, breathtaking pictures, and great technical information, but in addition, the author gives you practical advice and tips for more creative exposures. This book is a must-have for all SLR owners, whether you own a film or digital (and I own and use both)."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I'm a relatively new photographer, with a pretty good grasp of the technology behind it all. Even so, this book really crystallized some of the concepts that I had learned, but which hadn't become very clear yet. This book is probably not recommended for the advanced novice, and certainly not for the photographer, as this may already be stuff they know.I'm not sure how useful this book would be to the very brand new beginner, as it gets into quite a bit of detail on the interplay between the various factors that go into exposure. Even so, I would buy it, because it will be a book to read once you do have some foundations in place."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book explains Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO in a very simple matter. He explains the shot he was going for and then he tells you why he chose the settings he used. I keep it with me and muse over the pictures and try to duplicate the story.. Works for me!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson takes some awesome photographs that are captioned with the settings used on the camera. Viewing these have inspired me to continue practicing to improve my skills.The text is a good quick read and made the book an enjoyable diversion. I would have liked more detail on the settings and why certain effects work better than others for various photo opportunities.I have given this book 4 stars, implying that it is worthwhile to get, but not the perfect book. His catch line early in the book was \\"Your exposure should be correct\\" in answer to a student's question about the exposure setting in a situation is demonstrated through all of his examples. He chooses a correct exposure, but does not go into details behind variances that could have been used."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really enjoyed Mr. Peterson's Understanding Exposure. I found it very informative, easy to understand, well-written and filled with good example photos. I need to read it at least one more time to really absorb all the great photography tips so I can put them into practice. I enjoyed his style so much that I've purchased Learning to See Creatively, too."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"What a great book. It took the little knowledge and convinced me that great photos are not just being in the right place at the right time, but you can deliberately choose your great photo. Because of the simple way he builds topics it is easy to grasp the concepts. Very readable book. I took the tips and within a few days was able to apply his tips and get shots pretty close to the examples he gave."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Still half way to finish up this book. Great book to own as self reference library. I particularly love to read up the Light chapter, this provides me a different view on capturing stunning shot.The only information lack is the real EXIF info that missed out. I assume maybe Bryan tries best to keep this book to those non-technical readers. I'm still figuring out how to convert those SLR lens info to DSLR, maybe I confused myself. Bryan did not explain further which pictures he took using SLR or DSLR.Anyway, this is a great book to own and worth reading."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Was told about this book by a friend so I picked it up. Since then, I have gotten 2 other people to buy it. Pictures are great and the book is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Outstanding book for anyone into photography. Explains in simple easy to understand terminology. Highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Second book of Bryan Peterson's I've read. He does an amazing job of explaining the different methods and really taking the mysticism out of exposure control. ISO, Aperture, Shutter speed, lighting, and many other topics are really explained in a clear and simple way so as to not leave any confusion.It's funny, I noticed a huge different in my pictures after just reading the first couple of chapters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book should come recommended with any SLR purchase , it quickly and clearly explains how and why to use all the creative options on an SLR camera ,and also includes some practical exercises to demonstrate the principles.If you have never taken your camera off fully automatic , do yourself an favour and get this book , it is by far the clearest explanation of what any camera is capable of and will have you using the advanced features of your camera in no time."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"SUPERB technical book !! written in a precise+ easy to understand+ humurous style. A MUST for one to learn taking good/creative photo, as well as for one to acquire basic (to profound) knowledge to appreciate photographic images.Just like other folks that I read in the Reviews, I made decision to order all Bryan Peterson's 4 books, in my case, right after reading the first few chapers of Understanding Exposure, and realized how valuable the books and this author/Bryan Peterson is, to my thirst of knowledge in photography .Again, like a few comments that I read in Review, I also regret to think all I can get from Bryan is 4 books. I hope Bryan Peterson will publish new one in the near future.As Bryan taught his students that there's a wealth of subjects in this world for one to photograph, I'm sure there's equally a wealth of knowledge, out of Bryan's years of experiences, that he can still share."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Being a novice photographer, this book has helped me exponentially.He goes into detail and gives you chapters on each of the fundamental necessities for great photography. Along with his phenomenal photography, he gives you the settings that went along with them and explains why he used what he used and how he achieved the photograph.Fantastic learning tool.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Ok. I'll admit it: I buy a *lot* of books that I don't read and sometimes just glance at and use for reference. I actually read this book cover to cover. It's short and it has a lot of good examples that illustrate what the author is writing about.I learned a lot and most of that was by looking at sample photos and reading the short text descriptions next to them.I am not an advanced photographer so perhaps more experienced readers may find the book less useful but for beginners it's just fantastic."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've recently decided to enter the DSLR world, so I'm quite new at Photography and DSLR cameras. I bought this book as well as the DSLR and Digital Photography for Dummies, and while the latter was an \\"OK\\" book, this book is absolutely great!Not only it covers the basic concepts for an exposure (Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO), it also covers technical details about them (for the more fanatic ones). I must confess I was a bit confused in some parts of the book, but I'm pretty sure that after I use my new camera and take some pictures around and go back to reading this book, the hardcore things will make a lot more sense to me.From a beginner's point of view, this is a must have book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have purchased this book about two months ago, and you can already see that my photographic skills have been improved! This book helped me to understand how to set exposure. I set exposure only manually now. I would say that for an advanced photographer, this may not be a great help. But for me it was just \\"what doctor ordered\\" =)). I tried to read about the exposure modes in many other different books, web sites, on-line discussions, etc. But this book helped me to finally understand how it works. I would highly recommend this book to any beginner photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am only half way through this book and already I have learned more from it than the other 20 or so photography books sitting on my shelves put together! The writing is engaging and the more technical stuff is made understandable with cute analogies and gorgeous photographs. I am so impressed I have ordered two more of his books and will be ordering more again. Don't hesitate!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If this was being sold as a book of photographs instead of a book about photography, it probably would cost $40-50, because the pictures themselves are stunning works of art. The author, a gifted writer and teacher as well as a superb artist and photographer, explains why and how he selected the settings for each photo.The book is a pleasure to read, food for the mind, and a feast for the eyes."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is very good at explaining how to use your SLR (film or digital) camera in manual, Av, and Tv modes; and why you should use these modes instead of the automatic modes to take better pictures. It is illustrated with hundereds of good color pictures that show examples how different exposure settings affect the outcome of pictures. I have read several books on photograpy, but this one is the best because it gets to the point, re-enforces the text with visual examples, and can be read and understood in a few hours."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is simply outstanding. I've bought quite a number of books from Amazon on a variety of subjects but this particular book forced me to go out and buy a highlighter. The information shared here is easy to understand and, with so many examples and samples, you really feel like you're learning.The author goes into great detail about how to \\"see\\" a great image and how to properly expose that image. whether you're a digital or film shooter this book is a MUSt for anyone looking to really dive into their photography hobby/profession. I just loved it and keep it in my camera back pack as i travel taking pictures and constantly going back to the text.BUY THIS BOOK! You won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is excellent. I give it 4 stars because it didn't cover ISO THAT well for my understanding. Granted, it's a lot simpler than aperture and shutter speed, but I finished not really being sure when to use which ISO. Other than that the book is a must have. Highly recommended. The quality is incredible like others have said. I'm going to try Exposure and Lighting for Digital Photographers Only by Meadhra and Lowrie next."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an easy read that provides you with the basics and shows you how to use them in a creative fashion. Peterson discusses the three aspects to exposure (ISO speed, aperture, and shutter speed). People criticized him for discussing these concepts at length. However, they are the fundamentals to \\"understanding exposure\\", nothing more!He tells you how to use these basic concepts to obtain more creative shots. He also provides the information used to take his amazing and colorful photographs as proof of his concepts.Initially, I incorrectly assumed Mr. Peterson did a lot of post-processing to obtain that bright color. Therefore, I gave him four stars. However, in an email conversation, he informed me the bright colors are from the film he used which saturates the color. So, I will not obtain these rich photos from my digital camera. Instead, I would have to use post-processing to obtain that color.He covers some very useful topics at the end (filters, creative shots, multiple-exposures, etc.). I wish he would've provided more information on these topics instead of one page each.Nevertheless, the book is a very good buy, if you take the time to READ and not merely skim through the book looking for bits of information, you will enhance your understanding of exposure. Yet, they will still not look like his. However, if you believe this is remedial information and nothing new was learned, you then should write your own book!P.S. Plus, it looks great on your coffee table and people will think you know something about photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book last year just prior to a trip to Ireland, I read it on the plane ride over, then referred to it numerous times over the course of my stay there. My understanding and use of my DSLR camera improved dramatically, and my pictures (not all of them) are testament to that.I just a re-read it while flying to Thailand for vacation as a tune-up on the basics--my best photo's reflect the effects of the principles taught in this book.Bryan Peterson's writing style is clear and concise, his manner is open and approachable, it's like a having a kindly mentor guiding you down the path to understanding rather than an expert droning on about the technical aspects of photography. I'm giving my daughter a DSLR for Christmas, and though she's taken photography classes, I'm purchasing this book to give with the camera.Very good and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am not a professional but an enthusiastic amateur. I have been taking pictures for some time but relied a lot on the camera's automatic controls to do the thinking for me. I didn't believe that I needed to learn or understand how a camera worked. Is it any wonder that I did not achieve the results I looked for on a consistent basis? I wanted to understand exposure better and this book helped me.This book spends a lot of time on the three things that make up exposure: the ISO rating, shutter speed, and aperture. Sure, it gets dreary learning those things but if you want good pictures it's essential to learn the underlying pieces of it. And the author does a good job in connecting the dots.What helped me most with this book, though, is the understanding that for any picture there are a number of correct exposures. That is, you can get a correct exposure a number of ways by changing any of the three parts of an exposure. The trick is to find the creatively correct exposure. The exposure that represents your vision and intent for the picture.Another great help to me was the explanation of how the light meter gets fooled by certain environments (e.g. snow, shadow, etc.) and how to deal with it. My landscape pictures have improved a great deal. I find myself in Manual mode much more often these days.This book won't make you a great photographer but it will help you with tools you can really use. I think this book is ideal for an enthusiastic amateur or lower level of expertise. A seasoned professional will undoubtedly already know these things."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I learned more in this book about correct exposure than I learned in a hole year of photography school. Bryan peterson is an excellent teacher. He expains the basics in an effective easy to remember way. For anyone who is confused about apeature, shutterspeed, ISO, or metering, this is a must read! I rented this book from the library and loved it so much I decided I had to buy it. The best photography book I've read so far; I plan to read all of his books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"After all the praise I'd read about this book, I bought a copy (and quickly resold it).Nominally this is a 160 page book, but many of those pages are filled with the author's photos, and like a copy of Byte there's relatively little actual text. What text there is belies the 2004 date or the claim that it's updated: despite the occasional token reference to digital photography, this is a book about shooting film with 1980's technology, and is additionally biased toward landscapes. The author is big on focus-then-recompose shooting, which is much less feasible when shooting, say, humans than it is for mountains and distant tree silhouettes. The techniques advocated range from being inefficient with today's (or even 2004's) modern cameras to being inappropriate for modern dense digital sensors.There is a modest to moderate amount of common-knowledge content, but an hour spent with a web browser will give the reader that and more without all the anachronisms."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Despite my history, I still buy books I don't read and this title sounded like another of the same. I almost didn't buy it but I read some of the customer reviews and decided to take a chance. I am glad I did.In addition to his photographic and writing skills, Peterson brings something I've not found in other books and articles on these more technical aspects of photography. He stays spot-on in telling you how things are without unnecessary excursions into why.That sounds shallow, but technical presentations can be--usually are?--bogged down in detail. An illustration of Peterson's skill at this is in his sidebar, \\"Macro Accessories and the Advantage of Fixed-Lens Digital\\", where he explains that f/11 on a fixed-lens digital is equivalent to f/64 on a 35mm SLR and then explores the benefits of that without yielding to the temptation to present the optics involved.When I first thumbed through the book, the huge number of large color photos put me off. I didn't want a book for the coffee table. Turns out, they are functional. After reading the first forty-plus pages, I was eagerly reading the shooting data at the end of photo captions, something I have never done. I understood the data enough to learn even more by analyzing the photo in light of the shot parameters. Some of the most instructive of Peterson's beautiful illustrations have multiple shots of the same subject either with the same lens and different settings or with different lenses. These and their accompanying descriptions rapidly increase my understanding of the concepts, and it is painless.Despite the complexity of the concepts, I didn't have to make myself read this book. I returned to it as I would to a novel that had grabbed me."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you are hoping to move up from a point-and-shoot digital camera that lacks exposure controls to one that has exposure controls so that you can advance your skills and be more creative, then this is the book for you.Bryan Peterson does an excellent job describing the basics of exposure, starting off with good analogies to help the reader understand the three keys to exposure: shutter speed, film speed, and aperture. Next he discusses simple exposure scenes and rules such as \\"sunny f/16\\". He then moves on to talk about increasingly complex scenarios and helps you to develop the skills to get all of the details right in your exposures so that you get the exposure you wanted on film when you clicked the shutter, not the one you just hoped you got."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I got my copy of Understanding Exposure last night and though I'm only halfway through it, I felt the need to tell how great it is. With vivid photographs, detailed explanation, and a way of making the highly technical easy to understand, Bryan Peterson has created a book that every SLR beginner should buy and read.Peterson focuses a lot of time in the beginning of the book on what he calls the \\"photographic triangle.\\" Put simply, it's the relationship between your settings for aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. With an expert's touch for bringing things down to layman's terms, he makes this relationship far easier to understand than the countless web sites I've read while trying to gear up from being a point-and-shoot photographer to an SLR photographer.For instance, I've easily read ten web sites' detailed explanation on ISO settings for a digital SLR. Not one of them gave me a firm grasp of how the ISO fit into the whole scheme of things. From the web sites, I took away that the lower the ISO, the better to avoid graininess and that ISO wasn't as important with digital SLR as it was with film cameras. Great, so why the heck is it a setting on my camera?!Well, Peterson explains why by comparing ISO to \\"worker bees.\\" In his explanation, if you have an ISO of 100, then you have 100 worker bees working on gathering the light that enters the camera. If you have an ISO of 200, then you have 200 worker bees. And so on and so forth. I would go further and fully explain his analogy, but suffice to say that Peterson does such an expert job that I would not be able to do it justice without reprinting it.And beyond the explanation of the photographic triangle and how important it is to taking great photos, Peterson takes the reader into the realm of taking creative photos. As he points out in the book, there are often times 6-7 \\"correct\\" aperture/shutter speed/ISO combinations for any given photo. Decrease the aperture? Slow down the shutter speed and you'll still have a \\"correct\\" exposure. But, which of the 6-7 is going to give you the best photo? That's where Peterson takes over with photographic evidence of different photos of the same subject, all with \\"correct\\" settings. His example of a ferris wheel really hits the point home.For those who are afraid of the \\"M\\" setting on their SLR camera, Peterson takes away all fear and, as promised in the first part of the book, imparts a confidence that will make you wonder why you were so scared of Manual mode to begin with. For those who are already shooting Manual, Peterson helps bring full meaning to the photographic triangle. And for those who have been shooting \\"correct\\" photos all along, but wonder how to take things to the next level and get photos that will make others \\"ooh\\" and \\"aah,\\" Peterson delivers a detailed and wonderful explanation with plenty of examples.Lastly, all of Peterson's photo examples include a description of what he was trying to accomplish and the settings he used. He also, in passing, offers great advice in the way of explaining how he metered his light. These aren't just pictures for him to show off; they're studies in how to actually take great photographs.All of this and I'm only halfway through!!! I'll be sure to update once I finish, but even the first half of this book has done wonders for my confidence with Manual mode and the transition from point-and-shoot to digital SLR.===== UPDATE =====It's one day later and I've finished the book. As expected, Peterson delivers in the last half of the book just as he delivered in the first half. He goes on to talk about Lighting and Special Effects and, along the way, introduces \\"The Sky Brothers\\" and \\"Mr. Green Pants\\". These characters will make it easy for even beginners to remember how/where to set their exposures. Like the photographic triangle and worker bees before, Peterson's use of metaphor is perfect and, most importantly, memorable.Overall, I'm very impressed not only with Peterson's detailed explanations of seemingly complex topics, but also the way in which he informs the reader while not making things overly technical. This book is more than well worth the price tag!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson is to be congratulated on producing an easy to read and understand book on exposure. His obvious talents as a photographer and teacher flow through to his book. I found it exceptionally useful and very well illustrated."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It is very well written book to understanding exposure in photography. Perhaps, given information is known by pro's but Peterson's written style also deserve special acclaim. He gives all exposure details of every shot which are not avaiable in all photography books helps starters valuable information to understand exposure and taking \\"good\\" photos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The author's explanation, examples and exercises are easy to follow and understand. There are beautiful photos on every page; and each photo lists the settings the author used and includes helpful comments so the reader can achieve the same creative effect. The first exercise for the reader is using the manual setting on your camera. I took my camera and the book outside with me, followed the instructions--and achieved beautiful creative photos for the first time!! It was very \\"empowering!\\" Before reading this book I relied completely on the automatic settings of my camera. I have taken an on-line class and read lots of photography books, and the message never really clicked--but this book has allowed me to finally understand. This book has become the photobook I take everywhere for \\"how to\\" and for inspiration."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I signed up for an online photo course with the author of this book. The course structure was so good that I purchased the book.This book is absolutely fantastic at taking people from using the auto settings to manual mode. I cannot believe how simple the the principles are and how easy it is to understand the topic of perfectly exposed pictures.If you want to get into to real photography, buy this book, get off auto settings and get into manual mode. Your images will improve beyond belief."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Hi, I'm at most, an amateur photographer who don't even have time to shoot, let alone, read. I've been hooked on photography since 1982 but have never attended any formal courses. Through all these times, I've read just under a dozen photography books and believe it or not, this is the first that I've read from front to back! The sad truth about me is I love photography, but hate reading! I only read in the hope of gaining deeper knowledge and thick books doesn't help because by the time I get to the 3rd chapter, I've got a headache and forgotten what was in the 1st. This one is special, it's thin, but that doesn't mean it lacks depth. The funny thing is I've only read this book once over the course two weeks (yes I know I'm a slow and lazy reader) and yet I do remember what I've read! I remember what Bryan meant by 'the correct exposure'. Then there's things like the 'sky brothers', the left side of the sun, the 18% reflectance and the light meter in your camera ... to name a few. Oh it's also very enjoyable to read because Mr. Peterson takes you all over world in this book. This is one of those books I can go back on and flip through the pictures in the pages, and the words in the paragraphs would automatically register into my head. Highly recommended for lazy readers who loves photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have all of Bryan's books and if I had to choose only one book to keep, it would be this one. Understanding Exposure de-mysstifies the often tricky camera settings and makes getting a \\"correct\\" exposure seem relatively easy. He explains things in plain English and gives you tips and tricks that you can use right way. Another book I'd recommend to any photographer.

With the advent of the digital format many amateur shooters wondered whether they would have to learn a brand new language. A majority of amateurs are photo enthusiasts who hate anything that looks even suggestively mathematical, such as aperture, lens speed, exposures and yes, even ASA ratings. This book moreso than the preceding edition, cuts to the chase in simplifying how to obtain perfectly exposed digital photos. In down to earth language with lots of illustrative photos, the reader receives the message clearly. That some of the pictures are of photogenic members of the author's family makes this book communicate even more, especially since most of us sooner or later also take family pictures. We graciously accept the fact that family pictures are judged subjectively and included in the book only for their illustrative value. Does the book achieve its goals?

I liked the way Petersen presented his information. He showed examples of more than one technically accurate exposure with different settings. He doesn't just give you a formula for a scene.

I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book has gotten hundreds of glowing reviews on Amazon. Fair enough. There's lots of good information here. But I found the author's writing style distracting and annoying. Learning that an f/8 to f/11 aperture is the best choice when focal distance doesn't matter was helpful; having him refer to them three or four dozen times as \\"'who cares?' apertures\\" is not. Ditto his other signature phrases repeated (and italicized) throughout: \\"Brother Backlit Sky,\\" \\"Brother Reflecting Sky,\\" \\"Mr. Green Jeans,\\" etc.The over-indulgent editing doesn't stop there. He provides generally informative background and technical info for many of the photos, but the narratives are tired: \\"Although I was tempted to leave, I decided to be patient and was soon rewarded,\\" \\"I wasted no time turning my attention to this wonderful abstract photo opportunity,\\" \\"If you're like me, you welcome spring with great enthusiasm,\\" blah blah.And I definitely could have done without the \\"my beautiful wife\\"-in-a-pink-string-bikini two-page image and/or the wife lingerie & cleavage shot.If you're someone who appreciates good writing in addition to good information, I think there are better choices out there for your first book on photography.

It has a very systematic explanation of the range of creative exposures from story telling shots, to isolated subject, to freezing motion, and blurring motion. It really covers the basics.The big learning for me is that before I take a shot now, I think which creative exposure do I want to create. And the second thing I learned how to increase my chances of getting a correct exposure.I have read similar information elsewhere but it's the step by step that makes it really useful."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is written in a clear, user friendly style and the author sounds like a really nice person, but to tell the truth the advice he gives about exposure I learned by spending about a half hour with my friend when I was 15. And it's a lot better to learn this stuff while doing it than from a book. I guess the photos are good examples, but not any better than most people's who know the very basics of aperture, speed, ISO settings, and depth of field. What I don't understand is why the author--who is a pro--failed to mention the role of tripods in long exposure shots, so while he says that a 1 sec. exposure at let's say f16 is the same as f4 at 1/30 sec., he doesn't mention that a 1 sec exposure opens yourself to camera shakiness & blurring. There's a page on using a tripod, but nothing specific. He doesn't spend much time at all on explaining focal lengths of film vs. digital cameras, which is also important. I only mention these things because I'd hate to see someone take a bunch of photos without this knowledge and end up with unexpected consequences."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"After having read several books on photography, this it the one that has clearly shown me the use of the different exposures. Peterson dwells on what each aperture range, and shutter speed range, is good for. There are many photos in the book, and next to each, a short explanation of how it was taken, and what settings were chosen.Peterson makes a great teacher.There is a weakness in this book, in my view, and that is the missed chance to explain a bit of the optics and physics. Not that this needed to be a technical book, but a few diagrams and a few numbers would have gone a long way to dispel some confusion.For instance, Peterson at one point describes \\"stops\\", the settings in the camera that double (or half) the exposure. For instance, a jump in shutter speed from 1/30s to 1/60s is one stop. So is a jump from ISO 400 to ISO 800. For apertures, though, the numbers look like f/4, f/5.6, f/8, much less intuitive.It would not have killed the author to explain that to double the surface area of the aperture, one needs to multiply the diameter by the square root of 2 (approx. = 1.4). This is simple geometry, available to most.Then it would be clear that f/5.6 = 4 * 1.4, is one stop down in exposure from f/4.Peterson explains exposure by comparing it to a faucet. If you open it wider, more water comes out, and less time is required to fill your glass. OK, but most people would have understood that if you let in twice as much light, you require half as much time to record an image on the sensor.Depth of field and it's dependence on aperture is VERY easy to explain with a simple diagram. Another missed chance.Another example: ISO. The metaphor here is that ISO is like bees, and more ISO equals more bees collecting honey, so they get done quicker. So why does higher ISO increase the noise and granularity of your photo?If Peterson had included a bit of technical information, I would have recommended this book as the best one-stop resource. As it stands, I can just say it's very very good, but you need supplements. Kudos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great book to read to learn how to take accurate exposures. The author does a fine job of explaining the concepts clearly with good enough illustrations (photographs or exposure if you will) to buttress his point. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to go beyond the point and click auto paradigm of modern DSLRs."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book for beginners like myself. That's why I think the product description on Amazon is for the wrong book: \\"For serious amateur photographers who already shoot perfectly focused, accurately exposed images but want to be more creative with a camera, here's the book to consult.\\"This is the book for anyone BUT the person who can \\"already shoot perfectly focused, accurately exposed images.\\" In fact, the book starts out explaining basics, like what is aperture, don't be afraid of \\"M\\" manual mode, etc. So, IGNORE Amazon's description and know that this is a useful book to teach the basics, help you to get to know your camera, and learn some tricks and tips to take better photos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Awesome book. he speaks my language.

The essence of it struck a cord with me. I wanted to get this book and discover further about the author insights.I have taken photographs for many years, under many different situation with the main objective being to advance my skills and capture better photos. Since the author had beautiful award winning photos, I wanted to know further about his methods concerning explaining relationships of aperture, shutter speed and film/ digital speed (ISO/ASA) which he considered the cornerstone of making (his ) magnificent photos. Called the \\"photographer's triangle,\\" the main idea is to perfect this \\"trifecta\\" of methods (aperture, shutter speeds, and ISO/ASA). I was hoping that I would find fresh beneficial ideas that might benefit myself as well as other photographers. And I was glad I did.This book is only 160 pages but is loaded with information within the six chapters and the index. Don't expect a series of tutorials for relaying the information. What this book offers is a set of insightful and easy to grasp notions that expand your knowledge of photography, photographic methods and the ideas which involve creating photograph in general.The way the author writes is a like an \\"unfolding story.\\" The ideas and methods actually intertwine and integrate along the way. Each idea has at least one of the author's superb photos that immediately \\"pops out at you.\\" He weaves his ideas and explains how the final product created this award winning photo. Basic information is included along with the final exposure and additional information. Several times the focus also includes how the photo were initially created and then gradually transformed into a \\"better photo\\" and why. One or more photos show the \\"before and after\\" effects.This book is not only enlightening but extremely instructive. Along the way to reading this beautiful books, there is information concerning polarizing filters, double and multiple exposures. Instead of reading this book as a speed reading course, you \\"digest it slowly \\" and \\"think about what is being said.\\" In this day in age, where speed is everything, this is a welcome read.This book is not a \\"pocket guide\\" but a \\"full meal deal.\\"This definitely is a book that you \\"slowly digest.\\" If you desire to learn about photography and take your time learning, this is a great book from an award winning photographer. While it might take a little time to finish the book , most will learn from the author's methods and his ideas.The best way to learn from this book is to read the information, think about the photos and then how it might relate to your photos that you have taken in the past or want to take in the future.

I have never taken a class and have just picked up bits and pieces here and there. I had a very vague understanding of Exposure.I basically understood aperture and shutter speed and how they went together but I must admit my use of my light meter was not what it should have been -- I didn't put the pieces together...This book completely demystified exposure for me.There is certainly more to be learned but for the first time I \\"get it.\\"I read the entire book in an evening and went out the next day and had a blast shooting pictures even though it was midday and the light was crappy. While I couldn't fix the lighting I had a lot of fun experimenting with the things I learned in the book and ended up getting a nice shot of a bald eagle by chance. That shot would have been too soft based on my old shoot habits but by applying the \\"who cares?\\" rule I new exactly what aperature I wanted.I used to shoot Ap. Priority or Shutter priority most of the time. I love Manual now! Though all three have their place I was afraid of the big M before.Finally the other things I learned incidentally from this book are that a polarizing filter is essential equipment (probably an ND filter as well). I just ordered a B W polarizing filter.This book also inspired me to throw away my crappy cheap tripod and ordered a Bogen because I now want to experiment with shots that will force me to use my tripod more.For me this book was the key that unlocked the concept of Exposure for me."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is what I had expected - clear explanation on how to choose the creative exposure. As a novice in SLR, I find this book a must before read other books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The beauty of Understanding Exposure is by the time you finish reading it you will know how aperture, shutter speed and ISO interact to make the 'right photo'. You will confidently be able to set your camera to Manual Mode and begin taking pictures by using the meter in the viewfinder to adjust aperture or shutter speed based on the type of picture you are trying to take. And, it was the first book I read that simply explained what the 'mysterious' ISO really is.A great read, along with Bryan's other books. You will want to go out and practice what you are learning."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book came highly recommended and is a good book for beginners, and would be a great book for beginners starting out with color film photography. It is clearly written and does a good job of covering all of the basics. It is also a good book for people who have only ever used \\"point and shoot\\" cameras.Someone who started out with a camera that used an external light meter, or even on a manual camera will find that 95% of the material in this book is review. While concepts such as stopping down to increase depth of field, or changing the shutter speed to control blur are important basics, they are indeed basics which anyone with a modicum of experience should already know.There were some interesting techniques that I picked up from this book like taking exposure readings off of the sky, and compensating when most of the subject matter is green.The book is a bit dated when it comes to digital photography, most of his comments are about fairly primitive point and shoot digitals.I passed my copy on to a friend who is just beginning photogtraphy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I understand the basic concepts of shutterspeed, aperture, iso and lighting. Looking at the reviews I was looking for this book to take me to the next level - teach me how to meter a situation, give more indepth undertanding of advanced equipment and lenses etc. This book was a good read but disappointed me on those fronts.I really loved \\"John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide\\" which did provide me with all that information and has become my defacto reference for now."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Learning about photography, this is a great first time /review of things you for got and thing you just didn't know how book.very helpful."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I used 3 criteria for measuring this book. 1) How well the information was conveyed. 2) How well I was able to use that information to take better pictures. 3) How much did it enhance my overall knowledge base?1) IMO Peterson does an outstanding job conveying the basics of the what, how, and why we do what we do with settings on our camera such as aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and so forth. I absolutely LOVE and adore his writing style. When I sat down to read his book, I couldn't put it down. It's written like a webpage (for the most part) with only a few paragraphs of text on each page, but Peterson is able to cut to the chase and clearly explain in detail how things like aperture work and how to enhance your photos.What makes Peterson's style so appealing to me is that he is very intelligent. His tone is very warm and inviting. I felt as if my best friend had invited me to his house on a warm sunny day to talk about photography. Because Peterson is so warm and open, many people are offended by this. When he talks about how much money he made on such and such shoot (which he only did on two occasions), I take this as an extension of his warmth and openness, like an Uncle who is talking about what he did X number of years back on a photo shoot. Other people see this as either a waste of valuable text space or braggadocio. Whatever the case, if you read the book from front to back, you will understand why he says what he says and why he uses the tone he does.2) It's been two months since I finished reading Understanding Exposure and I can honestly say I don't think Mr Peterson's tips have helped. They have helped somewhat in that I know that F8 and F11 are \\"don't care\\" type of stops. It helped me when I was talking photography with my Uncle this past week so it made me feel like I was knowledgeable in the subject. However, when I try to put Mr Peterson's hints and tips on how to shoot waterfalls with at least 1/8 sec shutter speed, the photo's colors were way off.It's not really fair to blame Mr Peterson for my inability to improve my shot. Sometimes it's the user to blame, and in my case, because I'm inexperienced (I just bought my Nikon D40 in October) it may be because I'm just not familiar enough with my camera controls. What was distressing to me was the obvious lack of information on digital cameras. Mr Peterson acknowledged the fact that F4 on a film camera is not the same as F4 on a digital SLR. Unfortunately what Mr Peterson did not make clear to me, was what I had to do on my camera to compensate. What will F4 look like on my digital SLR as opposed to his film camera? Will there by any difference? I don't get any answers. Mr Peterson spent over 90% of his time talking about film cameras and how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO work on them.Yes, Mr Peterson does address digital cameras in his book, but they feel like addendums attached to the main body of work. He needs to make digital the primary focus in order to make the most impact.3) Understanding Exposure has been a great book to read, because it allows you to understand the basics of what goes on inside your camera. This is the reason I give this book 4 star rating instead of only 3. I love Mr Peterson's passion for photography and his easy, open, warm style of delivery. Because of this book, I feel more passionate about photography, and I feel more confident. I feel like I can hold my own in a conversation about photography basics which is important. Understanding Exposure will definitely increase your knowledge base and understanding of photography in general. However, how well that translates into actual better pictures I cannot say."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"i am glad i bought this book. i just purchased a nikon d50. i have learned a lot about exposure and i am now shooting in manual mode a lot more.this is a great book for a beginner."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Not too much text for you to read.

Simple yet effective tool to get a good exposure.When shooting during a bright day meter off the sky and recompose and ignore your light meter on the camera. Meter to the side of the sun for sunsets and sunrise and then recompose.Who Cares aperture (F/8 or F/11) use these when you need critical sharpness and contrast such as person against a wall, side of building etc.All kind of basic stuff but very helpful hints and tips.For the current price of $15 this edition is worth it and it translate to either digital or film"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've been having my eye on this book, and finally picked it up last week. After just reading the first 40 or so pages, I felt like I learned so much more than I ever have while just experimenting with my camera. The concept of exposure has had me completely baffled, with all those numbers and what they mean, and now it all seems so much easier! I've had the Canon Digital Rebel XT since last November, and 99% of the time use it in auto mode. I have a strong feeling, however, that when I finish with this book I'll have a much better command and understanding of the manual modes. So far it's been a revelation, finally all the numbers click! This is definitely the best photography book (out of many) I've invested in. If you're having trouble grasping the concept of apertures and shutter speeds and f stops, do not hesitate to purchase this book. Everything is explained thouroughly and is easy to understand, and Peterson's photos are gorgeous and very inspiring."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is obviously written for a wide audience with different equipment that includes film cameras, basic digital cameras (but possessing some type of manual control) and advanced digital SLRs. There were many useful points throughout the book covering the intelligent usage of shutter speed, aperture and metering. Concisely he reviews the basics of each and builds on them so that even an advanced amateur such as myself with my trusty Nikon D100 will have gained a greatly improved usage of each. The one downside to the book was the writing style was sometimes too simplistic and Mr. Peterson tried to cover too broad an audience. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here and recommendations from photography message groups. This book gives insight to exposure but it is basic, really basic. BUT the biggest issue that I had was that it seemed that in every situation, I should setup a tripod, adjust aperature and shutter speed manually. That may work for advanced or professional photographers but not someone that doesn't have a half an hour to take a picture. I also needed a book that gave me quick insights to how to set up a picture for taking pictures in dark environments. I found that I prefered John Hedgecoe's new manual of photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I took a full year photography course in high school. I never realized how much I learned in that course until I started reading these \\"highly rated\\" photography books. I'm by no means a professional. I would classify myself as a serious amateur. If I knew absolutely nothing about shutter speed, ISO, and f stops, this book would present me with a really good foundation on those subjects. However, I had already learned a good amount of information on shutter speed, ISO, and f stops and I was hoping that this book would cover more advanced techniques in lighting, and that it would give more examples on \\"tricky\\" or advanced \\"exposures\\".If you just bought a digital camera or if you shoot film, and you have absolutely no idea what shutter speed, ISO, and f stops are and how they relate to one another, then I think you will benefit from this book. If you already know what shutter speed, ISO, and f stops are then I don't think you'll learn a great deal from this book.The book however is great for reference and the pictures are worth the price of the book anyway. I didn't say I disliked the book, I was just hoping for more. I think the title should be Understanding Exposure for the new photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is just a great book. I found it very well written. Some people called it basic info. But if you are a pro, then you don't need this book. But if you just started photography, or you just didn't get the idea of Exposure, then this book is going to explain it well to you...I do recommend this to entry-level and photographers that want to increase their knowledge and skills taking better shots.."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Understanding Exposure had me shooting in manual mode in under 10 minutes. It is incredibly easy to do once you know how. Also getting to know about your cameras metering system will help you advance your photography ten fold. This is a must read book for new photographers. Just got your new DSLR? Just get this book, period!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is one of the only instructional texts I've ever read cover-to-cover. Admittedly, that was painful at times, but I managed. I have mixed feelings about the value of having made the effort.Part of the problem is the misleading title and product description, both on Amazon and on the book itself. This is NOT a book for someone who can already reliably make satisfactory exposures, nor is it expansive enough to be justifiably called \\"Understanding Exposure\\". I needed basic instruction on some subjects covered by the book, but if I were a more experienced photographer seeking advice on advanced exposure techniques, I'd be tremendously frustrated with this book. Even at my level of experience, I occasionally found it to be pretty over-simplified.And yes, the writing style is truly insulting and juvenile.I also had some theoretical problems with the treatment given to photography in general. \\"It's easy to make pretty photos, which can be sold! Hooray for boring-but-lucrative stock images!\\"I still give it three stars because the challenge it presents - that of sifting through a lot of crap in order to determine what information is really useful - is part of the deal with most how-to books. While there are some gaps and inconsistencies (the discussion of metering is slapdash and really quite useless), it still helpfully describes the basic components of successful exposure, which makes it an acceptable reference text for the beginner."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book itself is very much advisable, both for beginners and for little bit more experienced photographers. A great variety of different circumstances of exposure are illustrated in an excellent manner. Worth every penny.The books were, however, slightly bruised during the shipping. The shipping package for three books was oversized and there was no filling whatsoever to cover the books. Clear minus for Amazon.The shipping (economy) was, however, quick indeed. Plus for that."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is an absolute eye opener for people like me who are just stepping into SLR or Pro level photography..you learn about the basics of an exposure: Aperature, Shutter speed and ISO..The only problem I can think of with the book is that the basics about metering have been discusses a little too late in the book though Bryan himself considers light to be the heart of the photography triangle..but still a great book"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a wonderful asset to anyone wanting to go from a 'point and shoot' method of photography using automatic settings to manually tweaking the shutter speed, ISO, and aperture of a SLR type camera. If you are the type of person that wants to truly comprehend the hows and whys of photography and actually capture the image as you see it in your mind's eye, then this is the book for you.Before this book I read at least 6 (probably more) photography books cover to cover and still didn't 'get' exactly how the photographic triangle of ISO, shutter speed and aperture work. This book explained it, taking it one concept at a time, and offered beautiful visual examples of the concepts he's presenting. It is a fabulous first course in photography from a motivating teacher.5-stars, A+, This is no contest the best introduction into the world of manual SLR photography I found. It took my photography to a completely new level. If you are already a professional, adjusting your aperture and shutter speed without a second thought and obtaining the perfect results, this isn't the book for you. If you want to get to that level, it is."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is by far in my 10 years as a hobby photographer the best instructional, sample oriented, informative read I have come across. Since my purchase of this book by Bryan Peterson I have purchased 2 additional titles authored by him, Learning to See Creatively: Design, Color & Composition in Photography, as well as Beyond Portraiture: Creative People Photography. If either of these books are representative of the Understanding Exposure title, I will have certainly found my favorite Photography book author. With many examples given, reasoning for why pictures were taken and the thoughts represented for the composition given for each photo in this book, this book is a wealth of knowledge for any photographer at any skill level. Instead of being lost in a sea of complicated verbiage and theory, Bryan writes in a straight forward manner that is easily understood and absorbed. This is the 9th photography related book I have purchased and by far has been the best."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Plain and simple I have not used my camera in automatic mode since I picked this book up! The manual modes are so much more creative! A very nice well written book, that will have you learning and trying new things with your camera, that you never dreamed possible!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book has taught me how to shoot in manual setting on my camera! Wonderful!Beautiful picture illustrations too!!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Exposure is very important to the outcome of opening and closing a shutter. This book brings out all the important things you need to think about before recording a picture on a digital sensor or film. Bryan Peterson has been all over the world recording pictures and shows you how you can improve your pictures by understanding the importance of the hole (aperture) in the front of the lens. Depth of field is one thing I learned over 30+ years ago when I started out with my first SLR. It can make or break a picture. Read this book and you to will learn the importance of depth of field along with a lot of other useful information."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book provides an excellent survey of the topic for any beginner. All aspects of exposure, from shutter speed and aperture to filters and the relative benefits of film vs. digital are discussed. The book is very well and succinctly written. The photographs accompanying the text vividly illustrate the concepts discussed (i.e., the photographs discussing aperture and depth of field very well illustrate the impact of larger apertures on depth of field). An excellent introduction for the beginner. For those beyond the novice stage, however, the book would provide almost no information that they would not know. This book was clearly written for the beginner in mind."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"There are photo books and theeeeen there are photo books. I have found this to be very well written and illustrated. Each topic is usually short and to the point. The photos make you want to rush out and get some similar results. Numerous technigues are shown, some that I would not use right now but later on as I grow as a photographer could very well try. Trying new things is a sign of growth and this book really attempts to promote that.Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book on Exposure is a 10 star. Bryan Peterson is a must read for all who want to understand photography. He writes clear understandable steps and he gets to the point.Many books on photography go on and on about the story of the shotUnderstanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any Camerarather than give you instructions not Bryan Peterson there is a little story about the shot and a lot of instructions. No matter where you are in your abilities you will learn from him."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've had a pretty advanced Nikon camera for 2 years now, and had only scratched the surface of it's capabilities. I decided that now is the time to take full advantage of it and take better shots using settings other than automatic. This book provides an excellent background on the basics of exposure as it relates to aperture, shutter speed, and ISO - some daunting subjects - and does so in a really easy to read manner. Love this book & highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I got interested in photography about three years ago. I started with fixed lens cameras and graduated to DSLR cameras. I realized I needed more information in order to get the quality of photos I wanted. Digital camera design was a carry over from from film cameras. I obtained some film cameras (there are many excellent used SLR cameras available at a fraction of the original cost). The film cameras made me realize I needed more information. Enter Exposure, it was recommended by a discussion group I am a member of. I am still reading and rereading it. The book is a good starting point for film and digital camera operation. I am now taking much better photos and I have a better grasp of the process thanks to this book. I highly recommend it to anyone just starting out."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I think this book is wonderful. I haven't even finished reading it yet and I already have learned so much. I am a self taught photographer and love how easy it makes shooting in manual mode. It breaks things down step by step and concept by concept. Tells you why you would use a certain setting over another. I love the creative approach."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was a pretty good read. It isn't as basic as the Scott Kelby books, but it is more indepth. He uses a lot of photographs to help explain whatever subject he talking about as well as giving the details of the shots. It's a good book if you are fairly new to photography. If you've been shooting for a while and figured a lot of it out by tial and error, this may not be the best book for you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The revised edition of UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE is outstanding, using the author's professional photography as examples for explaining the basics of light, shutter speed, and results. Tips on great shooting using either film or digital camera supplement photo examples and make this an outstanding survey for any basic photography collection!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am new to photography and needed something to get me started. This book was great. Peterson gives great easy to remember tips and techniques. I have read much of this information online but it was never explained in the manner that he explains it in. He uses helpful analogies that really make the concepts easy to grasp. I would highly recommend this book for any beginner/intermediate photographer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book. I wish I had read this years ago. The author took complex information and explained it in a way that is much easier to understand. Some sections take a little more concentration and applied learning to really achieve a full understanding. The average person should be able to take this book and gain a great deal of knowledge. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent book for beginners or even advanced photographers. If you are only going to buy one photography book, this is the one to get. It teaches the reader how to capture photographs with perfect exposure, even in difficult lighting conditions. This is one of the things that seperate the pros from the amateurs. It also covers the creative uses of aperature and shutter speed. My photographs improved greatly after reading this book, and I still find myself going back to it for reference. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I couldn't put this book down! Page after page, there was a nugget of wisdom. Sure, things that I already knew were covered, but that served as a foundation to get me to the new wisdom and techniques to try. I particularly liked that each concept has multiple photos with an explanation of \\"I chose this F-stop because...and I metered at X spot because...and then I used this technique/filter in order to...\\" The writing style takes you through the concepts like a conversation; it's very easy to understand.I've had a digital SLR for a year and a half; before that I took some very lucky shots with a fixed lens digital camera, but I've never been a film buff. I've taken a camera class and a workshop; I'm in a camera club and try to get out and practice photography sometimes, but most often use my travels as my practice ground. This book was perfect for the stage I am at and I can't wait to get out and try a few of the suggested exercises.The editor's review says this covers infrared, bounce-flash, and candlelight, but those aren't in there. Lots of good stuff in there, but don't buy it for those topics!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Great book for beginners. It covers many tips, but mainly on 35mm film camera. Peterson should consider to write with Digital SLR perspectives to sell more books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I just got this book a few days ago. I learned more reading the first few chapters than I learned taking photography classes. He answers a lot of questions many are afraid to ask or questions that you didn't know you had. Wonderful wonderful book. It is concise and gets right to the point without a lot of unnecessary verbage. This is one of the first photography books that I have bought that I have not been disappointed with. I really can't say enough good things about it. Can't wait to go out and try out some of the new skills I have learned."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book has good information for the novice to intermediate photographer abouut exposure, but it reads a little dry. I have tended to skip through the chapters looking for certain topics rather than reading from beginning to end, as it does not lend itself to sitting down and reading that way.The information presented in the book is very helpful, however, and I have gained a lot from the lessons I have learned so far..."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I was very disappointed in the book and will be returning it. My book had a copyright date of 2004 and was a \\"revised edition\\". The author talks about taking a \\"creative correct exposure\\" but he severely limits the concept to outdoor photography. Aperture, shutter speed and ISO are only the beginning. The book DOES NOT address flash photography. The word \\"flash\\" does not even appear in the index. Understanding how and when to use a flash, indoor or outdoor, is a very important concept in taking creative correct exposures. I was left with many unanswered questions after reading this book. To summarize the book; take pictures in manual mode and learn how to use the camera's exposure meter. Search the internet for more information and save your money."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you need to know how to properly expose a photo, either with film or digital, the knowledge you need is in this book. Bryan Peterson explains everything in detail, from apertures and shutter speeds, to how to meter a scene. The photos usually illustrate his point perfectly, and they're pleasing to the eye to boot.So, why not a 5-star rating? Well, Mr. Peterson's writing style leaves a little to be desired. I constantly felt like he was talking down to his readers. He uses childish analogies and includes rather silly stories from his past. If I was in one of his classes and he taught it with the same tone as his books, I'd have to drop out. And seeing how this book was written several years ago, the part on digital is pretty outdated. I also noticed that the captions explaining the equipment and settings used are not always correct. These are minor complaints, though. Just skip over the boring parts of the text and get to the good stuff, and you'll love the book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this book after reading good reviews about it in a photography forum.When I got it I just couldn't put it down.First of all, the photos are AMAZING! Full with live saturated colors. These are photos of the kind that makes me say WOW... and believe me I said wow on every page turn.I liked a lot the presentation of the material. I found the accompanying photos very helpful in understanding the text in every topic.What is nice is that the texts are short and the accompanying picture(s) are indeed worth a 1000 words.The photos and text complement nicely and reading this book made me want to leave everything else that I wanted to do, grab my camera and try to practice the wealth of material.As an amateur photographer this was a great 1st book on photography to read.I also bought all the other books from Bryan Peterson and those were just as fun, just as useful and just as amazing."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"this book is better than a class. read it and you will understand the sacred mysteries of iso, aperture, and exposure, with plenty of real-world examples and an easy-to-understand style that's just technical enough without being dry. tip: before going on to the next chapter, complete your \\"homework\\" assignments. only downside is it's a bit big to take into the field with you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book based on several other recommendations. This book is well written, easy reading and explains all aspects of exposure. Bryan Peterson the author explains what aperture is and when and why you would want to use it, as well as shutter speed and when or why to use that as well as a great section dealing with lighting issues. He also provides some simple exercises to help you understand the concept. The book is also not biased toward either digital or film based photography, and also not biased towed an SLR or a point and shoot. The author does a great job of explaining some of the differences between the two (for me since I have both digital SLR and point and shoot, it was an, ah ha, that's why). I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This was great to get me going. It was inspirational with the photos included and very pragmatic as well. I'm definitely a beginner, but it helped me understand much of the terms I see online and gave me things to come back to as I continue on the fun of photography!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent book. It has enhance my knowledge about exposure greatly. It discuss the interrelationship between aperture, shutter speed, film(ISO) and how they are used to get correct exposure as well as creative correct exposures under different types of light and color.I recommend this book for all beginners as well advanced photogs such as myself who want to enhance their photog skills."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Really the best primer on how to take good pictures. Since reading this book I have not shot in auto mode. You could pay $50 and take an intro class at a local rec center or camera shop and you would not learn as much as you would from this book (at least that was my experience)."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Absolutely the BEST book on the subject of Exposure. You will actually understand A and S and M when you finish this book. Easy to read, very understandable and it even has some great \\"lesson's\\" you can go out and try in the field.If you own a digital camera that allows you to set aperture, shutter speed or both...and you want to understand (truly understand) how to use these controls and how to control your depth of field...Get the book!I have re-read this book 3 times!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"this book is very easy to understand and to comprehend the complexity of proper exposure. i definately recommend it as a must read."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am new to DSLR photograhy and this book does a great job explainging the relationship between Aperture, Shutter, and ISO."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"love the ppl who recommended this book were right..i am just starting photography and this book is well worth it ..it is written so you can understand it and apply it with not much expirence."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"With \\"Understanding Exposure\\", Bryan Peterson gives the amateur photographer an indispensable tool and learning guide. With the help of full color photos taken with different settings as well as clear and concise descriptions and explanations of technique mr Peterson gives the reader an easily understandable introduction to the world of exposure.Because of the great detail in which the different photo situations and techniques are covered it is indeed very easy to go out and reproduce the photos from the book (well, that kind of photo anyway) yourself after reading.This book gave me much more knowledge about photography than I would have expected it possible. It definitely helped me progress as a photographer.Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I truly think you can learn more by reading this book over one weekend than spending the entire weekend shooting photos. Some think you learn more by practice which can be true, but with as many controls as they put on cameras this day in age, sometimes it is better to learn first, and practice later.Regardless of whether you're a digital photographer or not, you could definitely use this book. I read it twice over the first two weeks I had it and still read it once every couple of months, simply because it's good to brush up on things you don't use very often. Filled with great advice, and inspiring pictures, I believe this one should be on everyone's shelf."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Well, I am not an expert in the photography area but I have read some books and several web pages related to this issue and I have to say this is an excellent book, I already know the basis but the way the author put in practice all this stuff it's really great, the pictures are beautiful and the explanations of each one are so simple, It's seems that you are taking a practical course right there and not only reading a theoretical book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I certainly enjoyed the book, learned a few new tricks (thank you), but was slightly put off by two things. The first was repeated references to something further in the book (i.e. Mr. Green Jean and the Sky Brothers). Why not just introduced these concepts earlier in the book, to make the learning process flow. Secondly, Bryan makes repeated references to \\"presetting the focus via the distance setting on front of the lens\\". However, Bryan does not explain / elaborate on the rationale behind selecting a preset focus on your lens. Yes it's nice to know that everything will be in focus, but I also would like to know what \\"preset\\" value was used (in the shot) and how the author knew to use that value....."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"With this book, and because of this book I can easily say I take better pictures. I own a Canon G10. I got sick of owning a $500 camera that I never took of Auto Mode. After buying this book, I planned on doing a cross country drive. Stopping at the Grand Canyon, Colorado River, doing some hiking in Utah. After reading this book, I learned how to operate my camera in Manual, how shutter speed, ISO, Aperture go hand in hand with each other. Learning this, I've taken some amazing shots that I will gladly hold on to for the rest of my life. It might have been luck of the draw, but while I was changing the dials to make sure I was getting the correct exposure, I can't help but think it's this book that helped me understand it all.A million times thank you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"What separates good photos from great photos? More often than not, the answer is exposure. Not just whether a picture is too dark or too light, but the way exposure settings can affect things like composition, movement or even getting the shot at all.Fortunately, there's Bryan Peterson. In his best-selling guide \\"Understanding Exposure,\\" Peterson \`exposes' (sorry, we couldn't help it) the secrets of obtaining the best, most impactful photographs using exposure, lighting, shutter speed and aperture to bring out the best in your photos. Peterson is quick to point out the difference between the so-called \`correct' way of taking a picture versus the \`creatively correct' way to obtain the image.The result is a series of improvements that may sometimes not be technically correct, but end up creating images that otherwise might never be seen. The book is divided into easy to understand sections on the main topics of lighting, shutter speed, etc., but the examples and techniques are both specific and broad enough for any lensman to see an improvement by utilizing many of these tips and tricks. If there is one essential guidebook for dealing with the tricky issues associated with lighting, action, composition and exposure, this is the one to have."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I'm currently enrolled in my first basic (digital) photography class at my local art institution. After my first class I realized that photography is much more scientific than I thought! I decided to get this book hoping that it facilitate my learning. It totally did! Peterson's writing style is consistent, clear and easy to read without comprimising his obvious expertise. He writes as if he is teaching you verbally in a real class. The ordering of the material feels a natural flow. Not to mention the fabulous examples he provides with his own images. (I especially love how he provides the actual metadata for EVERY image which is very helpful for future reference). Great book...highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"So, you know you use a larger aperture for a shorter depth of field. And you know large apertures have small numbers. But would you like to know why that is? Do you already know? If, indeed, you know these basic principles but not 'why' they exist, then you remind me of me, and I think you'll like this book. The photos are great, the book dimensions show them off well, and the descriptions are fantastic. It's not a dry, dull technical book...not does it overdo the, um, humor (ahem, Scott Kelby....). But it makes exposure make sense of a deeper level. Of course, if you don't an know aperture from a hand grenade, you'll probably like this, too. But, you don't have to be 'that clueless' to get something from this book. For me, it's reinforcing things I already know and helping me understand them a little more...and inviting me to really use my knowledge. The author evidently loves to shoot, and that enthusiasm is infectious. Don't worry that's it's too easy or too hard for you; just read it. I think it's been around forever...and books that stay in print that long tend to do so for a reason. (Recommended for film and digital, I will add that I am reading the revised edition, 2004, and am delighted that there is more information on digital than I expected. I do remain curious about the upcoming August 2010 edition, though.)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Exposure it one of the hardest technical things to learn about in taking high quality photographs. I learned it in High School in the 70's with an excellent teacher, and in College. I went on to really understand exposure and apply it on every photo.Today I am teaching Adult Ed Classes at the college on Digital SLR photography and I found this book perfect to help students grasp the concepts of exposure. I like the authors explanations and analogies, they make sense and make learning exposure more accessible to newer photographers.Even seasoned pros can use a refresher and a book to help fill in the gaps, and this book helps there too.This is not a super advanced guide, but very good basics for a foundation of taking better photos by understanding exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you can't afford a photography course then this is the book for you. If you did a photography course this is still the book to get. It has some basic pointers that will help you get better pictures.I really like it and now use mostly program modes (P,M,S,A).A great lesson for less than $20."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Too much of film technics; sky brother exposure tip does not work that simple; conflicting info, best sharpness at the smallest opening (page 37) or from f/8 to f/11 (page 56)?"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have both this book and Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide. I much prefer the latter book. Understanding Exposure was clearly written before DSLR's and, while some things haven't changed since the advent of digital, the book simply feels dated despite some updates. The Field Guide contains many of the same images and feels much newer.This isn't a *bad* book and Bryan Peterson does an excellent job of teaching photography techniques in either book, I just found the Field Guide to be superior."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a modest update of a book written years ago for the previous generation (film) cameras. While it contains many jewels of information about photography in general and parameters useful in deciding exposure philosophy I found it to be much less than I had hoped for as a convert to the digital format and a moderately experienced (amateur) photographer. I feel that it provides little value for the point-and-shoot cameras with only modest exposure adjustment capabilities. For the SLR shooter with the modern exposure metering systems, the author's adherance to a center weighted regime (which works very well for him) fails to do justice to the richness of the available technology. It could have been much more thorough for the digital devotee.For someone new to SLR photography I think this book would offer valuable insights to the thought processes of a legendary professional and as such, could recommend it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"OK, I love this book.After having used a compact camera for a few years and doing my best to understand all these shutter speeds, apertures and ISO, I decided I bought \\"Understanding Exposure\\" and two weeks later I was able to purchase a dSLR and actually understand it. As soon as other books by Petrson were published I ordered them as well.I'm not saying this is a book for everyone - even some reviews here will tell you that professionals are not particularly happy about it, but then, if you're a professional, you should understand exposure.What I'm saying is, if you want to decide whether you want to be serious about photography, get the book. If you want to switch from a compact camera to a dSLR, get it. If you already have a dSLR but you feel you want to understand it better, get it.Peterson is clear, encouraging and friendly. The explanations are fully illustrated and you will finally get the difference between f/2.8 and f/32. You will see when to use 1/500s and when to use 1/60s. You will understand what the ISO thing is all about.I have read it a few times and I still read it sometimes to learn everything.Best photography book I've ever seen."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Maybe I should have gotten this book first thing, but I just don't see the big deal about this book, It was somewhat informative, but really not much I hadn't already read online or in other books. It doesn't have any of those ah-ha moments or anything that just makes exposure 'click'. Since this book was recommended to me, I thought there might be some valuable info that I have been missing in order to get that perfect exposure and it just wasn't in there.I think this book is probably ok for your first photography learning tool, but if you have read other book and online through forums and such, you probably already know everthing this book has to offer."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am a photo enthusiast trying to learn photography. Purchased Nikon's high powered DSLR camera, then purchased 5 books on photography. This was one of the five I stumbled upon by accident. It surpassed the rest and is worth its weight in GOLD!! Everything is well explained. It's goal is to not only make you a better photographer, but also to help you understand the mechanics of a camera. It will exceed your expectations! Loaded with pointers, tips and tricks. Loved it! Informative/priceless:) -should cost more."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really had no idea about photography until I started reading about it. I had a camera, digital slr, but it just didn't make sense to me shooting pictures. I really wanted to take nice pictures, didn't have enough money to afford lessons so I decided to do it the practical way, reading about it. I started devouring everything written in the internet about it, but mainly when searching about photography in the internet most of the stuff you find is so technical and with very few visual exemplification.I bought a couple of books and finally bumped into Bryan's Understanding Exposure, it was amazing. His book had so many examples I could finally grasp the understanding of this vital concept in photography.After reading the book I went on a trip abroad in South America and applied most of the concepts he taught and I could really see a huge change in my photography. This book has really inspired me into becoming a professional photographer.Thanks Bryan!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is really old school basic photography from a true professional who knows what he is talking about. It will get you shooting in manual mode in no time. If you are still dependant on the automatic settings, you need this book to break free of your dependency.I am fairly new to serous photography (2 years), having spent over $10,000 in the latest cameras, lenses and lights the last 6 months (now that I finally understand what I really need) and have been spending considerable time reading as many books as possible on the subject; none of them come close to this book in really helping take better photos. If you have a good SLR, you really need this book to help you understand what it can do and why your shots are often lacking in simple clear terms that anyone can understand. This author really reminds you that it is not the high tech camera, but the skill of the photographer that makes the difference and that photography is truly an art that seems to be getting lost in the technology. I like the authors philosophy about taking the photo you want and not spending all your time on the computer fixing your mistakes...like I was at the start....he is so right.This book should be on the shelf of every photographer and be included as part of any digital photography class."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought a few books to help me go to that \\"next level\\" in digital photography -this book is it. It break it down so even I can understand it! Seriously - i returned all the others - this is the book to get your mind around the complicated issues of light and speed. It all makes sense. You will NEVER look at a picture the same way."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson is becoming my coach for photography. I own two of his books. This is the best book I have found for understanding exposure and it is very essential. For those wanting to understand the basics of digital photography, this book will be very helpful. Bryan teaches photography as well as being a professional photographer. In this book you receive concepts of exposure, example photos with his settings, and exercises for exploring exposure settings. He tells you how to calculate the correct f-stop & shutter speed for manual shooting. He also explains the different types of in-camera meter systems. Bryan also helps you to explore creative photography by experimenting with different exposure settings. A great book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a great place to start for a person who wants to understand the photohraphy past the point-and-shoot camera. Easy to understand and you will immediately want to try the techniques, use of which will mean an instant quantum leap in the quality of your pictures. I wouldn't mind if the book had 500 more pages to suck out more of Bryan Peterson's knowledge and experience. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to get to the bottom of the oft confusing world of camera settings and not get lulled to sleep by the second page."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Heck of a book. Some basic stuff, but it also shows many techniques that can stimulate your approach to exposure. In my opinion, some areas are five stars and others are four. Excellent pictures are presented throughout the book as examples of various exposure times."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book was definitely worth the money. The author simplifies complicated concepts and through innumerable examples, he makes the reader understand when andd where to use which modes. It wont make you a pro overnight, but it will definitely give you insight into becoming a better photographer.The examples he uses are very simple in terms of analogy so it makes the concepts very easy to understand. His pictures also give you ideas of what you can photograph and does make you a bit more creative. Overall I couldnt be happier with the purchase, the pictures are very good quality in full color and there are pictures on pretty much every page and take up quite a bit of the page thus you can see the results of his expertise. If you have an SLR and are a biggener or want a little bit more insight, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book was awesome. I read this book from front to back and it was easy to understand. I take better pictures and have a better understanding of my camera and its' features. I have read photography books before and have either have been more confused or never finished the book. Bryan Peterson's writing is great, easy to understand, and he takes you step by step into the \\"photography world\\""},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is excellent, well narrated and written. Very clear, excellent illustration. As good as it gets.The few small things to make it perfect:ISO setting provided for the photos in addition to apperture and speed. Since book is about understanding exposure, it would be nice to see the ISO settings too - all the details.Would like to see a little bit more details about light measurements, and not at the last chapter, but at the beginning. I was reading the book and couldn't understand why the author was getting the light reading from the sky and then recompose the shot, until in the last chapter where he finally explains. Would be nice to know from the beginning :)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I was left with somewhat of confusion on certain topics in the author's fist book but after reading this one everything fell into place. That could be mainly because I have quite a few years more experience now and a digital camera on top of that to practice more without waisting film and instant viewing. I really liked the parts in the book explaining where to take your metering for certain photos from! It's short and to the point with many examples, maybe too many leaving out room to explain a little more on some issues. This is why only 4 stars."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"One of my biggest problems in trying to find intro books is that none of them seemed very intro. I mean, people aren't born knowing what an f stop is. Perhaps I was merely looking in the wrong place, but this book explained to me how to use the manual setting on my camera in all sorts of situations, and how to figure out which settings are the best in various situations. What shuttle speed, aperture, light meter and ISO are, how they relate to each other, and what they will do in different instances. Some of the chapters titles made me wince with the cheese but overall this was a wonderful intro book. You may have to read it a couple times with camera and camera manual in hand but I don't think there's any book out there that will beam the knowledge directly into your head."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book does not offer you formulas or ready pills to swallow without understanding what you do but makes you understand the logic what you are trying to do. I believe it is probably one of the best book to learn and understand the photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book is very basic. It teaches you about aperture, shutter speed and ISO sensitivity. If you already know about the three, look elsewhere.The book basically tells you about the existence of depth-of-field, and stop-action and motion blur shutter - that's all.As I was finishing it, my only hope was that I got the wrong book, but alas, no mistake.Even as a beginners book, it had important things left out:- No clear explanation of what the aperture numbers are. It just tells you bigger number - smaller hole.- Should have talked about hand-held camera shutter seeds (minimum 1/focal length speed rule comes to mind). The whole book assumes the use of a tripod for its teaching.- Doesn't mention fill-flash for balancing light, although there is an extensive chapter about types and angels of light.- Although filled with many beautiful photos, only a couple of instances show comparison shots. The author hasn't made the effort to take good and bad pictures to compare and illustrate his point.- The author preaches about matrix metering, but emphasizes the fact that he only uses spot-metering. Spot-metering is not explained - it's too complicated and error prone, so use matrix metering. I thought this was what the book was all about!- The author doesn't make it very clear about \\"low key\\" and \\"high key\\" images and how the meter wants to put everything in the middle 18% gray. There was an attempt to explain this, but it was so simplified, that is was confusing.- No mention of the \\"zone system\\" for exposureThe internet has much more helpful info for free."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is an enjoyable, quick read. It contains many color plates, accompanied by text, that clearly demonstrate photographic choices such as (esp) depth-of-field, and shutter-speed.The book frequently presents sets of photographs of identical scenes, taken with automatic and manual camera settings, which are used to explicate the shortcomings of generic one-size-fits-all point-and-shoot (P&S;) camera automation that can frustrate artistic intent or expectations. More usefully, the book describes rules-of-thumb approaches using commonly available camera features that can compensate.Among the book's strengths is motivating why and when to depart from P&S; automation. As such, it may be especially useful to folks (like me) who are transitioning from a digital P&S; to a more capable camera.The book content avoids technical details, and offers good tips for an intermediate photographer, most accompanied by useful broad-brush techniques and memorable analogies that I have found helpful in my subsequent picture-taking. The book's focus is on taking \\"correct-by-design\\" pictures, with a bias against subsequent manipulation (digital or film), but does skim over such possibilities.On a negative note, I was somewhat disappointed that the technical specifications on several interesting pictures lacked complete EXIF-type information (usu: lens, ISO, lens/focal length, camera). Among other omissions, this lack makes it difficult to tell when a given photographc was taken with a true full-frame 35mm camera (APS) vs the common digital APS-C format, or something else, entirely.As an additional nit, the book suffers from its generality: I'd like to have seen more specifics on working through the flaws of a specific, less-capable (digital) camera+lens, as opposed to the approach taken which broadly distinguishes between film vs. digital but avoids details (presumably to avoid offending camera manufacturers).Finally, as a digital photographer, I definitely would appreciate more information on histogram/values interpretation, better guidelines on what is/isn't recoverable by post-processing, and in general, a slightly less purist approach to the world of fixing up pictures up after the fact.For folks new to the world of photography, I'd highly recommend this book. For folks with more experience, I'd suggest looking elsewhere (and let me know where!). For Amazon, how about a slightly more sophisticated system that allows reviewers to better express a newbie/intermediate/expert rating?"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is the book that finally helped me make the jump from auto and \\"P\\" mode to fully manual on my digital camera. I had tried many times, but this book explained the rationale and purpose behind various exposure settings so I saw the value of going manual. I have referred back to the book quite a few times to reinforce things. I would suggest it to anyone at the beginning or intermediate levels who want to improve their photography."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is great for the beginner or the amateur who needs a refresher course or just needs to gain an understanding of exposure. In my opinion, this is the first book that you should read when getting started in photography. A fundamental understanding of aperture, shutter speed and ISO as well as light metering are essential concepts on which everything you learn about photography is built. Without this book, you will struggle to gain control over your exposures. This book is equally as important for both the film and digital photographer.As far as the content goes, the explanations, instructions and excercises all correspond with beautiful color pictures that depict what it is that is trying to be explained or taught. You will not be disappointed here.Bryan Peterson is a world renowned photographer. However, his book was understandable and written in a way for the novice or hobbyest to comprehend. He further impressed me when he took the time to respond to some questions that I had after reading his book. He is truly dedicated to his profession and teaching others.This is a must read."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If, like me, you have bought endless books that claim to reveal the \`Secrets of Digital Photography' only to find that, apart from the pretty pictures, the most that they reveal is that we used to use something called \`Film', but, due to the wonders of modern technology we can now take pictures without it, or that they wax lyrical on subjects such as \`How to connect your camera to your PC' or how many photo programmes are available to make your pictures right after you have \`cocked them up' in camera, you will realise with what relief I started to read \`UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE' by Bryan Peterson.Here was a guy who was prepared to tackle my ignorance head on and reveal to me the true \`Secrets Of Digital Photography', I can honestly say, hand on heart that I now understand the relationship of Aperture to Shutter Speed to ISO, or what he calls the \`Photographic Triangle' and I at last understand what that thing was that the wedding photographer stuck up your nose at your cousins wedding as he measured the amount of available light.If you want to know about how light works, Bryan tells you in this book, if you want to know how to make \`Creative Exposures' it's all here, if you never knew how to get that \`Out of focus background' on a pin sharp foreground there are 7 pictures of his Dad with background coming more into focus with each shot and full chapter and verse on each exposure.Since reading the book I have 'Boldly gone' etc, trying my hand (with a fair amount of success) at 4 second night exposures, Macro photography, as well as portrait etc, I am conciously aware of the 'Rule of Thirds' and rarely use my camera on 'Auto' as I have more control over what my camera does if I use 'Manual'.As a retired teacher and \`Photographic Dabbler' turned serious photographer perhaps the thing that strikes a chord most with me is the fact that Peterson demonstrates immediately that not only is he a Pro Photographer but he is equally at home in the classroom and uses terminology that is calculated to stay in you memory and get you to your goal quicker, for instance he likens the ISO numbers to light gathering Bees, (You have to read the book) but I know that I will never forget the simile (if that's what it is) just as I never forgot that \`Gorillas Don't Always Eat Bananas' was a good way to remember the first five Sharp keys in music.Of course you have to want to learn this stuff, but if you are looking at Photography Books the likelihood is that you want to know it, if so you are in luck.I cannot recommend this book highly enough, I am not an expert in photography, that's why I bought the book, but I am no longer a dummy in photography and that is all due to Bryan Peterson."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you are trying to learn more about how to properly use exposure (i.e. aperture, shutter speed, and ISO) this is a fantastic book to begin with. It informs for the film and digital photographer. I have been taking photos for many years, but it has only been over the past couple of years that I became more of a professional. Despite this, I still struggled to understand some of the concepts such as the difference between a good exposure and a \\"creatively correct exposure\\" and what options I had.You learn how to expose for front-lit, back-lit, side-lit scenes, overcast skys, macro photography, motion, stationery objects, how to expose for bright scenes such as snow (grey card & 18% grey) and dark scenes such as night photography...you name it. Then Bryan Peterson tops it off with a sections on metering, special techniques and filters, and an analysis of film vs digital cameras.Understanding Exposure not only explained the basics in a conversational manner, but is also informed me of how the pros work and how to step up my photography to a higher level.This book has hands-on exercises that anyone can go through so that the reader has experience of all of the methods explained. Along with this, the book is FULL of color photos that show exactly what the end result could be. Where applicable, there are comparisons of before and after exposure adjustments so the reader may understand WHY they should make such changes.Where there is a difference between adjustments for digital versus film cameras, Bryan Peterson gives you the specifics of the difference and haw to adjust for it.It is a book every photographer should have!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A friend loaned me the older version of this book, and I was amazed at how much help it provided. Even though the old book was based around film cameras, the fundamentals that were taught and the example pictures were very, very helpful. This book is an almost complete update, with most sections rewritten, several new subsections added with specific information for digital users, and has a slew of new example photographs.This book is even better than the old edition, and expands on some of the topics that were only briefly touched on in the first book. One in particular that sticks out in my mind is that he explains the \\"don't care\\" apertures of F8 and F11 that he uses often. The old book mentioned it in passing, but I don't recall an explanation on why those apertures were useful. There is a short section on just that in this book and suggestions on when to use them.Full color photos are used throughout the book, and are a great help in understanding the concepts that he talks about. Each picture has a caption with the information used to take the exposure. He shows you the same picture with different settings so you can see the effects the settings have on the exposure.I find the book pleasant and easy to read. The tone and writing are very agreeable and easy to follow. While some aspects are technical, they are written in a manner that makes them easily understandable.This is all about how to capture the image, not processing of the image after it is captured. There is brief mention of pushing or pulling film and the effects it can create, but in general, this is about how to get take a proper picture. If you are looking for a book on how to process the picture after you have taken it, this is not the book for you.I can not recommend this book enough if you are interested in photography. I don't know how useful it would be for professionals, but for the person just starting out or serious amateur, I can't see how you could go wrong with this. While all of the information can be applied to SLR cameras (film or digital), the majority of it can be applied to the point and shoot cameras of either variety as well."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a book that every serious photographer should own--both for information and inspiration. I've had a copy of the original version of this book (1990) in my office since it was first published and it's worn to a frazzle. That's why I'm so thrilled that it has not only stayed in print this long, but also that Peterson has updated it.The first thing you'll notice when you read through this book is that Bryan Peterson is not just good at explaining the intricacies of good exposure in almost every conceivable situation (landscapes, close ups, portraits), but he is a world-class photographer. It's one thing to talk about manipulating depth of field or subject motion in theoretical terms, it's quite another to see the concepts demonstrated in masterful, creative and fun photographs. Bryan's photographs are fun, surprising and supremely well done. And the photos are so well chosen and so well done that even if the book was written in a language I didn't understand, I would get the points being made. His editors should be proud of that too. I also a professional photographer and author of many photo books includingThe NEW Joy of Digital Photographyand I often look to Bryan's fine photos for their inspiration.Getting good exposure is at the heart of making a good photograph. And you would think that with the auto-exposure systems built into both film and digital cameras that getting a good exposure would be a piece of cake. But as Peterson points out (and illustrates so nicely) there is a world of difference between getting a \\"good\\" exposure and getting the ideal \\"creative\\" exposure. Getting the ideal creative exposure requires careful consideration of how that exposure will affect things like depth of field, freezing or exaggerating motion, the color and quality of light and how your subject is presented.This book is not just about exposure, of course, but is a great source of information on various types of lighting, close-up photography, portraits, night photography, using a tripod and, most importantly, seeing creatively.I can't imagine making a serious study of photography and not having this book (and Peterson's classic book on \\"Seeing Creatively\\") nearby. Peterson is a gifted, funny and immensely talented teacher and photographer--more than willing to share all of his knowledge. As the author of many how-to books on photography myself, I have used Peterson's books as a constant source of information and ideas and I check my own facts against his regularly--I couldn't pay him a much higher compliment. As a photographer, I find myself looking at his pictures with great admiration and envy. His photographs are great. And by the way, \\"No!\\" I don't even know Bryan--except through his great books.Of course, with all of those kind words said (and I meant them), you might also want to look at my book on exposureExposure Photo Workshop: Develop Your Digital Photography Talent--I think they make good companion pieces.

I was let-down quite a bit by this book. I am a fairly-beginner photographer, perhaps maybe lower-intermediate. And, in all honesty, most everything in this book was kind of \\"blah\\" information. My biggest gripe is the following: the book is called \\"Understanding Exposre\\"... however, it should be called \\"Pointers for Exposure\\". Because, the best pieces of information that the author gives are not really explained (and, hence, they're not to be \\"understood\\" by the reader, but to be taken as gospel) but rather they're followed by statements such as \\"I learned this from my many years of photography, and trust me this works\\"! And that's a big problem for me-- not because I don't appreciate a great tip about exposure, but more because I was expecting to learn some valuable basics that would arm ME with the tools necessary to deduce, for a given lighting situation, how to best meter the light and determine the exposure. Instead, I've been given a laundry list of things to memorize for a given situation. Which, I guess, is great in the end-- and which is why my \\"REAL\\" rating for the book is a 4-- but just be forewarned that you will not really walk away from this book with a great UNDERSTANDING, though you may walk away with some good tips. Just my 2c."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Ever want to take your fancy camera off of Auto mode and explore those other mysterious settings: M, A, S? Ever struggle with understanding how to achieve a proper exposure? Then this is the book for you! Clear, concise and filled with gorgeous photographs by the author, this is the book on exposure I wish I'd had when I first began taking pictures a couple decades ago. Peterson jumps right in teaching the reader about what he terms the \\"photographic triangle\\" - how shutter speed, aperture and ISO (film speed) relate to one another and how they can best be used to not only make a correct exposure, but a \\"creatively\\" correct exposure. So why would I give this awesome book only 4.5 stars instead of 5? Because while Peterson hammers home the concept of the photographic triangle, the sample photographs contain information about aperture and shutter speed but no mention of what ISO he used. Considering how these settings directly effect one another it was a little disappointing to not have that information made available. Hopefully he will include this information in future editions. Still, don't let that minor quibble steer you away from this highly recommended book.One minor point worth mentioning: to get the most from this book you MUST have a SLR (single lens reflex) camera - digital or film. Today's popular point and shoot cameras have lenses that make selective depth of field nearly impossible (Peterson has a two page explanation as to why this is). While you can still get great pictures from a point and shoot, your creative options are severly limited if you want to, for example, isolate a subject against a blurry background. As the majority of this book is on not only proper exposure but using it creatively, I think quite a bit of information would be useless to those without an SLR camera."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Kudos to Bryan Peterson on the release of this long-awaited update to his 1990 classic, Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs. I've been recommending the original edition of this book to my DIGITAL photography students and on-line forum buddies for several years now, even though the original edition pre-dates the \\"digital photography\\" revolution. This new edition includes all the essential information from the earlier edition and brings it completely up-to-date with the inclusion of how this information is relevant to digital photography.Who should buy this book? This is a book for those interested in photography who want to take their photography to the next level. This book is for the hobbyist who is mostly using the camera's automatic settings, but is interested in using more of the camera's manual and semi-automatic modes to get better results. The author does a superb job of teaching the fundamentals of exposure in a simple and very easy to understand manner. This is usually an intimidating topic, but Mr. Peterson teaches it using every day language and examples. In no time, the reader will understand how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO are manipulated to get the right exposure and the desired photographic results.Beyond this, the author teaches the reader how to \\"approach\\" almost every conceivable photographic opportunity using the camera's semi-automatic modes (mostly aperture-priority). So not only does he teach the fundamentals of HOW exposure works, but he teaches WHEN to use one approach over another to achieve desired results. This alone is worth the price of the book!This book is beautifully written and generously illustrated with over 150 original color images from the author. The images really bring the concepts to life and are a source of inspiration for the reader.Who should not buy this book? If you are a seasoned photographer who has mastered the subject of exposure and is well versed in the use of aperture-priority, manipulation of depth of field, and metering, this book will be too basic for your learning needs.Again, kudos to Bryan Peterson on the release of this fine book. I am among the thousands of photographers who are very appreciative to Bryan for changing the way we approach a given photo opportunity and have taken our photography to the \\"next level.\\"Sincerely,jim henderson (the sandman on the forums)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Even though I've been informally an amateur photographer for several years, when I decided to make a living out of this profession, I needed some technical foundation in order to achive consistency and futher, inprove my skills.

Probably for beginners its fine, but once you've figured out the elements of depth of field, and the idea that metering will not provide the optimum exposure in all cases, there's not much else.If you're new to photography, take a look. If you've read any other books, or taken a few rolls of film, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE offers a solid introduction to principles for creating informed exposures. I've been taking photographs for years, but everything I've learned I picked up from experience. I thought, for the heck of it, I'd buy a book and see if I was missing something. In the end, it was worth the read, I learned a few tips, and found some inspiration to experiment.The book, however, is not without its quirks.On the positive side, the author does a curiously good job offering advice on formal decisions. While I don't agree with all of his judgments, I certainly applaud the effort and feel his comments are completely appropriate for the general public. Aesthetics can be tricky.The book is filled with the authors photographs, ranging from the amazing to the sappy. I enjoyed his descriptions and explanations, telling how he took many of the shots. I just wish he left out his licensing fees. Pointing out how many thousands he made from the various shots is really crass. I already bought your book... you don't need to show-boat. Strangely, a handful of pictures are of his wife, and I found myself wincing at most of them. Particularly given his descriptions. Sadly, we're obviously not looking at the same woman.Lastly, for all of the author's thoroughness, his explanation and discussion of ISO, in my opinion, is lacking. At the start of the book he explains that ISO is one of the three main parts to taking a correct exposure. Aperture and shutter speed get their own sections, but for ISO the author only offers a condescending \\"busy bee\\" metaphor... until 5 pages from the end of the book where he finally gives ISO a page. He explains the ISO value is the light sensitivity, but I don't remember him mentioning anywhere at what -cost- that sensitivity comes. For instance, it should say the faster the film and more light sensitive, the grainier the resulting image. There's a very grainy, low-light example in the book but grain itself isn't addressed.How could anyone leave that out?"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is simply the best photography book that I've read.

How to make your camera work for you by directing it through aperture or shutter speed. Well worth the time."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"An excellent book to read for beginner photographers, even amateurs, to understand what really goes behind making a photograph."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book was recommended by several people I know. I have been taking pictures for years but never really understood \\"photography.\\" I bought this book hoping that it would help me understand what correct exposure means and how to do it myself without relying on the cameras auto mode. It is a great book, really did help me figure it all out. Doesn't mean I am an expert now but its a great stepping stone from just taking pictures to really capturing a moment and making pictures that I think are beautiful to look at."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"It was recommended to me by another amateur photographer. I checked it out at my local library, but quickly realized I would miss it when I checked it back in!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have read many books on photography, and this book has been the only one that made sense of two words you see in all other books: \\"correct exposure\\". No other book ever succeeded on explaining the meaning of these words as this book does. Mind you that it does not give you a direct (dummies) explanation, but you certainly grasp the concept as you read. This book was informative, short and really fun to read!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"After a long break in amateur FILM SLR photography, I purchased this book because I thought it may offer some good advice for the DIGITAL SLR amateur photographer--- and does it ever! Bryan Peterson offers some really great advice for attaining exposures which transform normal photographs into really dramatic photographs. Whether you are into film OR digital photography, this book is worth your time and money. The author manages to use great examples of dramatically exposed photographs, then he very briefly explains how he shot it. If you enjoy taking pictures, this book fires you up; Peterson motivates you to pack up the camera and use his easy-to-understand advice to capture his visions in your own pictures. An easy, enjoyable, and enlightening read. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book was very helpful. Being a total amateur in photography, the author spoke in words that are easy to understand... took time in explaining clearly on how f-stops and shutter speeds relate to each other in composing a photograph. Even just thumbing through the book I had already discovered new things(for me, at least)... It has encouraged me to shoot in 'Manual' mode more rather than relying on the auto features of my camera (I had bought a used Nikon D50 and had been mostly shooting in 'Auto' or on 'Program' setting, until I read this book). I recommend it."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a great book for beginners photographers. Gives you understanding about number of things, written in easy to understand language with lots of exercises and examples. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a must-read for anyone looking to go the \\"next level\\" in their photography. I learned so much from this book. Highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is a very good book to explain exposure. The author has a great way of explaining things. I loved his metaphors. They were very effective in explaining a somewhat complex issue. There is a myriad of examples, and suggestions for special techniques and problems. I am no longer afraid to shoot in manual mode!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book should be your bible if you really are serious about photography and always keep it handy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am so glad I purchased this book. It is full of vivid photos that provide perfect examples of what the author is trying to explain. He does a great job of explaining hard to understand information in pretty basic language, and the book is a very easy read."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have had an interest in photography for a few years now, and have taken a couple college classes in traditional and digital photography, but what they lacked was some of the basic teachings that you would get in high school, somethings that are so second nature to a college photography professor that they don't even think to take the time to explain it in detail.This book helped point out some basic tips for achieving great exposures, it's filled with photographs from the author and always gives the shutter speed and aperture setting. It is helpful with both traditional film and digital photography and is a great help to a novice. A more experience photographer may find this book to be boring because it's information that's already known, but might also like it because the author helps to explain things in great detail making them much easier to understand."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I purchased this book in order to \\"brush up\\" on my book knowledge taking photos, and I ended up relearning everything I had forgotten but in a new, different light. The way the subjects are introduced and the coherent, simple explanantions are very easy to follow make this is a wonderful and valuable addition to any amateur's collection of how-to books. Each paragraph includes explanations, examples, and standard \\"do's and don'ts\\" which may prove invaluable to anyone interested in manipulating the frame in an effort to enhance the qualities that make photography interesting, artisitic, and even timeless. A \\"MUST HAVE\\" book that will make a wonderful gift to anyone who wants to take better pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"To move beyond the simple point-and-shoot level of photography, I wanted to find a book that explained the mechanics and basic techniques so that I could take control of what my camera was doing, and finally understand what all those other buttons and modes on my camera accomplished and why I might want to use them. I even tried to hunt down textbooks used in formal photography classes that might include dedicated excersises for practicing various techniques, but nearly everything out there was about how to use Photoshop instead of how to take good pictures. I was just about resigned to having to sign up for pricey formal classes when I came across this book...and it was *exactly* what I had been searching for.Peterson provides an outstanding explanation of aperatures and shutters, the relationship between the two, and when to give each their priority to achieve the \\"creatively correct\\" exposure that you want. The exercises that he includes are an excellent guide to applying the topics under discussion. I wish that he had spent a little more time explaining the matter of focal planes in a depth of field (1/3 in front, 2/3 behind) because he mentions it mostly just in passing in the midst of addressing other subjects, and to a novice in photography it can be a confusing concept.If you have an interest in photography and are ready to move beyond just \\"point and shoot\\" then I highly recommend this book. It's exponentially less expensive than formal photography classes, and will clearly tell you just about everything you need to know to feel confidant with leaving \\"Auto\\" mode behind and switching your camera mode to M, S, or A. Since reading this book, it's amazing how many times I've heard from my friends and family, \\"How come your pictures turned out so much better then mine?\\""},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Best book that I have read on getting it right everytime with no suprises. I have had all of my friends who are photographers buy it or borrow it and they all finished it in a week! Everyone loves it, and instantly improved their skills within weeks no matter what their level of experience and talent was!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Excellent book that answers all the questions that every photography wanted to know, but didn't know where to find the material. Very helpful in showing proper exposure techniques to use under virtually all shooting environments. Easy to read with excellent examples and insight as to the the thinking process involved. A book that can be referred to over and over again and won't be out of date."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is a must-buy if you're an amatuer looking for quick and easy tips on how to expose common situations correctly. Nevertheless, it does not teach you the underlying principles that have to do with exposure leaving you quite helpless when faced with any situation that shifts from the norm therein explained. The books title is somewhat decieving, because in the end you don't really understand exposure as much as you adequately reproduce all its easy-to-learn rules. \\"Understanding exposure\\" would really require other more technical and in-depth books."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],F={key:0},L={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const g=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(f,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),w(g,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",F,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(C,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-8bf32849"]]),U=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/1.md","filePath":"guide/1.md"}'),j={name:"guide/1.md"},O=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{U as __pageData,O as default};
