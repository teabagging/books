While I am not very familiar with the brand of fantasy novels dealing with dragon lore, I suspect the book has some plot twists that are not that common for its genre. To some extent, Lathwi is the adult version of a female Mowgli. Sent away by her dragonic mother to gain experience and perfect her knowledge, Lathwi finds herself entangled unwittingly in sorcerous affairs involving an old dragonic nemesis. During the ensuing conflict, she learns a lot more about magic and being human than what she bargained for.So far so good. Except that Lathwi is not your typical maiden in awe of finally discovering her humanity. Lathwi is a six-foot two-hundred pound mountain of a woman with the heart of a dragon, the appetites of a thief, and with a righteous impatience with civilization, romantic doggerels and metaphorical meanings. (Along those lines, a scene involving a male character who tries to explain to her what men and women could do naked in the water, and in the process take advantage of her lack of knowledge on the topic, is particularly hilarious -- and quite painful for the guy, serves him right!). I thought the interaction among characters was nicely done: the clash between the dragonic code of honor and the human obsession with apparently meaningless rules was sometimes funny, sometimes touching, but never boring.Although the plot is perfectly contained and doesn't leave the reader hanging, this is not the end of the story. I found the sequel to be at least as good as this first book. Just in this isolated instance, let's hear it for 'more of the same' :)"},{"Title":"Daughter of Dragons","review":"by Vikky BertlingBecause of her magical abilities, Lathwi has been outcast by her village and sacrificed to a dragon. Fate, however, has something else in store for her, instead of being eaten; she is adopted and raised as a dragon. Later, as a woman, Lathwi is forced to leave her mother's cave and sets out into the world to find her fortune. As she follows her quest, Lathwi becomes a sorceress' apprentice, in the strangest world of all, a human city. She also learns that an ancient evil is trying to rise again to overcome the dragons.In this marvelous novel we follow Lathwi's travels as she learns what it is to be human, yet strives to maintain her dragon identity. Lathwi's attitude towards humans and things that doesn't concern her is funny and infuriating at the same time! Kathleen Nelson has created a strong and intriguing female character in a primarily male dominated genre.While the action is, at times, a bit graphic, it is always captivating. This was a wonderfully written novel that I was hard pressed to ever put down. I will definitely be looking towards the sequel as my next read."},{"Title":"Daughter of Dragons","review":"A dragon lovers keeper cannot put down once start reading. Riveting .

If you have read \\"Elvenbane\\" it would be very interesting to compare the two.

I'm pleased to recommend as a welcome change from the standard a novel by a new author, Kathleen H. Nelson. Daughter of Dragons breaks new ground with its plot twists, unresolved ending, and complex, introspective characters. Lathwi is the powerful female protagonist, and in her struggles to understand and master human behavior (she was raised by dragons), the reader recognizes again and again the age-old question, &quot;What is human?&quot; Ms. Nelson has written a layered novel that combines elements of philosophy and psychology with a rip-roaring, humor-rich tale that had me reading until 3 a.m. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Daughter of Dragons","review":"This is a 'cover-to-cover' work...makes the reader anxious to turn the page while he/she aches for the heroine to meet her challenges.

Anxiously waiting for the sequel to hatch!"},{"Title":"Pocahontas (The Civilization of the American Indian series)","review":"This is a captivating tale of the Powhatans and their Pocahontas, or Matoaka as she was known. Born the daughter of the powerful Powhatan, it's almost as though she were placed by providence at the juncture of the English and the eastern woodlands Indians.Just ten when the Jamestown settlers arrived in 1607, she became early known for her cheer and joy in seeking friends amongst the colonists. But clashes came, and her aging father sought to expel the settlers, and almost succeeded, with the help the colonists' starvation and disease. Three years after their arrival, the colony was abandoned, the departing ships at the mouth of the James waiting for the morning tide to carry them to England.The relief ships pulled into view at that instant, a miraculous event, and Jamestown survived, and in time established a firm foothold in Virginia. Clashes with the Powhatans continued, however, and the colonists captured Pocahontas as a hostage against the relief of the Indian-held English captives. In her captivity, which seems to have been a friendly one, she was converted to Christianity-- the stories of her memorizing the various church liturgies are dear-- and married the young colonist John Rolfe. Her father agreed to abandon his war against the settlers, and indeed touchingly sent a string of fresh water pearls for her wedding and deeded land to Rolfe. There were to be eight years of peace following their union.The Virginia Company saw advantage to her traveling to London with her new husband, and by then young Thomas Rolfe, their child. They arrived in England in 1616, and she was received as royalty by King James and Queen Ann, and met many of the English notables of the day. But the climate took its toll, and she succumbed to tuberculosis or smallpox on the very eve of their departure for Virginia. She died in Gravesend in Kent County, and lies today in the little St. George's Churchyard there.Her monument is the peace which allowed the English the final foothold in Virginia, in spite of its eventual price on the Indians. Barely twenty when she died, she is recalled as a sprightly girl, an evocation of an America long gone.Woodward's book is filled with details and documentation, and well worth a five-star read! What she omits, however, is that Pocahontas is survived by thousands of American descendants today, each carrying her memory in their blood as the 400th anniversary of that first north American colony nears."},{"Title":"Pocahontas (The Civilization of the American Indian series)","review":"I purchased this book after viewing the movie &#34;The New World&#34; as the movie had spurred my interest inPocahontas.

Rather than decontructing old heroes, Mark Waid seems singularly adept at modernizing them while still leaving that sense of wonder that we all (at least at one time)loved about comics. Don't expect to gain any great insights into life, and don't expect to see any revolution in comic book storytelling. This is what it is - a superhero comic at its finiest."},{"Title":"The Flash: Terminal Velocity","review":"First of Waid is one of the best writers in the history of The Flash. And this volume is no exception. Wally West in this graphic novel is faced with the fact even if he is the fastest man alive he can't do it all by himself. Therefore, you get one of the best supporting cast in comics with Jay Garrick, Max Mercury, Bart Allen, Jesse and Johnny Quick. The story tells the tale of Flash trying to take down a terrorist cell. The art is pretty good a little bit to adjust to if you read more new comics then old but, not bad at all."},{"Title":"The Flash: Terminal Velocity","review":"Mark Waid's Flash is comics the way they were always meant to be; fun, thrilling, and just a touch of romance. One of the mostsatisfying endings I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Flash: Terminal Velocity","review":"There have been several incarnations of the Flash comic character since the original one first appeared in print in the 1940's. The character was originally named Jay Garrick and was discontinued, reborn as Barry Allen, Kid Flash was added, Barry was killed off and then Wally West became the Flash. Most of the Flash-like characters appear in this story as we learn a great deal about Wally West, his relationship with a reporter named Linda.The main villain is Kobra, the leader of an organization that has created a massive power grid to provide energy and is capable of manipulating fault lines in order to cause earthquakes. Wally West can move so fast that he is capable of moving out of this plane of existence and into the future, a point where once he enters it, he cannot come back. Therefore, as he battles the many arms of Kobra, he must always be careful to keep his speed down to less than transwarp level. Wally knows that Linda's life is also in danger if he enters the higher plane, so everything he does is at half-speed, albeit when measured on the Flash-meter.Impulse, a young Flash whose actions match his name is being groomed to be the next Flash, but his lack of patience and self-control make instruction very difficult. This is a story where the relationships between the various Flash characters and those not so swift often take precedence over the battle against Kobra. Yet, Impulse finally demonstrates that he is capable of engaging in teamwork and by the time the story has ended, Impulse has shown that he is a worthy successor to Wally West.This story lags in spots as the same personal issues crop up over and over again between Wally and Linda, Wally and Impulse as well as between Wally and Max Mercury and the female Flash Jesse Quick. There is also a flashback to the first Flash, a Native American legend known as Ahwehota. With so many Flashes and multiple Earths, it is often difficult to know precisely what is happening as the depth of the background makes it confusing. This is a recurring problem with the modern DC line, with so much history in the character; one cannot simply read a later story and completely understand it. There are also cameo appearances by Hawkman, Green Lantern and Superman, with Linda the reporter going Rambo as well."},{"Title":"The Flash: Terminal Velocity","review":"A terrorist is intent on blowing the hell out of Central City with the aid of some super weapons. The Flash's protege, Bart, as impulse, must grow up quickly to provide effective help for Wally during this serious crisis.He again needs aid from Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, and even Jesse Quick as a female garbed decoy Flash to give him time to come up with a solution.Fabulous stuff."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"This is the continuing story of hank and Chloe, if you like JoAnn Mapson and her books you will enjoy this book - - but it was a little disappointing to find that Chloe is such a flawed character and the way they resolved their relationships did not ring true - - a bit sad and not her best work"},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"What's not to like about Chloe. I loved her and loved the book. Jo-Ann Mapson is an excellent author.I would recommend any of her books to anyone who likes a good story.Mary Pichette"},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"This book is witty, wise and a definite must read! Following on the trail left by Hank and Chloe, this book develops a love triangle among the two and Junior Whitebear. At first the subject matter of infidelity bothered me, but the characters are so real and interesting it does not seem like the focus is the romance, but rather the characters themselves. The bond between Reed and Chloe is especially thought-provoking as it developed realistically. Jo- Ann Mapson delivers another great book that I have read and re-read. This goes on the shelf with the Bad Girls and Blue Rodeo. Can't wait to read Owl and Moon Cafe!"},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"I read Hank and Chloe and I loved it, and I was looking forward to the sequel, and I was not disapointed!

Why shouldn't Chloey have it both ways?I'm looking forward to reading Mapson's other books."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"I read Hank and Chloe about 4 years ago upon the recommendation of a friend and really enjoyed it. Then, last year or so, I heard that there was a sequel and eagerly awaited the paperback version. Once I knew it was available in paperback, I re-read Hand and Chloe (again, really enjoying it) so that I could move right into Loving Chloe, in effect, making it a longer novel. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It started out engaging and, it was a book that was riveting in it's own right but it just didn't hold together in the end. It seemed hastily contrived at best. The triangular relationship seemed thoroughly implausible and unresolved, almost as if Ms. Mapson just couldn't figure out what to do with it and finally, Reed's narrative seemed disjointed and convoluted and not worth figuring out.Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time with the book... made 40 minutes, 4 times per week of aerobic exercise much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"I waited eagerly for Mapson's sequel, and initially found it to be as engaging as Hank and Chloe. However, in the last pages, I became disenchanted. The conclusion felt forced and implausible, as if Mapson's publisher had threatened her into completing the book before she was ready. I felt betrayed by Chloe and her inability to make a choice, and the fact that Mapson does not lay out any consequences for Chloe's actions. Also, the inconsistency in Chloe's character -- first, strong and decisive, then weak and imprisoned by conflicting emotion -- bothered me."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"\\"Loving Chloe\\" by JoAnn Mapson is the sequel to \\"Hank and Chloe\\". I usually enjoy her books more, although this was a somewhat touching story (but gritty, with quite a bit of sex). Here is what the author says about that:Mapson never hesitates to explore the intimate details of the characters' sexual relationships. &quot;Writing about love and sex to me is great fun and a challenge,&quot; she said. &quot;The sex in my novels isn't all that racy, but one of my mother's friends recently said I write dirty books. I find that amusing since she is absolutely addicted to those bodice-ripper romances with Fabio on the cover.&quot;Mapson explores the complexities of a love triangle in this book. Hank and Chloe are sort of a star-crossed Romeo and Juliet. Hank is tender, loving, sentimental, committed, well-educated. Chloe is wary of commitment, street smart, and uncertain of her feelings.I find that the author really touched me when she wrote about the illness of Hank's mother; the birth of Hank and Chloe's baby and Chloe's immediate and intense maternal feelings; and the plight of the native American children and their less-than-adequate school.However, I wish that Mapson had gone in another direction and left Hank and Chloe where they were in the first book. Sequels can be dangerous for an author to attempt, and this sequel fell far short of the original.I am now reading her newest book, &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot; and am happy to say that the author is back in her usual fine form!"},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"In the sequel to Hank &amp; Chloe, Mapson takes the reader on the next journey on the path of this dis-jointed couple. Where Hank &amp; Chloe leaves off, Loving Chloe picks up, taking you through Chloe's impending pregnancy and what life will be life for Hank &amp; Chloe as parents.This time in a cabin in Arizona, Hank finds himself teaching Native American children in a third grade setting and learning as much about their lives as he learns about his own. Now living with Chloe on a much smaller income than either of them are used to, life is not the same as it was back in California. Chloe's days of waitressing and horse training are over, as she embraces the reality of being a parent and coming to terms with what this relationship with Hank amounts to. As if that isn't enough, enter a third party, Junior Whitebear, who raises even more questions in Chloe's already confused mind. Ultimately, Chloe must decide between a stable and steadfast love or one of pure passion and unexplainable force. In Loving Chloe the reader is asked to examine all of the angles of a love triangle and how to make sense of it. It also asks if unconventional solutions can work and be accepted, and what are the affects? The novel also takes a glimpse into parent/child relationships and how they affect who we become as adults, and what we pass on to our children. While the ending may be considered somewhat unrealistic or unsatisfying, it does leave the reader with lots to think about and ponder~"},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"This book and its sequel are engaging but ultimately disappointing. They are page turners, I'll grant, with some very nice insights into the way people function and the characters are colorful and likable. But the books are marred by inaccurate and implausable details regarding the horse world, genetics, and Navaho culture. Worse, there is a jolting mis-use of language. An editor should have corrected such clunkers as &quot;the lizard jettisoned to a safer rock.&quot; That's not poetic, it's just wrong, and it spoils the credibility of the narrative."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"This sequel to &quot;Hank and Chloe&quot; literally starts where the former novel left us, with Chloe returning to Hank, pregnant with his child. The setting is now the red rocks of Arizona, an Indian reservation and is described beautifully by Mapson. Chloe is still rough around the edges as she prepares for the birth of her child, and tries to have a settled relationship for the first time in her life.The problem is that Chloe, like a wild horse, is not broken or even easily tamed. Like the horse she can't bring herself not to ride while pregnant, her very nature keeps her from settling happily into domesticity. Chloe is akin to the horses that run wild in the canyons, and although she loves Hank, her nature is restless. When she meets Junior Whitebear, a romantic triangle ensues, much to Hank's dismay. The reader is left with the feeling that this triangle is never fully resolved, but all three players have come to their own private terms with it.It was a treat to see the well-fleshed out characters return from &quot;Hank and Chloe&quot;, such as Hank's uptight parents, and Chloe's young friend Kit. In addition, Chloe discovers the truth about her own parentage.I only gave this book four stars, chiefly because of the ambiguous ending. It seemed strained that the three main characters could be resigned to the fate Mapson gave them without much more strife. In additon, the futuristic epilogue about the offspring of Hank and Chloe seemed a bit contrived.However, if you love a picturesque setting and an interesting, entertaining love story with grit, you'll love reading about the further exploits of Chloe."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"The first book was amazing. Mapson is an excellent writer, I'm sure. But, I thought the ending of this one was a disaster. It was wonderful up to the last bit. The ending was so ugly, I had to backtrack several times to see if I missed something. Apparently Mapson took the money and ran. She slammed 250 pages of what could have been a poignant third novel about Hank, Chloe, and their child and have given us something more substantial than a phony summation.Perhaps my biggest regret is that Mapson created a complex and wonderful character like Hank just to be the foil for an easier character to write about, namly Chloe. The handsome native american man who was injected unfairly into the novel to give Chloe another person to abuse, was a poor (and racist?) artistic ploy on Mapson's part.And, what was Mapson trying to say about Chloe's mom? Were the horses supposed to symbolize some kind of randy sexual totem that makes some women revert to Neaderthals who just like men for sex, who get pregnant drop the baby in the dirt and hobble off into the sunset to find another man?Why trivialize these wonderful characters so?I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but when I'm fortunate enough to find characters with whom I can empathize, I feel betrayed when they don't live up to my expectations. The ending of this book turned me off so badly that I haven't read anything by Mapson since putting this one down, and I probably won't if I have to buy it."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"Mapson seems incapable of creating an unsympathetic (though flawed) character, but this book just did not live up to her first &quot;Hank and Chloe.&quot; I was disappointed that Chloe was not forced to choose between her two loves (as she surely would in real life), and disappointed at the epilogue, in which Chloe's daughter wraps things up in a manner that seemed too pat. However, the relationship between Hank and his young Native American students was touching, although I did wish Hank's parents had been more complexly drawn."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"When I closed the cover on Hank and Chloe, I could not wait to get to the bookstore to buy the sequel. At the close of the first book, a large question mark is left as to the meaning of the truck with the horse trailer slowly coming up the driveway as Hank waits and wonders. This book carries the story of these star-crossed lovers forward. In addition to Hank and Chloe, we now have Kit, Reed, Junior Whitebear, Dog, Hannah and Thunder added to the mix. We learn something of the Northern Arizona territory and its peoples and we are treated to the complex weavings of personal relationships, done as only Jo-Ann Mapson can do them. In a review of the first book, I commented that Mapson's writing reminded me of Richard Russo. Nothing in the sequel makes me change my mind."},{"Title":"Loving Chloe","review":"I liked Hank and Chloe, but liked Mapson's other two books better. This was a relatively entertaining, but weak sequel. It tried too hard to tie up all the loose ends. There were too many stories going on to really reach a logical or satisfying conclusion for any of them. I liked Hank a lot in the first book, but it was hard to respect him for not being realistic about Chloe's true nature and the likelihood of long term happiness with her. Chloe didn't develop very much as an adult in this book, which was disappointing. The story keeps you reading, but this one is not nearly as satisfying as Mapson's other works."},{"Title":"The Failure of Success; the Story of Jonah (Discovery Series)","review":"As children we all hear the story of Jonah and the whale, but all too many dismiss it as a simple fairy tale!

Its an interesting story of the intertwined lives of three young people in post-war England. Its provides an great historical setting.

Its amazing that an author so young could write a period piece like this."},{"Title":"Triangulation","review":"I thought this was a really good read. It reminds me of Ian McEwan's novels (which have received huge acclaimAmsterdam: A Novel), but Triangulation is less heavy handed and more subtle but equally rich in style.I was most struck by how Whitaker takes what would seem on the surface to be a bland central character (a retired cartographer) reminiscing about what, too on the surface, would seem as a bland era (the 1950's) and ends up developing very compelling characters, in a gripping, heart rendering story, that is revealed in what ends up being a rich historical setting.His prose are tight while painting a vivid picture in each scene. There is a sort of humility in the style of writing, perhaps intentional or perhaps not, that works well with central character of the novel... making it seem all the more genuine.I had read the Phoenix House edition that was first published in Great Britain that I bought when stuck in Heathrow airport waiting for a flight back to the States; what a pleasent surprise! A thrilling page turner like Grisham or Le Carre; it is not - but it kept me reading until I reached New York and turning the pages with an interest in the characters and story that stealthily and charmingly grew with each chapter.I am glad that Triangulation got the wider publication I felt it deserved with the US edition."},{"Title":"Children's Illustrated German Dictionary (Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Dictionaries) (German Edition)","review":"I ordered this dictionary for our 9 year old granddaughter.

I wish she'd have had at least another decade to write in. I'd read all of her books that I could find 20 years ago, in the pre-internet & pre-Amazon days. So I'm glad to have found TO LOVE AND BE WISE. One thing I noticed was how little reference there was to WWII. Then I thought of the possible explanation: that a British writer in 1950 took the war for granted, while more recent authors felt they had to mention it."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"In no ways as prolific a writer of mysteries as the Queen of British Mystery (Agatha Christie) or most of the Princesses (Allingham, Marsh, James, et al), but at about the same number as Sayers, Josephine Tey has given us a somewhat offbeat puzzle for Inspector Grant, her hero, to put together. A strikingly appealing young man, a famously successful professional photographer, is invited to visit in the home of well-known media people in a small community heavily laden with similar types. After a brief time, he disappears. What happened to him? Inspector Grant, who has met him by chance, and is at ease with the social types to be found in the community, is brought in to find the missing person and to find out why he went missing.We get to meet these rather offbeat characters and to join in the hunt. The book draws us rapidly along the trail and, ultimately, confronts us with an offbeat solution.Of course, in 1950, when published, the theme, its development and resolution would have raised a melody in very light counterpoint, so to speak, barely hidden from the reader. Today, in 2011, the counerpoint weave sinuously and emphatically, to become unmistakable at the end.Naturally, the code of ethics of the mystery story reviewer prevents eucidation of the point, but it will be apparent to those who choose to share the general pleasure in Tey's books."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"To anyone of middle age wondering why the times of our youth are so much more memorable and vivid and magical than latter-life experiences, Tey sums it up nicely in one of the last lines of the book: \\"The fantastical was for adolescents; for adults there were adult joys.\\"PLOT TALK: there is a device -- and I don't know if you could call it a device, more a plot necessity; and that happens often in Tey's books, I've noticed -- that gives a big hint to the mystery in To Love and Be Wise. Inspector Grant was to conduct an interview with the missing Leslie Searle's cousin, a scene I was looking forward to. But then the meeting, due a circumstance of plot, had to be canceled; I could not recall any other book where the author sets up such a tasty tete a tete, then cancels it. But of course Tey had to."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Marta Hallard is an actress, Alan Grant a Detective-Superintendent at Scotland Yard. Grant is useful as an escort. Leslie Searle, an American and a photographer, is invited to spend the weekend at Salcott St. Mary at the home of Lavinia Fitch and Walter Whitmore and other family members. Leslie Searle seems to be famous. Lavinia's sister, Emma, dislikes him. Emma's daughter Liz, secretary to her Aunt Lavinia, likes him very much.Toby Tullis, an actor, has a place in Salcott. He is so famous he is surprised that Searle has never heard of him. Perhaps Searle, who photographs celebrities, is having him on. Walter and Searle decide to do a book together. Walter is a broadcaster for the BBC. His trademark is an unself-conscious friendliness. Liz is engaged to Walter.Lavinia feels a wrongness and a fascination with Searle. Liz is clearly fascinated. The book plan is for Walter to do the text and for Searle to provide the illustrations. It is to be a portrait of a particular river its entire length, from the source to the sea. The pair intends to use a canoe. The work is to have the title CANOES ON THE RUSHMERE.At the start they are to sleep in a cave. Five days later they walk into the pub, the Swan, where they usually drank. The men seemed to have been having a personal discussion and none of the others ventured to their area. Afterwards Searle said that Walter left in order to avoid throttling him. Searle disappears.Alan Grant arrives to question the BBC commentator, Walter Whitmore. He reported the disappearance the morning following the evening at the pub. Grant thinks the disppearance has an aspect of the sawn lady about it. Grant asks Walter if Searle is the person he purports to be, a photographer of celebrities. Perhaps Searle lost his way in the dark and fell into the river.The room Searle occupied is devoid of atmosphere. Walter Whitmore seems to be deteriorating, visibly. The press has reached him. Grant's friend Marta functions as a sounding board. The next development is that Searle's shoe is discovered. The solution to the mystery is another instance of Josephine Tey's (Elizabeth McKintosh's) resourceful use of an identity theme."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"I really didn't care for this story. Tey is a good writer, and this book is superlative when it comes to characterizations, but the mystery(?) is less than exciting. Grant is wonderful, and here we see an urbane Grant who has to go to the country to follow up the disappearance of a young man that he had met once at a cocktail party. He follows all clues, and comes up empty (even to dragging the river twice), but once back at home in London after awhile, the pieces come together and he figures it out. The denouemnet is quite good in this book, but again, the book didn't excite me."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Of the 7 (she wrote 8) of her \\"mysteries\\" that I've now read, this is IMHO one of the best. It's not as good as the fantastic \\"Daughter of Time\\" but in a class with (but maybe not quite as good as) \\"Brat Farrar.\\" It's much better than \\"A Shilling of Candles.\\" Essentially, if you read Tey mysteries in the order written, you will see her getting better and better. As many have written, it's a shame we don't get to see what she might have written had she lived longer. As one of her later novels, this one includes several familiar characters: Inspector Grant (the protagonist), Marta Hallard (whose character is greatly rounded out herein), Jammy Hopkins (a cameo so to speak), & Grant's favorite Sgt., Williams. The book includes considerable humor and funny dialog as well as some lovely or interesting phrasing: \\"It is very dreadful being suspended from a spider's thread,\\" \\"So disheartening for a woman, don't you feel, to be weighed against a rabbit, and to know that she will inevitably be found wanting,\\" \\"One of the secrets of a successful life is to know how to be a little profitably crazy.\\" It's the only one so far that gives the reader even a ghost of a chance to guess the ending--though it's almost impossible here too. The ending is reasonable but hardly likely. One does wonder about Grant's dearth of romance considering the appearance of several women to whom he seems attracted. Not Tey's forte apparently. Still, this is a fine mystery novel, not dated, but comparable to some of the better ones being produced today."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"This is one of Josephine Tey's lesser known mysteries. &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; and &quot;The Franchise Affiar&quot; are, perhaps better known. This novel is in the Inspector Grant series and concerns the disappearance of a young man whom Grant had met briefly at a party.The writing and atmosphere of this novel are both excellent. Unlike some other Tey novels, I enjoyed this one more for the characters and setting, rather than plotting. Tey has a fine ear for dialogue and humor and Grant is a pleasure to go detecting with."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Even in a book that has its flaws, Tey's writing makes it sparkle like a gem: \\"Common sense is halfway to kindness,\\" is only one example of her Austen-like humor and wisdom; but, at the risk of including a spoiler, the solution to the mystery was immediately introduced into my mind by the picture on the paperback edition. The same plot would not be nearly as effective in a detective story published in 2012, unless the story itself took place in 1950. So I would suggest to the publishers, change the cover of the book, and the plot will be harder to detect and more enjoyable for your readers."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"My introduction to Josephine Tey's novels was through The Daughter Of Time way back in the 1960s. It is only recently that I've started reading her other novels and I am finding them to be every bit as good as that one. This novel includes Marta Hallard - an actress friend of Alan Grant, the Scotland Yard Detective Inspector who both featured in \`The Daughter of Time'.Leslie Searle, an American photographer, has made a trip to the UK to look up Walter Whitmore as a mutual friend of theirs has died. They become friends and agree to collaborate on a book about a canoe trip down a local river. But Leslie disappears immediately after a public disagreement with Walter and because of the proximity of the river he is feared drowned.The local police are stumped and Grant is quickly called in to investigate. Right from the start he feels there is something he is missing. The plot is fascinating and presents readers with a great many red herrings as well as a substantial number of clues. The local community with its high proportion of people involved in the arts is well described though not always flattering language. I thought all the characters were well drawn - Liz, Walter's fianc&eacute;e, Lavinia Fitch and author and Aunt to Walter Whitmore as well as Leslie Searle himself.If you like your crime with well drawn characters and a complex plot and detectives who are something out of the ordinary then give Josephine Tey's novels a try.

(I wish she had written more books!)In THIS book, we actually get to know Inspector Grant. Ms. Tey does not feature her detective as much as other authors do.

He shows up out of nowhere and associates himself with the family of Walter Whitmore, local celebrity. Then, he disappears. Grant is assigned to find his body, but is Searle really dead?The title of this book comes from a question that is asked in the middle of the book: \\"Is it really possible to love someone AND be wise?\\"Every time I read one of Tey's books, the word 'delicious' comes to mind. I enjoy them so much that I want to savor them, never letting them end.

Here we meet the authors whose works the bedridden Grant finds unreadable in Daughter. Silas Wheatley, whose speciality is the agricultural saga with added dirt. The charming Lavinia Fitch, who has no illusions about the soppiness of her heroines.

They are well written, with dialog that flows very naturally. The plot always has an interesting twist. She also brings in a sense of place and time that make setting an important part of the story line. Her stories are simply elegant and not gruesome. It's a shame she didn't have time to write more books."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I am biased, and there is no two ways about that. I believe Rushdie is the greatest mordern writer in history, hence if he wrote the eqivalent of 'Amsterdam' I would probably rave about. If I had to name a favourite of Rushdie's written work, I would always name 'Satanic Verses' as my perfered, due to it's sheer brilliance and busyness, however it is closely followed by 'Midnight's Children.' I read it a couple of months ago, and my message remained unposted, hence my recollection is a bit blurry, however I remember raving in that review immediately after reading it. I think that Salman Rushdie, along with the 1997 Booker prize winner and the likes of Rohiston Mistry and the novel 'Flower Boy' have created a standard of writing that the rest of the world should to aim to match. I absolutely love Indian literature, much of it being as many have mentioned, being in the little known, but highly interesting genre of magic realism, along with the fabulous Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Love in Times of Chlorea. I plead for people to give this style of writing, and 'Midnight's Children' a chance. The later is an interesting, consistant and busy novel, which I enjoyed from every aspect, and will remember for much of my reading life."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Should anyone ask why this book is so revered, I would be at a loss to even being rationalizing others' adulation. The Booker Prize? One of the 100 best works of fiction of the 20th century?This book was one of the toughest slogs I have ever undertaken voluntarily. I pushed forward hoping that the end would justify and reward the senselessness of that which preceded the end. Had I not invested so much in a vain quest to find that which others described (allegory, metaphor, mysticism, creativity, use of language), I would have put it down much sooner.The language and flow of the work are distinctive, imaginative, and complex, but these are the few positive characteristics I can ascribe to the work. The remainder I found to be uninteresting and dense. In parts, I felt as if Rushdie had lost energy and focus, inserting filler until he could again jumpstart the storyline by again stretching the life of the central chracter across a historic event.Read instead Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Jorge Luis Borges. You'll find what others have promised within this work and come away with a far more rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I guess you have to be a historian on India and its culture because if you are not (like myself), the book was confusing. I could not distinguish the fantasy from the reality - which may have been the intent. Although I fell short on understanding, I feel that Rushdie is an artist in the literary sense."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie has done much better. This was not up to par. His earlier books were far better. This was difficult to get through."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"One of the best books ever written.

Unlike many other novels that kept me very much awake during my travels, this was a perfect novel \\"designed for falling asleep\\". The book will NOT make the time seem to flow faster; just the opposite. You will do well skipping less interesting pages. The action is very slow and fragmented, much of the book is a rather immature childhood fantasy; a frequent consultation with an Indian (preferably of Muslim faith) is needed to understand many words. I was actually lucky that my flight companion was an Indian (but not Muslim, so he actually had problems with the meaning of some words!). The most interesting parts of the novel are around page 350, when the action moves to Pakistan. But you simply might choose to give up way before that. I would be curious if other books by this author are of similarly questionable quality but I am afraid to try.....Midnight's Children is a VERY strange choice for a Booker Prize."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie may be regarded as a prize winning artist, but not in my book. This novel was truly a tough read, and that is not because it is complex in language or scope. The first 150 pages almost caused me to put it down for good and donate it. However, around this point, the story takes a better turn as it finally focuses on the protagonist of the novel. Aside from the general history of Pakistan and India and the 30 year span this story takes place, there was far too much mysticism involved. Twists and turns here and there make for the story to slog along, but in the end it just doesn't gel. Incestuous thoughts, bawdy feelings and overall sexual feelings of ineptitude are replete thorough out the novel. That in and of itself doesn't bother me, but when it is used as an essential characteristic by and of the narrator, it tends to become trite and useless. Additionally, while the story does take place in India and Pakistan, the use of the local language or Rushdie's attempt and using sounds and local vernacular drowns out an otherwise descriptive passage at times. The conversations are somewhat void of attention to the situation at hand or don't address the overall theme of the novel. Alcoholism, poverty, opulence, and histrionics are used throughout the story as vehicles to paint a full picture of the narrator's life. Unfortunately, they run flat and the overall theme, if one can really discern a deep meaning to this novel, is lost so the book lands with a thud! I am only giving it two stars because it is a decent attempt. I won't attempt to read Salman Rushdie again. Far too many other better books out there."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"My explanation for two- and five- star ratings for the book is just the opposite of what an earlier review surmised. I believe it is 5-star by those people who know India/Pakistan only superficially and so assume that Rushdie is on to something; it also includes the Macaulayites or those Indians/Pakis who have learned about it secondhand from English books. Often the word-play, puns, or etymologies used by Rushdie don't make sense."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is so obviously influenced at parts by Gunter Grass, it could have been called \\"The Silver Spittoon.\\" Actually I think this title would match the book about as well as \\"Midnight's Children\\" does; the midnight's children don't really have parts in this book. They are place-fillers, like so many plot contrivances and characters in the novel. Rushdie likes to tell things more than he likes to show them, at least here. ---So this is also supposed to be like Gabriel Garcia-Marquez. Well let me tell you, take Gabriel Garcia Marquez or even Isabel Allende any day over \\"Midnight's Children.\\" These are gifted authors in the reader-grabbing sector, even through translation. Their stories can contain historical stuff without feeling stuffy and dull.Not that the novel feels too stuffy. Just a little awkward in the historical sections.\\"Midnight's Children\\" feels as if the author wrote down on a piece of paper hundreds of incidents and ideas and then stringed them together.I don't mean to be too mean to Mr. Rushdie, he seems like a horrorshow chelloveck, only he needs to lighten up a little! :-) Some parts of this book are funny, but none gutburstingly so. Perhaps I expect too much. Perhaps I make it a habit. Is that always bad? Perhaps one of the reasons that his book doesn't work is because it tries a balancing act that needs a vibrant and even slightly cruel character (like Gunter Grass's \\"Tin Drum\\" which had a weird, vivacious Oskar in the role). Saleem is appallingly half-minted. And yes some of the other characters do interesting things, but they are not really *people*. They are not even successful oddities.I would have loved some sort of a Hollywoodish (Bollywoodish?) showdown between Saleem and the Widow--- or Saleem and Shiva--- Saleem and *somebody*. Carefully done. Done lively and well. I would have liked one scene that really stood out, at least one scene. Sometimes I get the feeling Rushdie either holds himself back too much or has very little to tell."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Dipping into controversial and expansive review of India's nouveau independence, Rushdie's autobiographical recitation (in fiction) of protagonist nasal-telepathic Saleem Sinai bestows lessons and conjures imagination.Some novelists have received acclaim for making allegory through adventure - Coello for \\"The Alchemist\\" or Kosinski for \\"The Painted Bird.\\" As great as those novels are, neither has the depth of review that this novel has. And, much to Rushdie's credit, this adventure intertwines with real events of the recent histories of India and Pakistan - thereby making it more relevant to those who lived or have heard about the many historical references contained throughout this book.Being an American usually means reading little about the history or culture of India. We are ignorant of their struggles - and this book enlivens us to a certain degree - such that the reader can conclude from reading this book that this country has struggled as greatly since its independence from Britain, than it did under British rule. Forster's portrait of British degradation of India in \\"A Passage to India\\" made westerners believe that Gandhi's plight was both necessary and inevitable. This book tells us that freedom from British rule did not necessarily deliver better karma or even sounder ruling. The \\"Emergency\\" of Indira Gandhi delivers an appalling caricature of Indians being cruel to Indians - as Saleem must be emasculated by the ruling party's dictate - for reasons no more discernable than the German holocaust or any other genocide.This book travels chronologically from Saleem's grandparents' romance to his 31st birthday. Saleem lives an incredible life -worthy of this book's size. His life - or really his son's life - is encapsulated in one sentence: \\"He was the child of a father who was not his father; but also the child of a time which damaged reality so badly that no one managed to put it together again; He was the true great-grandson of his great-grandfather. . .\\" It makes nonsense until you read the book - then this statement is both valid and true.Amid this adventure we meet snake charmers, a succubus wet nurse, a witch, a 512-year old prostitute - as well as typical western literature characters, e.g. a man who shoots his wife and her lover, a corrupt general, and a son who kills his father out of pure hatred.This is a thoroughly drawn portrait of a literary character. Amassing 445 pages in my hardback edition - each page having approximately 550 words - it is a long read. And, Rushdie's swirling writing style, where he touches upon a topic and a few paragraphs or pages later descends upon that same topic with more resonance or more detail, can leave readers feeling half empty at times as the complete description will not come to light until a later time. This is not a quick read. This is not easy reading. But, this is worthwhile reading.Rushdie writes with great literary style. Full of metaphors and complete with magical insight, this book is understandably incorporated by many universities' English departments"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I have to admit I had a real problem with the beginning, it started out kind of slow. And there was also a bunch of characters, so many it was really hard to keep track of. But with careful reading, it went to to get more and more exciting, and after a while I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The premise of the book is just beautiful: the children born around midnight on the night that India gains independence from Great Britain all have special powers. One boy can jump through time at will. Another can change sex. The narrator can peer into others' thoughts, or at other times (surrounding an interesting plot device) can smell trouble through a remarkably sensitive nose.The book's style is addictive. The narrator liberally jumps into and out of his own story; he's reading it to his lover (Padma, a reference to Rushdie's own companion) as he rushes to tell the story before he disintegrates into 600 million pieces, as he foresees happening shortly.Since the entire basis of the story are these magical children, the book is necessarily part fantasy. (I've heard it compared to Garcia Marquez's \`\`magical realism&quot;, but I wouldn't know.) As a result, Rushdie can take frequent flights of fancy into events that wouldn't make sense anywhere outside of Midnight's Children. But it's all totally believable, because these children are all magical in their own way.Midnight's Children is Rushdie's way of describing India as he sees it. To him, the nation is part fantasy, part reality, part horror story. Some of the horrific events in India's postcolonial past come off sounding unbelievable, which is why they fit into the fantasy-fiction construct so well. One wonders throughout, \`\`Is this real, or is this India?&quot; In this way, Rushdie's postmodern flights of fancy aren't just stylistic wankery; they serve a meaningful purpose in the plot.This is certainly one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I went immediately from Midnight's Children into One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, which is something like moving from six years of filet mignon into a day of cold gruel. Nothing's wrong with Ivan Denisovich, but the stylistic differences are mighty. I can only recommend that you read them sequentially; you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is obviously a master writer and shows his skills in this long, expansive and creative piece. I'm a fan of the magical historical fiction style and have read Marquez and plan to read Grass soon; not a big fan but I like the style well enough. I wish it was book a bit shorter (I am a slow reader), but the scope and range of the work (from tragedy to comedy and back) along with it's historical reach make it a very good read. Whip out your dictionary on this work too, it certainly expanded my vocabulary."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem is born at midnight at the very moment India gains its independence. Thus, he is connected to his nation right from the start, as are the 1001 children born during that magical hour. Saleem sets out to preserve his story and finds he cannot separate his history from his country's history. Nor can he leave out the stories of the other children of midnight. Rushdi's book is long and complex, and sometimes it is tough to get through. However, it is not one of Penguin's Great Books of the 20th Century without reason. It is an analysis of self and nation and history and truth. An excellent work of fiction, to say the least."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Just like all Rushdie books, MC requires a good deal of attention from the reader. But with good nurturing, this will be your favourite book. The tale of Saleem Sinai from his grandfather's youth to his old age spans the modern history of India. His fate is entangled with that of the country, his complexity reflects the problematic political state.I was lucky enough to be in India as I read the book, and that enabled me to get more out of his local terms and customs. So I believe it'll help to be familiar with the country.Rushie's play on words, observations and blurry fact and fiction make this an R-rated fairy tale. DO NOT miss this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Okay, so some people may have a problem with the &quot;Indian-ness&quot; of the book. The book is not a history text, nor is it a report on India, it is a work of fiction! The writing is beautiful, the story is mesmerizing, and it is a terrific, entertaining, and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The children in question are those hundreds of infants born at midnight on August 15, 1947 - the precise moment at which the independent Indian nation state came into existence. They all have supernatural gifts, but few more so than the narrator, Saleem Sinai, blessed (or cursed) with the enormous nose of his presumed ancestors which gives him the gift of telepathy, the ability to \\"sniff out\\" what others are thinking. But he is not his father's son. Switched at birth with another baby, Saleem is a Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. This book is his written record of Indian national history from 1910 to 1978, through its concordances with his own family life - an expression of what Rushdie calls \\"the national longing for form\\", the obsession with correspondences and similarities. We follow Saleem and his riotous extended family through the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of \\"The Widow\\" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law. As Saleem discovers, \\"midnight has many children; the offspring of Independence were not all human. Violence, corruption, poverty, generals, chaos, greed and pepperpots ...\\" Readers familiar with the history of twentieth-century India will find this more enjoyable than most, as much of the pleasure here lies in the way Rushdie folds national-political events into Saleem's experiences using four modes of connection which Saleem helpfully describes midway through - active-literal, passive-metaphorical, passive-literal, and active-metaphorical. The other pleasure is Rushdie's language, which is rich and complex (however there were times when I found his rhetorical style almost tedious). Fortunately, this is a very funny book, taking many of its cues from Bollywood cinema, and it's also quite acidic: part comedy, part angry polemic, it's a an odd combination but the result is a wonderful piece of literature. This is a book you will probably read several times in your life and enjoy in new ways with each encounter."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The subject matter and vocabulary in Midnight's Children are unfamiliar to American readers, and Salman Rushdie loves his flashbacks and digressions. So this book is tough going for much of the way. Somewhere near halfway through the book, you begin to recognize the different threads of the plot and the book begins to make more sense. At this point, you want to begin marking up every page with cross-references and notes, to keep track of what is going on. I would say that this book is a good subject for study but I'm not sure that it's a good read. In fact, I'm not even sure it can be read, in the usual sense of the word, by most people outside India.But it's worth the effort to try. Midnight's Children is an intense and revealing exploration of India's culture and politics, mixing factual information (\\" . . . although there is considerable disagreement about the number of 'political' prisoners taken during the Emergency, either thirty thousand or a quarter of a million persons certainly lost their freedom.\\"), humorous observations (\\" . . . the water shortage had reached the point where milkmen could no longer find clean water with which to adulterate the milk . . .\\"), and wildly imagined events (a communist snake charmer induces a pair of cobras to act out a rich man refusing to give alms to a beggar, police harassment, hunger, disease, and illiteracy). The narrator is Saleem Sinai, a man born at midnight on the day of India's independence. His destiny, of course, is closely bound up with that of his country. He and one thousand other \\"midnight's children,\\" alternately influence the course of history and are influenced by it in all sorts of improbable ways. In tracing Sinai's life, Rushdie finds occasion to comment on scores of important developments in India's history."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salmon Rushdie may be most famous for \\"Satanic Verses\\" and the subsequent death warrant it earned him from Muslim fundamentalists. However, his previous book, \\"Midnight's Children,\\" is a genuine reason for fame.Simply put, the book is outstanding in almost every way - well written, plotted and characterized, it contains a whole kaleidoscopic world. However, it is Rushdie's gift for metaphor (especially in a political context) that sets him apart. Not since Nietzsche in \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" has metaphor been so sharp and multifaceted. It truly takes on a level that few other authors can reach.The plot certainly does owe something to the Bombay movie industry, however the final result is much more than a Bollywood musical. In fact, it made me (whose knowledge of India admittedly was mostly limited to movie portrayals) rethink my happy-go-lucky view of that country as a place where everyone ate well, sang about love and occasionally rode an elephant. What a fascinating introduction to an equally fascinating culture and uniquely Asian melting pot!Perhaps the most lasting concept to come out of the work is the illusive need for personal centrality. We all want to be the center of not just our own individual worlds or lives but the entire world. It's the subjective striving for universality that truly leads to tyranny and despotism. Fascinating!This connects the text with Derrida's post modern theory of the unsustainability of centers, too. Why is it that only America ignores these themes preferring instead to concentrate on titillation and culture alone?In any case, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is an exceptional work of fantastic realism that keeps you thinking as well as guessing about another culture as well as human nature, itself."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is, in every way, a perfect novel. Both humorous and heartbreaking. I found myself deeply moved and very suprised that I enjoyed this novel as much as I did. I have never been very interested in Indian history, and knew close to nothing about it. But upon reading this novel, I found myself drawn into the rich fictional history of the Aziz family, as well as the equally rich history of India. Rushdie may have ruined reading for me, as every book I read will now have much higher standards! Not for light reading, though. I imagine this is a book that you could read over and over and still find something new each time. This is a tough novel, and it takes a lot of work to truly \\"get it\\". The only reason I stuck with it is because I had to for class. But it was very rewarding in the end. The novel reveals itself in layers, with recurring themes and motifs that grow in extremely deep and powerful meanings. The character of Saleem, self-described savior of India, is one of the most memorable characters to have graced the pages of a novel. I have heard some people say that this book is a let down in the end, as though it never comes to a full climax. In answer to that: I felt that was the whole point. Saleems dreams are always dreams, they are never completely realized. The language is beautiful and lyrical, and the plot is highly detailed, as though each sentence was carefully planned. Rushdie may be the ultimate architect of this century when it comes to plot building. As a writer myself, I was both green with envy and speechless with awe over this novel. I have never read anything else by Rushdie, but now I definitly plan to!A couple of tips:1. There are many different characters, so you may want to make a family tree to keep track.2. Pay close attention to Rushdie's use of color in the novel, particularly green, saffron and blue, as well as numbers.3. The narrator, Saleem, breaks away from linear storytelling in a big way. Often, the story jumps around and he gives a lot of foreshadowing. It helps to let go of our western idea of time (i.e. events happening in a timeline) and just let the story unfold. Trust me, once you can let go of your confusion and just let it be, the reading becomes much easier! Also, it's interesting to consider what he chooses to tell us ahead of time, and what he doesn't.And finally, you will definitly want to brush up on your Indian history! I'm not talking a whole lot, just an Encarta article or something so you know what's going on. Also, when historical figures are mentioned in the book, you should do a little research and find out more about them. This is especially true for the political figures, such as Indira Ghandi.Like I said, this book is A LOT of work, but worth all the effort."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is considered to be Rushdie's masterpiece; it won the Booker Prize, and then, in 1993, it won the 'Booker of Bookers', ie the best book to have won the Booker Prize in the first 25 years of the award. In addition to this, Rushdie's reputation is not built upon his literary merits so much as the surrounding controversy of another book, The Satanic Verses, which all but condemned him to years of hiding and constant moving about in an effort to escape fundamentalist Muslim assassination-attempts.The premise for this novel is amazing. At the stroke of midnight on August 15th, 1947, India achieved independence and became a valid country, free from the shackles of Britain. One thousand and one children were born in the hour from midnight to 1am, one thousand and one children with magical powers, the potency of which increases the closer the child was born to midnight.The narrator, Saleem Sinai, was one of two children born on the exact stroke of midnight, and throughout the novel various allusions to yin and yang, good and evil, up and down, et cetera are made between Saleem and Shiva, the other child, but unfortunately nothing really comes from this. Although mentioned often and with great vehemence on the part of the narrator, Shiva never really came across as a 'bad guy', or even someone that should be worried about at all.The story meanders through thirty odd years of life before Saleem's birth, detailing the lives and idiosyncracies of his parent's and grandparent's adventures, which, admittedly, are described with great sweeping motions and tantalizing literary strokes. Sentences marvel, paragraphs sing with wit or beauty, but...what was the point? After Saleem is born, events take an incredibly epic turn, as the implications of the children of midnight are revealed, but then, the narrator just sort of forgets about it and rambles on about things that, given the immensely intruiging concept of the children, just doesn't spark any interest.The narrator is an interesting writer. He repeats reiterates recapitulates words in threes, often, and that works. He used parentheses artfully, and well. But the narrator foreshadows everything and anything, so that we are always reading about events that will come to pass, soon or otherwise, and in cryptic ways, 'He kept himself in the background of our lives, always, except twice...once when he left us; once when he returned to destroy the world by accident'. It is an exceptionally annoying literary technique, serving only to make the reader wish that events would hurry up so that the portentous-sounding episodes will occur, but...even they are marred by fore-shadowing and never really live up to the promises, anyway.The last one hundred and fifty pages drag, seemingly without cohesion, in an effort to combine the plot-threads, to actually make the children a part of the story - and, disappointingly, they really aren't very predominant - but it doesn't work. Then, in a whirlwind twenty pages, everything is tied up neatly, the children are dealt with, and the book ends. The fantastic premise never really lived up to its promise, and the book suffers.Is Midnight's Children a failure? No. As a story, it is enjoyable, written well, and at times, beautiful. Certain passages are crafted with amazing skill, and the narrator is a pleasant enough fellow. But the concept of the midnight's children should have been ditched - the story would have worked well enough without them because they never really played a part - and the book would have been greater as the spectre of great things to come would not have existed."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Towards the beginning of this book, there is a minor character who is an artist whose paintings have grown huge because he keeps trying to fit life into them. He mourns because he'd wanted to be a miniaturist, but instead has elephantiasis. Even though the character never recurs, I thought about him through the huge landscape of this book.Rushdie has the eye for detail of a miniaturist, but writes in epic sweeps, fitting in countless lives and actions. If done badly, this would have been nearly impossible to read, but the execution is brilliant and instead gives the impression of a huge rich tapestry running by like film.The book is about the Midnight's Children (children born in the first hour after the birth of India as a nation) and their erstwhile leader Saleem Sinai. It traces him (and them) through childhood, the creation of Pakistan, and beyond. Even though the events are crucial, to have an understanding of the plot won't give you any help with the book.My advice to people attempting Midnight's Children is to not worry too much about catching and understanding every detail. Yes, knowing more about Indian history will make certain things clear (although it may obscure others), but there's so much here that it isn't really necessary. I already know that this is a book I'm going to re-read, and that will be the chance to pick up missing pieces.One of the highest of recommends."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; appears to be an allegory, spiced with satirical commentary, on the political course of modern India and the in-fighting of its various social and religious factions. It is an endlessly inventive book with a cheeky sense of humor and wild, exotic imagery, but it does not eschew somber moments. Rushdie presents this novel as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, writing from his current residence at a Bombay pickle factory under the critical eye of his frequently interruptive lover/fiance Padma.Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India's independence from Great Britain and Pakistan's formation. He and one thousand other babies (the Midnight's Children) born in India throughout the hour each has some supernatural power such as witchcraft, time travel, gender alteration, etc., or otherwise is simply a mutant. Kind of like the X-Men, except they're too self-serving to band together and fight crime (and too bad, as there is a lot of narrative potential in this idea).Saleem routinely hides in a washing-chest in his house to find inner peace away from neighborhood kids who taunt him for his large misshapen nose and other odd facial features. One day in the chest, he has a strange accident -- he sniffs a pajama cord up his nose, triggering an effect which causes him to hear voices in his head and realize he has telepathic powers. By telepathy, he establishes communication with the (heretofore unknown to him) other Midnight's Children, but they prove unwilling to unite. An operation performed on his nose to stop his severe dripping snot problem clears his nasal passages to reveal an uncanny olfactory ability, enabling him to sniff out emotions and ideas as well as smells.Saleem also gives an extensive background on his family, beginning with how his maternal grandparents met, up to his pyromaniac-turned-singing-star younger sister. After his (Muslim) family relocates to Pakistan, almost all of them are killed in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and in the 1971 war for the independence of Bangladesh, Saleem is conscripted in the Pakistani Army as a human bloodhound.Eventually, Saleem marries Parvati, one of the Midnight's Children, the witch, who bears a child fathered by his arch enemy Shiva, another of the Midnight's Children, whose special attribute is his ability to crush people with his overdeveloped knees. Shiva works as an agent for the government of India, who demand to know the indentities and whereabouts of all the Midnight's Children, and Saleem is the only one who can tell them...Like E.L. Doctorow's &quot;Ragtime,&quot; &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; blurs the line between historical fact and fiction, weaving fantastic events against a realistic backdrop of a land in turmoil. Saleem is an extraordinary character, not a hero in the traditional sense but a deformed symbol, a vessel for carrying and displaying the problems and hopes of the people of India."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"&quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is the first Rushdie book I've read, and only the second one by an 'exile Indian'. I'd heard so much about Rushdie's literary talent that I went off and bought it.At first I was a little disappointed, I must say. Rushdie's prose at the beginning of the book is clever, intelligent, witty - but it didn't touch me emotionally. I very much enjoyed reading it, but I wasn't too interested in what was going on.Then, before I'd noticed it, I was hooked. From the moment the narrator actually became a protagonist, I was involved in the plot. Driven on by the dozens of hints and foreshadowings, I simply had to know what would happen, and I began to care about most of the characters.More than that, Rushdie's novel is a rich tapestry of politics, magic, metaphor; there's so much imagination in this book, but it doesn't become overladen as other novels sometimes do. The author juggles his multiple plot lines, characters and his version of history and India deftly, and for me reading this novel was a real joy.P.S.: Some readers - and critics - have complained that Rushdie's India is not really India. So what? I believe that &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; can be enjoyed tremendously as an imaginative, clever, involving and intelligent novel. Why look for the 'truth' in it? While some readers with a limited knowledge of the country might take this novel's geography and history as 'the real thing', I don't think you should judge literature by its readers."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Previously, during a scandal with 'The Satanic Verses' and Salmon Rushdie's death sentence, I tried to read his 'Shame' but was absolutely disappointed and stopped reading after first 100-150 pages. Now I discern at least two of my mistakes: I read Rushdie in Russian translation and not up to the end. 'Midnight's Children' was my second attempt to understand Rushdie, I was attracted by its Booker and Booker of Bookers. The book consists of three parts: at first I was tired with author's derisive style, then I became interested in the fate of its protagonist, only at the end I appraised author's intention and mastery of its realization.An undeniable strong point of the novel is its excellent language, a wonderful gallimaufry of indigenous words and such an amazing gamut of English that can do credit to every unabridged dictionary. Rushdie masterly wields his skillful pen, a reading of his phrases is a pure pleasure for a literary gourmet. His style is influenced by the Arabian tales of 1001 nights and - among modern writers- by famous 'magical realism' of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The novel is an expression of author's genuine love to his native India. Rushdie weaves into the intricate lace of his story all important events in political, social and spiritual life of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh since the beginning of the century. But some of his interpretations are rather disputable (the reviews of readers from Eastern countries confirm this). In depiction of Indira Gandhi author's sharp mockery turns into blind hate, and the Prime Minister of India transforms into a real devil incarnate, a fiend that sterelizes midnight's children depriving them not only of their magical gifts but the hope itself. It is hard to understand such undisguised selective rage. The third part of the novel is the best one. Relating about the innumarable sufferings of his people in Indo-Pakistan conflicts and during formation of Bangladesh, Salman Rushdie reaches the highest and culminating point of his story.The novel is full of interesting images such as 'the perforated sheet', 'snakes and ladders' and - first and foremost - 'midnight's children'. All countries, that had passed through social disturbances and collisions, have known their midnight's children, a quixotic generation bestowed with their wonderful gifts but deprived of any possibility of their realization. Midnight's children dream that they are inseparably linked with the future of their beloved country, that they are its part and parcel with all its misfortunes and joys. They will be overcome by the persons without illusions but with hard elbows (or knees?) and jaws longing for power and money.The last chapter of the book gives the joyless and distressing picture of 'new' India after defeat of midnight children (one more image - &quot;Abracadabra'). But the protagonist, ending his story, leaves one empty pickle jar - a symbol of hope: the children of the vanquished are alive, they differ from their parents but nevertheless they ARE their children."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Claims of \\"Masterpiece! Bravo! C'est manifique!\\" and multitudes of roses gloriously wafting down from the expensive seats in the balcony are justified. This book made Rushdie a star. Rushdie who? Isn't he the guy who wrote that bizarre quasi-sci-fi novel about some birdguy? Yes, he is. And five years following that dabble (entitled \\"Grimus\\" which, to steal Hume's thunder, \\"fell deadborn from the press\\") Rushdie sprung some new fantastic oil reserve of novel writing and produced this utter gem. What a difference a mere five years can make!This is a thick book. It's a very thick book. Thick with meaning. Thick with stories. Is it about time? Sure. Is it about family? Yup. Is it a political book? Well, sorta. Is it about the vicissitudes of memory and history? Probably, yes, that sounds good. Is it about India? Oh, yup. A lot of India in it, sure sure. Its bulk is impossible to summarize to any degree of fairness. Its bulk in meaning is nearly incomprehensible. Still, it all comes down to the narrator: Saleem Sinai, who, equipped with numerous nicknames and adoptive parents, is pummelled and dragged and drained through India's independence. Having been born at the very stroke of midnight (or was that his rival, born in the same room, who was the real son of Saleem's unsuspecting first set of \\"parents\\") on the cusp and lip of India's independence, Saleem later finds himself, and 1001 other children (you guessed it, the \\"Children of Midnight\\"), imbued with magical powers beyond belief. The magic of India's independence from Britain shoots forth wonders. Of course the government under Indira Gandhi isn't too happy about this, and Saleem finds himself in a very bad sort of pickle later on. These scenes make up some of the more disturbing and violent chapters (and Rushdie was accused by some of being too hard on the Indira r&eacute;gime). Cover your eyes! Plug your ears!This is historical fiction at its best. There's much to learn about the history of India in these pages of pulp. Some familiar names will pounce out from the ink: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi (no blood relation to the Mahatma; she was assassinated in 1984, four years after this book was published), Morarji Desai, Lord Viceroy Mountbatten, etc., etc., the names and history they encompass pile up page after page. Saleem and his family are also victims (very unfortunate ones) of the partition of India (into India, Pakistan, and soon after Bangladesh). This event still holds the record for most people moved from one place to another at one time: 14 million people (with about 1 million dead). Then war war war, more war war, and a state of Emergency, war war. Saleem is buffetted through it all, as countless millions were. The novel brings out the complexity and bulk of modern independent India through the voice of Saleem. Make some room in your brain for Rushdie's \\"many headed monsters\\".One of the best scenes is \\"the perforated sheet\\" in which a doctor, Saleem's Grandfather, is only allowed to examine a Muslim woman through a hole in a large sheet. One part at a time, no more, no less. One day he looks through the hole and sees a...Book three is a wild ride which will likely evoke the response \\"how did Saleem get here?\\" This book is Saleem's \\"rebirth\\" ending with the \\"Abracadabra\\" that changes everything; as book two is about Saleem's birth and childhood, and book one attempts to sum up the events leading up to Saleem's birth (the perforated sheet will haunt).Is Saleem an honest narrator, though? Or does he lie through his big teeth (and much bigger and talented nose)? This is one of the many tensions that rips through the novel, and questions and examines biography as well as history. Saleem only admits to lying once.The novel has some debts also. It owes a big one to \\"Tristram Shandy\\" written by Lawrence Sterne in the 18th century, in which an autobiographer attempts to write his life and keeps getting mired in digressions. Rushdie takes the best elements of this brilliantly bizarre book and meshes it into his own story of Saleem. Rushdie himself has acknowledged the influence of Sterne. Also, some have called this novel \\"India's 'Tim Drum'\\" with its parallel stories of nations with growing pains siphoned through single characters. Regardless of influence, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is an amazing novel rich with meaning, detail, humor, love, tragedy, childhood, family, philosophy, religion, sibling rivarly, and people people people people people people burgeoning out through the lines of text like on a crowded Mumbai street. There are, in short, people everywhere.This book is worth the effort. It may take a little more effort than expected. It's huge, it's complex, it's part history part fantasy. What it attempts to do, in a very human way, is posit meaning to events and lives and their very multifarious interpretations. It can all be found in cleverly labeled pickle jars. C'est manifique!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"\\"...our physical alienation from India almost inevitably means that we will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not actual cities or villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands, Indias of the mind.\\" -Salman RushdieRushdie uses his characters to help develop these imaginary homelands. In turn they represent different aspects of India and the overarching ideas of the time. Saleem's memory and subsequent loss of it during the Indo-Pakistani war (where Bangladesh declares independence from Pakistan) is an example of the confusion of the social memory at that time. An example of this representation of Saleem as the memory of India, or that he represents India is the geography lesson where Zagallo says to the class about Saleem, \\"In the face of these ugly ape you don't see the whole map of India?\\"(231) They use his nose to represent the Deccan peninsula; the \`stains' represent Pakistan, \\"a stain of the face of India\\" (232). So Saleem's face represents the lands over which the wars are fought throughout the book. \\"In any war, the field of battle suffers worse devastation than either army. This is natural\\" (43), says Aziz in the beginning of the book, foreshadowing the suffering of his own grandson.Saleem seems to understand his own ostracism from his family even before he becomes aware that he is literally not of their blood. He resists falling into the same cracks as his grandfather early in the narration:Family history, of course, has its proper dietary laws. One is supposed to swallow and digest only the permitted parts of it, the halal portions of the past, drained of their redness, their blood. Unfortunately, this makes stories less juicy; so I am about to become the first and only member of my family to flout laws of halal. (59)One of the most memorable quotes of the novel:...maybe there is something unnatural about me, some fundamental lack of emotional response; but my thoughts have always aspired to higher things. Hence my resilience. Hit me: I bounce back (But no resistance is of any use against the cracks.) (396-397)Here he is resisting his family's ways, and the ways of his family's culture with the reference to his grandfather's admission of religion. Saleem addresses the cracks again at the end of the novel after his grandfather has died. He gives himself a piece of advice about his grandfather's ways on page 187 when he quotes \\"What can't be cured must be endured.\\" He is referring to the first page of the novel, when he introduces his grandfather:...he resolved never again to kiss any earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. (10)Aziz becomes the splitting India figuratively. Aziz's education comes from Tai, early in the Novel, \\"From Tai, Aadam learned the secrets of the lake\\" (17). The lake represents older more violent ways, as Tai is known for his murder and drowning of European women who come to ride in his boat. Tai's resistance is more of a rebellion to Colonialism, if violent at that. Aziz absorbs these older traditions but maintains a newer generational understanding of his culture that he discusses in his marriage to Naseem. Before he marries her he comes to a symbolic realization about her (and consequently India):So gradually Doctor Aziz came to have a picture of Naseem in his mind, a badly fitting collage of her severally-inspected parts. This phantasm of a partitioned woman began to haunt him, and not only in his dreams. Glued together by his imagination she accompanied him on all his rounds, she moved into the front room of his mind, so that waking and sleeping he could feel in his fingertips the softness of her ticklish skin or the perfect tiny wrists or the beauty of her ankles; he could smell her scent of lavender and chambeli; he could hear her voice and her helpless laughter of a little girl; but she was headless, because he had never seen her face. (25)When Aziz marries her, he finds that the sex is disappointing. He says to her, \\"Forget about being a good Kashmiri girl. Start thinking about being a modern Indian woman\\" (34). He resists from saying for her to be a modern \`British' woman, even though India has not become independent yet, but refers to their own culture. Instead of taking his advice, Naseem does her own resisting that is seen in the rest of their marriage as a result.Naseem is called assiduous throughout the novel (especially on 67), a word that means, \\"Constant in application or effort; working diligently at a task; persevering; industrious; attentive: an assiduous student.\\" She resists the sexual education of her marriage for tradition, and claims power from it:It is a sign of power of this custom that even when her husband was afflicted by constipation, she never once permitted him to choose his food, and listened to no requests or words of advice. A fortress may not move. Not even when its dependants' movements become irregular. (41)The battle between Aziz's modernisms and Naseem's traditional ways culminates in a starvation war. Aziz sends about the children's religious instructor and Naseem refuses to cook for him anymore in rebellion. Aziz stubbornly refuses to eat anything else and wastes away. When Aziz becomes deathly thin, Alia and Naseem devise a plan and Naseem pretends to fall ill. Alia feeds both of them until everything is better and they have both reclaimed their pride. This domestic version of the impact of modern colonialism, the resistance and the reclamation mirrors exactly what was going on in many families and India at the time. It is hard to encapsulate the entire reality, as Rushdie has Saleem suddenly admit, \\"Is this an Indian disease, this urge to encapsulate the whole reality? Worse: am I infected, too?\\" (75). Saleem revisits his grandfather who has just found religion at age sixty-eight and finds Aziz:I saw the cracks in his eyes - a delicate tracery of colourless lines against the blue; I saw a network of fissures spreading beneath his leathery skin. (275)(Saleem recognizes these cracks as death.) Aziz tells his family of his religious experience meeting God,...although the details of the particular deity he had seen grew blurred in his mind, leaving behind only a passionate, drooling desire for revenge (which is also common to us both)...he would refuse to go to Pakistan (as Reverend Mother planned). (276-277)Aziz dies on Christmas Day, 1963. The allusions to muscular Christianity and Colonialism are not lost. Even when presented with this force in his old age, Aziz responds with resistance. Aziz has always represented the secular generation in the novel. When he gets rid of the religious tutor in the beginning of the novel he says to his wife, \\"He was teaching them to hate, wife. He tells them to hate Hindus and Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs...\\" (42-43). Rushdie himself admits that he is secular:I am a member of that generation of Indians who were sold the secular ideal. One of the things I liked, and still like, about India is that is based on a non-sectarian philosophy. I was not raised in a narrowly Muslim environment; I do not consider Hindu culture to be either alien from me or more important than the Islamic heritage. I believe this has something to do with the nature of Bombay, a metropolis in which the multiplicity of commingled faiths and cultures curiously creates a remarkably secular ambience. Saleem Sinai makes use, eclectically, of whatever elements from whatever sources he chooses. It may have been easier for his author to do this from outside modern India than inside it. (431)Even with the resistance of his own religion, Aziz succumbs to reclaim one before he dies. His openness to all religions shows that the idea of secularism transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh and aspires to familiarize itself to the world. The religious, secular and resistant characters are Rushdie's way to signal that his characters transcend narrowly defined cultures.All of the characters in the novel, while transcending narrowly defined cultures are trying to come to and understanding about colonialism, resistance and reclamation. Rushdie's perception of the \`big picture symbolism' (which he reveals through his characters) is coming to an understanding about something from experience, and by doing so, coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. Rushdie was able to see \\"the big picture\\" from his deracination from India as he writes the novel in England. The secular character in the novel, Saleem's grandfather Aadam Aziz, introduces this generation of secular thinkers. This school of thought then existed before the Independence of India, and the birth of Saleem. Secularism is one example of an idea that transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh. This seems to be Rushdie's overarching objective: to leave us all with an understanding about something, and by doing so coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. We must remember the events the characters and the history of this story for:\\"It may be argued that the past is a country from which we have all emigrated, That its loss is part of our common humanity.\\" -Salman Rushdie"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"If this book was described by 1001 readers, I think you'd get 10,001 different views of what they experienced. Some knowledge of the history of India & Pakistan before and after independence and the partition will be helpful. Perhaps some \\"-ism\\" (magical real(ism), coming-of-age(ism); post-modern(ism); stream of .....) reading would prepare you for this. But neither is required to enjoy it. Having read many of the less than stellar reviews, it seems that many had preconceived notions that weren't met or they tried to make it a fast read.This is not a \\"page turner\\" suspense novel; nor is it Joycean (or any other author's). It is Rushdie. This is what he writes and how he writes. Read it for its own style rather than trying to compare it with someone else.I think too much effort is made by publishers and reviewers to put authors into groups. I'm sure the publishers do it to capture buyers with \\"if you like A, then you'll like B\\". Reviewers too often do it to show how many authors they have read rather than making valid comparisons.Base your judgment of Rushdie (or any of his books) on what you like or dislike about his work rather than by \\"someone says he is like Marquez and he isn't, so I didn't like it\\"."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Much has been written about the unique writing style of Salman Rushdie and Midnight's Children. It is hip to like it and thus call oneself a literary, and not unusual to dislike it as an uninitiated reader who cannot possibly know what to expect a priori. For what it's worth, here is my attempt to characterize the style. The book is written as a \\"stream of consciousness\\", long long long sentences, side-by-side repetition of adjectives for emphasis (hint hint hint!), use of synonyms similes parellels without punctuation or separators (again for emphasis), revealing the plot's end-game in advance yet (or thus) engaging the reader in the path to getting there, repeated summaries each to make an overarching point than to simply recollect the story so far, admitted insecurity and intermittent defense of the story's believability, and did I mention rechristening of events and characters with metaphoric names. If you could read and follow the last sentence in one shot, you are ready to read and enjoy Midnight's Children. The story-telling is hallucinatory on the surface, but enlightened underneath; deliriously exaggerated on the surface, but scrupulously balanced underneath; grossly fatalistic on the surface, but hopelessly optimistic underneath; carelessly raw on the surface, but meticulous genius underneath.Never judge a book by its cover, judge it by its metaphors. Besides being one intense allegory, the book is a collection of the richest metaphors I've ever read in a piece of literature. Metaphors, mind you, and not its evil cousin, Analogies. Every event and character is first rechristened with its metaphoric name. In the process of writing the book, Rushdie has created a new vocabulary of words that become the best way (if not the only way) to describe those characters and events.Spoiler alert: To pick from this new vocabulary, one way of characterizing the life of Saleem Sinai, and therefore the book, is Sperectomy: the draining-out of hope. To quote the last sentence of the book that sums it up \\"...because it is the privilege and the curse of midnight's children to be both masters and victims of their times, to forsake privacy and be sucked into the annihilating whirlpool of the multitudes, and to be unable to live or die in peace.\\"Midnight's Children is a great way to live vicariously through post-colonial India. IfA Fine Balanceis a bus-ride through India with a good commentator, Midnight's Children is your dark roller-coaster with ghosts popping out at you at every turn. IfA Fine Balanceis real in a touchy-and-feely way that you wish it was unreal, Midnight's Children is unreal in a mystical way that you will hate to, and yet force yourself to believe it is real; just like a post-traumatic nightmare, only it was a re-enactment."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Yes it's a very important momentous book but it's also incredibly undisciplined and selfindulgent ie unexplained non-universally understood in-jokes and references.I got the sense that if there were a hundred layers and levels of meaning, I got only 25 to 33 layers, and the rest was above my head (I am Asian American raised in New York and living in Los Angeles without a deep knowledge of history but who reads the New York Times).I felt the same way about Call It Sleep by Henry Roth."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Despite its rave reviews, the author's Wwiting style or &#34;voice&#34; in which every sentence contains a multiplicity of parenthetical ,sometimes extraneous, statements forced me to abandon the novel as slogging through the maze was just too tiring to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a wildly ambitious novel (what Rushdie work isn't?), that for the most part succeeds. The prose is absolutely gorgeous at times, and is consistently awe-inspiring. However, this book frequently digresses into a state of borderline tedium. This is not a book that you can just plow through on a couple of rainy afternoons (unless you're some kind of inhuman literate beast - something we should all aspire to be =P), this is a book that you bite off in digestible pieces and savor.Rushdie has been and will always be a writer's writer. Even so, there is plenty of entertainment value in this work that anyone with a modicum of literary fortitude would be well-served to enjoy.If you are deciding whether to start with \\"Midnight's Children\\" or \\"Satanic Verses\\" I would suggest SV for avid readers as I believe it is better, and I would recommend MC for the more casual reader as it is more accessible.My rating for \\"Midnight's Children\\": 9/10"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie really is the most extraordinary stylist. Reading \\"Midnight's Children\\", I came up with the appellation \\"The Steve Vai of the Pen\\". If you're not a rock fan it may bear pointing out that Vai is the guitarist who can make his guitar laugh and speak like a human voice. I swear Rushdie could write sentences that sound like an electric guitar if he wanted.Rushdie has a reputation as an intellectual and a hard read, but nothing could be farther from the truth. This book is a riot - complex and deep, but ebullient and compulsive. By turns orotund and bawdy, fragrant and crude, it simply crams so much in that it is impossible to pin the book down with a simple phrase. Part solipsistic fantasy, part psychosis, part history-by-proxy, it is several books in parallel. One stylistic trick that reminds me, jarringly, of Stephen King is Rushdie's device of events echoing forward in time - not prolepsis, but hints and fragments of what is to come, sometimes accompanied by an affected narrative twitch as the writer steers himself back to the matters at hand. The effect is one of a compulsive forward momentum, drawing the reader into a book like the perspective lines and streets of a painting.So what is the book about? Well, that's a hard one. I would call it the tragedy of Indian nationhood. The protagonist, Midnight's Child, is born with India at the stroke of independence and fated to live out its life in synecdoche. The supernaturalist bent of its realisation is a little clunky, but then I live surrounded by homoeopaths, creationists and astrologers. Such is modern life. The climacteric in which he is sundered from his fate is the horror of India's forced sterilisations, a final loss of innocence for a state already hopelessly compromised by contact with realpolitik and superpower patronage. Perhaps this was the point at which the Mahatma's sanctifying imprint was finally washed from the soil and India became just another lost, modern state. If so, welcome to Earth.At any rate, the Child is finally eaten up and churned away in the mass, individual talent macerated and lost in a cacophony of 600 million voices. An allegory of the wider individual in the midst of the conflict of ideologies that scarred the 20th Century?This is perhaps not the greatest book in 25 years, as the Booker prize would have it, but it is an important one, maybe even a work of genius. Perhaps it is about lost hopes. Then again, perhaps it is about the ambiguity of venom. And perhaps it is about pickles. I'm going to go with the latter."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"If you are looking for a nice relaxing book to read this is not the one for you. However if you are looking for a challenge then you may just enjoy this novel. The story is heavily hidden within the pages and at occasionally I was lost in the rambling sentences that at times,went on for more than a page.I was hoping for something profound to happen at the end of the story but it just sort of petered out as if the writer got tired of telling the story.Perhaps I am just not of a high enough intelligence to truley appreciate this epic tale."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"his best book...he is so erudite and knowledgeable on a global level...i was in india at the tail end of the pakistani/india conflict...his universal eye increased my understanding of this age old tribal war."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Be warned: this is not an easy read. It is what happens if the history of a country is condensed into a novel. There is an incredible number of characters, which represent something. There is an incredible number of references to events, ways of thinking, political directions and to the history and society at the base of it. It is very well written in a way that you will feel like being there and watching the events in person.It is still relevant; it will help you to understand some of the problems on the subcontinent."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"It's a scintillating, rich piece of writing, for sure. It just branches out into so many directions using so many styles, bouncing and reflecting between them. Historical and political events transmute freely and exuberantly into personal identity and vice versa. It's much less claustrophobic and crazed than the Satanic Verses, this definitely shares the same playful mixing of the mystical and the mundane, but it seems much less dark, and even the bleakest parts feel thrillingly alive. He just has this incredibly lyrical way of making coincidences, foreshadowing and outright prophecies collide and mix in with each other. I can't speak for others, but I found it very hard to not be drawn into Saleem's world, nose and all"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a masterpiece of literature and history. It has a unique style which combines prose, storytelling, magic realism, and historical fiction and moves them along like a horse at the racetrack. It is like caviar: I can't read too much at one sitting for it's too rich. I like to savor it one chapter at a time. I laugh and cry while my mind is churned up with images and ideas. The references to Indian languages, religions, culture, history and folklore enrich the adventure, allowing me to emmerse myself in the writer's universe, and also the world of the 1940's and 50's. I reread passages and constantly find something new. Although this book was written over 25 years ago, it still resonates with us today. Salman Rushdie is not only a genuis but a phenomenon, and, in case you couldn't tell, I love this book. I took it from the library, but had to return it after three weeks because it was on hold for someone else. I wanted to have my own copy, so I could read and reread it whenever I wanted, and share it with family and friends."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Very voluminous, but a great read. I love the way Rushdie, cajoles you into his themes and plots and sub-plots. Not a simple read, but of a generation of writers who take the time to write, and hence you need to take the time to read!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie plays with language and stories, but he still manages to keep us captivated. This is above and beyond a novel, with a lot on it's mind, and a fantasticly creative way to tell it"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I read this on the trains traveling in India. Definitely the most enjoyable way to learn about the history of India since independence. It was hard to put down, even while traveling through distant and novel landscapes."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The narrator for this book was Lyndam Gregory. This is the first time that I have heard him, but I thought he did a great job. I enjoy listening to books where it is obvious who is speaking by the characterizations done by the reader. Gregory did that extremely well and his accents, tones, and everything else he did with the voices of the different characters made this a pleasurable listening experience.This is the first time that I have read Rushdie and I enjoyed the novel. It was quite different than anything else I have read and I thought that the premise that the history of India was tied to the life of this boy was a fun concept. This is basically an historical allegory. The cultural milieu is quite different than what I am used to, but it gave me a new perspective. I found the introduction to this edition interesting when Rushdie talked about the lawsuit Indira Gandhi brought against him for defamation due to a single sentence about her personal life. Given how he made fun of almost all historical figures, it is interesting that she took it seriously enough to react that way; he must have really hit a sensitive spot.I highly recommend this audio book. It is a fun way to be introduced to Salmon Rushdie."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I liked the story in this book. The whole idea was very clever and the characters were likable. However, it took me forever to finish this book due to the writing style. In short, it was confusing.

I'm not much of a history buff, but I did enjoy learning more about India's recent history from Saleem's perspective. When I finished the novel, I was physically and mentally exhausted, more glad to be done than anything else, but, despite that, I am very glad to have read it. The story itself is not boring, but it does take a lot of time to get through, so I would not recommend reading this when you are particularly stressed or hurried (as I did), because you won't be able to get through it."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"In Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie integrates self-awareness with national identity. He demonstrates brilliantly how the national events in which we live influences our perceptions and worldview, and how our subsequent reactions (emotional, actual) become integral to ourselves. As when Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, and India becomes a free nation, each of us experiences the midnight effect of being born into a nation at the moment of our birth. We are very much the product of our culture and consequential political envelope. We devise our own interpretation of events and distort them in memory to serve an (ever-changing) identity that drifts in an illusion of permanence and reality. The intentional distortion of historic events by a multitude of political factions adds to the illusionary veil of reality so that our assertions of truth and fact are further clouded. Rushdie's mystic reality is a perfect method to portray the mysticism of India, yet surely serves as a cross-cultural illustration of the deep mysticism of the human condition. We are all a chimera of our conscious/unconscious perceptions, associations, emotional reflections, and memory. The outward manifestations of change due aging are held together by the content of our surroundings; a history of events and experiences, some verifiable by supporting accounts, others more fraught with illusion and fantasy.Midnight's Children carries the reader through a mirage of associations, reoccurring themes, and events - self-evolved by the selective recall of the author/character - in an intense reenactment of Saleem's life, a life portrayed within changing national backdrops, family, friends, loves and enemies, desires, fears, dreams, all melded in meaning and illusion. Are we the same at nine years old as at ten, or thirty, or sixty? Is vacillation in actions and convictions apparent, evident? The flow of existence is a continuity, a continuity of recalled events, external markers, and physical evidence; but of internal perceptions, beliefs, we have little empirical evidence to fall back on other than memory, a fallible proposition at best! We, like Saleem, are constantly adrift between these states.Saleem is gifted, as a result of his magical moment of birth coinciding with his India's independence, with \\"...the greatest talent of all - the ability to look into the hearts and minds of men.\\" This telepathy at an early age, however, leads to a combination of uncertainty, disillusion, and an unfocused call to action that ultimately results in a sort of observational existence, more a life of commentary and evasion than direction or goals. But maybe that's the point, direction itself is an illusion. The steps we take must surely be connected, yet the path that results is as much chance as fortitude. How were the hands dealt at birth determined? Why an estate rather than a slum, or a slum rather than an estate? It all seems real enough, until you read Midnight's Children and explore those assumptions."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is my second experience with Salman Rushdie. I read Haroun and the Sea of Stories awhile back. I believe that I chose to read this after seeing it highly recommended in Nancy Perl's \\"Book Lust\\" lists. I am looking for novels that will engross me with a story, give me a characters that I care about, and have a narrative voice that I trust. Like Ellison's \\"Invisibile Man\\", one of my favorite novels, I found Rushdie's Midnight Children to create a compelling narrator whose voice lingers and reveals great truth about his nation and culture.Some readers may not care for Saleem Sinai. He's unreliable as a narrator. He's loose with time and sequence and foreshadows. He meanders. He is struck with his self-importance. I found all of the digressions and explorations of Saleem Sinai to give the book its character and spice.The premise of the novel is extraordinary. The concept of the magical Midnight's Children who are both all powerful and powerless in and India that is not accomodating to their powers is a potent allegorical device. Saleem's relation to his own gifts and his own connection to the fate of his nation is especially profound and I wish that I had more knowledge of history, especially the history of Pakistan, to be able to fully appreciate the scope of Rushdie's nation revealing efforts.Ultimately, this is a book that is as much about a family and for those readers who are not into the allegorical and political dimensions of the book I still feel that it is worth giving the book 25 pages or so and seeing what you feel about it. If you can appreciate Saleem's voice and the story of his grandfather that begins the novel, you will certainly appreciate the book when Saleem enters his story and the plot moves more consistently through his life. Even missing the political and allegorical dimensions of the book, this can be read as a meditation on how a supremely gifted child succeeds and fails to be fully embraced by his family.Midnight's Children sucked me in and was worth the effort to get through. I hope that you will be similarly blessed by this ambitious book.5 stars"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's voice is unique, and if you haven't read anything by him yet, Midnight's Children is a good place to start. Be prepared for intriguing characters, long flights of fancy, enough historical facts to keep the novel anchored in reality, and insightful comments on human nature. Winner of the Booker Prize when it was first published in 1980, it also received the prestigious \\"Best Book in 25 Years\\" Booker Prize."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"After recently finishing Mistry's 'A Fine Balance' I planned to give myself a break from Indian lit for a while, but finding myself without a book on the other side of the country, the only books in the shop that called out to me were Indian - so I bought three!Midnight's children is regarded as a classic, and deservingly so. I cannot help but contrast it with 'A Fine Balance' which I so recently read. Both are brilliantly written, inspiring books that intricately intertwine with India's tumultuous history. Yet they are as different as night and day. Midnight's children, although similarly passing through some quite dark hours of history, does not have the deflating, depression quality that the other book has. If anything Rushdie's writing shows symptoms of the 'disease of optimism' that his characters and his country so often succumb to in the novel. Despite the flawed narrator Saleem's neverending series of mishaps and his sense of inevitable doom, I couldn't help but feeling upbeat throughout this novel.Part of what makes this book so interesting is that it combines history with fantasy. Not just in the usual sense of historical fiction, but in a more magical, mystical sense. I won't go into detail but this makes this book a delight to read. The first person narration is quirky, racing forwards and backwards and admittedly suffering from errors of memory and chronology but never too off-beat so as to get confusing (or rarely so).Yet another book I highly recommend. Look forward to reading more of Salman Rusdhie's work in the future."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is real story telling an abundance of characters neatly tied together in an overwhelmingly rich language. The metaphors impressively telling, the story moving forward at high speed between back flashes. This is a book I for some reason put aside after the first pages more than twenty years ago and considering that at the time, I had no problem reading 'One hundred years of Solitude' by Gabriel Garcia Marques, who is also using this magic-realistic prose, I am very happy to be able to compensate and torealize how wrong I was then."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I have to say, I don't get this book.

What a great non-English/American piece of literature."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"It took a few chapters to get used to Rushdie's writing style. By the end of the book it really grew on me and I ended up enjoying the book. The writing has a negative tone, and all the events in the main character's life were foreshadowed - not the whimsical book I was expecting. Still a very good book and worth the read. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"My introduction to Rushdie was via his novel Shame. By the end of that novel, I was just enamoured with the man. Every one told me that the midnights children is his best work and I could only salivate at the quality of story telling that I would get from reading this book then. Afterall if this was supposed to be better then Shame, it had to be the best thing ever written (for me that is).Based on this assumption, I started reading midnights children but unfortunately where Shame took me 4 days to finish, this book took me over 3 weeks to read. The story is not very interesting though the character development and weaving was well done. The book does drag on sometimes and caused me to lose track of what the story was at certain specific points in the book.This is a 3 star book for me at best."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of those books I tell everyone to read, and have read several times myself.

Based on children who were born on the eve of Indian indedpendance it is a dizzying ride on a carpet of magic realism. Rushdie's sharp observations, his breathtakingly beautiful prose and his unique imagination make this one of the masterpieces to have come out of English writing. It is long and one needs some amount of determination to have it finished, but it's worth it. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Reading this book revealed to me the true threat of Rushdie--which is not his religious beliefs or how he weaves them into his novels, but rather his mastery of the art of fiction. I wasn't sure whether this book was poetry or prose as I read it. Much like Faulkner's, Rushdie's words flow almost musically around his characters. Yes, you learn a lot about India and its independence struggles, but more importantly Rushdie pulls you into this swirl of magical characters, so much so that you don't want to leave"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The book is magical - a blend of history and absurdity that yields profound insights into the human condition. Set around the independence of India, it affords the reader some insights into that sub-continent. Of course, many lesser forms, such as TV programs, do the same thing. This book goes far beyond that buoyed by its wonderful humor (I promise you won't forget the black mango or Saleem as a 10-year-old &quot;comforting&quot; his distraught and beautiful aunt. This book both celebrates and transcends time and place - while you will learn much about India and Pakistan, you do not need that knowledge to appreciate the insights into the human condition that come shining through. There is sadness and disappointment beneath all of the hilarity of Saleem's adventures, behind the irony of Rushdie's description of the Indo-Pakastani war in which &quot;only three bombs were dropped&quot;, but those three bombs killed nearly all his family in both India and Pakistan. This book will make you laugh out loud, sigh inwardly, and ponder the human condition. Midnight's Children succeeds at doing for the birth of India what Thomas Pynchon failed so miserably to do for the birth of the U.S. in Mason &amp; Dixon."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Excellent storytelling - with a mixture ofopinions, philosophy and history that is never boring, blended with endless surprises."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"A masterpiece of fiction, Midnight's Children is not to bemissed. Rushdie is the master of suspense, humor, drama and historyin this page-turner. Midnight's Children is chock full of illusion, humor, history, drama, mysticism and more....a full plate for many readers, and yet you cannot put it down once you enter the world of the protagonist, Saleem. Rushdie keeps you guessing, makes you laugh out loud, and provides small clues along the way through the birth of a nation, and the life of Saleem. Rushdie is never predictable, and neither is Saleem. The author has a definitive knowledge of not only India, Islam and the culture, but also of that which we call the human experience. His characters are real, and at times surreal. Saleem experiences life and the trials and tribulations with humorous hindsight, and the foundation of a culture unknown to many in the west. Of all of Rushdie's books, this is one that will definitely be the classic in the ages to come."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"So what was all the fuss about? The Book to beat all Bookers, the Booker of Bookers... a breathtaking, beguiling and even bulging book packed with words spun by a master of the written form - yeah, I liked it!Certainly, it's a bit of a plateful and a touch overcooked in parts, but this smorgasbord of a novel left me stuffed and satisfied at every sitting.Like Marquez with his 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', Rushdie captures a whole continent, a civilisation, as he takes us through the birth of the newly independent India, seen through the eyes of his protagonist, Saleem Sinai. He lays the story before you with a brilliance that dazzles and a style that leaves you wanting more.No indigestion tablets needed here, just a comfy armchair and a footstool to digest the often bizarre plot lines that pepper this feast of fiction. It's funny too, and that's what made it for me - that and the characters (especially Saleem), who are painted with a warmth and sympathy that makes them all the more endearing.I guarantee that as soon as you taste the starter you'll be drooling for the main course, and the dessert will just melt in your mouth. Don't rush it - sit back and enjoy this 'Midnight' feast"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"What a joy. This book is full of life and jokes and history.

(I was told this was a good place to start with Rushdie.) I admired very much the ambition of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN. Rushdie is to be commended for trying to write a great book. He almost did it. The first half is really vivid and enthralling. Rushdie's prose is truly winged. However, somewhere about halfway through the novel (about the time the narrator leaves Pakistan), I lost interest and the rest of the book became a chore to finish. There really wasn't much of a payoff either, considering all the time invested in reading such a thick book. I think MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN would have been a much stronger book had it been pruned by at least a third. There were also too many loose ends for my taste. I'm glad I read the book though, and I think I have a pretty good idea of Rushdie's strengths and weaknesses as a writer now. It's not a bad book, but it's far from being a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This review essentially deals with the author Salman Rushdie rather than this book, because after all Midnight's Children is the 'Booker of Bookers', what more can one add? - except to state that if you are preoccupied with 'magic' then you have spectacularly missed the point of this book. The allegorical nature of its construction, its metaphors and its historical dramas are what is important here; its allusions and not any apparent wizardry. As my title said, this most certainly is not Harry Potter for readers and I wish reviewers would stop wasting their words on that topic and instead re-read and re-examine the core themes, dramas and constructs of what is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written.Salman Rushdie is to Literature, what George W. Bush was to American politics. Seldom has history witnessed individuals who possess such an ability to thoroughly polarize their respective audiences. Love or loathe, there can be nothing in between. For reference, my feet are firmly on the 'love' side of the divide.In continuum, one thing I personally find fascinating about Rushdie is his ability to alienate people in equal numbers to those he utterly enthralls. As per the aforementioned correlation there are those that he utterly repulses and repels and that fascinates me. What is the reason for this? It is fair to say that, that which we are able to 'read' (and by read I mean in the Mortimer Aldler sense of the word), is a direct reflection of our own intellect or lack thereof, and I sincerely believe that this is one reason why Rushdie irritates so many people. He irritates people because most people are not that bright and are not really 'readers'; not actually literate per se. What I mean by that last comment is that people no longer seem able to concentrate on a book (or much else besides television), or to dig for deeper meaning; to read between the lines and to grasp allegory and metaphorical allusions. In today's world of get-rich-quick everyone wants to be Eric Clapton but no one wants to put in the hours, henceforth people buy 'Guitar Hero'. Life is not a game of 'Guitar Hero'.It's interesting to draw parallels between Rushdie and another English author, Stephen Fry. Fry is also an intellectual heavyweight with a wonderfully sharp and agile brain and an extensive vocabulary. Unlike Rushdie, however, Fry is big and cuddly, has round edges and not sharp corners and I think that is one reason why the public take to him more easily. Besides which he is also flawed and slightly imperfect; he reaches out to us where Rushdie pulls away. To Fry's non-threatening modelling-clay persona Rushdie is perfect, unforgiving and cold, a statuesque individual carved from the hardest granite. One can't also help but feel that perhaps Rushdie's ethnicity rubs people up the wrong way, or is that just a cheap shot on my part and merely an easy way to find an answer to my question? One cannot help but wonder, though, if it isn't hard for those outside the liberal Literary establishment to accept a man of colour is more brilliant, better educated and ore mellifluous than they could ever hope to be. Again, that might just be smoke-and-mirrors, a cheap shot on my behalf, a quick-fix to a more complex quandary.To return to my second paragraph, I personally adore the fact that I have to read Rushdie with a green highlighter in hand (green is my colour for unknown words). I adore the fact that Rushdie crushes my ego, and belittles my vocabulary. I love the fact he challenges me to become a better reader to widen my vocabulary. I love the fact that Cambridge-educated Rushdie has a higher intellect than I, because he is SUPPOSED to have. An author (like any artiste) should ideally not be an everyman, should not be a Stephen King or a Jeffery Archer. Authors of Literature should shoulder the responsibility of raising the bar and challenging our collective consciousness, and Rushdie relishes that opportunity and performs that rle admirably, a perfect casting.If you don't get the beauty and elegance of this book, then you simply have not understood it and I sincerely urge you re-read it, preferably with a green highlighter in hand!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The first time I tred to read this book I got about one third of the way through. It didn't hold my interest. I liked the writing style sometimes, but it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Then I tried again. This time I found it much easier, but I was still sometimes bored, and I was not sure why this was such a great book. Finally, I started nearing the end, and I began to figure out what this book actually was. It wasn't so much some particular thing in the book at that point as the entire narrative starting to cumulatively come together.This book is a masterpiece, entirely deserving of the Booker Prize it won. It gives one a sense of Indian history--not the country as a whole, which would be boring and impersonal, but as lived by the protagonist, Saleem. (And presumably by Rushdie, who is almost the same age--though the novel as a whole is certainly not autobiographical.) The humor, joy, tragedy, and anger all work. This was the first book of Rushdie's I read. It will not be the last."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"While Salman Rushdie released in the mid-seventies a book called GRIMUS that bombed and promptly went out of print, it was his 1980 work MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN that catapaulted Rushdie to international attention and really started his career. Winning first the Booker Prize, and later the \\"Booker of Bookers\\" (that is, the best of all novels to win that British prize), MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a tale of India from the beginning of the 20th century to 1977 that holds a mirror up to history.Narrated by Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of midnight on the August night in 1947 when India officially became independent, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN begins with the history of his grandparents in Kashmir and then alludes to the killings of practioners of Gandhi's civil disobedience by British occupiers. Rushdie builds up considerable suspense as the timeline of his narrative approaches Sinai's birth. Afterwards, the novel deals with Saleem's upbringing, his coming of age, and a stint in Pakistan's army before returing to the heart of India. While the book could have used a more energetic editor and some parts drag, the final 200 pages of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN make it entirely deserving of the heaps of praise showered on it so far.There are elements of magical realism in MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but often with a characteristically Indian twist. All of the surviving members of the 1001 children born at midnight of August 15, 1947 have special powers, in Saleem's case it is a form of telepathy that allows his to bring together telepathically the children of midnight in a conclave each evening. Towards the end of the novel Saleem encounters practioners of magic influenced by Hindu mysticism that impacts the plot immensely. But alongside the magical elements is astute commentary on the reality of modern India. Rushdie's tendency to always look at Pakistan (and Bangladesh) and India together, in spite of lines on a map, gives an interesting perspective to the culture and politics of the region.While Rushdie is always an entertaining author, his tendency to take an absurd amount of elements from other works of literature sometimes dilutes his originality. Much of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is taken from Gunter Grass' novel THE TIN DRUM, a book with which Rushdie claims inspired his to begin writing. Like Oskar Mazerath, Saleem Sinai is a young man of questionable paternity who has special powers and remains aloof from the madness of his age as he reports it. Saleem, just like the narrator of THE TIN DRUM, follows his mother to a cafe to watch an adulterous meeting, and instead of a tin drum Saleem refuses to be parted from a silver spitoon. While all authors are influenced by their predecessors, I found MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN to be far too unoriginal at times. Rushdie's later work is much better in this respect.I find THE SATANIC VERSES to be Rushdie's finest novel, and would recommend that to anyone who has not read his work before. It's a brilliant and excellently constructed roller-coaster (and I say that with no hyperbole) of a novel that is all the more important because of its impact on East-West relations of the late 80's and early 90's. After reading that, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a good choice for further Rushdie."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Ok I've re-read this book eight times, since the age of fourteen. I think that's why it took me till the sixth time to realize the book was about India, from Independence upto the 1970s. 'Midnight's Children' refers to that generations of Indians which lived right after independence, i.e. 1947. So-called because it was at midnight, 15th August 1947 that India(and Pakistan + the about-to-be Bangladesh) were born out of British India. It tells the story of Saleem Sinai who was born on Midnight, Independence day, and whose life is tied to that of his country's. Along with Saleem, another son was born almost at the same time: Shiva. These two represent the two different sides of India that are so familiar: Saleem represented the affluent, British-educated cosmopolitan and tolerant India. Shiva, represented the hungry-starving dog-eat-dog India, and how those two grew up together, separated, yet tied together. Plus all the hopes and dreams which were assocaited with the formation of this new India, the \\"tryst with Destiny\\" e.t.c. With the actual history of India as the backdrop. Saleem was one of many 'Midnight's Children', another name for India's democracy, and parliament. And goes on to show how Indira Gandhi neutered them (she declared a National Emergency, declared martial Law, and brought on the onset of disabling Socialist policies, the effect of which are still being felt). The book is written very well, but some of the Indian references will go over non-Indian readers' heads. Also, the state of India as Rushdie describes it is correct for the late 70s and early 80s, and has no bearing on the India of the 90s onwards. I think it's time to write a novel on Midnight's Grand-children, to the see the sparkling changes they are making on their nation. This book is only for people who have a significant interest in India. Not for the casual reader, and not a book to read for anybody who wants the most up-to-date story on India. Unfortunately there isn't a novel on that as of now."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"While prolific at times, there is too much \\"borrowing\\" from other authors, which I found upsetting. Particularly Marquez's use of \\"butterfly imagry\\" and the non-stop sentences. Can't we be a little more original? This really irritated me. I plowed through this book, and found some parts flowing and well written, while other parts were forced over exaggerations, and very pretentious on the authors part. Don't know how I ever managed to finish it, but was glad when it ended, leaving me with very little (I read it in India, but that didn't help). While an Indophile, I tend to read everything Rushdie anyways, and feel he doesn't come into his own until \\"The Moors Last Sigh,\\" which I really loved. I am now busy with \\"Ground Beneath Her Feet,\\" which so far (and I just began), has a bit of immaturity and silliness to it, but I'll give it a chance. I feel \\"Midnight's Children\\" is a bit disjointed and its \\"brilliance\\" is very inconsistent."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"In 1981, Salman Rushdie published Midnight Children, a novel that one can say belongs to the genre of magic realism. Though the genre has been totally dominated by Latin American writers --Garcia Marquez, Juan Rulfo, Isabel Allende, and Laura Esquivel-- the Indian author Rushdie holds his own.Not only does he use magic realism --the fantastic, the magical, the strange-- as a useful technical tool, but he transcends it to portray the almost unreal and surreal dimensions of the Indian subcontinent. And much like the Latin American writers, he brings a magic and refreshing view of the effects of colonialism.Though far from being a work immersed in social realism alone, Midnight Children, contains a great deal of parody and satire of India--but all done with artistry. Given to paradox and the absurd, it is hard at times to tell the serious from the comic. All in all we can say that humor prevails. And when we are in doubt we accept that the author means well and we read his humorous antics with goodwill--much as we do with Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy.For those who are language-oriented, the novel owns a treasure of hyperbole, similes, and metaphors: as when he refers to \\"pickles of history.\\" Pickles, for those who like them and eat them, leave a sour taste in your mouth, just like some episodes of Indian history.To present his own interpretation of reality, Rushdie tells us that \\"Sometimes legends make reality, and become more useful than the facts.\\" And he goes on the insert a series of tales and legends within the novel. Saleem, the busy and tireless narrator, is an almost incredible character. No sooner has he told us a few verities than he quickly jabs at us with exaggerations; no sooner he treats a fact than he contradicts it; no sooner he falls asleep than we see him acting in real life; no sooner he awakes than we know he's dreaming. And if that wasn't enough, the witch Parvati changes Saleem into an invisible being for some time. Ah! What a fine writer can do with language!When Saleem says:\\"Midnight has many children; the offspring of Independence were not all human. Violence, corruption, poverty, generals, chaos, greed, and pepperpots.... I had to go into exile to learn that the children of midnight were more varied than I--even I--had dreamed.\\" (333)Three points catch my attention: the enumeration of abstractions is capped with one concrete noun--pepperpots. On the surface this is an innocuous juxtaposition, but on deeper scrutiny we can see that Saleem is appealing to our sense of taste and smell, for pepper can be pungent and explosive. Just as we chuckle at \\"pickles of history,\\" we smile at Saleem's magical nose (or perhaps divine as in the elephant-headed god Ganesh): \\"Using my nose (because although it has lost the powers which enabled it, so recently, to make history), it has acquired other compensatory gifts....\\" Next, we can only imagine how psychotic the other children could be to outdo Saleem. And next, we are confronted with the problem of chaos.As readers, we are forced to keep track of time; a task that is easier said than done. Time in the novel is circular, fragmented, mythical, and cyclical--never linear. I cannot help thinking that all this is deliberate to simulate the chaotic societies that form the Indian nation.Much of what was prophesied of Saleem --a symbol for India-- has come to pass:\\"Newspapers shall praise him, two mothers shall raise him.! Bicyclists love him, but crowds will shove him! Washing will hide him- voices will guide him! Friends mutilate him- blood will betray him! Spitoons will brain him- doctors will drain him- jungle will claim him - wizards reclaim him! Soldiers will try him- tyrants will fry him. He will have sons without having sons. He will be old before he is old... And he will die....before he is dead.\\"With one exception: India will never die, for very much like China, India is a thriving force and the economic heart and pulse of the planet. Not only is Salman Rushdie a true child of Scheherazade's, just like her he will also go on telling stories to go on living one more day.The only writing guide I consult to write my articles is Mary Duffy's Toolbox for Writers, which amazon.com sells."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children centers around the protagonist, Saleem Sinai, recounting the story of his life to his lover one night. In his life is the entirety of Indian post-independent history; in and on his body are the markings and symbols that relate to his country. He is a member of a group of people born the evening that Indian was freed from British rule, each person born with special powers elevating them from the rest of the population. This story at its core is of the parallels that Saleem (and his friends) shares with India, and what a most unusual story it is. This book is 560 pages of complete storytelling mastery. It is an epic of magical realism, fully deserving its comparisons with \\"The Tin Drum\\" and \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\" Rushdie writes to the edges of the page and beyond, filling every sentence with originality and crazy invention that (wildly) has the control never to veer off into complete farce, which is indeed a gift. It is highly intellectual and complex, but written with deep humor and pathos, told by a narrator that continually holds the reader's hand to get them through the tough spots. The places that this book goes and the experiences it offers the reader could not be properly encapsulated in any review, so just note that it is worthy of all its praise and is easily one of the best books of the last century."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"He (salman rushide) displays a unique style of writing in his Midnight's children, besides being very playful with his words and sentences. His work is not structured like a typical novel - list of characters, a plot/suspense and a climax..In his view, after all this is a memoir, he describes how he has organized it. Each chapter is a jar of pickle. Has a raw material (character) and he adds the right amount of spices (characteristics) to make them irresistible.His characters die before they are born, he has no interest in suspense. While each jar focuses on one character, bits and pieces of other characters are added to enhance/enrich taste of the pickle in making, exhibiting different characteristics. After tasking all the jars, one is only left with awe of characters. they are seasoned so well that one can't be judgemental about them and this applies to both the major and minor. There is no good or bad. They are just there!Content however is common sense. He captures the pulse of South Asian families. (Indian/Pakistan/Bangladesh) across different economic statures and how they are affected by personal and political views of the day. He is exhaustive with the content (without being boring) that it is hard to notice anything missing from the book. (Of course there will be something missing, because it is a fixed edition and he acknowledges and convinces the reader that it is not his fault...)What exhaustive book, can be complete without asking the basic question...\\"Who what am I?\\". (Thats right, he plays with the words, makes his own sentences.)Now who can conjure a new answer to that, and yet has anyone answered this question yet? here he goes...\\"My answer (he says) : I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I've gone which would not have happened if I had not come.\\""},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is perhaps strange in that it is an immensely popular novel but is also very intellectual and even esoteric. The story is narrated by Saleem Sinai, who was born at the exact moment of India's Independence. He is a very self-reflective narrator, who lets us in on his own perspective on his story-telling, as well as telling us the reaction of his servant Padma who is also listening to the story and who affects it as well. There are many twists and turns regarding the relationships between characters; there are name changes, nick-names, false-starts. This is of course what Salman Rushdie is interested in.Rushdie has said that he thought this novel is about excess. You can see what he means as so much is packed into this novel and it is a credit to the author that he keeps this up all the way through (it took 5 years to write, apparently). But it also feels like it has been worked at, and requires a fair bit of working on the part of the reader. There are touching moments, and comic moments. These are genuine, but must be won by the reader who has to pay attention and keep up with the complexity of the novel.There is so much in this book that you notice new things about it each time you read it. Rushdie has said that he quite likes it when he comes across words from different cultures in books (e.g. Jewish phrases in Roth). It would be best if readers share Rushdie's view when reading Rushdie himself as there are all sorts of words and phrases here that are not all explained."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's writing style is magic to read, and his words pull you into the stories he weaves. At some points in the book, you do start to notice how long it is, but for the most part, it's very enjoyable! I will read another of his books!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie certainly stands out in style from other authors and that makes this book a refreshing change of pace. If you are looking for a quick and easy read, this isn't for you. This book, like many classics of the 20th century, has a complicated and convoluted storyline in places. His writing style can be difficult to follow at times as he doesn't follow the typical rules of grammar. As one reviewer indicated, you will enjoy the story more and get more out of it, with even a nominal understanding of some of India's culture and history. That being said, I found myself actually enjoying the story more in retrospect than I did as I was reading it. This book actually lived up to its hype but not in the way I expected."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"While I enjoyed the magical realism of the book and the exotic setting, I did not care for the characters. Feces run through this book. At one point, the narrator describes a man defecating into his own hand and proudly proclaiming the length of this fecal masterpiece. The beauty of the language is literally mired in filth."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a flamboyant account of the history of a boy, Saleem, who is intertwined with the history of a new country, India. He is born at the stroke of midnight carrying with him powers of telepathy that connect him to the other 1001 midnight's children that our born on the birth of India. The other children also carry gifts, changing genders, witchcraft, levitation, time-travel, etc.Saleem's nemesis, Shiva, was also born at the same moment but born into poverty and has the powers to resist Saleem's telepathic powers. In the book, we witness the growing pains of a new country and the ill-conceived notion of what these talented children try to accomplish - changing India for the better. Instead we witness the fragmentation of the new country and religious boundaries being drawn between the Indian (Hindu) and Pakistanis (Muslim) and Bangladesh (Muslim). Saleem's life and family are intertwined with the history of India, as the country separates and clash, the life and family of Saleem are also destroyed.This is the first novel I've read of Rushdie's after he performed a reading at the Chicago Public Library. He is clearly a talented writer, but I wish I was more in tune with Indian history and politics; some of the symbolism was over my head. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book very much and plan on reading his new book that takes place in New York, Fury."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"There is little else to say.

Is it India? Yes. No. It represents the complexity and the clash of culture that is India."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Flipping through the reviews, I was amazed at the number of two and five star reviews. I came up with a possible explanation : either reviewers were Indian or very familiar with Indian culture (5), or they were not, and found the subtleties of Rushdie's language and the culture too difficult to negotiate (2). The book is a masterpiece, but requires a serious investment in getting to know India. If you fall in the first category of reviewer, it is a must read. If you are less familiar with Indian culture, you will still marvel at the beatiful language, but be prepared to be a little left out of the inside jokes."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The three stars does not indicate any lack of ability on Rushdie's part, only my lack of connection. I can read an Eco novel and laugh myself silly because I have enough knowledge of his references to get most of the metaphors.

I don't give up on Rushdie. I loved The Enchantress of Florence and the interviews I have heard with him have left me with the desire to read more of his stuff. If you're going to tackle Midnight, however, I'd bone up a little first. [...]"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is the epic story of post-colonial India. All of India, across all of India's children and also across time. Our fateful narrator is Saleem Sinai, a boy who was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the exact time that India gained its independence from Britain. He is destined to always be exactly the same age as his homeland. In some sense, he represents the whole country.Who is Saleem Sinai? Well in his own words from the novel,\\"Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I've gone which would not have happened if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each \\"I\\", everyone of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you'll have to swallow a world.\\"And from that, you get a sense of the grandiosity of the novel. No doubt, Midnight's Children is a challenge to read. No doubt, the narrative style is disorienting at first. No doubt, you will get bored when Rushdie waxes on for pages about a nose. But for some readers, like myself, it will have been a magnificently worthwhile read, a difficult uphill climb with the most astonishing views. The passages are beyond beautiful. The symbols are everywhere. The metaphors are endless. And the emotional impact is overwhelming.I absolutely loved this novel and am very grateful to have read it. I know it's not for everyone, but for me, it was intensely powerful.

Rushdie is the Shakespeare of our time."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"It is hard to categorize or pinpoint this novel's style. \\"Magical realism\\" comes to mind as a label, referring to the succession of supernatural and absurd situations, tightly enclosed within the cold reality of society and politics. But that same frame, as well as the personalized and introspective tone of the book, tie it too much to its specific context. For the same reasons, the adjective \\"epic\\" would be inadequate, even if Saleem Sinai's story is, playfully, the direct or indirect cause of modern India's historical landmarks. It reads like a novel from the Latin American \\"Boom\\" movement of the 1950's and 1960's, but it's not. In any case, it is a hard to follow novel but one that richly rewards the reader.The plot is most original and witty: Saleem Sinai is born exactly at 00:00 hours on August 15, 1947, at the same time as independent India. Within the following hour, some 500 kids are also born, who will be called \\"Midnight's Children\\" and who also will, each of them, posess a specific supernatural power. Saleem is born the son of a poor, wandering English musician and an Indian woman, but for mysterious reasons he is changed places with the heir of a rich Muslim family, the Sinais. Saleems carries, then, an original sin. He is malformed and reclusive, a seemingly natural born loser form who, however, great wonders are expected, as the result of an omen given to his \\"mother\\", as well as a portrait in the newspaper and a letter from Nehru.The novel traces the history of Saleems's family, his wealthy childhod, and the moment of coincidence between his adolescence and his magical power: the ability to listen to people's thoughts, and so to influence, deliberately or not, the history of India.There are to many characters, anecdotes, and suplots to be summarized here, but it is worth remarking the general sense of self-flagellation, the vocation for sordidness, and the unhappiness of History. Kind of an anti-Harry Potter, or more like a tropical Oskar Matzerath (\\"The Tin Drum\\") or unhappy Tristram Shandy, Saleem is a memorable character, and the story is very rich, funny, sad, political, intimate, and many things more. Do not expect, of course, a strict chronological line, nor things making realistic sense.

That doesn't make it easy, but for eighty percent of the book I was captivated by both the story and the writing.The use of Indian terms or colloquialisms, endearments was a bit frustrating and meant I was distanced from the culture being depicted not only by non-membership, but through language.But still, there are other places where the Indianness is hilarious and a testament to Rushdie&#65533;s skills at evoking images. There is a description of the \\"actress with a mountain of fruit on her head\\" in the pictures in a peepshow ... \\"Lifafa called her Carmen Verandah\\" Verandah is a word which has found its way into English from India, and this verbal joke about a Latin American actress is lovely.Coming from a country where the verandah was adopted as part of the architectural vernacular, I have an uncommon fondness for verandahs, both the word and the concept!Then I got to within 80 pages of the end, and just couldn't get excited about finishing it. Somehow, I didn&#65533;t really care any more.The best part of the storytelling was when Saleem was a child; somehow events filtred through childhood seemed more compelling.There is loads of symbolism; much of it just washed over me. I think Rushdie is a fine storyteller in his best passages, but other times merely pretentious.Absolutely worth reading, but I think it might encompass too great a time span, and be flawed for that"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I wanted to read a Rushdie book and I've heard this book being called the \\"Booker of the Bookers\\" (referring to the prize). Rusdie's writing may be poetic and beautiful, but it is hard to trudge through this fairly long book. Furthermore, Midnight's Children is not particularly educational as far as Indian history and culture. The author may deserve his great reputation for his writing style but don't expect to be entertained.Reading this book made me feel like I was back in highschool and reading a required book for English class. My apologies to literature lovers who may consider me a philistine."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This novel was really awful. Terribly slow, terribly boring, just plain terrible in general. ***spoiler alert*** Rusdie even knows it is terrible. Six pages from the end of the novel, where you are \\"finding out the mysteries\\" that the narrator has been \\"holding until the right time\\" he takes a 17 inch crap in front of the reader. By the way, there is nothing revealed really, the whole novel is just one long drawn out promise of SOMETHING happening, and then nothing happens.There is some wit in the novel, but it is tedious and excruciating rather than entertaining. Rushdie thinks it is cute to describe things or events or feeling as a string of words without punctuation. I will give an example: This novel is boring tedious obnoxious. That last example makes me feel like I should win a Booker prize.Every character in this novel is annoying. Every event is intended to confuse and reduce the reader's pleasure as they are reading it.I don't understand why this novel is so heavily regarded. I feel like it appeals to the more pretentious reader that thinks it is neat when the real is mixed with the fantastical, and then repeated over and over again. Every puzzle is just revealed after it has occured, so there is really no reward in understanding the author's cleverness. The narrator keeps telling us to \\"listen carefully\\" because he is going to tell us something important, but there is nothing important in this novel at all. It doesn't break any new ground, and it certainly isn't entertaining. It is also not interesting or intelligent. Though it is very frustrating to read, for when the reader works to understand it, the reader is not rewarded with anything. Except for poop, right there on page 527 out of 533, Salman states right there and then \\"You finished my book, and now I am taking a big old poop. That is what you get for getting to the end. Aren't I funny!\\"Rushdie has a fatwa out on him for writing \\"Satanic Verses\\". Why doesn't anyone want him dead over this book?"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is as close to perfect as you can get.Worth noting, the Mistry book, A Fine Balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book. If you want the original, read Rushdie. Mistry should be ashamed. His is not even a different take, it is just another take of the same image and not as good."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a fantasy voyage into the world (and underworld) of modern Indian life. Rushdie seems to relish in introducing whimsical characters and side-stories to balance the rather disturbing elements of Indian(/Pakistani) society.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find Midnight's Children to be a masterpiece. It often becomes a tedious read as Rushdie seems to elaborate on his characters into needless detail. And the fantastical elements of the story are, well, a bit over the top. Having said this, this book is a must read for people who are fascinated with modern India (..such as myself).While comparing novels is a dangerous (and unfair) game, I have to recommend Son of a Circus by John Irving over Midnight's Children. Both share the same overall theme (story on modern India without taking itself too seriously), with Irving's novel being a much better read (funnier, less fussy on details, generally easier to read)."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is certainly an interesting read, and I admire Rushdie's attempt at writing a very different type of novel. I will spare you the novel synopsis, as others have probably gone to great lengths to recap the story. Keep in mind, that the story does flip back and forth in the memories of the writer (which is different from Rusdie).I didn't particularly like the Satanic Verses and I read this novel for a class on Expatriate Literature. As Expatriate Literature goes, this was a great exploration of the theme.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I was expecting much from this book not having read Rusdie before. I have came away slightly dissapointed. The first few chapters lived up to my expectations with excellent word play and metaphors but overall I found the style this book is written in detracted from the novel. I also found the book too fantastical. I am a hug fan of God of small things so I did not expect the different style to bother me but unfortunately it did. THis is still a good book though &amp; due to the previous reviews there is a good chance that I am missing something ! Perhaps a second chance wouldn't go amiss."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"There's a good 200-250 page novel in here; the question is whether or not you're willing to slog through nearly 600 pages to find it. The biggest problem I had with this book is that Rushdie apparently thinks his reader is an absolute idiot who must be led by the hand across even the most obvious metaphorical thresholds. It speaks volumes, I think, that the reader surrogate here is the lumpen, dim-witted Padma, seated fawningly at the narrator's feet while he writes. Yes, I know we shouldn't conflate the author and the narrator, but it's hard not to think that Rushdie shares more than a little of Saleem's condescension toward his reader. At least Rushdie has the courtesy to warn you on the first page -- \\"Oh, spell it out, spell it out.\\" That he does. It's an interesting story, but the tedium of the overbearing narrator just sunk it for me."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The ideas behind this novel are very creative and promising however the actual story drags more than once. The last third of the book is slow and boring then rushed at the very end as if Rushdie lost interest himself. I was enraptured for the first half and yawning for the second. I'll pass on seconds."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Discount the 3 stars, because what I really mean is 3.5 stars. Althought not the great work of literature that many believe it to be, it is still a good book that is well worth reading. It has a compelling narrative and Rushdie is talented storyteller. The story is what is really worth getting into here, but the main problem is with its style, and that is what makes it not great literature. Quite frankly, Rushdie just doesn't seem as talented at getting his story into written form as he is at having the story itself. Rushdie seems to be trying to do for India what Marquez did so well for Colombia with \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" but heproves hampered by numerous stylistic mistkaes. The most glaring and overarching problem with this book is how Rushdie tries to incorporate magical realism. \\"Midnight's Children\\" attempts to utilize magical realism in a looser, less fable-like tone than that used by Marquez. While noble in intention, the style that Rushdie uses simply proves to not be as conducive to this type of story-telling as the folkloric style of Marquez and various others. My other problems with the prose are most likely personal preferences, but there are many gimmicks that are used that I found to fall flat or to kill narrative tension (especially how the majority of the events are told many times before they happen so that by the time the book ends, I felt like I had read an additional 100 page epilogue summarizing what I'd read before). All of this can be tied the fact that prose seemed unduly messy. Not in a get-inside-the-narrating-character's-style messy, but a messy that cries out for a better editor. However, these complaints are easily overshadowed by the greatness of the story itself and in the compelling characters, as well as Rushdie's skill in weaving the story into the greater story of the book, that of Postcolonial India. Looking back over this, I think that three stars might be a tad too harsh, but I feel that the complaints about the prose and its inflated status as in the last twenty-four years warrant it as a warning of sorts. However, don't let the rating drive you away from the book, but also don't fall into the trap of overvaluing this \\"Booker of the Bookers\\" (as it was awarded) and take the book for what it is: a good story wrapped in poor wrapping."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"It is to be understood that Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' stands free and clear from national associations, in the way that Hemingway's 'The Sun Also Rises' stands free and clear, and in the same way that Dickens's 'Great Expectations' stands free and clear from such associations. If anything, we should judge them from national, cultural perspectives only sparingly. Such works belong to a rare group which simply defeat cultural bounds.Whether the reader is an Indian, Pakistani, Englishman, American, or otherwise, the novel stands upon its own merit. What Rushdie achieves is stupendous. The language is fascinatingly brilliant, and sparkles at every turn. So, too, is the genius of his plotting; the story is always fresh, never unexpected, despite its basis in historical fact. The Indian who dismisses its plot for its political implications is sorrowfully missing the heart of the book; the Englishman who judges the book on the basis of its faithfulness to real events and actual situations certainly misses the full impact of the novel.What Rushdie does is a re-creation of the novel form; he takes the novel, rooted in English tradition, and re-forms it in the half-light of Indian history. If we are able to judge Rushdie and &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; as literature, and not as political-cultural testimony, we can truly appreciate its achievement. It is one of the greatest novels written in a long, long time.The Booker Prize, whether it be enough to justify the novel or not, is almost an adequate judgement of the book. Fifty years from now, when students of Indian history and politics look back on the late 1900s, they might not think much of &quot;Midnight's Children.&quot; Fifty years from now, when students of literature look back on the late 1900s, they will inevitably think of Salman Rushdie and the achievement of &quot;Midnight's Children.&quot;"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The book is too extravagant. The word play is often totally baseless (such as dung-lotus for Padma), although Western readers may not be knowledgable enough about the background to know that, and the racy plot has scenes like in a cartoon book. Very clever but certainly not literature that will stand the test of time. Rushdie's \`Satanic Verses' is a much better novel."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The hype surrounding Salman Rushdie's death sentence has overshadowed the fact that he is an incredibly talented writer. This novel drips with brilliance. The parallels between the main character and Indian history are so well developed and clever that it is almost impossible not to grin with its genuis. Rusdie's colorful and dramtic descriptions of people, places and events can sent chills through the reader. His witty, philosophical and politcal characters are some of the most original in modern literature. Enough wonderful things cannot be said about this truly incredible work! It's a must read for anyone interested in modern literature."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I bought this book based on its reputation and, relatedly, on the &quot;Best Book in 25 Years&quot; label on the cover. I started reading with high expectations. I was reasonably impressed, true, but I was skeptical that the label on the book went too far. Then, around page 200, the book went from good to spectacular. Rushdie builds up to his payoffs, with a (foretold) surprise every fifty pages. The book can be appreciated either by reading every word slowly, savoring each one, or by tearing through it to see what happens next. Rare is the book that is not only moving and thought-provoking, but also fun. Believe the hype."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of the finest novels in the past fifty years. Rushdie perform every kind of literary stunt to tell the story of modern India, a nation whose life is eerily paralleled, influenced, and mythologized by the narrator. It took me twenty months to read this book. I would begin, read about half of the book, then put it down. Next month I would start all over, enjoying the prose far too much simply to pick up where I left off. There is an extraordinarily dense minimalism about the piece, as it leaves you with the feeling that the whole story would fill twenty times as many pages, and that the narrator is only briefly sketching the highlights. There are a thousand and one reasons to read this, and at least half of them are good."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a long and sometimes arduous exercise in fantastical realism, a would-be folk tale about the history of India since its independence from Britain. The narrator's birth occurs at the exact moment of national independence, and from then on his life is something of an anthropomorphic mirror of the development of his nation.This book is neither a fictional autobiography nor a literary history of modern India. Well, actually it's both, but really it's about the dangers of being ancient in a modern world, and the pitfalls of trying to bring tradition into a rational, contemporary framework.Rushdie is one of the most eloquent writers of his generation, and inherits from Nabakov the role of linguistic perfectionist - every sentence is rolled up in allegory, wordplay, and, most importantly, meaningfullness."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a great book. I think Rushdie&#65533;s main charm lies in the way he has mixed all the political events of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh effectively in the story; more so for the fact, almost all the events are at wrong times in history and yet its difficult to notice it!! Language has always been Rushdie&#65533;s forte. I cannot think of any other writer who can convey a 4-pageful of facts in 4 lines. On a lighter vein, this book could be a good GRE supplement for verbal section! The humour and sarcasm too are very well written and placed in the book.This book rightly deserved the booker for the best book, and even more rightly deserved the booker of bookers i.e the best book in 25 years. Ya, its that GOOD!! and its a must-read for a book-lover. Another book I liked very much is Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I bought the book some 4 years ago but left it in the book shelf until now: and why didn't I read it earlier! Being from the asian continent myself (with particular interest in the history and culture both of India and Pakistan) I found little difficulty in relating to the novel; its rich word play, bollywood like plots, surprises and twists,urging one to blaze &quot;FULL-TILT&quot; through the pages.Rushdie's style was inimitable and witty, demonstrating a razor sharp mind yet one that ozzes (in liberal degree) compassion and warm humanity. A robust view on life with all its &quot;snakes and ladders&quot; along the way, with each of us the unconscious player."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"this book is just gorgeous, it's magical and warm and hilarious and so sad as well. I adore Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and I would recommend this book to anyone who fell in love with One Hundred Years of Solitude, as this caputures the same spirit, style and humour. Well done Mr Rushdie - superb !!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is a brilliantly written narrative that combines history and fiction impeccably and in a fashion that is without precedent. The author explains the historical context of his novel with exceptinal clarity, and Rushdie's frustration with his beloved India is evident throughout the story. Moreover, Rushdie's writing in &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is wildly creative, and the text is filled with the powerful musings of an enormous literary talent. Salman Rushdie has penned an extraordinary hybrid of reality and imagination that is sure to amuse and impress the serious reader."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first Rushdie book I have read and it was unlike any other reading experience I have ever had. From the beginning, the prose leaps out from the page and smacks you silly until you think this book is more than just a book. Sentences and wordplay that you have to reread and think &quot;WOW&quot;.Every character is interesting and the plot never lets up. It might be beneficial to have some knowledge of Indian custom and language, but I don't think not having any would ruin the read.I love Naipaul for his economic style and realism and I love this book for the opposite reasons: its sheer wildness and fantasy.Absolute magic."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This magical, lyrical book will captivate you from the start. The language, the images and the prose are simply breathless. Though it takes about 150 pages to get into, the investment is worthwhile. I'll read this book in ten years time: again!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Under a less skilled pen, this book would be a chaotic,jumbled, unreadable mess, with so many characters and subplots floating in and out. However, I am happy to report it works! It does have a consistent theme, mostly about one character's life, the \\"leader\\" of midnight's children, set against the backdrop of one of the most dramatic political real life dramas of the last hundred years. While this story also borders on \\"magical realism\\" at points, it never wanders so far off the map that you get lost, but you will have to pay attention.A classic!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"If I wasn't completely convinced before that Salman Rushdie has a claim to be the most gifted writer on the planet, I am after reading this book.This novel is a generational saga along the lines of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" and Jeffrey Eugenides's \\"Middlesex\\". As those two novels reflect the history of their own respective nations, so does \\"Midnight's Children.\\" It is the story of one family, and one person in particular, Saleem, who is born on the stroke of midnight on the exact day and time India achieved its independence from Britain. From that propitious birth onward, Saleem's life becomes a reflection and representation of the young Indian nation itself.The title refers to the 400 odd children who were born at or near this same midnight. Each one of them have magical skills which vary in strength and importance in direct relation to their birth's proximity to midnight. Since Saleem was born exactly at midnight, he has the most valuable skill, the skill to look into people's hearts, minds, and souls, and to commune with the other midnight children mentally. In this vein, he forms the Midnight Children's Conference, a meeting of these 400+ children who communicate through Saleem's telepathic mind and have the stated goal of reforming India. If this sounds unbelievable, it is not. It is the same sort of magical realism fans of Latin American authors will be familiar with, and adds to the strength, beauty, and ultimate brutality of the story without making the reader roll his eyes in incredulity.As is India, so is Saleem. He hears the multitudinous voices of India in his head, a mess of contradictions: peace and violence, forgiveness and revenge, progress and tradition. His family also reflects the indefinable character of India. They are by turns real and fantastical, living and dying, perservering and escaping. The amalgam of these voices and Saleem's family is an India that Rushdie seems to understand no better than anyone else, but his affection for and frustration with India could only come from a native.The reader also follows Saleem's physical life. His face mirrors a map of India, and his enormous nose is gifted at sensing emotions. From the life of a rich boy in Bombay, to a fighter in the India-Pakistan War, to a broken carnival traveller, and finally to an owner of a pickle company, Saleem's journey through life is expansive, human, and always entertaining. The side characters are just as engrossing, and all have a part to play in the tumolt of Indian history.To keep the earlier analogy going, I found this to be a slightly more difficult read than \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" but just as entertaining as \\"Middlesex\\". Rushdie writes with wit, style, anger, and absolute brilliance. He is generous with allusions, but I felt they were also extremely accessible. I recommend this book not only to India-philes, but also to fans of literature in general. This is a master in peak and rare form, and this is one of the finest novels written in a generation. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"When I first picked this book up, I really didn't like it. Who writes a novel where there narrator doesn't even get born until page 131? And I found the narrator's style of constantly dropping hints and alluding to what would come later to be irritating and distracting.It wasn't until I finished the first book (of 3), on page 137 or so, that I realized how brilliant the book is. From then on, it wasn't just about plot or style: I found myself hanging on every word the author said, over-analyzing everything (especially colors; blue is for god, red for communists and true feelings, green is for nostalgia) and wishing I had an annotated copy, since I didn't feel capable of keeping up with Rushdie's sprinting mind and style.It got to the point where after every chapter, I had to put the book down and take a deep breath. Every chapter feels laden and interlaced with symbolism that melds with rather than rises above (or sinks below) the plot.Rushdie's style is infectious. I found it obnoxious at first, but his mixing of standard English with Indian-referenced Hindi-tinted 'Babu English' to be completely endearing and fantastically comical. (\\"There was hankying and pankying? In the basement?? Without even chaperones?!\\")And the use of realistic fantasy-- describing unlikely actions in such a way that they seem plausible, with the narrator all the time apologizing for what seems unlikely, and informing you to believe it if you like-- pushes the story forward and makes it gripping. (\\"Purushottam the Saddhu grew tired of his sedentary lifestyle and developed the suicidal hiccups, which assailed him for an entire year, sometimes lifting him bodily off the ground two or three inches and causing his head to crack alarmingly against the garden tap; eventually he died and collapsed to one side, his legs still locked in the lotus position, and leaving my mother's verrucas without any hope of salvation.\\")And as a person who knew nothing about India or Pakistan and was never particularly interested in either, the book was a fantastic introduction to the extremely interesting events following India's independence.Overall, I can't think of a book I'd recommend more highly. It's definitely within my top 5 books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Ok I've re-read this book eight times, since the age of fourteen. I think that's why it took me till the sixth time to realize the book was about India, from Independence upto the 1970s. 'Midnight's Children' refers to that generations of Indians which lived right after independence, i.e. 1947. So-called because it was at midnight, 15th August 1947 that India(and Pakistan + the about-to-be Bangladesh) were born out of British India. It tells the story of Saleem Sinai who was born on Midnight, Independence day, and whose life is tied to that of his country's. Along with Saleem, another son was born almost at the same time: Shiva. These two represent the two different sides of India that are so familiar: Saleem represented the affluent, British-educated cosmopolitan and tolerant India. Shiva, represented the hungry-starving dog-eat-dog India, and how those two grew up together, separated, yet tied together. Plus all the hopes and dreams which were associated with the formation of this new India, the &quot;tryst with Destiny&quot; e.t.c. With the actual history of India as the backdrop. Saleem was one of many 'Midnight's Children', another name for India's democracy, and parliament. The book basically shows what the two estranged siblings - India and Pakistan/Bangladesh or Saleem/Shiva go thru from Independence onwards i.e. the two big Indo-Pak wars, the Pak military coups, how Indira Gandhi neutered them (she declared a National Emergency, martial Law, and institued disabling Socialist policies, the effect of which are still being felt). The book is written very well, but some of the Indian references will go over non-Indian readers' heads. Also, the state of India as Rushdie describes it is correct for the late 70s and early 80s, and has no bearing on the India of the 90s onwards. I think it's time to write a novel on Midnight's Grand-children, to the see the striking changes they are making on their nation. This book is only for people who have a significant interest in India. Not for the casual reader, and not a book to read for anybody who wants the most up-to-date story on India. Unfortunately there isn't a novel on that as of now."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Imagine...... a story that has existed from the beginning, has a life of its own, has its own destiny. Even then, cast a credulous cynicism that its author had only been a poor puppet, and who could impossibly be a writer of a book that is like a dream or an ineffable fable. I had imagined Midnight's Children this way and with Salman Rushdie drudging on this writing - it is quite sacrilegious to think , but pardon me, because indeed &quot;to understand just one life, I cant easily swallow the world&quot;. No, not this one so effortlessly because the reality/history that Rushdie had created is full of flamboyant Indianess, paradox, anachronism, fibs, magic, metaphor, humor, bawdy language, and imagination that are orchestrated in such a lavish way. Rushdie who has proven himself to be a master had so far successfully transmogrified himself to be invisible as the writer (at least for me).Most of the moments that I had spent with this novel were teeming with unsatisfaction with what I really seemed to comprehend, and while I was hovering above an &quot;illusion of understanding&quot;, the story is unheeding and unstoppable in its power to surprise me one instant, then to taunt me at another time and often really makes me laugh in its ludicrous lucidity.In the story, imagine a certain Saleem Sinai living with his life as a microcosm of the history of India. With his birth heralded by prime ministers and prophesied by wizards, and his life to be made as a template for a new beginning of an emerging nation, his life has become a fulcrum of contemplation of why what who how of a nation and its people. Saleems's life is told as a fictional autobiography with its armory of leitmotifs such as perforated sheets, silver spittoons, noses and knees, and pointing fingers. The outrageous and often fecund foreshadowing of paradoxes gyrate around the story's inevitabilities so that the whole work still maintains its serious appeal. A reader has to think beyond Saleem's life, or so to speak, has to go beyond being just kicked out of the story in order to appreciate this work or else this outrageous fiction would just amount to any ordinary melodramatic tale. Any one might be impressed about how the life-story of Saleem is being narrated in front of an ever solicitous Padma- a character-audience who goads and pulls the writery-leash that Saleem inextricably pinioned on himself and who inevitably flavors the story by her moods, and unknowingly also instills suspense and gaping interest to the story. So that what lies between fiction and history? Further, I see a lot of its parallelism to other novels such as 100 Years of Solitude, but its similarity is being put in an elegant copy. I would mostly hail this book among the other of Rushdie's works which I deem too ambitious to be true.And what about this chutnification of history? I really like this idea, and it reminds me of the &quot;gedanken&quot; or thought experiments that scientists use to explain a phenomenon that cant be proven by experiment, and yet can always be arrayed as truth. Midnight's Children's peculiar way of &quot;pickling&quot; events and then adding certain flavors and spices of perspectives had just given me a chance to meet Indian history (not from a textbook, at least) but in a quite sophisticated way."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Reading Midnight's Children is not an easy task. The rich language and elaborate descriptions take hours to ply through and days to appreciate. Your time will, however, be very well spent. Salman Rushdie's classic recently was awarded the &quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; and the award was clearly deserved. Admittedly, the book will probably appeal more to South Asians who will recall their own childhoods when they read phrases such as &quot;cho chweet&quot;, but even for someone from another part of the globe, the novel is a worthwhile piece. Take your time and enjoy as Salman Rushdie takes you through the joys and troubles of Saleem Sinai and the rest of Midnight's Children..."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is an amazing book - I had thought, when I started, that it may have been a very heady, difficult to read book (as so many Booker Prize winners are), but I found it very easy to read, despite Rushdie's very interesting style. He has a very unpretentious voice, almost young sounding, but Saleem is an ancient soul. He communicates well to those less ancient then himself.It's absolutely crammed with little things to recommend it. I honestly can't fit them into a review. The amount of detail, the little stories all weaving themselves into each other, the colourful characters and events, the meticulous planning Rushdie has obviously done before writing - there is so much foreshadowing, it keeps you turning pages furiously! - and the overall impact of the book is amazing.I can't recommend this enough. Read it!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Throughout Rushdie's novel the plot is complex and the character's conflicts rapidly producing. Rushdie displays an amazing talent for writing in this way. The numerous subplots told by Saleem Sinai, the narrator, form an overall character that is relatable with the reader. At times it even seems as if the narrator is speaking directly to the reader by describing his own life and mistakes as simply as if in a one on one conversation. It takes a true master to write this way without producing the impression that the narrator is pointing a finger in the readers face, accusingly or all-knowingly. Rushdie's style of writing is what, personally, kept me reading. Although the beginning of the book more of resembles a family tree and history book, the information is needed in the long run. After reading through \\"Book One\\" of Rushdie's novel, the book became immensely more interesting. The plot thickened. Tragedy started to befall the world once filled with magical realism. The wonderful Midnight Child blessing of powers is shown in a new light. The reader in \\"Book Two\\" and \\"Book Three\\" starts to feel the pressure that Saleem feels, as well as even some of the pain. (If the reader decides to commit to the book completely.) All in all, I loved the book. The writing style was fantastic, the characters were relatable, and the plot was complex enough to challenge my own skills. Yes, the book is difficult, but the effort put into reading it is worth every page. However, for any future readers I have some advice: 1) Keep a family tree of the character's relations to each other during \\"Book One\\". The tree would help when Saleem makes allusions to his past to explain a certain point or his own personal reaction to an event. 2) Brush up on the Indian Independence and the British-Colonial Rule. Islam and Hinduism knowledge would aid the reader too, but isn't as in demand as the ruling classes and how they stand in the terms of control over their freedom and way of life. Finally--3) Read the book while sitting in a favorite spot. The book's plot is too complex for reading on the bus or a few pages every few days. The reader needs to be totally invested in the book and be willing to put in the time.For all of Rushdie's future readers, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book won the Booker of Bookers, so when I saw it sitting on the shelf, it said, \\"I must be good, take me home!\\" After all, I've adored some other Booker winners.Not this one.Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight, August 15th, 1947, at the same moment that India becomes an independent nation. He knows that he must be special - he even receives a letter from the Prime Minister for such a fortuitious birth time. This book isn't just about him, though, it is about several generations of his family and the history of his country, all of which makes it into a lengthy literary saga.I didn't like Saleem. He drove me crazy with his dodging of topics and endless diversions. I wasn't interested in his relationship with Padma and I got completely fed up with his self-important attitude. I understand that his condition is reflected by India throughout the novel, but that didn't mean I enjoyed reading about it just because it had literary value. His connection with the other midnight children was interesting, but once again his arrogance ruined it. He's an unreliable narrator to an extent, but not in the way that I like, if that makes any sense at all. He's just trying to make himself sound good. Maybe because he is, apparently, not very attractive.India, as a country, was by far the most compelling character throughout the book. I loved reading about the different regions, about Bombay and Delhi, about how rapidly India was changing. I'd certainly recommend this book for insight into the culture and that is easily the best part of it. I wouldn't mind seeing the Kashmir region for myself, now, after reading about it so many times.So, in the end? I think Midnight's Children was too literary for me. I can tell that I'd get more enjoyment out of it if I went through in a class and then had to write a paper on it to pick it apart. As I was going through, I actually picked out paper topics that would illuminate the subject matter better. I'm not quite crazy enough to go out and write a paper just now, though. If I ever have fewer TBRs waiting for me, I might pick it up again and see if I can catch some of the threads that I missed this time, but I don't anticipate that happening for a long time."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children has tried to shake the foundations of some power structures , which is the main aim of any postmodern work. Rushdie has mixed fantasy with facts in right proportion to picturise Post-Independent India. Children born during the night of Indian independence are called \\"Midnight's Children.\\" They suffer from all the ailments of Independent India. They are made unproductive like the country. Declaration of Emergency by Indira Gandhi is compared to the labour pangs of Parvati, a witch. All the important historical events like The Jalianwala Bagh Massacre, Bangladesh War, and The Emergency are mixed with magical elements like Aziz's itching nose saving him from the bullets of English soldiers on the Jallianwala Bagh ground. Rushdie aptly uses terms like 'chutnification of history' and 'pickles of history' to explain his treatment of history. There is 'discontinuity' in narration. But we see 'permutation' in places where Saleem brings all the women of his life in an order to explain Parvati, the witch, about his marriage. Saleem lives a 'fragmented' life. He is split into 'fragments' by his grandfather's rationality, grandmother's credulity, father's numbness, mother's fragmented life, and sister's lovelessness. He has no constant identity. He gets lost in a jostling crowd of 'I's. Rushdie mixes all genres. He includes film trailors, gossips, advertisements, posters, and third rate similes, and jokes to break the distinction between high and low literature. This is called 'hybridity.' Rushdie seems to give his own comments through Saleem. Salman merges into Saleem in some places, and it is clear in the text. This is called 'short circuit'. Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' shares many of the post modern techniques, and can be called a novel with post- modern features."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Giving away the ending of a book or movie is considered an unforgivable social sin in some quarters, so what the heck are we to do about an author who commits it against his own work?There's always that risk of self-exposure in any memoir, real or fictional, but the example of Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" is particularly egregious. The narrator, Saleem Sinai, in some very cleverly-turned phrases, immediately puts us on notice that he was born at the exact moment that India gained its independence from Britain and that as he writes this memoir he expects to die at any time. That in itself is enough to make you sit up and beg for more; a profoundly significant nativity, coupled with the urgency of impending doom? What could possibly happen next?Well, I'll tell you what happens next; Saleem Sinai informs us that the powers which devolved upon him due to the time of his birth had no impact whatsoever on anyone, and he confidently expects that his death will be no more notable. In other words, this is the story of a man who might as well never have lived at all. God knows what kept me reading after that.Okay, it was Rushdie's undeniable gift of words that kept me reading after that, but the whole book is the same game; Saleem Sinai, in the middle of his narrative, drops a dark hint or two about future events like hidden murder suspects, devastating fire and bomb attacks, wives and sons who aren't truly wives and sons, fascinatingly various magical powers leading to vicious magical wars, and some cruel and dangerous figure called the Widow. Eventually, all of these oracular utterances come true, you find out what really happened, and because the narrative has built them up to such a pitch the events themselves seem trite and you're left wondering what all the fuss was about.In a way, Rushdie got himself into a real bind here. If he'd told the story of Saleem Sinai, all the magical ties surrounding his life, his and India's parallel courses, \\"Midnight's Children\\" would have been a much better story, but he would have lost the chance to weave the opulence of his prose and that would have been a serious loss. On the other hand, by giving his language all this room to stretch and bend into all these mystical hints about what's to come, he robs his plot of its power when the events he's foreshadowed come to pass. Like the old saying goes, it's always something.Unfortunately, my sympathy for Rushdie in his literary difficulties does not extend to excusing his book for its flaws. If he couldn't find a way to balance the beauty of his language, the weight of his themes and the power of his story, that's his problem, frankly. It doesn't change the fact that he shot himself in the foot. (I know, there are a lot of bloodthirsty hooligans and brain-dead sheep out there who'd like to shoot him in a more damaging spot because some group of thin-skinned busybodies told them to, but you know what I mean.) For all his ambition, admirable as it is, the fact remains that with \\"Midnight's Children\\" Rushdie messed up a perfectly good story by calling too much attention to himself.These \\"slice of life\\" sorts of books - the type that go from miscellaneous Point A to random Point B rather than from beginning to end - have their advantages at times. They are certainly more prevalent now than in ages past; they're probably easier to write, and authors can throw into these books anything they like without regard for how well those details fit the story, since there is no story as such. However, as with most modern practices that disregard old traditions, the practitioners of \\"slice of life\\" stories have to be careful; the abandonment of the old rules does not mean that there are no rules, it just means that the new rules have not been discovered yet. Even players of modern free jazz can make mistakes. Salman Rushdie has uncovered one of those new rules for us, to wit, if you wish to trade the beginning-middle-end structure for the simple joy of the journey, do not - I repeat, do not - begin by telling us how the journey ends!In short, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is one of those books where you can get more pleasure by turning to a random page and basking in the warmth of the author's narrative skill than you can get by reading the whole thing from beginning to end. And that, my friends, is why lending libraries are sometimes more useful than bookstores.Benshlomo says, A journey of a thousand miles may begin with a single step, but that single step had better not be the last one."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":".... This book is no doubt good, and possibly great. However, for me, it doesn't reach truly elevated sublime \\"best book in 25 years\\" or top ten list status. With that said it's a worthwhile read for a phantasmorgorical look at India and Pakistan history and the plight of the countries. The 1,001 Midnight's Children carry around supernatural gifts, some pretty powerful, some not so spectacular. The protagonist Saleem Sinai, just happens to have a super-dooper nose and can converse with all the midnight's children in his head. His archenemy, Shiva, he of the gargantuan knees spoils Saleem's leadership of the Midnight's Children .... It's a cautionary tale of what could have been and deeper underlying, Rushdie weeps for his country of India and what could have been. The most unique convention of the novel is that Saleem's life parallels the development of India. It's a rather ambitious task that Rushdie sets out to do to capture India's development within a fictional life. The writing is well-versed, intelligent, and compelling. There is a good command of language, not quite as elevated as that of Nabokov, but good nonetheless. It reminded me a great deal of Gunter Grass' Tin Drum in the aspect of a fanciful characters reflecting a Country's development, so may lose some originality points for that. All in all though, an enjoyable read, but not one that I want to go back and read anytime soon, which is the true test of literary greatness for me. I would read Catch-22, the Underworld, and Crime and Punishment again and again. For Midnight's Children, once was enough."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"... I think I may just be turned off by the way he writes. I only made it through the first half of this book before I was completely confused and turned around and frustrated. I felt exactly the same way for his \\"Satanic Verses\\"... only got about half way through that one, too. I am very well versed in Islamic culture and religion, but I know next to nothing of Indian culture, so I was very confused by his profusion of culturally-rich references and descriptions of Indian mindset and history.I am only giving it two stars because he does have a very lyrical and descriptive writing style; I saw another writer compare it to Nabakov's style of writing, and that seems pretty apt. Very colorful, very imaginitive, very pleasing to the mind's eye.However, all the prosaic narration in the world will not help you understand a complex, stuttering, warped, fiercely non-chronological tale. I think it's safe to say that if you have read one Rushdie novel and you like it, you'll like them all. If, on the other hand, you find one novel to be scream-inducing, it's probably best to avoid the rest of them."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Difficult for someone who doesn't even get the symbolism of black and green. I looked up the colors of the flag and they are red and green (Paksitan is white and green). So don't expect much from me.Set in India during the independence movement and told by a Muslim. Won the Booker Prize for Best Book in 25 Years. Concept is that the guy (and others) born at exactly midnight on the day of independence have some special powers. The author is able to read peoples' thoughts and to communicate with the other 1000 children born at midnight. It is fantasy told in context as historical novel.This novel is difficult to read and therefore not for the average reader; the style is Faukneresque in grammar and punctuation, virtually every sentence is filled with metaphore and symbolism. If the reader had a good knowledge of India-Pakistan history, the story would be more interesting as there is a good deal of hidden (or not so hidden) political analysis. These are the reasons I didn't rate the novel higher so probably a little unfair.Here is an example (ok, this is an extreme example):Hint: The Widow is Indira Ghandi; Monkey is the sisterFrom the chapter \\"At the Pioneer Caf&eacute;\\" --No colours except green and black the walls are green the sky is black (there is no roof) the stars are green the Widow is green abut her hair is black as black.

Whether this is a reflection of the author in general or this book in particular I cannot say (for admittedly, this is the only book by Rushdie I have read to-date), but this book smacks of Grass' The Tin Drum in more than mere coincidental measures. While I am not the first to make this comparison between these two authors; I found the similarities between Midnight's Children and The Tin Drum to walk a dubious line (perhaps out of my own ignorance). The resemblances don't end in style alone but spill over into the story and the characters as well. There are even parts of the book (particularly some of the more poetic passages) which seemed to be &quot;lifted&quot; from the Tin Drum and reworked for Midnight's Children. Suffice it to say that I am not accusing Rushdie of plagiarism here, only suggesting, perhaps, an overlty ardent fawning over the great Mr. Grass. Likewise, I am not proposing that this is not a good book in it's own right or that it should not be read. It is and it should. I am merely recommending for those interested in reading this book (or the author) to read The Tin Drum first so that it may lend new perspective to Midnight's Children. These two works do make for an interesting comparison. Again a very good book, well-written, and definately worth the read, but for this reader it pales in comparison to its predecessor."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Reading \\"Midnight's Children\\", much like Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is in a way like reading a dream. The people and places are surreal and distorted, yet familiar at the same time. In a lot of ways, its similar to the distorted vision from which we view the world as children, where everything seems larger than life and more important than it really is. I've read articles where Marquez and Rushdie's writing styles have been favorably compared before and if you've read one, the similarities will become immediately apparent upon reading the other. Rushdie has done a fantastic job of telling a story with a political message that doesn't really feel like a political message because it was so masterfully told. Like most good books, this is one you find yourself remembering for a while."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book has been written by an extraordinary being, whose linguistic arsenal of celestial creativity manifested through impeccable writing skills... have founded my No. 1 author; with Midnight's Children being my personal favourite.Rushdie's magnificent narrative style coupled with a richly-textured storyline all added up to the substance of this best seller; which is beyond my humble words to describe.One of the best fictions that I have read so far. Sheer brilliance!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Salman Rushdie books, and it plays wonderfully on audio (esp. during long car commutes)!

Highly Recommended A++++++++++"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; has been honoured by book critics as the &quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; and no wonder ! It's one of the most original, brilliant and stunning novels I have read in years. How apt too that Rushdie's technique or genre of writing should be described as &quot;magical realism&quot;, for MC dresses the telling of post-war Indian history with so much fun, humour and imagination from references drawn from such a deep ancient well, your senses reel from the rush and cultural overload. Granted, Rushdie's method with language doesn't make for easy or casual reading. Words meticulously chosen, assembled and invested with meaning tumble helter skelter onto the pages in dazzling and colourful rapid fire prose - &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style - you really need to concentrate to understand and savour its riches. Its huge cast of characters evoke the sense of a grand pantheon of gods overlooking the lives of its divided people. Not surprisingly, these same gods (or God) - depending on whether you're Hindu or Muslim - connive to coincide births, deaths and marriages and the mercurial fate of these &quot;midnight's children&quot; who come from disparate social and religious backgrounds with the making of history. The use of the &quot;switched-at-birth good Saleem/bad Shiva&quot; as a central motif in the novel is also a masterful stroke conveying both irony and plurality that characterises India. &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is one of those important novels that just has to be read by everyone who loves serious fiction. I'd be willing to bet that it'll get on the reading list of every literature student, if it hasn't already done so. A rare and genuine masterpiece. Make time to read it. You will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I love Salman Rushdie, so any review I may write will be biased simply because I value everything Salman has to say. I love his bitting sense of humour particularly when looking at despondent issues such as poverty, I love his vivid descriptions and his almost obsessive love of small details, when describing even the most inconsquencal of his characters. But what I love most is the gross ironies he presents in his novels. Midnight's Children is no exception to Rushdie's favourite fable method, and if full of hilariously detailed paradoxes. The idea of swapped births, rich to poor and poor to rich, but still ending up in the manner which they were born, to me, is ingenius. While I did not enjoy this one quite as much as Satanic Verses, I believe Salman's writing is something you begin to appericate after you give his novel's considerable thought. They are somewhat hard to digest at the beginning, but once thought over; the links, the hidden messages and abundent symbols make it all much clearer why Salman has earned the praise he recieves. A busy, beautiful and saddening novel, andd one which I will remember forever."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a truly luscious book to be savored slowly.

To my infinite surprise I discovered one of the true masterpieces of 20th century literature. My only complaint is that the latter half of the book does not seem to follow the impressive lyrical precedent of the first 300 pages - but this is to be expected as the beauty of the writing is unparallelled."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"After reading a different Rushdie book I jumped at the chance to read Midnight's Children for my high school AP English class. The details and imagination are outstanding. The book is over flowing with not only drama, but humor as well. As for all of the word plays and puns made in the book and interview with Rushdie revealied that he used them merely to make a family type language and individual habits of speaking. They were not intended to anger the readers.

This book has so many things to recommend it. It is a fabulous story first of all but also set against the backdrop of Indian culture and politics. I found it fascinating, engaging and informative.It is certainly one of the best books I have ever read and I would highly recommend it. I preferred it to Grimus - his first novel"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem Sinai, the narrator, was born when the clock struck twelve on the day when India became free of Britain at last (1947). Through some strange effect of physics, each of the children born at that time has something wrong with him-or right, some special spooky power they cannot figure out. Some have extra special sensitivity, others super strength. Some of the superpowers are funny, some quite poignant. Like the X Men, Midnight's Children are (mostly) ashamed of their special gifts; and this becomes a metaphor for the admixture of Hindu and Muslim that made up India until the partition a year or so later and the birth of Pakistan. And still the races and religions cavort in an eternal spectacle of high and low. Saleem's own power is the ability to experience smells with more punch than ordinary citizens, and you can imagine in the pungent provinces of India he visits this is as much a curse as a blessing.The two babies, switched at birth, become each other's opposite number. A Hindu boy, raised as a Muslim; a Muslim, raised Hindu. As Shakespeare said, in ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL: \\"For I the ballad will repeat/ Which men full true shall find:/ Your marriage comes by destiny,/ Your cuckoo sings by kind.\\" As the servant Padma listens to this modern Scheherezade, the relations of master and servant also dissolve from within, a dark allegory of the postcolonial nexus of modern writing. Rushdie seems to be hinting that we're none of us where we're meant to be, and that at this late date there's not much we can do but lump it.After 25 years MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN continues to sell happy numbers of copies for its author, the controversial and limelight-dwelling Salman Rushdie. He lives comfortably off the many editions his masterpiece has gone through. Every now and then you hear an imaginative screenwriter announce that he's \\"conquered\\" MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but in truth the pleasure of the book is very much in its intratextual details, and I can't imagine a successful movie version, though I said the same about MYSTERIOUS SKIN and look how wrong I was there."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book should have been a favorite of mine, as it combines the overall concept of a small, misunderstood group of people with extraspecial powers (a la X-Men in the comics) with the style of Latin American magic realists (a la Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marques) and the literary theme of trying to make one thing match another (in this case, the life of Saleem Sinai with the history of India itself). But I found it much too slow, repetitive, and obtuse. Perhaps I needed an annotated version, so that I could appreciate it more?This is indeed very disappointing to me, as I think Rushdie's style of mixing the highbrow literary art with pop culture references and scatalogical content a refreshing change. I like it a lot more than literary pretension like that of New Yorker darlings Matt Klam. The problem really came down to the way that the style came together in that, while I found the story and the theme elements fascinating, I thought the sentences way too bloated, where entire sentences and paragraphs could easily have been cut. This is not to mention the repitition of earlier events in an underscore of the themes, that might have been useful if you were the type of reader who couldn't connect the dots the first time the lines were drawn.I also found the conceit of the narrator storyteller, and his impotence, to be a little too precious. Rushdie was walking the fine line of metastory and I felt he slipped off it way too much into a self-conscious parody of literary (...)I know I'm going to be in the minority on this one, for not only has Midnight's Children already won major awards, it's been virtually canonized by the Booker people as the best of the Bookers. Oh, well. I'll chalk yet another one up to the vagaries of taste. It's not that I don't think Rushdie can't write, but that his writing just doesn't work for me."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did and ended up calling it quits about halfway through. It's not that Rushdie isn't a brilliant writer, but his generation-sweeping narrative felt like a long exercise in allegory and self-referentialness without characters or a plot that I managed to find involving.You'll find that the usual checkmarks of \\"magic realism\\" apply here. The writing has a fanciful storybook quality, as does the plot logic. The author blends real-world history with myth and pseudo-myth. Characters have exaggerated personality and physical traits, and strange ailments, some of which seem to grant them extraordinary powers of telepathy and foresight. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate symbolism and thematic depth, but there was a bit too much literary flash at the expense of characters or a story arc I could relate to. Maybe it's just me -- I was also left cold by Mark Helprin's much-loved Winter's Tale, for similar reasons.Too bad, because Rushdie really can write colorful descriptive passages that sing in audiobook form, combining poetry, satire, Bollywood imagery, and bits of the real world in a rollicking series of well-crafted scenes. But it's also one of those books where the author is constantly and consciously being \\"clever\\", mainly through manipulative foreshadowing and an air of ah-but-you-don't-see-where-I'm-going-with-this. To me, that sort of thing gets annoying, as though Rushdie wants to bait critics into being impressed with his novel through structural trickery (\\"this a novel for *smart* readers -- like us!\\"). I say put on some pants, Emperor.Still, Rushdie is quite brilliant, and for literary adventurers who appreciate dense novels and are perhaps a bit more knowledgeable about India/Pakistan/Kashmir than I am, there's a lot here. Depending on your tastes, it's certainly worth consideration. But, as generation-spanning multicultural novels go, I *liked* Zadie Smith's White Teeth and Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex a lot more."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is possibly the best novel ever written. Some people might take it to be symbolic, I'm not one of those, to me the events are literal (I am originally from a third world country), but I can imagine that people who grew up in the West might think none of the situations in the book to be realistically possible.I never knew how influential to modern literature this book has been (I was too young to be interested when this book was first published). When reading it I was able to make connections to many first rate novels I have read in my lifetime whose author's were beyond a doubt inspired by Rushdie's work, and that is by no means the only reason I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"So, this isn't so much a review of the book as it is a criticism of some of the reviews I have read for this book.

This book is complicated, poetic, and deep, but it is also beautiful, passionate, and inspiring, so if you are one of the people who gave it one star after reading 75 pages, please do us a favor in the future and don't post a review of a book you either don't understand or don't read in its entirety."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children is a complex, intricate political and social commentary on India during the mid 20th century, told from the perspective of young Saleem Sinai.Oh so magical...- I'm a sucker for magical realsim, therefore its constant presence in this text was right up my alley. It's blatant, sometimes wonderful, often grotesque.- Saleem Sinai's family is constructed of a cast of eccentric characters, present primarily in the first two books, provide the reader with adventures, tumultuous relationships, and an in-depth look at why Saleem turns out the way he does.- The concept behind Midnight's Children is fascinating, as is the supernatural bonds that are created amongst its members.- The writing is of course terrific- humorous, descriptive, and brilliant. Whether you think the confidence Rushdie's text exudes is cockiness or talent is up to you to decide.Back to Reality...- This book is long, which is fine, but for me the last \\"book\\" (a little over 100 pages) lost a lot of steam. Saleem's family was mostly out of the picture, and his life as a young adult just didn't captivate me.- I'm not a huge fan of the \\"I'm going to tell you a story about my past\\" structure, which is used.

It's magical, but I wouldn't classify it as a fantasy. Though set in India and certainly an Indian novel, it was written in English and is very approachable to readers of different cultures. It's a long book, and dense, but not especially difficult read.The book follows a character born at the exact moment of India's independence, and traces the rich history of that region along with the narrator's own story (and that of his family.) Written in the first person, the narrator evokes everything from humor to heartbreak. The novel's characters weave a rich tapestry that shows some of the diversity of the region at that time.As an subjective telling of history, the novel unfolds in a circular pattern, accustoming readers to ideas more slowly and also repeating symbolic elements. On the one hand, it worked well, but when it felt repetitive I was reminded of the length and got a bit impatient. Overall, I would recommend this book widely, and consider it the sort of contemporary novel that may stand the test of time. (8.5/10)"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Oh, my goodness.

Saleem Sinai, an Indian Muslim born on the stroke of midnight August 15, 1947, at the instant of India's independence, recounts a mystical, doleful tale of his own birth and trials as they coincided with those of India and Pakistan. All children born at the hour of independence were endowed with extraordinary gifts, the great potential of a new nation. Saleem of elephantine nose and dual parentage sees them all in his paranormally perceptive mind as he is witness to the initial optimism, two Indo-Pakistani wars, and India's oppressive State of Emergency instigated by Prime Minister Indira Ghandi.\\"Midnight's Children\\" is an opinionated, critical tour of modern India's struggles with its own diversity and demons. Its overwhelming pessimism seems out of place now, as India has become one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The book must be viewed in the context of the time at which it was written, the late 1970s. Salman Rushdie has a lot to say, and says most of it more than once. He pulls no punches and makes no excuses for anyone. In spite of Saleem's first-person narration, Rushdie's fractured, repetitive prose style impedes its accessibility and slows the reader down. And I would not have thought it possible to pile so many metaphors on top of metaphors and remain coherent. \\"Midnight's Children\\" is a long, provocative lament but somewhat overworked."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a tome, and for its kaleidescope of impressions, one to be savored. There are some books where after a point, the length is wearying, and the last hundred pages are half read, half skimmed, the right hand fingers feeling the slimming of the pages in anticipation. Not this book.The story is justifiably grand, the partitioning of India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the second world war and the emotional analog in the minds of the two countries' citizens. But what keeps ones interest is not the heavy politics, which for the most part remain the background as in most great historical fiction (Tolstoy notwithstanding).Rather, it is the bridging of individuals and events with achingly tender descriptions that are burned in the reader's mind. Take, for example, two lovers who communicate only with their hands, like moths that hover over a flame--impelled by some force toward the fire, just close enough to stay warm but always in danger of being consumed. The symbolism, like self-immolation, that India is represented to outsiders and in some ways it disingenuously is to itself, that surprises and rewards the reader.You probably won't be able to finish the novel in one sitting, but that is a blessing, in that with each sitting and turn of the page, you are refreshed with the power of language and how the unforgettable images appear vividly in the mind."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first and only Rushdie book that I have read, and I am very glad I picked it. The plot and narrative are large, that's for sure, but this is part of what makes the book so fine. The story focuses on the lives of the children in India who are born in the midnight hour of the day of the nation's independence. This special birth date and time convey to the children unique powers, in particular to the main character, Saleem. The book follows Saleem through his life as he interacts with his fellow midnight's children and his family. It is basically all flash-back as Saleem recounts the story as he nears the end of his life. While events in the novel are fantastical, the world is self-contained, believable, and thoroughly engaging. I am not well-versed in the history of India, and might have more to comment on in terms of how the book relates to it if I knew more. What I do know is that this is one of the most original books I have read, and ended up caring very much for the characters it contained. Exceptional."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Knees and a nose, a nose and knees. Around these improbable features Salman Rushdie builds a narrative that takes in the history, sounds, and smells of India. I have read this book about 6 times over a number of years and never seem to tire of it. I have read all of the Booker Prize winners and most of the shortlisted nominees. There are a couple that come close, but I still smile to myself with pleasure when I think of the joy that reading &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; brings me. It has also informed my reading of Rushdie's other books and led me to admire this master wordsmith even above Peter Carey, my other favourite. &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is about a group of children born at midnight on the eve of Independence. They each have a special characteristic. Critically, two of them are swapped at birth and raised in circumstances which allow Rushdie to portray the real India - a multiplicity of parallel dimensions ... hindu / parsi/ islamic/ mega-rich/ shockingly poor. And so terribly divided since that fateful day in 1947. That Rushdie gives us the panorama while at the same time amusing us with his wordplay is an aspect that this book achieves at a higher level than in his other books. Bringing to mind aspects of Indian life, particularly the teaming hordes of Bombay (or Mumbai as it now called by the fundamentalist hindu government), does help with comprehending the scale of much that Rushdie writes about. It is, after all, his home town. Nevertheless, I think the writing can be enjoyed just for the pleasure it gives to the reader. I think it's about time I read it again"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem, the protagonist of Midnight's Children, repeatedly says that to understand him, his readers will have to \\"swallow a world\\"--that is, to understand his story, they will have to understand every single detail that influences it in any way. And here is the genius of Rushdie's novel: in its epic attempt to document the myriad seemingly insignificant details that make up a life, Midnight's Children creates something much more than autobiography, much larger than personal intrigue, and ultimately much more important than the simple story the back of the book makes it out to be. Midnight's Children, the fictional autobiography of Saleem Sinai, is the best novelistic testament to memory--both personal and national--that I have ever read. Asking what it means to remember, what it means to forget, what it means when the most character-shaping memories you have are factually inaccurate, it leads to one huge question: is it the way things actually happened or the way you remember them happening that is important?In the 500 or so pages of this novel, Rushdie weaves a clever and fantastical story about Saleem Sinai, born exactly as India becomes independent, and his perceived influence on the fate of the nation. Because his birth links him so intimately to his country, Saleem believes that he is the center of every historical event of note, causing wars, international incidents, and interpersonal fiascos by what he calls his \\"rearranging of history.\\" To the reader, of course, his influence is absurd, as is the idea that one relatively insignificant person could have so much effect on so large a scale. But the genius of Rushdie's writing is that Saleem's position is simply a relatively common one writ large: don't we all feel that we are somehow the center of all that happens around us? Saleem's story strikes any of us who would like to feel that we are significant beyond the borders of our own selves.A word of warning: if you're expecting to learn factual Indian history from this book, beware. Though it is loosely based on actual events, Rushdie is clear that this is a story of memory--memory which necessarily distorts and rechronologizes according to its whims. In fact, if you read Imaginary Homelands, a collection of essays also by Rushdie, he's explicitly clear that some of the details are blatantly wrong, and he means them to be so. Don't read this book as the end-all truth about Indian post-colonial history. But if you're looking for a compelling read combining personal and national identity, factual past and remembered past, individuality and its war against communal insiginificance, by all means, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Clever idea. Politically correct book. Historical fiction. An educational book for the uninformed western observer. Despite all these positives, there is little that drives the narrative, and much like the magical realism of Love in the Time of Cholera, the story is overly weighted by anecdote after anecdote and by the seeming inevitability of a trite conclusion. Rushdie's language is at times inventive and rich, and at moment's stirring. But overall the story is bogged down by inconsequential details, overly repetitive motifs and structure, and the lack of a really compelling and immediate story. As a middle-aged man, in general I no longer find novels highly engaging, so you can take that with a grain of salt as well."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This was my book club's \\"big book\\" for the summer, with mixed results. Those who read it, loved it, but lots of people had problems getting through the book. What an experienced reader might find charming, entertaining, and thought-provoking - multitudes of characters, glorious digressions, rich and satirical reinterpretations of history, and Rushdie's far-flung wordplay - people with busy schedules or not enough patience to allow themselves a chunk of time to \\"get into\\" might just give up on. But the rewards for reading it are high - I have this undefinable criterion I attach to what I consider truly genius works, whether they're novels or poetry, that I can only describe as a feeling of their having not been made by mere mortals. Ok, that's a bit of purple prose. There are some literary works that are so well constructed that they seem to exist pretty perfectly, you're absorbed in that constructed word-world. I don't mean minimalist, though; this book is Dickensian. Here, you've got an entertaining/self-conscious/comically unreliable narrator, seemingly all of India, everyone in India, crammed into it, niftily named chapters labelled like jars of chutney (a metaphor I borrow directly from the book), it all turns into a bit of controlled chaos in your own mind, yet it's (I think) flawlessly executed, and it really bears re-reading. What helped me organize my thoughts about this book was drawing myself an oft-revised geneological tree of most of the characters, doing a little reading about the history of India, especially about the Partition and after, and putting myself in a Bollywood state of mind. I can't imagine recommending a contemporary novel more highly. And the discussion that results from reading this book with a group of people can be very rich."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This novel is Rushdie's most highly regarded. It is certainly the novel in which he unleashes what he terms 'mad prose pyrotechnics' to their utmost capabilities, telling a multitude of fantastical stories involving witches, noses, sheets with holes in, finger mutilation, washing-chests, pickles... the list is as perpetual and complex almost as the history of Modern India itself. A prose style that makes the magic realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez seem almost muted and restrained.This novel then, is a seemingly endless parade of storytelling -and not a simple, linear narrative either. Saleem's story swoops and loops and dives and frequently circles. It is a highly post modern novel that frequently stalls while the narrator forgets (dates such as the assasination of Ghandi and the 1957 elections) summarizes what has gone before and fortells what is yet to come. Why such a curious, strange style? Because Saleem is a character who, in his words is 'the sum total of everything that went before me, of all that I have seen done, of everything done-to-me...To understand me, you'll have to swallow the world'. Yes, Saleem is, in a sense, India itself, coming into being at exactly the same moment - 15th August 1947 and blessed with magical powers that allow him to see into the minds of other people and hear their voices in his head. Saleem's life is inextricably linked to Indian history since 1947 - so it's not surprising that the poor fellow can't tell his story straight.Inside this narrative is a multitude of political commentary, allegory, leifmoteif symbolism- humble objects such as a spitoon frequently recur in the stories, satirical riffs, ruminations on the nature of history, enchanting descriptions of Indian scenes, parody and digression. In this last aspect it reminded me somewhat of a much older post modern novel - Lawrence Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy'.Saleem's experience as a 'swallower of lives' ultimately overwhelms him, and the complex richness of this novel has overwhelmed and will overwhelm many readers. Those familiar with the complex heterogeneity of Indian culture will find much to inspire and challenge them here. And for readers prepared to hunker down and engage with the prose will find a great Indian novel from a highly exuberent and talented writer."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"At the surface, Midnight's Children is a novel of the Indian subcontinent. The characters and events tend to run parallel to the history of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in the modern era. Defining the book as such is both entirely accurate and breathtakingly false, for Midnight's Children is also a novel of the mysteries of life, with an emphasis on mystery.Rather than approach the book as a brilliant deconstruction of the politics of the subcontinent-which it does, or as an indictment of rigid religiosity-which it is, Midnight's Children should be read for a pure enthusiasm for life, distilled into book form. The novel is both tragedy and comedy and, in its embrace of the fantastic, the ineffable, the magical, it transcends all the modern fiction that remains mired in dour realism.Rushdie is a fine-perhaps great-writer working at his peak here. Don't be put off by its surface plot (although I find India compelling). Pick up this book, read it for its life and humanity and joie de vivre."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"A stylishly written masterpiece that chronicles the life of the narrator and parrallells it with the independence of India.Saleem Sinai is born in Bombay at the very moment of India's independence from Britain. Fortunately for Saleem he is switched at birth with Shiva, his alter ego, and raised by wealthy Muslim parents. Shiva in turn is raised as a Hindu pauper.Saleem, although physically imperfect, shares fantastic paranormal abilities with the other 1001 children born during the first hour of India's independence. Midnight's Children, as they call themselves, can communicate telepathically, however, Saleem and Shiva are blessed with abilities that are even more advanced than the other Children of Midnight. The two of them vie for leadership within the midnight childrens conferences. After Saleem finds out the circumstances of their birth, he unsuccessfully attempts tries to hide these facts from Shiva. Once Shiva finds out the truth he and begins to plot his revenge.Rushdie masterfully interweaves the events of Saleem's life with those historical events that occurred during the first thirty years of India's independence; including wars with China and Pakistan and the fromation of Bangladesh. He introduces a plethera of unique and fascinating characters who epitomize the diversity of the region. The language is a bastardized English, combining the King's English, ancient Hindi,Persian and varoius regional dialects. Rushdie does his best at giving the reader a glimpse of just how complicated India is with its different religions and customs.The humor is very tongue in cheek and prevelant throughout. Rushdie uses variations of spelling and punctuation to accentuate his drama and humour."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a landmark novel. Not many people can do something so original in this post-modern age. Although this style is not unique to Rushdie, his analogies and metaphors stand him out from the crowd. As Joyce was to Dublin, Rushdie is to Bombay not merely a stream of consciousness but a torrent, flowing perpetually with the rhythm of India at the time of independence. The modern and the traditional clash with an unbelievably colourful explosion in this book. The story swings in and out of magic and realism. Rushdie was born himself at the birth of independence in India, he is therefore putting himself forward as the special few, the &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;, with special powers, indeed he has. He is as colourful and diverse as the new India. The &quot;sequel&quot; &quot;The Moor's Last Sigh&quot;, has nothing on this his best work. He casts a dream, and as for the cast - a boy with super strong killer knees, a boy with a radio in his head and with the sense of smell that can sniff out hate, love and colours. I don't know much about the politics of India or the partition of Pakistan, but it didn't matter. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"A meaningless collection of words.

An incredible fiction that tells the true story of India's birth as a nation. I read the book years ago, and then felt it come to life as I spent 6 months wandering around India. A work of art, and one of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is much easier to read than other works of Rushdie (eg, The Satanic Verses).

It was my first book by Rushdie. I definitly plan on reading all of his other books!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is a great plot-weaver, no question about it. However, as a native of the Indian subcontinent, I feel that he falls short in giving a true sketch of life there. Perhaps this is because he himself is a migrant. This is an aspect of the novel that many Westerners cannot really pick up on, but that sticks out in my mind. Also, it would help if Rushdie weren't such a pervert."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children potrays the life of Saleem Sinai, one ofthe many children born precisely at the stroke of midnight of August15,1947 when India woke up to its freedom. All through the book, the undercurrent of satirism runs. Every character captures the Indian mentality. The book is a reflection of how India has grromed herself over the years. The metaphorical and rich language accentuate every situation and every character. The blend of satire, fantasy and fact, truly places it as the best work of Rushdie."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Though I'm not a native english speaker and noexpert on Indian history, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.I think I missed half the &quot;nudge nudge, know what I mean&quot;jokes, and still I couldn't stop snickering to myself.I'd recommend it to anyoneLeontien"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The length and density of Midnight's Children was too much for 50% of my family and friends book club. Non-finishers included both 30-somethings and 60-somethings. Those of us who persevered found the book enriching and enlightening. The writing style and vocabulary were discouraging to the more concrete readers in the group. I will read another of his books someday, but I will not recommend it for book club!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"There's a lot of praise for this book, and I thought I'd put my two cents in. One important note: Rushdie PURPOSELY inserts historical innacuracies, so don't think you're getting an accurate historical account - that's done on purpose. Indeed, from a post-structuralist theoretical standpoint, Rushdie's project is clearly to deconstruct. But, he goes nowhere with it. His whole novel can be summed up in a few lines: The popular version of history is inherently corrupted by social mediating forces; so, in order to combat that force, I'm going to offer MY version of history to show that there is no ONE history. It's a pretty standard argument, but he doesn't develop it beyond that. I would suggest that you look to Faulkner (who focuses on history's lingering qualities) or Ellison's Invisible Man (in which he focuses on how to break through cycles of historical oppression). They handle the effects of history in a much more engaging and profound way."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. The subject, the repercussions till today ... I have lived a very long time in this geographical area and have therefore a deep interest.Rushdie's book reminded me of so many visits of locals where at the end you were asking yourself, what was the purpose and what were we talking about? These instances and the book have one thing in common: a complete waste of time. And Indians, as well as Nepalis, are very good at that.In Midnight's Children it seems that SR's ego - and boy, so called Indian intellectuals do sport quite some ego - simply went haywire. The book is an exercise in overtwisting a twist, in being oh so very clever or as the Germans say it approaches the subject 'from the back through the chest and into the eye'."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is so in love with his own writing and condescending of his reader that he feels it necessary to explain his themes and symbols, and to periodically review the main points of the story. I admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters and some of the wordplay, but most of it is out-of-control, self-indulgent rubbish. It is very disappointing to me that this book has won so much critical acclaim."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I've read another one of his books and thought it was very good. This one was too disjointed for me.Frankly no one in our reading group enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's book Midnight's Children is unbearable. The book is extremely repetitive and boring. Rushdie attempts to avoid this criticism by being \\"unique\\" and using a stream of consciousness technique that infuriated me consistently during the reading. The book is filled with supposedly \\"deep\\" metaphors, which are actually incredibly superficial and annoying. Rushdie's arrogance and narcissism is reflected by the main character of the book, Saleem, who spends the majority of a 500 page novel complaining about how life hasn't treated him fairly. Prior to reading the novel I was disgusted by what I knew of Indian tradition in general, particularly the caste system and pervasive racism in the country. This novel did little to enlighten western readers to some redeeming quality in their society, and left me, a staunch liberal, reconsidering how bad colonialism actually was. Since I realize that colonialism was one of the most immoral actions perpetrated by any group of people in history, it only goes to show you how negatively Rushdie portrays what should be a vibrant culture. Since this seems to be the only reason to market this novel towards western readers, I am forced to conclude that this novel is a complete failure."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a lousy book. It's really amazing to me that the world had made such a fuss about such a mediocre writer as Salman Rushdie. The reason is properly that he is of somewhat Indian origin and that Khomeini got pissed off. Anyway Midnight's Children is a socio-political account. It revolves around some crucial times in newer Indian history, like the declaration of post colonial India on midnight August 15, 1947 and the declaration of state of emergency on June 25, 1975, the war with Pakistan, etc. Upon these historical facts Rushdie then brews an account inspired by magical realism and interspersed with personal experiences. Often Rushdie tries to be funny, but I didn't laugh one single time!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a heaping pile of garbage and here's why. It is extremely boring, and excruciatingly painful to read. Every teacher I've ever had in my creative writing workshop classes always emphasized two very specific things that a writer needs to keep in mind in order to write very good fiction. The first thing is that you need to grab the reader's attention right from the beginning of the story, and try to maintain this attention as best as possible. The second, is that the writing needs to be clear so that the story flows well. Salman Rushdie does neither of these two things. Folks, describing what someone's nose looks like as the introduction of a novel is not how you get someone's attention. In fact, its a pretty good way to ensure that people think you are retarded. Also, the novel jumps all over the place in terms of everything - the characters, the time, etc. The result is a reader that is inundated with places and names that he or she could remotely give a rat's ass about.Second, the premise of the story, which is about a thousand children born on the stroke of midnight that possess supernatural powers, doesn't impress me at all. The premise doesn't impress me at all. Why? Because if Saleem had an ounce of common sense, and if he could really tap into other people's minds, then wouldn't it be extremely logical for him to become a professional poker player? Gambling in horse races is legal in India, as mentioned in the novel, so it is clear that it is a gambling-friendly country. Think about it. Creating a Midnight's Children's Conference is probably the last thing I would do if I were Saleem and I could read people's minds. And Saleem has the nerve to think that a bunch of idiotic 10 year olds, yimmering and yammering about what toys they want, have the ability to save a country? Please, screw that. I woulnd't care about India. India can go save itself because I would be too busy at the casino and buying Ferraris and mansions.Third, now this is a bit nitpicky, but the name Salman Rushdie distracted me from the novel, of which I could only read about 4 pages at a time at most because it was horrendously boring. Salman should be the name of a delicious and tasty fish that I like to eat once or twice a month, not a prominent author. And Rushdie? This distracted me even more, because what is Rushdie supposed to mean? That he wants to rush to die? Or wants us to rush to die? It's a goofy name, and serious novels require authors with serious names, like Stephen King, or Tom Clancy, and not silly names like J.K. Rowling. You know what J.K. stands for? JUST KIDDING. Harry Potter and his friends gain magical powers to defeat the jackass that killed his parents, and finally, has a tea party, but JUST KIDDING. But Rowling has achieved a level of wealth and stardom that Rushdie can only dream of, and I'm willing to bet that when he had heard about Rowling's success, he instantly grew another grey hair. I looked up Rushdie's picture on the internet, but only saw a picture of a sad hobo.Midnight's Children, is a form of verbal diarrhea in that Rushdie is simply stroking his own ego, and possibly himself right in front of our eyes, except only through the form of words. How many times is he going to repeat the motif of the smell of chutneys and sweetmeats and the smell of human waste in the air whenever Saleem goes out into public? Once, twice? Try possibly almost a hundred times. Books like these should be frowned upon, and the people that are giving this guy accolades and awards for this novel, need to put down their PCP pipes, and enter drug counseling and rehabilitation therapy, because these people are contributing to the slow death of literature as we know it. I think literature is like technology. It needs to evolve over time and newer versions of things should make previous ones obsolete so that we always have an influx of fresh new material. No car manufacturer today would put the engine of a Model T Ford into any car, it's just stupid. When the semester is over, and the exams and papers are all finished and submitted, I will celebrate with a small glass of champagne, and wait about 30 to 45 minutes. Then I would take Midnight's Children to my backyard, set it on the ground, and proceed to go to the bathroom on it. Midnight's Children, by Salman Rushdie, I give it a 1 star."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I feel about Salman Rushdie's first big book roughly the same way I feel about Indian food. The food features a fascinating melange of spices, smells and textures, but I have no desire to consume it. Nor do I particularly comprehend the attraction of the cuisine of a dirt poor Third World country with more dietary taboos than you can shake a sitar at and, while heavy spicing is a perfectly logical substitute for substance, at the end of the meal one longs to ask: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;. Similarly, in his novel, Rushdie combines his signature Magical Realist style and the actual historical background of India since Independence with the family history of the Sinai's to create a bewildering mess of a novel that is heavy on Bombay slang. The language is pungent but indecipherable and the story is ambitious but confusing. The linguistic pyrotechnics and luxuriant prose have displaced the meat of the story.I actually believe that India offers a unique opportunity to the author of today. With the end of the Cold War and peace in the Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland, many of the settings that offered built in tension have disappeared. India, however, remains a corrupt political state, is rife with ethnic tension and is nearly at war with both Pakistan and China. There are so many latent plot lines that it would seem an irresistible setting and I very much enjoyed books like Rohinton Mistry's Such a Long Journey and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy (1993). But, both are much more traditional, Western-style novels. As is usually the case, the injection of magical realism into Rushdie's story ends up detracting from his tale rather than enhancing it. The effort to create an Indian, or postcolonial, style did not work for me; a straightforward narrative, stripped of hocus pocus gimmickry, would have been much more enjoyable.GRADE: C-"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"had fair expectations. rushdie spends too much time being cutesy and obnoxiously witty. read a book on indian history instead."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"\\"Midnight's Children\\" by Salman Rushdie is called a 'Great Book of the 20th Century\\" and \\"a modern classic,\\" and rightly so. This novel is one of the most interesting and memorable of the 20th century, and one of the best novels by a living writer, at least that I have read. Rushdie weaves a semi-historical, semi-mythical portrayal of the newly formed nation-state of India. Throughout the book, I kept thinking that the protagonist was actually Rushdie himself; or, perhaps the protagonist represents Rushdie's generation, since he was born in Bombay in 1947. The plot is interesting indeed, which I won't get into because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Let's just say that the protagonist relates the life of himself and his immediate ancestors in such a way to make Rushdie the \\"Indian mythmaker.\\" The writing is often too much in some places, and I feel that Rushdie over did it in a few places. I do like how Rushdie would refer to his own metaphors throughtout the book to keep the reader focused, because the reader can indeed get lost in the plot if one is not careful. This novel is often put next to \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" because of its style. I might agree to that to some extent, primarily because each of these two novels have a different purpose. They are both written in the style of magical realism, but again, each novel has it's own purpose. If Rushdie had kept his writing focused on India in his subsequent novels, I believe that he would be to India what J.M. Coetzee is to South Africa. However, Rushdie's scope is much broader than one country or even one culture. Anyway, that's another topic. Overall, if you have never read Rushdie, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book came highly recommended by my English professor, who - if she had a choice - would name this Booker of Bookers one of the top three novels ever written.

It was only when I looked at my clock and realized it was three in the morning that it hit me. I had devoured almost half the book and I kept going because I wanted to see what would happen. When I finally finished the book, I realized that she was right: if not one of the top three, then definitely high up.

This is possibly one of the best books ever written.I can't say this book is for everyone. That's not really saying much because I don't think a book exists that is suited for everyone, save for maybe a dictionary. Still, this is an intense, methodical book. Those looking for a quick read are best suited to seek something else, because this one is not a quick read by any stretch of the imagination.Within that intensity and thickness one finds the brilliant yet insane world of Saleem Sinai, the main character of this story. Both allegorical and literal, this story winds though such a myriad of well-woven sub-stories that one needs to put the book down every few pages to think about what was just read.From his birth to the book's finality, we rise up the ups and fall down the downs with Saleem. We are twisted, confused, wrought out, and yet manage to survive through thick and more thick. From front to back, side to side, this narrative thoroughly tosses you about. From chapter to chapter one never knows where you're going to end up.With excellent writing plus both laughable and dramatic scenes, Rushdie shows why he is one of the greatest writers of our time. Truly an instant classic, this book is a must read for those who want to explore some of this generation's greatest. This work is wonderful, beautiful, exasperating, and terrifying.

But suffice to say, it is the story of Saleem Sinai, a midnight child, born at the moment of India's Independance, and therefore, absolutely and irrevocably tied to his nation's events. He will be your guide. Follow him, if you are ready to take your imagination on an uncontrolable roller coaster of sights, sounds, and ESPECIALLY smells!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is the zenith of the talents of one of the greatest and most misunderstood writers of our era. Unlike most of Rushdie's other novels, Midnight's Children is almost relentlessly serious, with little of Rushdie's trademark quipping interfering with the progress of the story. And while some fans may miss it, it works, as Rushdie delves into magical realism to tell the story of children across India born at the stroke of the nation's independence in August 1947, and their telekinetic powers and ability to communicate with each other across great distances. In addition to mirroring the history of India during its first half-century as an independent, unified nation, Rushdie uses the children's &quot;superpowers&quot; as a metaphor for India's own erratic and often misdirected ascension as a nation-state."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is truly pathbreaking. It's got pathos, tragedy, comedy, drama and 'tear-jerking' ...all in all, a totally &quot;masala&quot; book. Lesser writers would have floundered to paint on such a huge canvas, but not Rushdie. He straddles the past and the future, the magical and the mundane, the east and the west, history and fantasy with equal grace. If Rushdie were a filmmaker, he would be a person who could mix Manmohan Desai, Ram Gopal Verma and Ray into a lethal combination.Saleem Sinai is not however the typical potboiler hero...he's got his magical moments but the weight of power and history weighs him down.Shiva, however, is the villian like a Bollywood villian.But, reviewing this book here seems so difficult, my advice is to go read it!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is a true master with a skill for story telling that not many can match. This book is not to be missed by those who care about politics and how people are affected by it on an everyday level. And as I have never yet been to India, I feel like I have already visited surrounded by it's sites &amp; smells. I can't wait to read more of his works!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"When I first started to read this, I thought I'd never finish it, so I decided to read slowly, but carefuly, and I haven't done wrong - I really enjoyed it. There's not one boring part in it. It knid of reminds me of G. Garcia Marquez because of the involving of elements of fantastic, but still Rushie has his own special style. You don't need to know everything about India to be able to read this - common knowldge is enough."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children is an incredible achievement. Mr. Rushdie is able to relate the complex story of twentieth century India through a personal narrative that is entertaining, magical and beautiful. The novel is presented as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, who was born at the exact moment of India's independence. This gives him supernatural powers, namely the ability to communicate telepathically with 420 other \\"midnight children.\\" These children, all born in the first hour of India's independence, all have some supernatural ability. Saleem's account goes beyond his own experience, including stories from the lives of his grandparents, parents, neighbors, and many others. Using him as a symbol, Rushdie explains the multifaceted and somewhat confused identity of India as a whole, a theme that surfaces in many ways throughout the novel. Rushdie's story combines fact and fantasy to create a magnificent picture of the modern history of India.From his birth, Saleem's life is tied to his country. Due to the incredible situation of his birth, Prime Minister Nehru writes to him, \\"We shall be watching over your life with the closest attention; it will be, in a sense, the mirror of our own\\" (139). Parallels between Saleem's life and the life of India are found throughout the novel. In addition to his mother and father, he names many people as \\"parents,\\" including his nurse, a neighbor, his friend, and a number of others. This parallels the numerous \\"parents\\" of India's culture, including British, Hindu, Muslim, and other influences. Saleem's childhood sees issues with identity and purpose. Similarly, he witnesses many events that show identity issues for the new nation, including language marches and the Indo-Pakistan war. Additionally, Saleem is fragmented and falling apart. He describes a physical ailment that he has, \\"I have begun to crack all over like an old jug ...I am literally disintegrating\\" (36). This resembles the fragmented culture of India. In numerous ways, the history of modern India is echoed in Saleem's life.Rushdie's unique style is as magical as the story itself. The novel constantly uses vivid images to convey meaning. Saleem states that he is able to smell history, referring to \\"the vinegary force of Adam Aziz's determination\\" (14) and \\"the acrid stench of his mother's embarrassment\\" (14). Rushdie combines symbols, rich images, and expressive prose in a way that adds to the dream-like aspect of the novel. When writing about a moment of insecurity, Saleem says, \\"green shards lacerated my hands as I entered that swirling universe in which I was doomed, until it was far too late, to be plagued by constant doubts about what I was for\\" (187). This picturesque style greatly contributes to the surreal character of the story.If one goal of Midnight's Children was to convey the history and culture of twentieth century India, this novel is very effective. Rushdie covers the wide range of people that make up this nation by including countless diverse individuals and scenes. Saleem writes, \\"I have been a shallower of lives; and to know me, just the one of me, you'll have to swallow the lot as well\\" (4) symbolically saying that to understand India, one must understand all of these stories. Considering the sheer amount of characters and plot developments, the book is amazingly smooth and easy to read. The author is able to tie the whole range of these varied accounts into one coherent picture. Yet this novel goes far beyond that goal. It historically documents a culture and simultaneously composes a magical personal story. Rushdie does all of this with a brilliant, unique style that makes the entire novel a remarkable work of art.Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children conveys the multifaceted history of India with the incredible story of one person's life using symbolism and metaphor. The dream-like quality of Rushdie's style adds greatly to the magical aspects of the story. The novel effectively achieves its goal, and is both fascinating and beautiful."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie is a celebrity writer, so I approach his work with a heavy amount of skepticism. Many times, authors fail to live up to their fans' praises or their enemy's condemnations. But Rushdie resists my attempts to dismiss him as an author whose success hinges solely on inflated emotions.Midnight's Children deals with some time shortly before and after India obtained its independence from England. The novel leads slowly to the birth of its narrator, Saleem Sinai, who, incidentally, is born at midnight on the first day of an independent India. After an incident in a hamper, Saleem's nose bestows him with a magical ability to communicate with all other Indian children born in the first hour of India's independent birth. Hence, \\"Midnight's Children.\\"Rushdie's characters parody those found in certain sacred texts, so the derision he draws form religious figures is no surprise. Mary and Joseph appear in the story. But Joseph is a terrorist, and Mary, well, I do not want to give away that surprise. She makes excellent chutney.The novel repeats frequently, for a purpose. In order to produce a magical-realist allegory, Rushdie must iterate things over and over again until he has persuaded the reader of the correspondences between the quotidian and the privileged narrative of history. Saleem's frequent interruptions in the narrative serve both implicitly and explicitly as moments of self-reflection. A text that is self-aware and admits to its own faults is one that allows space for criticism and even invites it. It is a sophisticated and mature authorship to deny one's own authorial power.Midnight's Children is especially useful for literature students looking for a fictional narrative of India's independence and struggle for self-identity. He presents Saleem Sinai's India, and consequently, calls into question the privilege of so-called \\"objective histories.\\" Might the truest histories, in fact, be the \\"subjective\\" stories of the common people? Even though the novel is fiction, it presents an extremely personal view of India's tumultuous post-colonial history."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is an excellent and in some ways ground-breaking work. It deserves a lot of accolades, and I share many kudos from some previous reviewers. However, the work falls short of a masterpiece, for the following reasons.1. It's too long. At a skilled and parsimonious hand, the novel could be half the length to tell the same story.2. Mr. Rushdie has a tendency to flaunt the same (admittedly) good ideas or puns over and over again. Example: the perforated sheet, when first introduced, is ingenious, and the initial narration quite funny and touching. But it gets too many repeated airings later, as if Mr. Rushdie believes that the reader is too dumb to get the symbolism.3. The work lacks subtlety. Mr. Rushdie writes exuberantly, which is a good thing. However, he often overdid it, making no room for personal discovery of hidden treasures. In other words, the feeling one has out of second and (rarely) third reading is the same-ol and not infrequently, a mild revulsion at literary exhibitionism. Mr. Rushdie's eagerness, in my opinion, has resulted in several shortcomings in the plot. For instance, revealing Mary's \\"crime\\" immediately after it was committed is not as good a strategy as delayed climax.4. Some sybolism is confusing. Saleem is obviously portrayed as a symbol, witness, living (and then dying) embodiment of India with a Muslim heritage. But him being the bastard son of an Englishman and an accordianist's wife seems to confuse that. I can appreciate the implication that India is held up as a bastard of Britain by this parentage, but how that gets into the Muslim aspect is something I cannot sort out clearly (despite Saleem's upbringing by Amina, with a Christian twist through Mary). This lack of clarity, maybe intentional, is nonetheless a detraction from the novel, in my opinion.In totality, M/C is a very good novel, and its Booker of Bookers, in my opinion, is deserved, in the sense that other Bookers are mostly mediocre to good offerings. Some weaknesses evident in the novel (lack of patience and exhibitionist knack), sadly, foretells Mr. Rushdie's decline as an author."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of the absolute masterpieces - and comparisions to 100 years and the works of Borges are inevitable because of the use of magic realism. However, it differs from works of Marquez in 100 years because his style is not as controlled and the flow of word play is more abundant, creating a riot of colours and smells - which overwhelm you even more if you were born in a large indian city in the 60s or 70s. A note to appreciate this book - please read up just a bit of indian history from independence to the late 80s - i guarantee you'll enjoy this book substantially more if you do so. Rushdie is not Joyce - and you can easily get the incredible wordplays and metaphors with a half hour homework before reading Midnight's Children. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"What an incredible surprise! And to think I had nearly dismissed this writer as someone for the West to parade around just to spite &quot;Islamic extremists.&quot; Besides, I'm also often skeptical of artists who disrespect religious traditions.But upon a friend's recommendation, this became my first experience reading Rushdie- and I'm now a true believer! Encountering this author heightened my senses to the dangers of censorship- what a deeply personal experience. This is a magnificent book- one of my favorites ever.100 Years of Solitude and A Passage to India make nice complements."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The thing that really surprised me about Midnight's Children, by the end of it, was its generally sardonic attitude towards the magical symbolism and omens that are so central to the plot. So much is made of the mystical connections relating to the main character (Saleem Sinai), so much promise is set up in the story, that it's surprising when the abuse starts being heaped on Saleem with almost sadistic relentlessness. By the end of the story Rushdie has portrayed a startlingly pessimistic view of the \\"potential\\" of the innocent. And, with the obvious parallels between the life of Saleem Sinai and the development of modern India, Rushdie also exhibits a pessimistic and fairly depressing forecast for the future of one of the world's most populous nations.But amidst all that is an epic; a collection of stories that seems almost like \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\" in its scope. The magical realism style Rushdie employs is far less confusing than that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez: where Marquez's rambling, stream of consciousness writing serves largely to (intentionally) disorient the reader, Rushdie (through a liberal use of semi-colons) gently guides the reader through narrative leaps spanning both time and distance. Astonishingly descriptive, Rushdie is almost more a painter than a writer in this book: the near 550 pages pass by with a very economical use of dialogue, and it is the scenes and descriptions that provide the meat and memories of the novel.Those who are fans of Tolkein and other authors who write lavishly detailed stories simply cannot miss this novel. \\"Midnight's Children\\" plays out like an Oscar-winning film or a very vivid, elaborate dream."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I hate fighting my food, and I similarly hate to fight what I'm reading. I've read too many rambling books that one is \\"supposed\\" to enjoy, only to put them down in disgust. However, this one came across to me as completely enjoyable and straightforward! Why? Because I've lived in India for two years, and had no problems following the characters or the march of history behind them. I only wish I had this kind of context with other such books. My very unconstructive advice? Move to India--wait for some time--and then read this."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is an extremely ambitious book. Rushdie attempts to weave together so many different ideas and threads, that it's hard to imagine conceiving of such a thing, let alone writing it. There is ample talent and brilliance and inspiration to be found, but ultimately Rushdie simply makes the reader work way too hard. You must juggle so many things at once, in order to keep it going, and it's exhausting.The chronological leaps, the ceaseless foreshadowing (you must constantly ask whether some new piece of information will be elaborated later, or if you must re-read a passage to figure it out), the liberties taken with punctuation, the \\"Hinglish\\" language challenges, the historical/cultural references, the magical/fantasy elements... all of these things are great on their own, but collectively it's just too damn much.Glad I read it, but can't recall another book where I was so glad to be done. It's hard work and the payoff is not quite there in the end, even tho I love Indian culture and history."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a very well thought out book; the whole narrative is obviously laid out from the beginning. The narrator, Saleem, is a rambling sort who is scrambling to write down his life story before he cracks and breaks away - \\"Now the crack, the cracks and always the cracks are narrowing my future towards its single inescapable fullpoint; and even Padma must take a back seat if I'm to finish my tales.\\" The narration isn't rushed though, but it does tend to delve off into personal speculation at times. I wasn't bothered by this because I found it entertaining, but some people might be. Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on the day of the birth of the nation of India, so his story is also the story of India as it transforms from a tender and weak country into an adult and dangerous one. The best part of the story is Salman Rushdie's writing, in my opinion. He tends to use what I call adjective or noun or verb strings - putting words together like in this one: \\"driven on by the imperatives of rip tear crack, I abandon reflections.\\" Salman Rushdie has such a unique style of writing, one that forces the reader to completely focus on what is being said or else he/she will miss something vital. It's gorgeous, colored by Indian phrases and sentence-structuring. Midnight's Children is a very interesting story, and I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially lovers of unique prose."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie lectured the motto in this tome: the life story of anyone can be the result of the whole world, and the whole world can be nothing but triggered by or explicited on someone. This is a historic fiction with fantasy, and a great fiction in its own.Rushdie is so ambitious that he tried to depict the history of India in a book, in a very gorgeous language and style, while simaltaneously ruthlessly burdening our poor good protagonist, Saleem, and his morbid family.I am so dazzled by the ambition and the language of the book, and am deeply moved not only by the book itself but also Rushdie. I can feel the ardent love and eager struggle for India in Rushdie. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted. And I am so happy that I finally finished this book. Its a deeply true-heartedly wow."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children skyrocketed its author Salman Rushdie to fame winning him a Booker Prize. The novel has since been named the best novel ever to win a Booker. it was written in 1980 having every promise of becoming part of the English literature canon of great literature.The book is long, dense, magic-realistic and episodic. Like David Copperfield the Bombay born narrator states he was born! Saleem Sinai was born on August 15, 1947 the very hour in which India gained her independence from Great Britain. Saleem is one of 1001 children born in this magical hour. All of the midnight children are granted special gifts. Saleem has a large nose and is able to smell better than anyone. He is also able to conjure up in his mind a meeting from time to time of all the midnight children! Saleem is born to a poor Hindu named Wee Winkie. A nurse switches the Aziz baby with Winkie so that Saleem ends up growing up in a well to do Muslim's doctor's home. Triumph but more often tragedy plague this family. Saleem's family is killed in the war between India and Pakistan. Saleem endures child abuse, poverty, impotence and sorrow . He meets many mentors especially women. His life's ups and downs mirror those of his native India in the first years of independence.Rushdie writes in a vivid style filled with the sounds, colors, smells and volatile emotions of the Indian and Pakistani people. A knowledge of the Muslim religion and the history of India will help the reader understand the complex plot. Each of the thirty chapters is a gem of narration which requires close concentration on the part of the reader.This book will not be to everyone's taste. It is a wild ride whose tour guide author is the brilliant author. Undoubtedly,much of the book is based on Rushdie's own youth in India. This book can be read allegorically and lends itself to rereading. It warrants discussion and analysis. An excellent novel which is probably the best fiction ever written on India!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Complex, interesting characters and plot. Best I have encountered. Imaginative. Brilliant.

Am totally dumbfounded at how great this book is. Being more familiar with Indian History (and having lived through it), I am amazed at Rushdie's powers of imagination to merge real events with a magic carpet ride to make his point; many people like me lived through these historic events and were kind of oblivious to them....I am amazed at how well he touches upon the culture, social habits, religion. ........----------------------------------------------------------------------I don't want to elaborate on the contents, because it is important for one to read this book without any preconceived notions.

The irony ..It is a well known fact that Sanjay Gandhi (Indira's son) led the mass forced sterilization of mostly poor people. There was very little opposition; many even welcomed it (why should the poor have so many children, when they cannot afford them). Add the religious angle to it (Hindus vs Moslems)..... yes everyone knows that Morarji drank his own urine. Maybe, that's why he lived to a ripe old age.... how wonderful to have so many mothers and fathers... my son who is NOT my son, but is the real grandson of my father ...... and Padma, the dung lotus ....everyone will form their own impressions of the book. The metaphors, symbolism and irony cannot be missed. For me, the sprinkling of all the familiar things (Kolynos toothpaste., pan, spittoons,chutneys, pickles..) provided the relief in the form of nostalgia. Personally, I don't think of this as a political book, more of a glimpse of how times change with a twist of irony. Hey, life goes on...."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is a book to take on vacation... or a book to read at home if you cannot afford a vacation! If you allow it, this book will completely pull you into it's pages and have you eating, sleeping, and dreaming it's story.

Maybe I shouldn't say I don't like since I haven't read the whole book, but I don't know if I could. Perhaps it's because I'm only 16 and the only knowledge I have of Indian culture was a brief unit on the topic freshman year, or maybe I'm just not mature enough to read this book.

Rushdie is the perfect example of such an Indian. For an authentic view of India we must still turn to V.S. Naipaul."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I enjoyed the first couple of chapters of this book immensely but got lost at the end. It flows brilliantly in some parts, and is completely confusing in others. Honestly I did not know what to make of the book."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"For a book that has received so much praise this is maddeningly self-indulgent. Rushdie details the struggles of partitioning and the development of India with fantastic skill but the main plot is too self-aware. In any other guise this might be described as fantasy but, of course, it is too worthy to be listed as such. Tiresome in the extreme despite the poetic nature of the prose, this is one to read if you want to show off at dinner parties."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"A novel must do two things: it must entertain, and explain. It is through stories - delivered through mythology, literature, movies or just plain gossip - that humans meet their most fundamental need (besides food) for tools to help understand the world and their role in it.I could care less if Midnight's Children was judged the 'Booker of Bookers', but it does not tell a compelling story nor it does it explain India's history or its society in any relevant way.There is no need for a plot synopsis here, but Rushdie invents a thousand or so children born at India's independence at midnight of August 15 1947, who are gifted with magical powers - which presumably could have been used to intervene and help in their Nation's halting advance into modernity.Saleem Sinai - the hero - instead immerses himself in a world of feckless friends and relatives, whose concerns and ambitions seem seem completely out of phase and magnitude with the history unfolding around them.He invents a Bombay where nearly everyone is a Kashmiri Muslim, a Parsi or an upper class Gujarati - who live in the Methwold's Estate, shop at Breach Candy and, of course, the children go to the Cathedral and John Connon school. They are all charmingly European in their sensibilities (or at least light-skinned!).Now Parsis and Kashmiris are a nice enough people, but they make up less than 1% of India's (Mumbai's) population. Rushdie still wants to use the history of the remaining hundreds million Indians - many or most of whom are like the 'black South Indian fisherwoman' that, except for the servant Padma, never seem to become part of the story. How does he attempt to pull this off, and still write a novel meant to reach the (Western, not Indian) reader?Through 'magical realism' of course. Why deal with a real, compelling story when you can have magic whenever you like. The novel is not only full of numerous nicknames, metaphorical titles, but every page seems to have a character being transmigrated, transmuted or just plain transported somewhere or into something else. This makes it impossible to follow enough of the hero's story in order to care what becomes of him (or his country). You are trying to follow a family or nation's drama - and there are jugglers, acrobats and magicians pulling silly tricks all the time.There was a reason why Shakespeare split up his plays in to tragedies, comedies and histories. He realized that it was not possible to mix up the three and still entertain and explain, and Salman Rushdie is unable to succeed here."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Unfortunately this is one of those books that are not to be taken lightly.It is a very difficult read, the author has no desire to make it easy for the reader, the temptation to put down the book is constant.I finally decided to skip entire parts that made no sense at all and tried not to waste completely my time. It will take a lot of time and attention, think twice before embarking on it"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Presented as the pinnacle of the magic realism movement, this novel left me cold. There are aseveral reasons why one SHOULD like it: -about India -by an Indian (kind of) -&quot;difficult&quot; -Liberal/socialist -decadent However, no matter how these stack up -for me it was completely boring. I had no interest in any of the characters and as a metaphor for modern India it was markedly unmetaphorical. I learnt nothing of that country. I learnt a lot about the limitations of Magical Realism -an essentially lazy, self indulgent genre. The ego of Rushdie is prominent -as he wrote it he was clearly thinking &quot;This is an important work&quot;. He should read Eliot, Proust and Dosteovsky -and learn his place"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"When I saw the lavish reviews thrown by well known critics of The Times, NYTimes, Observer, etc, I didn't mind wasting my pocket money on this book. What I got in return for my wastage of my pocket money and two days, was utter wastage of my time, when Gunter Grass, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, V.S. Naipaul and Sir John Milton are awaiting me in my shelf.The book is merely so-so.To write a critique of it I must divide it into two fragments to review it. Or in the terms of Salman Rushdie, let us view it in two fragments through the perforated sheet.To judge Salman Rushdie's talent as a storyteller, we must judge the story and the way in which it is writtenThe story, I must admit, is quite well thought and the descriptive talent of the author is revealed here. It is thrilling, which, before Midnight's Children, only Clancy and Ludlum could provide.But then, it is written in toasted english. Rushdie, like a spectre, is swaying, his context changing faster than the climaxes in which the events are set. He is trying to make an Indian version of the English Language and he has'nt quite succeded in it. English has been baked roasted and mixed with Indian spices, with chilly in excess which has compelled me to spit out the dish altogether. Indian words have been used for the international audiences to celebrate. Rushdie through his novel, has failed in achieving his aim, laying the bricks as the foundation for a massive Indian Literary Castle in a forest where India is not drawn on the map.But, I admit again, despite a fantasy filled story, Salman Rushdie, unlike Rowling, has succeded in making his novel a literary masterpiece in some intellectual sense."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I read Rushdie's incredible novel when I was in India and it was all the more special. Within the lives of 30 or so people born at Midnight on 14/8/47 (the moment India and Pakistan were cut free from British rule) Rushdie weaves an allegorical novel that summarises India's past and as those lives are lived comments on her future. The problems of Islamic Kashmir and the beautiful language that he uses in describing it are unforgettable."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's kaleidoscopic tale weaves the political intrigueof India's revolution into the fantastic story of anextraordinary boy with supernatural powers.

It's a great book that will be an enjoyable read for anyone intersted in international politics, religion, sociology, history, or simple human nature."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Expertly woven, startlingly unique, refreshingly honest, Midnight's Children won me over completely. It took a while to get the hang of Rushdie's style of writing--he requests that you pay attention--but once I got used to being challenged now and then, the pages began to turn faster and faster, and I became more and more intrigued with his story and with South Asia.Saleem Sinai is born at the very moment of India's independence, and his life is like that of his country's: ever-changing, tumultuous, loveable, corrupt, mysterious, confusing, rich, poor, at peace, at war, on and on. Plus, he and everybody else born on that same midnight have magic powers. Saleem's power, super smell, doesn't seem like much at first, but it gives him a keen telepathy and it propels him along one hell of a series of adventures. The spirit of India is everywhere in the book. Saleem is both one in a billion and one of a billion. He shows you everybody completely, and one person even more completely, and that makes for a very enlightening and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a COMMITMENT!I read it for a paper I wrote on Religious Prejudices in Indian Literature (dealing with Hinduism) along with \\"God of Small Things\\" and \\"Death of Vishnu.\\" I got only 1/2 way through when it came time to write my paper... and still I'm pressing through it.530 pages... wow.This book was a little hard to get into at first. But then pages 80-200 were incredible. When the main character \\"comes of age\\" and recieves his \\"gift\\"... the book is so intruiging and compels the reader to think of his/her own growing up experience.But as Saleem becomes an adult and goes to war, the book drags on and on for 200 more pages.I have 80 pages left, and i'm just excited to move on and read something else - not to hear the ending.This book has been beautiful... but a little too long. Just realize that you're getting yourself in for a LONG haul before starting it!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I could go on for a long time about this book. I have read a lot of books but this one is probaly the best post war book, and for sure on of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's Midnight's Children is sucessful on three levels.First, it is an enjoyable read. The imagery, style, and langauge are clearly first rate, and highly remniscent of Garcia-Marquez.Second, for a western reader with little knowledge of Pakistani-Indian history, the book provides a sweeping background of this important contentious region.Finally, the themes and ideas contained within the book, such as 'snakes and ladders' and 'midnight's children', are often insightful and novel.I was somewhat disappointed by the good-guy/bad-guy allusions to contempory politics, but overall, I felt that the knowledge and insight I gained from this book was clearly worth the effort."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"&quot;Midnight's Children&quot; was the second novel from Rushdie I read, but it remains my favorite. While my tastes in novels runs more towards Hemmingway I was unable to put this book down. I was held captive by the author's ability to include historical refferences of the birth of a nation into the complex story of Shiva and Saleem. I particularly liked the parallelism between the two boys and the gifts given to them by their midnight births. While this book can be difficult to follow due to it's historical reffernces I felt that it only added to the understanding of fate of Saleem's live. Overall I would highly recomend this book to those who have an interest in Indian History or enjoy an author with a great command of the English Lanugage."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"The book is a allegorical polemic, done in great style. It has flashes of brilliance and very clever passages. But ultimately, it fails to transcend the contortions of its plot to great, universal literature."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Certainly all the hub-bub about this Booker-Prize-winning novel is somewhat deserved -- but only somewhat. For an author as erudite as Rushdie, you do finish the book expecting something else, something *more* than this. Rushdie's precise diction, his mastery of ear and voice in English, and his bitingly dry wit all come through in this narrative, but it is clearly not his best effort. Occasionally repetitive, needlessly melodramatic at times, and not-quite certain in purpose, Midnight's Children shows flashes of brilliance and genius, but it is an uneven effort. Although anyone can see how adept Rushdie is at storytelling (and telling tales-within-tales) after a few pages, and almost anyone is certain to read this cover-to-cover, Midnight's Children has some dull, obscure, rambling moments that are noticable. The epic scale of the novel, the clever use of recent history, and the vivid portrayal of India/Pakistan/Bangladesh are all strong pluses in its favor -- Rushdie certainly deserves high praise for this work -- but he can (and has) done better. Read it, enjoy it, and then move on to his later publications."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"How do you tell the story of a country? Tell it as the story of a person. The main character and narrator of Midnight's Children, Saleem Sinia, is born (or at least someone is born, because there is a bit of a muddle) at the stroke of midnight, on August 15, 1947, the day that India gained its independence from British colonial rule. Narrating his own story, Saleem tells his country's story, and that of the other 1,001 children who were born that day, and blessed with special powers because of their special place in history --not that it helped with their survival in many cases, but then nation-building is fraught with risks.Salman Rushdie, also fortuitously born in 1947, took to heart the classic advice to budding authors: write what you know. The result is beyond history, beyond testimony; it is art. He identifies the truth in the storytelling, or as he puts it: he liberates the truth from history.The book is tightly interwoven although at times it seems loose and meandering. Saleem's faithful companion Padma speaks for the reader and urges Saleem to get back on track. My favorite aspect of the writing was the sensual quality: it is tremendously atmospheric, and permeated with considerable wry humor. The imagery is rich and resonating. Nothing is gratuitous. Every detail, every description, has either symbolic or historical relevance. This is what sets Salman Rushdie apart from writers who can spin a good yarn and keep the reader engaged, but who have no sense of literary construction, not to mention history.History is the main theme of the book; personal history, the nation's history, and the need to create one's own history. History has cracks, it comes together and disintegrates, memory is faulty. But overall, history is always invented and it depends on who is doing the telling.\\"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\\"One aspect that several people at book club mentioned as being difficult was the fact that this is the kind of book that must be read while paying close attention; you can't skim through it or else you will miss key information. Often Rushdie will offhandedly toss out a fact, or mention an event, and then 20 pages later (not just one or two pages) it will be revealed that the aforementioned detail was a key turning point in the life of a character or the country.Rushdie plays freely with the supernatural (ghosts, but are they?), oral storytelling, voices, prophecies, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu religious conventions, melding them into a unified, if surreal, whole. The priests are instructed to tell their Indian Christian converts who might be concerned about whether they will be accepted into Heaven if their skin is darks: Tell them that Jesus is blue as the \\"Hindu love-god, Krishna, is always depicted with blue skin. Tell them blue; it will be a sort of bridge between the faiths.\\" This is a Solomonic solution rife with absurdity. Upon being told that Jesus is blue, Saleem's nurse Mary Pereira is indignant, \\"You should write to Holy Father Pope in Rome, he will surely put you straight; but one does not have to be Pope to know that the mens are not ever blue!\\"The multiplicity of voices was another aspect that was problematic for some readers. Events unfold simultaneously. We get to hear different voices speaking at the same time, just as Saleem hears the voices of the midnight's children in his head. This is the literary convention that Rushdie uses to express what the main character is experiencing, as well as representing the conflicting forces in the country.Midnight's Children is a book that is epic heroic, historic, and yet completely human and accessible, because for all its scope and grandeur, it is a story about life, as it unfolds and is told from the perspective of a fictitious narrator who reveals his world as he sees it, with his inconsistencies, frustrations, and memory lapses, but with the honesty of an inhabitant of the world he describes. He is no stranger to this land. And even though the readers of this book may come from widely divergent cultural backgrounds, the underlying humanity of the story is universal.This is one of the great novels of the 20th century, and the Man Booker Prize committee agrees: in 1993 Salman Rushdie was awarded the Man Booker Prize as the best book selected in the past 25 years. It is also one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"It was stunning, eye-opening, mind-boggling. Loved it. Love it. Still in my top five of all time."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"One of the major burdens one faces when watching \\"Citizen Kane\\" in the 21st century is having to determine whether or not it is the greatest film of all time; similarly, reading Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" carries with it the additional burdent of whether or not it is worthy of being perhaps the most praised novel of the last 40 years (winner not only of the 1981 Booker Prize, but both the 25th and 40th anniversary Booker Prizes). As with \\"Kane\\", it's a question best put out of mind, in my opinion; better to try and assess and appreciate the book on its own terms. This was the novel that made Rushdie famous (though not the one that got the hit put out on him by the Supreme Leader), and it is indeed well worth reading. Some spoilers follow.The high concept in \\"Midnight's Children\\" is that, in the first hour of Indian independence in 1947, 1001 children are born with special abilities (some of them fantastical, some only mildly weird and not especially useful) - the Midnight's Children, as one of them, our protagonist Saleem Sinai, calls them. Saleem, whose ability is telepathy, is one of the most powerful, and the one who locates the others. But this is not the story you might think it was just from looking at the premise, which is one of the issues some people take with the book. The children are pretty far in the background, for the most part, one or two exceptions aside; indeed, you could rewrite this novel to remove the fantasy aspects and I don't think you would change anything fundamental about it. This is perhaps a bit disappointing on one level - when the government at the end comes down hard on the Children, fearing them as potential rival 'gods', it comes across particularly strangely since they've been around for 30 years and haven't really done anything of overt significance. But then, given that Rushdie is making a bitter attack on the policies of the government during the Emergency, perhaps that is meant to heighten the pointless barbarity of it.Rather than being about the children as a group, this is really the story of one Indian family over the course of three generations, and how the tumultous history of India in the years from the 1910s to the 1970s affects them. Our narrator Saleem begins with the story of his grandparents, moving to his parents, and only gradually do we arrive at the moment of his own birth, and his life story. As Rushdie himself notes in the foreword included in this anniversary edition, most of the figures in his family are based to some extent on people in his life (though not too much; the author notes he was annoyed that his real father was unnecessarily (in his view) offended by the fictional Ahmed Sinai). Rushdie's writing style is quite marvelously musical prose, with numerous interseting stylistic points, and he creates a very interesting narrator/narrative interacton - there's plenty of metatext and unreliable narrative employed (my personal favourite being when one chapter concludes with the unglamorous death of the main antagonist, only for the narrator to confess in the next chapter that he has no idea what happened to the villain, and is only vainly hoping that he died). I'm not normally a fan of magical realism (the works of Garcia Marquez never particularly impressed me), but Rushdie makes it work.Though perhaps not the story one might expect, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's prose is dense, filled with great writing and magical imagery. The problem is that there's no real plot to make it chug along, so it's a very long read. I ended up skimming the second half of the book, so that I could brag that I finished it."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This book took me a while to read. It is very wordy and a bit of a challenge, but if you are up for a challenge this book is definitely worth reading. The story is so different from anything I had ever read before, and it gives such a detailed depiction of India and her history."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first Rushdie book I've read, and I am completely blown away. An autobiographic account of an unlikely protagonist whose life is intertwined with the destiny of his country, Midnight's Children is an all-encompassing account of post-independence India, its people, cultures and politics. An eclectic cast of gifted children, army generals, impotent husbands, religious zealots, movie actresses play out their extraordinary parts in the tranquil valley of Kashmir, \\"magical\\" slums of Old Delhi, an oppulent British estate in Bombay, the enchanted jungles of Sundarban and military encampments in Pakistan, connecting dots that bring out a picture which is astounding and surreal even to a native like me."},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I don't have the time or inclination to go into a long rant about what makes this book so outstanding, but I will say that it is by far the best book I've ever picked up. I learned a lot about India and its turbulent history, but that was just an added bonus. As with any great novel, some of the characters in the book reminded me of myself, and taught me some things about myself, but that too was just a bonus. Rushdie's writing style is very pleasing and his methods of storytelling are far better than anything I've ever read. Those are the things that make this book so great. You simply MUST read it!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"One of Rushdie's best works and far more accessible to those without knowledge of Southasian history and Islam. The plot is one of the most unique and interesting I've come across in a long time. It is a fairly easy read and a book I think everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I had this book around the house for years, and, frankly, was afraid to read it. For some reason, I thought that Salman Rushdie was one of those &quot;literary&quot; writers that could only be appreciated by English majors. I was fascinated by his life of exile and respected him, but could never bring myself to reading him.Then, my son David and my wife Mary both read the book, along with some of David's friends. They all raved about it. Since my family knows my literary tastes better than anyone and were so insistent I would like the book, I had no choice but to give it a try.Once, again, they were right. The book was a joy to read, and far more accessible, interesting, and funny than I had would have expected. The narration by Saleem Sinai is priceless. The story is told mostly chronologically with just enough tangential stream of consciousness ramblings and foretellings to stay interesting. The premise (the tale of those 1001 children born within the first hour of India's independence) was a stroke of genius. The fact that I learned a lot about Indian and Pakistani history was a bonus.The only downside was that the story began to slow down a bit at the end, but since it was essentially the story of the birth of a nation (two, actually), the author couldn't possibly be expected to keep up the fever pitch he began at. All in all, it was a great read and a great story and I, for one, will be sure to read more of Mr. Rushdie's work!!"},{"Title":"Midnight's Children","review":"I can't compete with all the wonderful reviews listed below. Just a few of my thoughts on the book: It's one of the very best I've ever read. It's poetry at its best. It's full of magical ideas and the first half of the book might just be the best part of a book I've ever read. I was a tiny bit disappointed with the second half which was still great but lacked a bit of the magic with which the novel started (something I've noticed in the other two books of Rushdie I've finished, The Moor's last Sigh (also excellent) and The Ground Beneath Her Feet, good but not up to par to the other two, as well)(I never got through more than 10 pages of the Satanic Verses which was too complicated for me).

Yellow Robe's collection of plays. Through two women characters__one American Indian and one white__the playwright eloquently delineates the profound lack of understanding and awareness of American Indians on the part of the &quot;white&quot; American society ( which, in my opinion, is still in the throes of narcissicisstic adolescence as a society). Through this four-scene play about the relationship between two women__ one Assiniboine Sioux and the other of WASP heritage__the story of a tenuous friendship unfolds. Every time I read The Star Quilt I weep at the tragedy of non-Native Americans who have objectified, defied, and betrayed American Indians (and many other &quot;alien&quot; cultures) to this very day. The miracle is that many American Indian tribes today are growing stronger in their cultural practices and beliefs in the wake of &quot;white&quot; American society's shallow materialism. William S. Yellow Robe communicates this through realistic dialogue in a play that ends with humanity and insight. The other plays in the collection, Where the Pavement Ends, hold powerful messages of American Indian values such as respect for and preservation of all life. They are told with humor, whimsy, creativity__and a vein that runs through all of William J. Yellow Robe's works: humanity."},{"Title":"Where the Pavement Ends: Five Native American Plays (American Indian Literature & Critical Studies)","review":"This book is a nice collection of plays by Mr. Yellowrobe; often addressing serious cultural issues, sometimes with a comical twist.

The story's UFOlogy is a cut-and-paste pastiche of the least credible \\"government insider\\" stories of the last twenty years, with barely any connection to actual facts concerning the subject. Given that this is an entertainment and not a factual primer, this would not be so bad in and of itself, if the plot was at least captivating - but it is far too episodic to manage that.The characters, though well-drawn, are all too briefly utilized to sustain interest. The aliens are conversely very poorly drawn, and barely explained. When we discover what their purpose is, it isn't very credible or satisfying, and the actual climax is so lame and unbelievable as to leave the reader groaning. Anyone whose tolerance is low for Steven Spielberg's \\"Wonder Children\\" should definitely avoid this one - it comes to a childishly simplistic finish.If you're looking for stellar entertainment, wait for the miniseries - though, personally, I'm glad I read this first, as it spares me twenty agonizing hours in front of the tube - which will, at least, no doubt have eye-popping special effects.Without saying too much (in case you're planning on going ahead and reading it anyway, or don't want the miniseries spoiled), this will appeal to fans of the series Dark Skies or the weaker \\"shapeshifting alien\\" episodes of The X-Files, but not to anyone else.It's coming - and you have been warned."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"I saw the miniseries \\"Taken\\" on SciFi and loved every minute of it.

The magical essence you get from watching the show is just not there. The characters are untangible voids, whereas in the series they emit floods of emotions. The scenes, especially the beginning, are rushed and skimpy, missing out on important details and vital information about these extra-terrestrials. All the events just rushed out all at once and in such a small amount of time that in the end I was left confused and disappointed. Allie's wise antics and philosophies are omitted. The ending was not nearly as moving as the series. I hardly finished the first paragraph and I already fell asleep. Do yourself a favor. Don't be a chump like me and buy this time waster.

The end is poor, and expected, and even when I don't read SCI FI very often, I can see that the end of the book was forced, probably the author was running out of time, and he have to take the book to the print shop.

(Perhaps they held back on that so they can publish yet another tie-in book entitled &quot;The Philosophy of Allie.&quot;) Additionally, the book lacked much of the character development that I enjoyed in the series. Important exchanges between characters were simply deleted, like Allie's healing of Charlie -- the point in the series where everyone realizes that Allie *isn't* just a little girl -- as well as the video message from Chet to Mary, in which she realizes that he really did love her. And to top that off, the entire END is missing! Allie simply walks off into the sunset to join her alien kin. Without Lisa's discovery of the lone star necklace, it just wasn't the same.I'm going to wait for the DVD and hope the special features will make up for this terrible excuse of a novelization."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"On television, Taken was a miniseries that lasted for ten nights. Ten one-hour long episode. What writer Thomas Cook failed to realize is that you cannot cram ten hours of material in 350 pages. The book feels over crowded and distant. The characters come and go so quickly that they all become paper-thin cutouts. What must have looked good on television looks horrible on the page.It's no secret now that Taken is about alien invasions. The story starts at the very beginning, with Roswell, and ends in the present, with the last final invasion. Through this period, we meet two families. Two of these families are abductees, and the last family is the obligatory evil-military guys that are so typical and predictable that they are no fun as villains.As we move through six decades, we see these families battling with the different invasions and with the fear of being 'taken'.But in a television drama, you can move fast in time like that. TV is based on dialogue, not prose. But you can't do this with a novel. If you keep moving quickly from one place to another, then the story begins feeling all over the place and quite disjointed. And Cook does nothing to try and link up these scenes with prose. Brief sentences are all that can be found between the overly abundant dialogue.I did like the plot, but maybe it would have been better had each episode become a book in itself, instead of trying to cram all ten episodes in one book and use only the dialogue, linking them with brief sentences like 'and then they were in the kitchen' or 'and then he was in the houspital'. As a matter of fact, the words 'and then' or 'and so' appear so often that, by the end, you just can't stand it anymore.Thomas H. Cook is a well-liked mystery author. He should probably stick with his own original material. Taken is a very incompetant attempt at adapting a very good series, one that leaves you completely dissatisfied and boring."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"This is a good book, a bit short for a 20 hour movie, but still good"},{"Title":"Taken","review":"A twenty hour mini-series is difficult to adapt as a novel. I think Cook did an adequate job, but the book varies little from the series so if you've seen it--- there's not much point in reading the book. There are other variations out there in novel form on this subject matter that take it to a deeper and more intriguing level. I'm anxiously awaiting the publication of Area 51 The Truth right after Christmas-- the 7th and concluding book in the Area 51 series by Robert Doherty. You might want to check out his take on the alien angle and conspiracies."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"My review is simple. I've read and liked all of Cook's other books. This one is absolute garbage. It's contrived. It's boring. The ending is boring. I disliked it intensely. It was a waste of my time. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"When I found out that Thomas H. Cook had written the book version of a soon to be released SF miniseries I was intrigued and couldn't wait to read it. Thomas H. Cook is the author of fifteen novels, including The Chatham School Affair, winner of the Edgar Award for Best Novel; Instruments of Night; Breakheart Hill; Mortal Memory, among others. Those have been some of the most interesting mysteries I have ever read. However, this book reads just like a TV miniseries, the characters are wooden without any real emotion and the events very predictable. So my question is why Cook even bothered doing this project???"},{"Title":"Taken","review":"I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the series and thought the book would be a great supplement. I hoped the book would expand off the series. No depth to the characters or the story line. Wait for the DVD."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"It's hard to imagine that any review, positive or negative, will have any impact on the sales of this trite print-version of the Spielberg-branded mini-series. Tsave the time of some Thomas Cook fans, I offer this:Other reviewers have given plausible explanations for the barely one-dimensional characters and blitzkrieg pacing of the book; there is also an appalling lack intrigue or suspense: presentation of what may be a startling visual in the mini-series of a crash site is delivered without build-up or fanfare, dropped in the reader's lap like an unbuttered piece of toast.Consistency is painfully weak: what is described as a &quot;treacherous&quot; descent into a gorge is, in a page or two, capable of allowing a &quot;vast array&quot; of investigating staff and heavy equipment to arrive &quot;within minutes&quot;; an object described as larger than a B-29 is, again within a page or two, being carted off by a truck.There's no examination of any character's internal world; rather, we get bare descriptions of personal transitions: &quot;...he couldn't accept that it was a dream no matter what she told him&quot; is followed a paragraph later with, &quot;He...believed that it was only a dream.&quot;Really, transitions simply don't exist; characters move emotionally from antipathy to gratitude, physically from office to crash site, within the space of a sentence-stopping period. Rambling sentences worthy of the Bulwar Litton contest, but with poorer use of commas, give us our only serious ratiocination as we try to ferret out meaning.If only I could give it &quot;0 stars&quot;...unless you simply must have the complete Spielberg brand, or the complete X-Files knock-off, or the complete repackaging of encounters library, pass."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"A very quick, entertaining read. Cook said in an interview he was concerned with the pace of the novel, and pace is sure not a problem. It zips along. The problem is, it zips too quickly. In novelizing Leslie Boehm's epic teleplay, Cook adapted the equivalent of 10 TV-movies ... and rather than expanding upon the material (at least somewhat, as is the wont of most novelizations), he has streamlined -- summarized non-essential scenes, dropped tertiary characters, etc. At times the book reads like a riveting &quot;treatment,&quot; a story expertly compacted, rather than a &quot;real&quot; novel. And I have a feeling that TAKEN might have benefited from allowing the story to breathe more -- not sprawl, but allow the characters to be more than essences and archetypes.That said, I don't know that Mr. Cook is at fault. His contract may have mandated getting the final product down to a limited word count ... these novelization gigs don't come without strings, and the final drafts have to be approved by the film's honchos as well as its editor. If a distillation was, in fact, his job, he has done it well. Whatever else is true, he keeps the tale interesting and taut ... and the book is never dull. (There's no time for it to be!)"},{"Title":"Taken","review":"Although I did not see the series, I gather from the book jacket that Taken was based on one. Whatever the quality of the acting may have been, the quality of the written work is quite good. It's not exactly major literature, but it definitely has major entertainment value-and how many of us would actually sit down with Tolstoy for an afternoon without a grade point average hanging over us?The characters are made multidimensional through a series of individual vignettes that carry the reader through the lives and interactions of several people in at least three families. The perspective changes in each of these vignettes, which allows the reader to take in more information than any one of the characters has, much like the diaries in Dracula do. The tale itself is not given in any great depth. There is no build up based entirely on the emotive impact of colorful imagery; the narrative is primarily responsible for giving information on the settings and that alone. The mini-chapters last mere paragraphs and the drama takes place predominantly in dialogue rather than descriptive form and are designed to engage the reader in the lives and personalities of the characters. This probably reflects the cinematic venue of the original work where The Character is everything. This makes the story a rapid read and difficult to put down; I finished it in a matter of hours despite multiple interruptions.I wasn't quite as enamored with the ending, though. It was as if the author enjoyed tailoring his characters and telling the story of their experiences, but couldn't find as tailored an ending for the work. It just sort of stops, as though he wasn't sure what great message he was trying to convey. There doesn't seem to be any impacting moral or definitive statement to be made, no real purpose to the story that would bring the whole to a conclusion. The little girl brings all the pieces together, but that is all that is accomplished. The only surprise is that there isn't a surprise. (I wondered if the little girl wouldn't turn out to be the second coming of Christ, or something similar). I suspect that this too is a function of the story's original starting point. A series based on a collection of characters and their interactions isn't really designed to have a \\"point\\" only to entertain and keep the audience returning every week. Although there is an effort to provide continuity from week to week, the end of the series is not necessarily designed into the project from inception. One presumes the authors hope it goes on for some time. Certainly endings can be designed to meet the need when a series ends, but that usually arises when the need for it does. In fact the finale for a popular series can be a media event.The book is a quick and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"I have to admit I was really disappointed with this book, the series I loved and got on DVD as soon as it came out.Fortunately for me this book was another thrift shop purchase for under two dollars or I would have seriously thought about going back to the bookstore and demanding a refund.Considering this book is supposed to reflect a ten part series with LOADS of characters, their lives and times from the 1950s, this book does not even SCRATCH the surface, in fact it stops dead at crucial points which explain everything about why Allie was so important not only to the Aliens but to humanity too.Another bone of contention for me is the ending in the book; it ends so abruptly, you are left looking at the last page and thinking, \\"Eh? Isn't there supposed to more?\\" We all remember how Allie had to leave earth, that she wanted to stay with her parents Lisa and Charlie but humanity was not ready for someone like her and she would be safer with her alien relatives but in the book, we don't EVEN get a taster of this, one minute she is talking to her mom, the next....well there is no next minute, that is my point!I was so frustrated with this book, and the only reason it is getting two stars is the cover art is really nice and the blurb on the back reads quite well, shame about the rest of the book though.This book's contents is not worth the paper it is written on, which is a real shame because it could have been a cracking good read given an author who knew what he was doing, obviously Mr Cook didn't know what he was doing and thus spoilt it all for readers across the globe and if there be any aliens out there for them too!"},{"Title":"Taken","review":"I was completely hooked on the SCIFI epic miniseries event, TAKEN. I received the book as a Christmas present, and I read through it in two days. It almost mirrors the series itself, although, I was disappointed to find that the book dropped several good characters and skimmed through several scenes that were in the series. I noticed that some scenes were altered. For example, in Alaska 1970, Sam Crawford, Dr. Powell, Buzz, and Sarah split up to search for the missing student Daryl in the series, in the book they searched for Wendy. The book lacked many details, but I was rather surprised that Cook managed to squeeze 20 hours of television drama into a 355 page book pretty well. The characters certainly needed to be explained more, and after I read the book I was still asking questions that I thought would be answered. I just hope there's a sequel, and maybe someone else can patch up the holes that many people have given the Taken novelization a thumbs down for. It was adequate work, but improvement was needed."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"Please do not read this book. Please. Doing so would only encourage more soulless novelizations of tv shows.

For you people who want to know what happened to Allie at the end, take a look at the title of the book. My only problem with the book was the grey's motives. The explanation for the abductions was absurd. For anyone who isn't a hard-core, let's-all-go-to-Roswell UFO fan, I highly reccommend this book.

The beginning chapters go a little too fast and don't convey quite enough information, however. The final chapters, on the other hand, bring the story to a climax and reasonable conclusion.I managed to see large portions, but not all, of the tv miniseries a few years ago, so I thought that reading the novel through from start to finish would prepare me better when I obtain the DVD so that I can view the entire series.All in all, this is a worthy read, although I can't say that I feel that many of the characters were truly developed in quite the depth that they could have been."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"I read the book before watching the movie, and I must say that it is almost like reading the movies script.

I mean the plot has extreme potential, don't get me wrong. But each scene/chapter/whatever is so short, that by the time you get the picture as to what's going on, the scene ends and you fall right off the edge. I couldn't tell you who any of the characters in this book are or even what time period they're from. This book is all over the place with times, action, and sadness all mixed up together.

I couldn't wait till the next episode would air, and I bought the DVD box set after only seeing the first four episodes and watched all ten episodes in less than a week. Since I liked the mini-series, I thought that I would give this book a try, knowing that the ending was different becuase of the other reviews that I read before buying the book. After reading the book, I would have to say that I liked the mini-series much better than I did the book. The book skips scenes that I thought were important in the mini-series (Allie healing Charlie's bullet wound) or were combined with previous scenes. The book dose not even tell you that Allie healed Charlie's bullet wound (as stated above) or even that Allie knew that Charlie was her dad until the part when Tom makes his apperance near the end. The reader does not even know how Charlie got out of the office all right after being shot. One of the weaker novelizations that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"Duh. The ending on Taken: the novel by Thomas Cook is different from the ending on the tv mini-series by Steven Speilberg. I think that what people don't nottice is that the book is copy writen and came out somewhere from the end of october to november (according to the copy rights on the fourth page of the book). This means that the ending and the character development would be different because it would be like giving away the story before the series comes out. I am sure that alot of people may not have been so attracted to the series if they did not make it a little different."},{"Title":"Taken","review":"For anyone who has read this book, you have to admit, it has it's good parts.

I also found the writing engaging, informative and succinct.I am somewhat surprised by the reviewer who was disturbed by the mention of celebrity film actors who frequented the Hotel Del Monte. Whether any of us likes it or not, these icons of the film industry are woven into the tapestry of American life and, therefore, are part of our history. Since the patronage of film actors was hardly the focus of the book, I found Ms. Cain's inclusion of a few photographs of early screen actors an honest representation of the variety of clientele one might expect to see at the hotel.I recommend this book to those who would like to see wonderful images of the Hotel Del Monte that are not just the common postcard photos. Of particular interest to this garden lover, are the pictures and descriptions of the meticulously and laboriously planted garden areas that must have been quite a visual treat to the hotel's visitors."},{"Title":"Monterey's Hotel del Monte (CA) (Images of America)","review":"In response to Ms. Bogg's review, I am well aware that the Naval Postgraduate School does own photos of the Hotel del Monte.

It's soundly researched and for those of us who thirst for more information, it has a valuable bibliography at the back.I'm not sure why another reviewer thought that the Monterey Naval Post Graduate School resources where ignored, since the author used several of their images (including the inimitable one of Amelia Earhart) and specifically thanks them in the acknowledgments.If you're interested in California history, and beautiful images of a vanished way of life, you need to buy this book!"},{"Title":"Monterey's Hotel del Monte (CA) (Images of America)","review":"After reading the preview copy of this book, I found that is has everthing you would want to know about the history of the Hotel.

Not only does she make a number of noteworthy points, she uses a ton of textual evidence to back up her statements and (and this was the clincher for me) she doesn't just look at Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, but also Edith Wharton, Zora Neale Hurston, Kate Chopin and others. Highly recommended for scholars in the field and laypersons who enjoy the Modernists."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"Scholars have long known the backstory to Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's famous collection of fairy tales. Despite the legends, the brothers were not itinerant travelers collecting the tales from the German peasantry. (Unfortunately, this legend is soon to be perpetuated to a larger audience by Terry Gilliam's entirely fictional film, The Brothers Grimm.) In reality, the brothers mostly collected the tales from their sister, Lotte, and through her circle of friends and associates. The brothers then continously edited the tales for several years until we have the versions of Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin, Puss in Boots, and many other tales that we know today.Most of this backstory, especially that of the women tellers, has been scattered about in strictly academic works in English and mostly German. Valerie Paradiz has synthesized this material into one cohesive and highly readable book. While we have the stories of the women and the changes made to their tales, we also receive a sympathetic view of the two brothers, struggling to support a family hit by several tragedies by doing work they loved and valued. Neither the brothers' contributions nor those of the women collaborators are diminished.While the book has an academic bent, it works best as general nonfiction and is highly recommended for a much larger audience. Paradiz's writing style is warm and approachable, making details interesting instead of trivial. A familiarity with the Grimms' tales is helpful, but not necessary, since she provides enough information about each to support her prose. Consequently, an interesting slice of German and folklore history is made accessible in a deceptively short book. Footnotes and a biliography are offered in the back of the book for further reading and research."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"Valerie Paradiz's book, \\"Clever Maids,\\" is an excellent history of the Grimm Brothers and their lifelong work cultivating folk tales. I wish I had this book in college, because I think it is a first-rate story that deserves to be shared with the masses.Over the years, the Brothers Grimm have had their singular lives wrapped up in fictional renditions that border on fairy tales themselves. In Drew Barrymore's 1998 movie, Ever After, it is the Grimms who visit an aging dowager queen in France, so she can tell them about her grandmother, the original \\"Cinderella.\\" Then there is the wildly fictional movie of the same name about The Brothers Grimm that creates them into gallant, manly adventurers who stumble upon fairy tales come to life and have to defeat them, etc. With all of the myth surrounding the men, it is pleasant to see a compact, historical accurate biography of the Grimm Brothers and their fairy tale compilations.The author not only unearthed many interesting facts about where the fairy tales the Grimms took down came from, but her smooth writing talents combined with an academic eye allowed us distinctive, unique insights into their lives and their feelings in relation to the world around them. Though the title is slightly misleading - we don't learn about the way these women might have thought and felt like we do the Grimms - the story itself, and the people involved, are riveting.Historians might have known and written the full story about the creation of the Grimms' Fairytales before, but this is the first work that has made that information accessible, readable, and, quite frankly, thrilling to read."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"Clever Maids is a decent read, about the female sources of the fairy tales we're accustomed to attributing to the Brothers Grimm, and has some biographical interest. But the author seems to have an axe to grind, which can get annoying. She keeps noting that the Grimms never thanked their female sources by name in their publications. Surely it would've been nice if they had, but I wonder if such public acknowledgment was really the custom in the early 1800s. The Grimms were folklorists--they never claimed to be the tales' original authors.Still, nice to know a bit more about the Grimms and their process for collecting and setting down stories. The book is less interesting for its analysis of the tales, which is (to say say the least) not subtle. For fairy tale analysis, I prefer Maria Tatar's Off With Their Heads."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"Clever Maids by Valerie Paradiz is an important contribution to Grimm scholarship, and while Ms Paradiz certainly has credentials as a Germanist, she seems more interested in advancing a feminist point of view than truly following the material where it leads her. She deserves credit for using the Grimm correspondance to correctly attribute the female friends of the Grimms as the immediate sources of many of the famous Kinder und Hausm&auml;rchen, but this, as she notes in the prologue (p. xv) was already known to German researchers. What she seems to want to imply, but never outright states, is that the women the Grimms collected from may actually have composed some of the stories when prompted by Jacob and Wilhelm to tell stories from their childhood. Instead she gives lip service to the \\"oral tradition,\\" while seeming to undermine it at every turn. Again and again she draws comparisons with the lives of the Grimms and their female contributors, always with an observation on the oppressed status of women in 19th Century Germany.Consequently, I find her devotion to German literary scholarship just a little questionable. I recall hearing a radio interview with her on the local NPR affiliate, and she consistantly \\"americanized\\" the German names of the figures in her book, as if she was afraid she would lose potential readers by appearing too arcane.Another (small) disappointing point of her research is her apparent unfamiliarity with scripture and the influence of scripture on the stories. On page 135, she states, \\"In the gospels, (St. Anne) is the mother of the Virgin Mary.\\" In fact, the mother of Mary is neither named nor even mentiioned in either Matthew or Luke; the name \\"Anna\\" comes from non-canonical sources, and is most likely an imitation of Hannah, the mother of the Old Testament prophet Samuel, whose infancy narrative closely parralels that of Christ and John the Baptist. Furthermore, when discussing the typical Grimm plotline \\"of older brother(s) versus younger,\\" (p. 107) she strains to make a biographical comparison to Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother Ferdinand, while totally ignoring the more obvious parallel to Joseph and Jacob in the book of Genesis.Nonetheless, Ms. Paradiz makes many valid points and certainly has performed a valuable service in bringing the real Grimms' lives into popular readership just when an excrable Hollywood movie has appropriated their names for the sake of brainless entertainment."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"This book is a great read for adults but some editing is needed when telling the tales to kids."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"Valerie Paradiz is a feminist of the 'women can do no wrong, men can do no right' school of thought, and this attitude pervades her story of the brothers Grimm and the women who supplied some of their stories.She critcises the Grimm brothers for not giving enough credit to the women who supplied many of the stories in the first volume of their famous tales, but then she grumbles about them giving too much credit to one particular woman in the second volume of the tales.She criticies the princess's father in one tale for making his daughter keep a promise she has made, and she disapproves of the father of one of the Grimms' friends for punishing his daughter for stealing from her sister and then lying about it. Aren't men brutes? Why should girls not be allowed to steal, lie and break promises with impunity?The book is entertaining enough as a factual account of the lives of the Grimm brothers, how they compiled their stories, and some of the women who supplied a lot of the stories, but the constant feminist carping makes it somewhat trying to read."},{"Title":"Clever Maids: The Secret History of The Grimm Fairy Tales","review":"The Brothers Grimm were not nice little tales of sweetness and light like Hans Christian Andersen. They used raunchy humor, sexual and physical violence, and gender inequity as a standard--far above the heads of most childrne. As were the sex scenes in the movie, 'The Parade of the Penguins.' Thank God.Fairy tales have always been transmitted orally from the Middle Ages through antiquity. That is the way our Appalachian ballads and tales ae being done today, and much is lost by not being written down. They've consisently been about good and evil, rich and poor, heroic and helpless, and humanity and inhumanity.Their first published fairy tale was THE FROG PRINCE. One we will always remember. From the beginning the tales were too vulgar and violent for young minds. They used their first published book CHILDREN'S AND HOUSEHOLD FAIRY TALES in 1812 as a literary privilege, to see what they could get away with, and do so with much aplomb. This was the age of German Romanticism and the Napoleonic Wars. Goethe was at his peak and 'men of letters' were interested in reviving old sagas from earlier times. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were intent on preserving the German past. They set out to unearth every folk story ever told in the German tongue, and their first book became a modern classic, coming in second only to the Bible in those days.A history of their heritage and lives is presented here as proof positive that they did indeed change the literary world. Interspersed with some of their tales is the story behind them and why the brothers felt as they did. That makes this a 'classic' of a classic."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I came to Moby Dick through the big read (.com), a British venture that saw celebrities from the British PM to John Waters each reading a chapter of the famous book. After a few online chapters I wanted to read it for myself.It started off well enough...There is more than one narrator in Moby Dick, and I prefer the first one, Ishmael. When Ishmael speaks we're either looking for a whaler, or we're aboard the Pequod looking for, and killing whales. The reader is right amongst it, and the story is compelling. Melville sets the scene, establishes the characters, and brings the action to life. You get a real sense for the life aboard a whaler, and even a sense for the suffering of the much maligned whale. Unfortunately, as with &#34;Three Men In A Boat&#34; the actual story is rather thin, so the novel is rounded out by digression, and Moby Dick digresses on an epic scale. The big read sought to prove that Moby Dick was relevant to the Internet Age, and I wholeheartedly agree: If you like reading with a dictionary by your side, flipping from your novel to the dictionary, Moby Dick and the Internet (and Google) are a match made in literary heaven. I personally don't mind it, up to a point, but after that, I'd prefer that the author did a better job of writing his context into the story. Still, there's a lot out there about this book, and whatever Melville mentions can be Googled, often referenced to the book.Like many readers, I hated the classification of the whales chapter (by book sizes, no less). So much so I couldn't get over it, and finally went looking for explanations for it. As it turns out, it's not as idiotic as it seems (as I suspected) and has a lot to do with Melvilles commentary on Slavery (in an era after Britain had outlawed it, and was trying to stamp out the trade, only to run up against the US, whose flag was openly used as a flag of convenience to allow slavers to escape); But, even though I now understood the chapter, it still wasn't as &#34;hilarious&#34; as one english major insisted. Language abuse. Humorous, perhaps.LIfe is short and there's so much to read. I'd love to take a Moby Dick class, but if it were up to me---If I were you, and you were feeling a bit culturally lightweight at the start of the new year---I'd read &#34;Two Years Before The Mast&#34;. Set in a period close to that of Moby Dick, and about life on board a sailing ship, it is just as well written as the whaling portions of Moby Dick, just as evocative, and compelling, and you get the bonus of a trip up the coast of Mexican colonial California; stumbling over the slippery, algae covered rocks of San Pedro's mudflats, before it was blasted into what would become the nation's busiest port; surfing a long boat through the waves to land at Santa Barbara; and a glimpse into the height of the cow hide trade, and how it operated from ship to shore. A much shorter, more direct and consistent novel.Moby DIck is interesting, most of the time, but it's a lot of work, wading through the clumsy prose and putting up with a narrator (other than Ishmael) that often seems a bit too self satisfied and cocky given his weak anchor in science. It isn't going anywhere, clearly, and you never know when life will suddenly slow down and leave you with nothing to do, but shy of that I'd prefer to read something better."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I read this for a college English class. The cover is beautiful, the font and pages are all great quality. The illustrations in the back are a great bonus. I loved the content of the book itself, but the format and presentation of this book make the experience of reading it that much better."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"The centerpiece of the story is a white sperm male known as Moby-Dick who had taken the leg of the Pequod's captain, Ahab, years before. The crew of social misfits and outcasts consent to Ahab's obsessive mission to destroy this murderous whale at all costs. The story is told by Ishmael, the lone survivor of the journey.The symbolism of the novel runs as deep as the Pacific itself. While Ishmael is adept at navigating the capriciousness of the story's vicissitudes and adapting favorably to each new experience along the way, Ahab remains immutably negative, convinced that each new trial is yet another personal attack upon his cursed life. The whale takes on the personified significance of all the world's troubles, and in Moby-Dick, Ahab makes these practically assailable, a classic example of fanatical scapegoating.The novel is also highly referential: Ahab, so-named for a biblical king; Ishmael, allusion to the biblical orphan; Pequod, similar to the Pequot Native Americans of Eastern Connecticut who were decimated by colonists; and Moby-Dick, alike the infamous albino whale of the Pacific, Mocha Dick.In a way, it is also self-referential to the author's own writing. For Melville, a late-starter to the literary world, writing became a quest which gave his life purpose and direction. Like Ahab, his writing could take on a mania of its own, but like Ishmael, he would change and adapt with each new book he would read. And reading in order to write would provide a rhythm in his life like the whale's breathing. Friends of Melville's remark that writing Moby-Dick proved to be the happiest years of his life. It's truly a writer's book on many levels."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Just want to add, beyond any comment on the material inside, that the binding is horrible for Penguin paperbacks, meaning that the pages are not evenly cut and stick in all directions at the end of the page starting from the glued part. Every Penguin paperback I've ordered from Amazon suffers from this..."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I'd heard rumors about the book before I read it. That it was drawn out and overlong. That it was bizarre in its construction and characterization. That it senselessly detailed the intricacies of whaling to a microscopic degree. Having read the book, all of these are true, but they are by no means condemnations. It is a book ahead of its time--perhaps still ahead of our time. Take, for example, those first hundred pages which so beautifully detail the relationship of Ishmael with Queequeg; this section is intriguing and instructive and startling at once, displaying homoerotic overtones that would shock today, more than 150 years after its publication. This is a book that depicts the entirety of life: religion, relationships, occupation, philosophy, etc. There is nothing untouched in this novel, and it provides insight into all.Reading Moby-Dick, I had an experience similar to that which I felt while reading Heart of Darkness for the first time. I find them strikingly similar in construction. For Conrad, it was the jungle; for Melville, the water. The protagonists of each are drawn inexplicably forward, many times against their own will. The psychological and philosophical implications of these narratives are truly enlightening.Indeed, the language is sometimes difficult to wrap your mind around--especially some of the whaling dialect that arises in the characters extended soliloquies. But this is a book that shouldn't be missed. I was startled to conclude that the cetology and whaling minutiae did not distract me from the experience but focused me on the events that followed; for all of its eight hundred pages, there is not a superfluous word. And when the novel reaches its beautiful conclusion, it is a dramatic and brilliantly paced even that creates a bit of a whaler in each reader."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I just wanted to put in my two cents here. (...) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive \`readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books.

Because of my condition, while reading it I suddenly realized -- and I mean KNEW -- that Melville was afflicted with depression. I still remember the passage, Ahab, watching the sunset, thinking to himself:Chapter xxxvii - SUNSET (page 165) \\"Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise!\\"And that exactly described my condition. \\"Gifted with the high perception,\\" I perceived the total, utter pointlessness and meaninglessness of -- not only my life -- but of existence itself! And so I could no longer enjoy the things of the world that other, less \\"insightful\\" mortals could. I later researched the life of Herman Melville afterward, and it turns out that he did indeed suffer from depression!I heartily recommend reading \\"Moby Dick.\\" And if you're \\"lucky\\" enough to read it while clinically depressed, you may find it has a lot to say to you that may prove valuable. And you'll learn things from it -- many things -- that someone who is not experiencing depression could not possibly understand."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Forget everything you have heard or think you know about this book. What it decidedly is not is the story of a one-legged madman pursuing a whale for revenge.Do not give this book to high-school students. Have them read THE AENEID, the prophet Isaiah, a few scenes of HAMLET, so that when they are forty and MOBY-DICK falls into their hands, they will recognize at least some of its underpinnings.MOBY-DICK is as weird and far-ranging as Scripture, and stakes out the same terrority, namely heaven, hell, earth, mortality, joy, flesh, eternity, the soul. Ahab is no more mad than Edmund in KING LEAR: the real madman of MOBY-DICK is Melville himself. But he can only have been unhinged by an angel, so sweeping is the power of his imagination.It's perverse to look on the shape and construction of MOBY-DICK as radical, innovative, foreshadowing such moderns as Joyce; it's like calling Revelations \\"innovative.\\" Melville has no such aim and has no interest in technique. Indeed, he has few \\"literary\\" virtues. His language is dense, syntactically clumsy, exhausting, over-precise to the point there's no telling what precisely is being said. No human being could speak the dialogue that erupts from the mouths of its personages: it's like opera, or the dialogue in PARADISE LOST. It has a more urgent, essential motive than speech. It's the soul speaking.MOBY-DICK is nothing so trivial as a literary experiment. It aims for wholeness, concreteness; it wants to be about everything, inside and out, and its eye is everywhere. Melville senses the sun and stars are part of his story, and equally so the bones and guts of a whale, so he makes them characters. When the convention of the first-person narrator becomes too restrictive, he lets Ishmael lapse, absorbing him and all of the Pequod into a single, unlocatable consciousness that seems to have existed before time.The greatness of this book has nothing to do with its \\"qualities,\\" but with its passion, its madness -- its genius. If ever a secular work was inspired, surely it was this one. It is beautiful not in the way books are, but as a created thing is, a horse or a river or a redwood. It makes little sense to me to call MOBY-DICK The Great American Novel, since it's hardly a novel at all; it is sui generis, acknowledging no standards but its own. If it must be a novel, then has the same standing in the canon of world literature as TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES: the supremest expression of the mind of a culture, disavowed by the culture itself.As for this edition, it is at least handsomely printed and well bound. The foreward is profoundly irrelevant, and there are no notes, though I can't imagine any torrent of notes would be of much use in penetrating the mystery of this vision, prophecy, epic, call it what you will.If you find yourself these days looking for reasons to be proud to be American, MOBY-DICK will give you one."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Readers say it's far too long, the cetacean history is tedious, who the heck cares how to best prep a harpoon line? Well if you're one of those folks who likes a good harpoon-prep scene, you're in for a treat.

You will feel in your guts the rush of the sleigh ride, you will breathe the sea air and taste the mist, you will feel the salt hardening on your hands and face. Don't like any of that? Unless there's no place you'd rather be than your rocker, this is escapism as good as it comes. And don't even get me started on timeless themes, unforgettable characters and a plot as fine as they come...."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Moby Dick belongs to the first rank of world literature. Melville read widely and deeply within the Western tradition, and brought it all together in his complex masterpiece. Within the framework of a simple tale of obsession, Melville offers commentary on the corpus of philosophy, history, theology, and literature that is our inheritance. All of these themes swirl around the central question of the novel: should we affirm the world, with all of its evil, or should we defy it?Ahab, memorably, chooses defiance, and staking his all on that defiance, literally disappears, all flags flying, into the whirlpool. The effect is stunning.Along the way we meet different approaches to the central question embodied in the crew of the Pequod and the various ships she encounters on her long journey. Melville offers no one answer, but rather a piercing observation of the various human reactions to the problem of evil. Nathanial Hawthorne said of Melville that his curse was that he could neither believe nor disbelieve in God. In Moby Dick, we are drawn into the fury of Melville's wrestling match with God, and whether we believe, or don't believe, surely we are enriched by Melville's passionate struggle. The strongest expression of the struggle is Ahab, the epic figure who believes, but refuses to submit to the gods or to the fates. Is he the hero of the piece or the villain? However you view him, you won't forget him.As memorable as some of the scenes in this novel are, it is a long novel, and there are many detours. For those who are well-versed in both literature and philosophy the long stretches of commentary on whales, and whaling, and whalers, and all of that are actually commentaries on the Western canon. Not a line is wasted. The infamous chapter on Cetology is about whales, yes; but it is even more a commentary on epistemology (and a hysterically funny one, at that).The book begins as a novel, and moves on to explore other forms of literature -- most notably dramatic tragedy and the epic. In doing so, Melville makes an overt bid to be counted as one of the great writers in the Western tradition; and I, for one, think he succeeds. The novel is a complex tapestry, in which all of the pieces, even the seemingly meaningless ones, come together into that central whirlpool that brings Moby Dick to a close. It is a work that can be read again, and again, and again.There are great sections that are exciting and accessible to all. But for a more casual reader, there are long stretches that will seem pointless and incomprehensible.For someone looking for something a bit more accessible, \\"Billy Budd\\" and \\"Bartleby the Scrivener\\" are two Melville works that are shorter and more plot-driven. Yet both have the same complexity of thought that is so magnificently presented in Moby Dick.Still, if you are up to the challenge, Melville will reward you in spade"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Let anyone who dares try to surpass it, Melville's Moby Dick remains and probably will remain forever untouched as THE American masterpiece. Where else can you find a novel about an activity that has all but perished from the earth--at least in its 19th century form and purpose--that stays fresh as hot blood and silvery as sea-wrack in the mind? Where else can you find such a magnificent, encyclopedic grasp of western philosophy, theology, mythology and classical literature, handled with high humor--as though the whales themselves were batting those great themes and ideas about among their flukes? Where else but Shakespeare will you find a cast of characters of such variety and stature, with such resonant voices? Where else such immediate journalism of the daily life aboard a whaler? Where else such beautifully turned small essays, that seem like the journal entries recorded yesterday by a clever and educated man aboard a ship sailing now in some eternally present ocean? Where else will you go deep into details of filth and gore and hardest physical labor utterly foreign to your own life, and emerge considering how you will live out tomorrow? If it's an effort to keep up with Melville's mind, make the effort to keep a reference book hard by. You will emerge the wiser from the struggle to understand it all. Or if you don't want to be bothered with that, just NOTICE how much you SEE when he is describing sights and operations you surely have never seen before. This novel is so much more than a summary of its lance-straight trajectory of a plot can convey. Because Melville has freed himself--who knows how--to use every method he can think of to expand the Pequod into a universe of humans being human, mad or inhuman, dramas unfolding, specific work being done, nature inspiring us with awe, meditations mused upon. And the whale, his whiteness, and his magisterial, inscrutable power, truly is 'the unknown God.' When we see him in the last chapters surging among the boats it is like watching God pass on the waters. That tangle of lances and cables, that corpse freight Fedallah on his back, are like all the futile attempts of theologies to capture God and lash him to our little human craft and try out his essential oil. We'll never do it, and this novel will never sink. Sometimes, inexplicably, human talent touches the sublime.

Surprisingly, I found all the famoulsy \\"boring\\" middle chapters about the minutiae of whaling the most enthralling. The actual hunt for the whale was less interesting because Melville seems to drop his more earnest attempts at innovation and \\"get down to the buisness\\" of plot.And that's weird. Because, you'd think the plot would be the more exciting thing-especially with this subject. But I loved the experimental use of voice that Melville used in the middle of the book.Anyway, I clearly haven't got it all figured out. But I'd love to take a class.

The other characters play delightful parts as well.While Ishmael is the narrator of the story, I have always felt Starbuck to be the 'hero.' Melville places Ahab's monomania of endless drive and fixation on a goal (noble though it is) in unfavourable light against Starbuck's common sense and embracing of his ordinary, happy life.

With good reason the novel has been a staple of our culture, from the English classroom to popular culture. Melville's compelling story of obsession and revenge, his rich cast of characters, his varied and experimental style, and above all his masterful use of symbolism and pregnant imagery make Moby-Dick a book that no educated man or woman can afford to miss.The storyline, though somewhat unevenly paced, builds steadily into a first-rate tale of human struggle. The book is narrated by Ishmael, a young man who joins the crew of a whaling vessel to combat his depression, or, as he puts it, the \\"drizzly November\\" in his soul. Though Ishmael narrates, Ahab, the captain of the Nantucket whaling ship The Pequod, is the book's main character. Prior to the beginning of the story, Ahab is attacked by an albino sperm whale, named Moby-Dick. Moby-Dick chomps off Ahab's leg and sends him into a feverish madness. Ahab swears revenge, and over the course of the rest of the novel, he brings his crew with him on his doomed quest.Melville crews his ship with a huge and diverse cast of characters. The domineering and remote Ahab provides a natural foil for the care-free and easy-going Ishmael. The three mates of the ship - Starbuck, Stubb and Flask - encapsulate the range of man's responses to life's trials. Starbuck's sensitivity, Stubb's nonchalance, and Flask's prickly nature mark each character as distinct (though archetypal). In addition, the crew contains New Englanders of all types, natives from remote islands around the globe, and the sinister \\"hair-turbaned Fedallah [who] remained a muffled mystery to the last.\\"Melville's style, like his characters, is varied. There are sections of the book - particularly the \\"Whiteness of the Whale\\" chapter that are lyrical and poetic, alongside technical chapters addressing the types of whales or the proper manufacture of whaling rope. Certain scenes are written almost like a play, with stage directions and character names followed by their lines. When the Pequod leaves Nantucket, the mastery of Melville's prose shines through: \\"Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.\\"Moby-Dick is a landmark in American Literature, but because of its complex structure and poetic style, it's better suited for older or more patient readers. In addition, many readers might find an abridged version useful - one that removes the less plot-oriented chapters (like the infamous \\"Cetology\\" chapter). Still, for the discerning reader, there is no richer find than Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. I give it 10 harpoons out of 10."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I read (or tried to read) Moby Dick in high school, like many American students. I loathed it. Decades later, I have returned to the book and it is fantastic. It is alternately dark and light, almost always vivid. With more years under my belt, I have a far greater appreciation for the sense of life and living conveyed by Ishmael.You might want to consider either or both of \\"The Loss of the Ship Essex, Sunk by a Whale\\" -- a first hand account by survivors -- and \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\", also about the Essex and by the author of the introduction to this edition of Moby Dick.This is an excellent edition, as good as a paperback can get. Far poorer books on far worse paper with far worse binding are sold for as much or more. My only gripe is that the paper does not appear to be acid-free, but the paper stock is certainly very good.The introduction by Nathaniel Philbrick is excellent -- personal, well-informed and insightful, very worth reading before reading the novel.

I've been spellbound by this book since I was 20. Thirty years later, I can't turn away from it. When it came time for me to write my own book on a true nautical disaster, only a line by Melville could do justice as an introductory quote, though it came from Melville's book White Jacket.Moby Dick is Melville's masterpiece, though even his shorter works such as Benito Cereno and Billy Budd should be examined.Some force touched Melville, connecting him to the land, the sky and the sea and to the souls of men, and then, inexplicably, blended his consciousness with the universe. Melville exhibits an uncanny appreciation of the mystery of existence that is spliced as tightly as a mainbrace to everyday tasks and knowledge. The preparation of a harpoon for its murderous work is part of life's reality and Melville makes sure we can sign on for a voyage and do our part.In Moby Dick, Melville instructs you not only how to be a whaler, but he's given the reader a glimpse into eternity. Moby Dick is required reading for anyone who wants to understand Melville's magnificent vision of America, as a lone quixotic ship of co-equal strangers upon a journey that is as thrilling as it is fraught with hazards.Melville's best-kept secret is his harpoon-sharp humor which is unleashed on society through the rueful observations of his characters as they navigate a ruthless sea driven by the unyielding Ahab. The dour New England whaling captain is both at his best and worst when he is enthusiastically hailed by the captain of a passing ship. \\"How wondrous familiar is a fool\\", mutters Ahab who can think of nothing but slaying the white whale.Those seeking simple thrill reading may be too distracted to be in awe of Melville. His writing style is rich rather than impenetrable and not for those without a love of the language. A wise reader will allow himself to be overwhelmed like a sailor who surrendereds to the rise and fall of sea swells as they carry him to an unknown place."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"What in our own lives is a monster whale?

Big whale. One man chases whale, bringing others with him. Catches whale, but not until after whale rips apart boat. Problem is whale is stronger than the man and drags him into the sea. This might sound simplistic, and, given the depth of detail Melville provides, it arguably is. However, through the rich descriptions of sea, whale and shipping, we have a simple tale. Though many of us have read it, we know reading it again is still an adventure. The suspense is not in not knowing what will happen, but in how Melville tells it.Readers without the patience to enjoy an active psychological drama will be bored, but try to see past the drudging of sea life and into the souls of each character.Man vs. man?

Unless you have read this book before, have a massive vocabulary, or want to refer to the web all the time, this is not the edition for you.The book does include helpful whaling and sailing diagrams at the back, but it also has a map of the Pequod's voyage that gives away the book's ending--don't look at the map if you don't want to know!"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Having recently read Moby Dick for the first time, I am completely convinced that Hermann Melville really wanted to write a non-fiction book about great whales, but stuck in the fictional bits in order to attract a broader audience. I also do not believe that this is an American classic because it is such a well-written piece of fiction, but because it gives teachers so many things to talk about in class: changes in style, emerging attitudes about religion, narrative flashbacks, thematic consistency, and so on and on and on. Although the book starts out well, with amusing and complex characters and odd situations that expose much commentary on social norms, it unfortunately goes to sea. Once there, the lengthy and boring sections on whale anatomy, whale species, whale art, the history of whaling, whale butchering, and the inaccuracies of others who have chronicled tales of whaling completely overwhelm the fairly sketchy plot, the amusing characters, and anything resembling a reasonable story pace. Tangents on Great Lakes sailing and pretty much anything else that crossed the author's mind lead to lengthy, rambling asides that sap the reader's will to go on. Even the overarching theme of obsession (which is ably demonstrated more by the author's whale fetish than by Captain Ahab's pursuit of the white whale) is lost in the tedious bulk of non-fiction material. The author moves from narrative style to dialogue to museum cataloging to play scene style at whim and without regard for consitency or what works for the storyline. Worst of all, the ending of the book--the thin plot that most people know and use to indicate the importance of the book as the great American novel--winds up as poorly described, anticlimactic, and unsatisfying mess. While some may regard this review as harsh, I was in fact kind by giving this book two stars instead of one. Interesting perhaps to talk about, promising in parts, but an uninteresting chore to read in full. Disappointing and far from a great book."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I have read Moby Dick five times.It gets better with age.Every American should read it.

Save it for a cold Winter night...this is what literature is all about.Thank you Herman Melville!"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"At the risk of sounding ignorant, I found the book unbearable. I understand the symbolism in it. However, I didnt have the tenacity to follow it through all the tedious detours.Despite all, the last three chapters brought all the piecese together and ended the story with a spectacular flurry. One man's defiance against the whale, sea, world, God... It reminded me a bit of Ayn Rand's philosophy, whatever that is called.I think it would be a mistake for anybody not to read this book at least in part. At the same time, I want to spare them the countless hours of agony having to read through the unreadable chapters and pages. So 3-stars it is."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Last semester in college I had the opportunity, for the first time, to read various chapters from Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. I became so enthralled with what I had read I decided to purchase the novel as soon as possible. I just so happened to pick up Penguin's 150th Anniversary Edition. All in all I am quite pleased with this edition from the cover to the pages that are printed clearly and crisply.Moby Dick may not be everyone's cup of tea, it can be rather long and tedious to get through as Melville likes to lecture almost as much as tell a story. But from the first line &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; it's hard not to be sucked into the story as we follow Ishmael on his journey across the sea with the nefarious Captain Ahab. The story centers around Ahab's quest to find and destroy the White Whale. Of course Ishmael plays just as important of a part.Melville's use of language is spectacular and he truly did write a classic novel. This is a fascinating tale of adventure that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Recently, I just finished a copy of the book, Moby Dick . I had picked it up in search of a truly challenging work. I have to admit, I haven't ever read anything like Melville's works in my life, and it was a pleasant surprise to have chosen such an amazing piece of classic literature to read.Initially, I was startled, and almost discouraged by the high level of vocabulary used; much less the large list of sailing terms used within it. At the beginning, it takes a while to acclimate to the phrasing and sentence structure that Melville uses, unless one is used to reading older works. Once acclimated, it becomes easy to understand the piece.Concerning the plot, I found it enjoyable, however, at times confusing. I know that many have heard the traditional yarn of the insane Captain Ahab, seeking the whale that crippled him; but reading the actual tale presents a whole new aspect. I found that the incessant interruptions of information on cetology became somewhat of a nuisance; however, very informative and worthwhile reading, as it gives the reader a better understanding of the book. After having finished the book, I went on to read another book on cetology, and found it quite interesting comparing modern day whaling to 19th century whaling. Unfortunately, in the elongated sections about the anatomy of a sperm whale, one feels as if the majority of this book is an encyclopedia of miscellaneous information. Without this factual information, it seems as if it would be nothing but a mere short story.Despite my complaints, I would recommend this book to all who are seeking a thoroughly challenging literary work. I enjoyed being able to read one of the great all time American novels, and read it in its raw form. I would have to rate this book as being one of the best literary works I have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Melville's literary style is indeed impressive and his understanding of character mighty, but it does not make up for his arduous and ceasless pontifications on the nobility of whaling and his exhaustive detailing of the intricacies of the trade. This is not a novel; it is a whaling encyclopedia.The reader does not follow Ahab into the depths of madness and obsession, nor is he captured in the suspense anticipating the great and final confrontation between the captain and the whale, because Melville rarely (and I would suggest never) addresses these things. Rather, we are inescapably immersed in the banal specifics of whale anatomy, biology, and the tedious minutiae of ropes, sails, boats, hooks, et cetera et cetera et cetera. With all the meaningless discussion of how to cut a whale and the size of its jaw there are few pages left for the author to provide any insight into his characters or to make us care what happens to the crew of Pequod.Perhaps there is a great story embedded and I missed it filtering through all the monotonous tedium. There must be to have stood the test of the time. Still, I have to imagine that all the readers who truly love this book read the abridged version of this novel."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I blame two things for preventing me from having read this book sooner. The first is English majors. They made it seem so unapproachable. There are only so many times I can hear a book referred to as \\"the greatest American novel\\" before I assume that it is an unapproachable tome championed by people who champion overly-difficult books as a profession. But on the recommendation of two friends who, while they have both been known to read books as dense and daunting as anything the lit crit establishment might throw at us, I trust completely. I guess, then, that this review is actually a thank you note to them for convincing me to tackle Moby-Dick, which it turns out is quite approachable, full of humor and adventure, and composed of sentences that I'm sure all my friends are tired of hearing me read aloud.The only places I sometimes found to be difficult were passages of dialogue, but it's the kind of difficulty worth a reread because comprehension is rewarding. The sometimes detailed explanations of the industry of whaling, made infamous by the complaints of generations of high schoolers, were always enjoyable to me. Were it not for modern ecological morality and my tendency toward sea-sickness, I might have enlisted for a tour on the next boat out from Nantucket, such was the joy captured on the page by Melville. In the end, this novel is at its best because of the passion of its author. He's excited by his subject and it's hard not to be excited along with him.I mentioned that there were two things that prevented me from reading Moby-Dick sooner. The other was Billy Budd, which I had to read in high school and remember hating more than anything I'd ever read before. I don't know if this is because my adolescent mind was not yet ready for Melvillean diction, or if that book is just not up to the level of Moby-Dick, but whatever the reason, if you've had a similar experience and have dismissed the white whale because of it, you've made a mistake.Moby-Dick is the kind of book full of sentences that make me giddy, the kind that make me want to clap after reading them, because each one is almost a performance, a dance or a song or a stand-up routine, playing in the theater of my head-space. Reading this book was one of those rare times when the experience lived up to the hype."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"and why wouldn't you?, choose this edition. Paper stock, type face and wide margins matter with this whale of a novel. Oh, and the text itself? Remember: Melville is funny. A poet to boot. At some point, two- or three- or four-hundred pages in, I always seem to find myself adrift, joyfully cut loose, swimming in language."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Forget about the Great American Novel. Let us just agree that Moby-Dick is the Great American Book, and the rest of our literature can sort itself out. Like The Bible it contains narrative, poetry, philosophy, comedy, and finally tragedy. It is the American book of books.I actually read it in an undergraduate lit class, and could not put it down. I came to it at exactly the right time in my life; I just got lucky. I read it again, years later, and was amazed at how much I had missed in my first reading. A man in his forties will be closer to Ahab than a young man of twenty, but I do not regret the early exposure to this book. It changed the world for me. At sixty-four I am ready to take it up again."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I considered writing a lengthy review attempting to describe and explain the effect of this book, but it would be a waste of time. You know how Kafka intentionally wrote his stories in such a way that they would defy any attempt at interpretation? Well, Melville did the exact opposite: He wrote a book that is so charged with significance, that draws on so many sources, that attempts (and succeeds!) to do so much, that offers itself to such an unspeakable variety of interpretations (almost all of which Melville himself anticipated and plays upon), that there are quite literally as many different Moby-Dicks as there are readers--and more versions yet to be discovered. This book is like an ink-blot test or a carnival funhouse mirror, showing something unique to everyone, and it will speak directly to YOU, whoever you are. It is THE GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN BY AN AMERICAN, and easily one of the greatest books EVER written. It competes with Shakespeare and the Bible. Read it, read it, for God's sake READ IT."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"While I agree with most of the positive comments, I think this book should be edited into two parts. The first part would be all of the boring narrative called \\"Everything you wanted to know about whales and whaling but were afraid to ask\\". The second part would be devoted entirely to the story of the narrator, the crew and the whale.My reasoning is that the story itself would be strengthened. After a while, every time I got to one of the \\"this is why whales and whaling are good\\" chapters, I would just skip it because they were so drab. These chapters just destroyed the flow of the story. If you disagree, just remember how the story evolved up until the Pequod sets sail and then wham...biology of whales, whales in literature, whale classes, etc. Where did the story go? The good news is that these lame chapters are not mixed in with the story part of the book.Sure, this would shorten the story part of the book, but does the filler make it better? Not in my opinion. Length &lt;> quality. I would give this book 4 - 5 stars with my proposed division."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I guess I did not know what to expect, but I was surprised by the form and structure of the book. It is written in the form of 135 short chapters, some only half a page long, and it ends abruptly with a flourish of action without much warning.As a reader I want to state one cautionary note about this version of the book. By the way this is a well made book with large font and the paper is similar in quality to a hard cover book. The thing which I did not like and I caution a reader about in advance, is that one should not read the introduction by Nathaniel Philbrick and do not look at the maps or table of contents until you have finished reading the book. Too much of the plot is given away in those parts, well meaning or otherwise; and, knowing the end and the outline of the story spoils the read in my opinion.There are three elements which I found of interest. The first was the description of whaling and all the stories and trivia surrounding whaling. There is much romance and lore presented by Melville, over 500 pages and it is mostly an interesting and an impressive read.Ismael is the narrator but he is colorless compared to the larger than life captain Ahab who is the living embodiment of everything wrong with having an obsession. His obsession is to find and kill the great white whale Moby Dick. Most of the story is the search across great oceans to find this notorious whale.The last thing that stood out for myself was the prose. Melville has a colorful and interesting style, almost Shakespearean from time to time, and that makes the book the great masterpiece that it is. The last dozen chapters are very well written and convey a strong feeling of excitement and action. Here is an example from an earlier Chapter 37: \\"Sunset.\\"\\"The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun- slow dived from noon- goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'Tis iron- that I know- not gold. 'Tis split, too- that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night-good night! (waving his hand, he moves from the window.)\\"Moby Dick is semi-autobiographical and is based on trips made by Melville himself in younger days. Melville in his later years was unable to regain the passion and complexity of this book in his writings and was forced to give up being a full time writer. This is a great read, and most book lovers will want to read the masterpiece more than once."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Forget that you have heard that MOBY DICK is long, that it is boring, that it's about a big fish and some crazy guy who goes after it. It is first and foremost a huge sandwich of a book, a highly satisfying and greatly flavored one that is well worth biting into and finishing. The contemporary mind accustomed to arid, minimal postmodern prose may require a little, but just a little, adjustment to wrap around some of the baroque and factual passages, but once adjusted, it moves right along. The action is dramatic, there is genuine humor and warmth in the character development and there are times when the author works up a contagious enthusiasm for his study so that the technical information about whales, whaling and ships is more often captivating than not. It can be awe-inspiring or just plain amusing to watch Melville get worked up, waxing Biblical or classical or Shakespearean or, in some moments, breathtakingly lyrical. His language has a visual quality to it even when heading into abstract territory. Where human psychology is at work, he can be startlingly modern. If you need more enticement, then you should know that the chapters are rather short, so challenging passages don't last forever. It's not necessary to glaze over.To reiterate the classic storyline, an early 19th century whaling ship sets sail from Nantucket like all the others in the industry, expecting to be at sea for a few years, circling the globe in pursuit of the raw resource that was in its day what oil is now. Once at sea, the cipher of a captain, Ahab, makes known his personal mission: to track down the uniquely marked sperm whale known as Moby Dick who availed Ahab of a leg in their last encounter. With the exception of the ship's first mate, the voice of reason known as Starbuck, Ahab has his very talented crew in his thrall. As they sail oceans doing the business of whaling and interacting with the occasional ship met at sea, the tension builds as to the possible outcomes of an encounter with Moby Dick. When the climax comes, however much it may have been presaged, it is still a walloping scene. And then there is the wholly unexpected last page.An observation: Publishers claim Moby Dick is for readers age 5th grade and up, but I can't imagine anyone younger than a senior high school student being able to negotiate the many layers of experience, allusion and abstract ideas that fill this book. This is a read that definitely improves as one matures."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Was not happy at first to learn we had to read this in Eng103 but I am enjoying the book :) Also, it will be nice to say I read an American Best Novel!"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It took me a long time to get around to reading it because I had never heard good things about it, but after I ran across some great quotes from it online my interest was piqued enough to buy it and I was not disappointed. You know a book is good when the individual sentences are as enjoyable to read as the story is. As everyone who has ever read this will attest, it is a lot more than just a novel. It goes into great detail about sperm whales and whale hunting, which is why it probably gets poor reviews, but it is absolutely fascinating if you have the attention span to read it and learn about it. I found myself laughing out loud in places and gagging from grotesque details in others. I have a whole new appreciation for the men who went out and harpooned whales and enjoyed thinking about the evolution of the market to new products.

First of all, let me say thank you for choosing my review over all the others. I know you are a busy person and have a rather dizzying schedule of doing this and going there and having this and that for a snack. So, all the more appreciative this makes me to think that you have chosen my amazon review, over all the others, to read and love and consider before purchasing the item of which I am reviewing.Furthermore, let's say I was reviewing, say, a set of ballpoint pens produced by a company like Bic or Papermate, I'm sure you would also have chosen my review. Or perhaps not. Maybe instead of choosing my review of this rather commonplace item (ballpoint pens) you would have possibly chosen someone else's review. Well. Let me just say, sorry. I'm sorry my hypothetical review of Bic's set of inky blue ballpoint pens (valued at $.95) was not GOOD enough for you. I'm sorry you feel that my review of Bic's medium point, .1 mm blue ballpoint pen was possibly incomplete or unfairly negative. Or maybe you thought it was too positive? Maybe you are the kind of person who intentionally seeks out negative reviews of all kinds just to make yourself feel better about your OWN drawbacks as a person.Fine. Just fine. You don't have to like my review of Bic's medium point, small point or LARGE point blue inky ballpoint pens, for that matter. Nobody is twisting your little arm telling you \\"SO-AND-SO, you better LIKE that man's review of those Bic's medium point ballpoint blue inky .1mm set of blue ballpoint pen set\\"... SO. Here we are.But the fact of the matter is that you did not read my review of Bic's medium point blue inky ballpoint pens, because in fact I did not write a review of Bic's medium point blue ballpoint inky blue pens. No. In fact, I wrote a review of Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Whale\\" or whatever you want to call it (just don't call it late for dinner).So, back to thanking you for choosing my very heart-felt review of this item. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Fellow consumer, you have come to the right place (and the right review) to get your twisted little kicks by hearing about somebody trash Herman's famous romance novel \\"Moby Dick and the Whale\\". But maybe I won't stoop to that level. Maybe I don't want you to have the satisfaction of hearing somebody trash this classic novel. Maybe, in fact, I wrote this one-star review just to get your ATTENTION. Maybe I wanted to attract sick little minds like yours into this review just so I can tell you to SHOVE OFF. Maybe instead of going about your putrid little life, seeking out negativity and getting your rocks off from the slightest bit of cutting-down of much beloved and famous artists, you should do something better with your time.Maybe. Or maybe not. Actually, perhaps I wrote this review in order to tell you a little secret that I've been holding in for a very long time. The secret is: I didn't read this book. Despite having not read this book, I went around and told everybody I know that I have. In fact, most of the time, upon meeting someone, within the first few minutes of conversation I manage to steer directly into the fact that indeed, I have read Moby Dick. Usually, no one asks follow-up questions. But just in case they do ask questions, I have a back-up. I usually just say, well I must tell you, I won't even get started, because I could literally talk about this book for one full week without stopping, even for the loo and in fact I have a rare disease where I have to use the bathroom a considerable amount.After the initial look of discomfort from my newfound acquaintance, the convo usually dies down to mindless chatter about the weather or the kinds of ice cream we prefer. But never back to Moby Dick. So, all these years I've been getting away with lying about having read Moby Dick.Now that you know the truth, do you dislike me as a person? Have I made YOU feel uncomfortable? Or do you feel that you've wasted your time on this review? Well, I will TELL you how you feel. You feel happy. Happy to have read this review and happy to have heard my dirty, twisted little secret. I will tell you something, though. YOU haven't read Moby Dick either. Why else would you be considering buying it? Most people who have read Moby Dick are just happy to have been done with it. I'm sure the majority of people who have read this classic novel/slapstick comedy indeed are overjoyed to have been at it and done with it. I bet they would never want to read even a long-winded review of it. So, there you are. Proof that you have not read Moby Dick, just as I have not read Moby Dick. Maybe you better just forget about Moby Dick entirely and just go have a nap. Maybe a cup of blended celery juice will fix you of the notion of reading Moby Dick. Come to think of it, maybe that would solve my bladder disease."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Everybody said I should read Under the Volcano, so I did.

After taking a university class dedicated entirely to this book, I am convinced that Herman Melville has encapsulated the mystery and reality of what it means to be human.

Being 726 pages long, which is the same length as the edition discussed here, I am assuming that it is the same edition.I have always planned on reading Moby Dick, and a few weeks ago I came across this edition in the bargain section of a local chain bookstore. It was a handsomely bound hardback edition for the same price as the paperback, so I decided to finally read it. Unfortunately,it was not what I was expecting it to be. I understand that this book is full of symbolism and is considered an American classic, but I was expecting something different; something more exciting. Most of the book is taken up with material that I feel is extraneous to the story of the hunt for Moby Dick. There are chapters on the tail of a whale, on the flukes of a whale, pictures of whales, and so on. Moby Dick himself only appears on page 690. The story of his struggle with the Pequot is brief- very brief- given the space allotted to the material concerning whales and whaling in general. If only the story of the hunt for and fight with Moby Dick were included, then the book would have been only 200-300 pages long, and if Hemingway had written it, it would have only been a 100 page novella. My main complaint is that I did not know this before I started reading; if I had I might not have been so disappointed. I write this review to forewarn readers so that they might not expect something that the book is not and thus if they choose to read the book, they might enjoy it more than I did. I am writing this for someone like myself who was not forced to read it for school, but did so expecting an exciting classic story. On this basis, I do not think that it delivered; hence I am not recommending it.To be fair, there are those who feel that the whaling material is an important part of the book, and even a reason for reading the book. I disagree because the book is generally presented in terms of the struggle with Moby Dick, and not primarily as a book about whales and 19th century whaling.In looking over the other reviews I see that those reviews, like this one, that were not full of fulsome praise are generally found not to be helpful and I wonder why this is the case. I view a review as giving guidance to a potential reader and there are many, like myself, who did not appreciate the fact that this is actually a book about 19th century whaling, with an ancillary story about the struggle with Moby Dick. I feel that it is important that a potential reader be alerted to this and I feel that such an alert should be helpful to a potential reader, even if this warning does not jibe with the literary reputation of the book."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I first read Moby Dick when I was in my late teens. I loved it then, and I love it now, after reading it two more times. It is obvious that Melville had personal experience as a whaler, and he brings to life a world long gone. He dedicates this novel to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who inspired him. Both Hawthorne and Melville wrote about what they perceived were fatal flaws in humankind. Specifically American humans. But their writing is dramatically different, Hawthorne telling his stories in a more-or-less forward-moving narrative, Melville telling his in an innovative style that mixed fiction and nonfiction.Moby Dick was unlike any book I had ever read, in the way it mixes chapters of narrative fiction with chapters of reflection, the history of whales (cetology), treatises on how blubber is removed from a whale and how it's used, insertions of dramatic plays within the text of the story, discussions of the whale in art, musings on the sperm whale's head (the whale can see only to either side, not straight ahead), the taste of whale steak, and more. The book is long, but most chapters are very short, and their content is intriguing, whether that content is fiction or fact.When I read this novel for the first time, I was struck by how, despite the fact that whalers and those in the whaling industry knew every square inch of a whale -- how to render it down to salable products -- they didn't really know the heart of the whale. At all. Nor did they ever suspect that the creature they hunted for profit could and would turn around to destroy them. Though they believed otherwise, they did not own the whale.Critics discuss the whiteness of the whale and what that whiteness means. I've always leaned toward thinking the whiteness represents the indifference of the universe. Earthquakes, tsunamis, forest fires, drought -- none of these are personal toward humans, who are only one small piece of nature. Ahab's fatal flaw is that he believes he deserves vengeance and can achieve vengeance against the White Whale. But as he learns, he is \\"Befooled! Befooled!\\" into thinking he can win. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I was never forced to read this one in high school, and I am probably the better for it. I was stunned to read this in my later 20's, and it makes me proud that we Americans have at least one great novel. All I can say is: for the love of all that is good, get this thing and read it already.Melville has a curious and beautiful language all his own in this novel. Maybe some will find it dry, boring and long, but if you love thinking and humanity you will absolutely devour this book. It is not about whaling. Well, I guess it is about whaling, but it transcends the current details with connections beyond at almost every opportunity. Timeless themes and all that. For example, please read the chapter 'The Monkey Rope'. A simple act of cutting up a whale turns into a beautiful statement about humanity and society that is laden with unimpeachable truth.As well as dropping shiny nuggets on human nature almost every page, occasionally you also hit upon some prose which makes you gulp. Describing the lazy morning swim of whales:As morning mowers, who side by sideslowly and seethingly advance their scythesthrough the long wet grass of marshy meads;even so these monsters swam, making a strange,grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind themendless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.It is basically poetry. Thank you Melville, from the bottom of my heart."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"After hearing a great radio program on this book (Studio 360 on WNYC, you can listen online) I decided to finally bite the bullet and read it.It was hard! My gosh! You get sucked in at the start with a great story and QueQueg in the bed and the church service but suddenly it breaks down into a chapter on all the different whales in the sea (which was interesting to me for how little understanding Melville had) and why whales are actually fish (if you really want to know about fish, check out Fish, His Manners And Morals) and all the items used on a whaler etc. etc.Some scenes are written out like a play which reminds me of Ulysses.My favorite part was when they sailed out over a really clear bit of water filled with whales and they looked down and saw whales fighting, whales giving birth, whales making love all down at different levels.The writing is so dense! I could only read like a chapter a night. But the chapters are really short so that makes it doable. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"What more need be said about this classic of American literature?Melville's classic tale of Moby Dick is so fantastic on so many levels. His writing style is unique and fun to read. The story itself is full of poignant metaphors and hidden meanings. Even if you don't understand the philosophical undertones of the book, you will love the classic story of Ahab and his search for the great white whale.Really, fiction doesn't get much better than this. If you haven't read Moby Dick, you are really missing out. Fascinating, exciting, entertaining and moving. This is a book that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I am thirty-five and I had never read Moby Dick. Well, I have just finished it, and I have to say that it is very good. Throw out your Gravity's Rainbow, your Cormac McCarthy series, Underworld, and those awful books by Paul Auster. Pour yourself a glass of port(from Portugal of course) or a good sherry and enjoy. With all of the hip edgy stuff coming out in cinema and tv, I guess we are supposed to be smug and oh so knowing about a book written in the 19th century. They'll probably make some new version of it with Ethan Hawke or some British actors. When it's made and sooner or later it will be, don't think of going to it. Instead buy the book. This epic astounds me at every turn. I am glad I waited to read it as an adult. I doubt I will be able to get my so-called intellectual(post-modern enthusiasts) friends interested in reading it. Take my advice and pick this one up before you read anything else."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Herman Melville's book, \\"Moby Dick\\" with foreword by Nathaniel Philbrick is presently being read by my book study group. We are almost 3/4 of the way through, and I have to say that I am now a big fan of Herman Melville. I learned that Melville is considered America's greatest writer, and I can believe it. Some in my group read this book when they were in high school, but are enjoying it even more the second time around. It is not only a story told to perfection, but it's a book that offers landlubbers, as well as coastal residents, a chance to learn about whaling and the majesty of the ocean and it's inhabitants, with an emphasis on whales... the Sperm Whale in particular. Melville has a way of making the emotions felt by the many colorful characters in this book pertinent to all humanity. Read it. You'll like it. Or reread it and you'll like it again, only more so."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Melville was fascinated by whaling. I spoke with a historican of whaling at the Mystic Seaport in Connecticut. In fact we were aboard the Morgan, the ship used in both the 1920s and 1960s films of Moby Dick. He explained to me that for the common sailor of the day, nothing was so horrific as going on a whaling voyage. The historian told me that no one who had been on such a voyage would ever go on one again, save the top officers and ship owners. Yet, Melville sailed several times chasing the whales!Besides the personal and existential issues that this book poses, we have to also look at this as a book about the first invasions of the global personally indiscriminate capitalist economy into the early 19th century world of Ishmael. The New England villages which he comes from are small collections of independent producers who know each other, following trades or farming earth their parents have passed down. Barter on most things was just replaced in the crisis of monetization of the New England economy that followed the American revolution which led to the armed revolutions and state civil wars in New England that forced Washington and the other \\"founders\\" to establish the constitution and a strong federal government to crush the rebels who wanted to go back to the demontarized past.Melville's character comes from a world where by and large everyone works for themself, their family, or perhaps someone they know.Yet, Ishmael is thrown into a new world, where he is simply an employee in one of the first world industries, the whaling industry. Rather than his own master, or learning to become a master in a trade, or learning to run the family farm, he is thrown into a new world where the world market for whale oil, whale ivory, and other products command him. Instead of the regular unfolding of crops on the season and trade activity reflecting that, Ishmael's voyage follows the whales around the globe. It draws him into intimacy with people of other races, other languages, other continents in a struggle not only with the ocean, the ship, but together against the cruel lash of Ahab's commands, and the seeming irrationality to him of chasing the great White Whale.The author's use of Ahab and his arbirtrariness and the device of the great white whale, impose these new conditions in a way that emphasizes them and makes them stand out. Beyond the person issues, they represent the subjection of Ishmael and more and more of the world economy to blind, irrational to the average person, forces that will continue to conquer the world from Melville's time to ours, throwing us into periods of boom and bust, depression, recession, unemployment, insecurity, and world wars and rivalries. Capitalist world production, and the driven managers who it produces take command of our lives.Melville's fascination with whaling is also shown by the many chapters which simply relate the many traditions and experience from the anciets until his day of whalers."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Moby dick is a classic adventure novel about killing a white whale. The plot of the novel is a review of the whaling industries terrible points told in a sardonic manner. It also looks at the resons for revenge and how revenge is an endless cycle and thus it is completely pointless. The book has a way of telling people things so that the point reveals things to a mind predisposed to think well of whaling by being only a simple adventure book but tells a story much deeper to someone coming with an open mind; that is the reader feels touch of distant harm.The book is spattered with numerous characters that combine to make the one good thing about whaling because it brings people together. The main character, Ishmael, is a wandering intellectual sailor that has decided to join a crew for the specific purpose of seeing how to be a whaler. He goes on to describe that the noble art of whaling practised by numerous heroes all of whom exist only in ancient myths. Another important character is Ishmael's friend Queeque a savage idoler who becomes an instant favourite with Ishmael after they spend a night in the same bed. This large harpooner acts as an old hand bound for his home after seeing with disgust the christians. The final character is Ahab a moody old captain obsessed with the killing of a white whale ever since that same whale took away his leg. For this ultimate revenge against all whales Ahab swear the crew to this quest risking the ship and the lives of all those aboard.The author utilizes both wit and stark realistic examples to convey his point. With these tools alone Melville irrevocably scratches his point in the mind of his reader. There is very little else that is utilized but the style also has a seemingly pointless chapters which actually lull the reader into a sense of false agreement with whaling, so that Melville's point becomes all the more real and shocking in the eyes of the reader.This book is perfect for anyone that enjoys an adventure novel in which there are many points that make people think. People who enjoy novels by Jack London and orson scott Card will find this book particularily enjoyable. Because of both the adventure and the statements on the nature of human beings. The book also makes an interesting read for someone who enjoyed the three musketteers.The Book the most like this one is Jack London's white Fang. However instead of being told from an animals perspective of humans different ways. Moby Dick tells the story of mans legacy from a lowly man seeing things from the inside of a society that rules over animals with iron Javalins. Another difference is that while white fang focuses on the goodness of man; Moby Dick is based primarily on revenge, and other of mens darker things with only a faint spatterring of light.The Whale Differs from most books because it tells a story that is full of two meaning depending on what the reader already thinks about the book. Melville uses this book to try and make people realise the good and bad things of whaling and how in this time it was nessecary to sweep away the feelling of bad ways that the idolers had to untie a few people to tell the truth against ancient prejudices.I feel That this is a great book that should be read by everyone. however in spots it becomes exceedingly dull and makes the reader want to fall asleep, but these spots are few that thave no importance to the rest of the novel. In short this book can be slow, but those who persevere there is a great novel waiting to be told. I caution all however to not supect that it is just about Moby Dick."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"You are not a fully educated person until you have read this book.

I like the fact that we follow a reckless old sea-dog pursuing his &quot;prey&quot; to the detriment of his and his crew's lives. I also could relate to the symbolism and the balance of character traits portrayed by Ahab's gang. And, to tell you the truth, I found some of the maritime lore and whaling reports interesting... but Hey Herman! - were you trying to write a story or a friggin' encyclopaedia.This novel wasn't met with much success at the time of writing? Well I wonder why. More emphasis on the grizzled old osprey's thoughts and actions; and curtail your descriptions of sperm whale anatomy, diminsh the indexing of butcher-tools and keep the examples of uses of oil down to a cool dozen or so.Overall - a documentary with an interesting story line hiding in the details."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"\\"Revenge, I want Revenge!\\" Captian Ahab yellls on his deck, while searching for the big white whale Moby Dick.

His descriptions of places and people are pages long, it takes alot of patience and attention toward the book. It dragged on at the beginning when he meets Queqeg and spends the night with him. He created realistic characters who brave through tough times (meeting Moby Dick.) Though it over 410 pages to finally get to Moby Dick, it was a very adventurous story of a young sailor meeting the whale who took the leg of his captain.I really liked this book even though it was slightly boring at first. I thought it would be like that all the way through, but it soon picked up pace and got exciting. I like his writing style but at times it was hard to understand what he was saying. He used alot of Old English, which was pretty cool. Overall, I think the book earns 2 thumbs up.

I say no. I loved the poetic language Melville uses, and there is no doubt he was a great writer. He did not, however have a great editor. Getting through this book was like running a marathon, where you are forced to stop every mile and listen to a lecture on running, running shoes, knee pain, gatorade, or any other subject remotely related. Finishing the marathon gives you bragging rights, but not much more."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"The distinct impression I got from reading Moby-Dick is the complete and utter convoluted concept of the whole thing. It felt like I wrestling with Melville himself the entire time I was reading it. The first thing that put me off was the fact that huge pieces of the story were simply the author explaining things like an encyclopedia: what the different types of whales were, how to prep harpoons, the protocol for the officers to eat, and so on, and so on, and so on... What Melville could have said in one sentence-it seems-he said in ten pages. While it is true that there is a deeper literary meaning behind it, it's definitely covered up by the blatant symbolism that is thrown in the reader's face every page. What was told here could easily be told in a smaller format, as this book is loooong, and that fact is only amplified by the method in which it is told. Several times I found myself skipping pages just to see if anything interesting would happen in the near future. I suppose the best thing I could say about this book is that the chapters are short, so it makes it seem that it is going faster than it actually is."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for decades!

I'm often wondering....WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT NARRATIVE! Most of the book can be glanced over, and you STILL are wondering if Melville will ever get to the point! OMG!I think the ONLY thing that made this book a \\"classic\\" is that it was written during a time where not much was known about creatures of the ocean, and yes, whales are facinating...., and that a battle between man and unknown creature was something exciting. But yeah, Melville, had many spots missing off his dice! The guy probably wrote this while in a padded room in some unknown psychiatric ward!I only gave it 3 stars...not because it was OK, but yeah....battle between man and whale is an adventure....but this one was so poorly narrated, that keeping interest was a chore, and I only read it because I was bound and determined to read it.

He is half deaf and more than half blind with age. Even so, he can see that the diminutive people here are gentle, serious, and not yet Christian. He performs a mass baptism, not realizing that he has created Christian penguins.So begins France's straight-faced satire of the church, the state, and anything else he can think of. First, the innocents must clothe their nakedness. This creates modesty for them, but also creates immodesty, lust-inducing arts of skirt and bodice, and avarice for finer clothes and baubles. Next, they develop property law, proven by disputes over farmland. They create a noble class, when one demonstrates his nobility by killing another penguin and taking his land. They create a royalty, by means of fraud and extortion. They even create their first saint, the miraculous virgin Ste. Orberosia. She seemed best known for her miraculous virginity, which she proclaimed until her dying day (and we don't argue with saints). In fact, she was able to proclaim her virginity even after dozens or hundreds of encounters that would have destroyed it in less holy a woman - miraculous indeed. Perhaps the penguins weren't born subject to Original Sin, but they're mighty quick with the imitation.The History of Penguinia moves forward, through ages of avarice, adultery, elaboarate scams, false accusations, and all the usual goings-on of the political world. The events are painfully funny, right down to the cynical, cyclical view of modern times, locked into an historical rhythm. The views are painful only because they're so very true.I imagine they would have been even more true for me if I knew more about the political current events of France and Europe circa 1900, when this book was being written. I also suspect some wordplay in characters' names that would have been amusing if I knew French. It is a measure of Anatole France's genuius that now, nearly a hundred years later, it's still true enough for a modern reader, and one unfamiliar with the book's original milieu. I imagine this book will reward the prepared reader even more richly.This is satire at its finest - funny, but with an edge, and funny because it's so very true.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"This is a brilliant satire of just about every major European institution: the French government, the church, all social classes, royalists, republicans, and socialists. The plot has been very ably summarized by earlier reviews. I suspect that a modern non-French reader is handicapped by not knowing immediately exactly which individuals are being satirized in the novel, but a French person, especially one reading the book at the time it was written, would be immediately aware. The one satire that just about everyone will recognize is the reference to the Dreyfus affair. Dreyfus is called Pyrot in the book, and he is a Jew as was Dreyfus. Instead of being accused of treason, he is accused of stealing 20,000 bales of hay. In spite of clear evidence of his innocence, he is convicted and his conviction is upheld on appeal. Thus one of history's foremost miscarriages of justice is savagely skewered by Anatole France.The book is at times difficult to read, and it is often hard to follow because of the plethora of characters. Nevertheless, it is a tremendous work of imagination and is unlike anything I have read before."},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"This book is quite fun to read, I found. But it is very uneven. Briefly, it mocks every institution known to man, including the church, especially the church, so much so that this book is still on the Vatican's Index of verboten writings. Thus, any Roman Catholic reader risks excommunication in reading it. Just warning you!The conceit is that a group of penguins are inadvertently baptised by a half-blind saint. There follows a deliciously Jesuitical debate in Heaven over whether they now deserve souls. It turns out that they do. But please to ask a member of the aforesaid order on exactly how the logic of all this parses. It's altogether too abstruse for me!There are other very delicious parts. But, the writing becomes a bit sloppy in points. France frequently forgets his conceit of the nation of Penguinia and calls it what it is: France. Also, too much of the book is devoted to The Dreyfus Affair (herein called Pyrot).But the book is short enough that one shouldn't allow the unevenness to stand in the way of licking one's lips over jeux d'esprit such as the following declaration by Doctor Obnubile:\\"The wise men will collect enough dynamite to blow up this planet. When its fragments fly through space an imperceptible amelioration will be accomplished in the universe and a satisfaction will be given to the universal conscience. Moreover, this universal conscience does not exist.\\"Have a blast!"},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"When a bumbling priest accidently baptizes a population of penguins, God is left with a cosmic problem. The solution results in the creation of the Penguin race, and is the beginning of the long history of Penguinia.Anatole France has essentially written an entire farcical history book, satirizing various stages of human civilization. First he mocks early religion and mythology, prominently featuring the exploits of a saucy and quick-witted young woman, who in later Penguin history will be known as Saint Orberosia, despite her history of infidelity and opportunistic lies. He follows this up with lampoons of the middle age and modern times, both of which center on the relationship between government and religion. The church, composed of saintly followers of the holy Orberosia, is a constant threat to the representative government, alternately instigating baseless scandals (a la the Dreyfus affair), plotting revolutions, and conspiring to start unprovoked wars. Finally France provides us with a very dystopian vision of the future, where Penguinia becomes a soulless commercial metropolis under attack by disillusioned terrorists.The premise of this book is clearly inspired, but I found it hard to read. It really is a history book, which means that it skips quickly from story to story, never staying long with any particular set of characters. I found the stories involving love and relationships to be sarcastically poignant, while some of the political insights display an astounding amount of relevance to modern events. For example, reflecting on the Penguin government - \\"The Penguin democracy did not itself govern, it obeyed a financial oligarchy which formed opinion by means of the newspapers, and held in its hand the representatives, the ministers, and the president. It controlled the finances of the republic, and directed the foreign affairs of the country as if it were possessed of sovereign power.\\" Hmm. When speaking of the political leader they hope to groom into the internal destroyer of the Penguin republic - \\"It is not necessary for the man we choose to be of brilliant intellect. I would even prefer him to be of no great ability. Stupid people show an inimitable grace in roguery.\\" I at least can't help but be reminded of certain modern political leader.Although I didn't enjoy reading the book as much as I'd hoped, all of the witty phrases and lucid insights make Penguin Island worth the time it takes to slog through a whole imaginary history."},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"Penguin Island by Anatole France.

France has a lovely style in his native language which is at the same time poetic, erudite and easy to read. Reading classic satire makes you realize how we are fundamentally the same and will probably never change. I was struck by a section punctuating the conclusion of the Pyrot ( Dreyfuss ) affair in which he comments that it was back to business as usual:\\"The government remained under the control of the major financial institutions, the army dedicated exclusively to the defense of capital, the navy served only as a source of orders for the steel industry and the rich refused to pay their fair share of taxes.

It may not be everyone's piece of pie, but I defy anyone to say that they have seen its like before."},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"If you like your satire served with brilliant wit with a touch of irony and a side of righteous anger, then Anatole France (the pen name of Jacques Anatole Franois Thibault) is your writer. You can credit Anatole France, winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature, with the famous maxim: \\"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\\"Penguin Island starts with a fantastic premise. A missionary, half blind, comes across the island of penguins and baptizes them. Up in heaven, confounded with this act, the Lord gives the birds souls and intellect. France then uses his new civilization to satirize almost anything within range of his scathing intellect. The book generally parallels the development of human civilization. The longest chapter, the story of Pyrot and the 80,000 Trusses of Hay is a blistering critique of the French government's frame-up of Alfred Dreyfus. This chapter alone justifies the price of the book.For those who have come to this review through my Tour de France history or my cycling commentary, it should be noted that the Dreyfus Affair was the proximate cause of the creation of Tour de France.Anatole France is a genius. I heartily recommend this book.-Bill McGann, Author of \\"The Story of the Tour de France\\""},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"Many previous reviewers have noted the themes of this book--the entertainingly searing critique of social institutions, the imprisoning cycles of human history, the corrupting nature (and unavoidable hypocrisy?) of society/civilization. The weaknesses are amply noted too: at 345 pages, I found this a slow read. One wonders about the purity of the prose in the English translation; it is unclear how much of Anatole France's famously pure style can be appreciated in my volume (a translation by A.W. Evans).I was originally motivated to read this because of the positive reviews (\\"If you like satire, read this book!\\"). After just finishing it, I found it thought-provoking and came up with this hasty list of reactions [SPOILER ALERT]:-With so much indictment of contemporary French society, was Anatole France in favor of discarding civilization altogether--of returning to Rousseau's uncorrupted \\"state of nature\\"? The ruined nation at the end of the novel seems more reminiscent of classical antiquity (shepherds, wine, etc) and yet one would think Mr. France naive to depict a rustic society as any less rife with intrigues, corruption and appetite for power.After the fall of penguin society, natural harmony is temporarily restored to the island (wild horses once again \\"crop the coarse grass\\"). Thus the collapse of human civilization is redemptive, even if it simply sets us up for another long cycle fated to end in ruin. It seems noteworthy that there is a measure of idealism in his final vision, as France was such a profound and noted skeptic.I'm intrigued that his society returns to a state of balance before its inevitable descent into corruption. His view of \\"the future\\" prefigures aspects of Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" and yet there is the ever-present memory of nature (fossils of horses beneath the city) and hope of innocence lying within the future civilization (the two characters at the end - a new Adam and Eve?). This seems to contrast greatly with how visions of the future have since evolved: to the increasingly wretched post-apocalyptic dystopias that we so often see in today's fiction and films (Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" comes to mind).Anatole France has been extolled for his erudition and his bibliophile tendencies. What can we conclude about the value of gaining knowledge --of reading histories that must necessarily regurgitate \\"the best-known ones in the usual way\\"? One feels that a very adroit statement is being made on the role of the historian and those doomed to repeat history as a result of never learning it.Finally, why penguins??Go read this very stimulating book!"},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"Though this was published in 1909 you would swear it just came from Newsweek, Time or The Atlantic magazines. This is both comforting and disturbing to know that there is nothing new under the sun. Same old politics, revising history, putting a new spin on current events and just plain old human tendencies crop up in this great little book. Anatole France captured the daily lives we're familiar with and shows that it's an ongoing story since time began. Comforting because you feel that we're not the only group of people to live through turmoil and disturbing because \\"here we go AGAIN\\". Sometimes it seems a bit tedious but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"I'm reviewing the Modern Library hardcover edition (1932), with a seven-page Introduction by Professor H.R. Steeves of Columbia University. Unfortunately, Modern Library did not list the name of the translator but it is a very first-rate one.This insightful novel was the Magnum opus of Anatole France, one of Europe's finest authors of celebrated world literature. I first broke in to France's writings withAnatole France- A Mummer's Tale.which is a darkly hilarious (an Anatole France hallmark) saga of the French theatre.\\"Penguin Island,\\" however, is a much less provincial tale. Here's what it's all about (literally):An aged and pious priest, during an early epoch, was diverted to Penguin Island by the Devil. The old clergyman's eyesight was quite deficient and, through a comedy of errors, he baptized the entire penguin population of the mythical island! The reader is subsequently transported to the realm of Heaven where God is chairing a theological debate as to what to do about the penguins, ergo: should they each be apportioned a soul that they might ascend to Heaven (or to Hell) when they die? The opinions of the late, great philosophers and saints ensue and God ultimately renders His decision: not only will they be given souls; He will also morph them into a more human (but not entirely human) form.So a new civilization is established. An organized society of a sort commences with these naked penguinoid [my word] primitives but they are swift to evolve. The penguin-people adopt clothing (which launches vanity and jealousy). Then these Penguin Island inhabitants toil through the complex concepts of private property (thereby establishing a hierarchy of leadership and social castes); a census (taxes!); kingdoms (and thus wars and rebellion); the eventual founding of a republic (supplementing greed, tenoned with governmental incompetence of The First Water), and; the ultimate interaction with other cultures (giving rise to even more gluttony and bigger wars, punctuated with rampant racism/anti-Semitism.) In due course, anarchy prevails over all and self-destruction becomes the means to The End. At the conclusion the reader has been retrospectively presented with a fairly accurate history of man.Now, what the story actually epitomizes is an acerbic appraisal of the world's cultures and societies. France has contrived a beautifully candid, (if at times somewhat hyperbolic), parody of intellectual actualities. This work is one gigantic, prophetic metaphor for all that is dreadful regarding mankind, his governments, and his religious institutions. The story clearly demonstrates to anyone who reads it that the insatiable materialism and the widespread lack of ethics associated with politicians in general have not changed one whit since this book was written one hundred years ago! Churchmen at all echelons are similarly scrutinized for their periodic shortcomings. It's all hilariously irreverent.Professor Steeves encapsulates France's genius as an author: \\"The question [of an artist's matured craftsmanship] is not one of years, but of capacity to add continuously and surely to one's intellectual capital, and to utilize that capital to advantage.\\" (Page ix.) Clearly, France had reached a plateau of literary distinction with this intuitive work. I felt compelled to share an excerpt from the text which particularly illustrates France's exquisite brand of humor and which, perhaps tragically, exemplifies such foibles which periodically jut out from within our own judicial system:[A man, a Jew, who is known by all in authority to be innocent, has been imprisoned and awaits public trial. This dialogue, as was France's novelMonsieur Bergeret a Paris (Dodo Press) (French Edition), was no doubt inspired by his important personal role in the infamous Dreyfus Affair wherein a Jewish army officer was falsely convicted of espionage.]\\"'...has he not confessed already? There are tacit confessions; silence is a confession.''...he is not silent; he keeps on squealing like a pig that he is innocent.''...the confessions of a guilty man sometimes result from the vehemence of his denials. To deny desperately is to confess.'\\" (Page 179.)And if Republicans today knew that the following idiosyncratic dialogue had actually been generated in jest a Century ago, they would likely not seize upon a rationale so clearly akin to this one in support their own political posture:\\"'...I have called you together to levy contributions from the people so as to provide for public expenses and the maintenance of monks. I consider that these contributions ought to be in proportion to the wealth of each... he who has a hundred oxen will give ten; he who has ten will give one.'...one of the richest of the Penguins... rose up and said:'For my part I am ready to give up all I possess in the interest of my brother Penguins... We have, then, only to consider the public interest and to do what it requires... what it requires, what it demands, is not to ask much from those who possess much, for then the rich would be less rich and the poor still poorer. The poor live on the wealth of the rich and that is the reason why that wealth is sacred... You will get no great profit by taking from the rich, for they are very few in number; on the contrary you will strip yourself of all your resources and plunge the country into misery. Whereas if you ask a little from each inhabitant without regard to his wealth, you will collect enough for the public necessities and you will have no need to enquire into each citizen's resources... By taxing all equally and easily you will spare the poor, for you will leave them the wealth of the rich.'\\" (Page 48.)While it's difficult to believe, this calculating speech actually gets even more mirthful -- I'm absolutely certain that I have heard parallel oratories by certain contemporary U.S. congressmen.And Democrats would be sagely advised not to snicker too quickly because, with equally clever articulation, France exposes an apposite number of characteristically liberal methods, many of which manifest the donkey platform; I'm particularly thinking, to cite but a single example, about France's penguin union anarchists, bug-eyed radicals who incite both riots and conflagrations which directly result in the death of their own supporters. But here we must keep in mind that France was not at all targeting American political groups -- he was characterizing politicos in general, all of whom have plagued our lives planet-wide since the days of Noah!The astute reader will catch that this tale occasionally slips into a First Person delivery, (read the text on page 89 of this edition.) The work is of average length at 295 pages. This is NOT light fiction... sometimes the reading is a bit rocky but France's thoughts tend to coalesce in retrospect for the reader.Not a lot of people are reading Anatole France (1844-1924, a Nobel Prize of Literature winner) these days but they should. From my view he's right up there with Thomas Hardy, Ivan Turgenev, James Joyce and many other authors of this level of renown.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Penguin Island (Modern Library)","review":"While not as good as Gulivers Travels, this book is an excellent political/religous satirical work.

Really read it. It's a basic book, I won't say it isn't. But it covered so much stuff I'd somehow missed. Like the creation of story scenes.

I've published a lot of work through more than ten different publishers over the past few years, but recently, I've been looking for a good refresher book on characterization, nothing too tedious or geared toward a specific genre. Creating Characters: How to Build Story People turned out to be exactly what I needed.Personally, I found the book to be well organized. If I ever need to brush up on something specific, I could easily pick this book up again, check the table of contents, and know exactly what section I needed to reread. Someone who hasn't read this book could get a pretty good idea of what it contains just by reading the TOC subheadings. Most of the subheadings are quoting the core message behind each chapter. You can almost use the subheadings as a writing cheat sheet. I find that very convenient.The author does cross reference between chapters, which could possibly frustrate some readers, but I had no trouble following the core message in each chapter. Each section is kept very simplistic and on point, which is something else I like about the book. The chapters are helpful without being unnecessarily complex or difficult to navigate.One of the things I like most about this book is that it takes a more organic approach to building characters. You won't find endless pages on archetype, nor are there any psychological profiles to work through. Mr. Swain's book is more about choosing a dominant impression and using rationalization to sort out a character. This is primarily what I was looking for in a book on characterization.Also in this book, you'll find a simplified section about building up a character's personality by adding ideals and values linked to their background. The only other book I've read that touches on ideals and values in such a flowy, organic way is Randy Ingermanson's Writing Fiction For Dummies. (That's another book I highly recommend, although it takes a slightly more complex approach to building and understanding characters.)The only thing I found in Creating Characters that seemed a bit dated was Chapter 11, which is about making your character amusing. The jokes, of course, are very dated and aren't funny at all, but the pattern and point Mr. Swain is trying to get across is still very relevant today. One has to simply keep in mind that the author was from a different generation.Overall, Creating Characters is a solid book on characterization, and I would happily recommend it to writers at any stage in their career. I learned a lot from this book, and I'm sure I'll be referencing it in the future. This is definitely one for my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Creating Characters: How to Build Story People","review":"I have an earlier edition of this book and use it often for the valuable information and examples within.

One does not, for example, start with Labels, proceed to Fleshing Out, and so on. I'm not sure how a writer does create a character, but I doubt it's done by jumping around in random fashion from one method of characterization to another. This book would be so much more valuable if there were some sort of organic flow from one chapter to another, from beginning to end.

Personally, I felt that Swain's book lacked organization and tended to ramble about character traits never really getting down to the meat and potatoes of the subject. The examples seemed to have been put together in a rushed way without much thought. It's almost as if Swain wanted us to know that anything was possible.It's true that anything is possible in writing. That is the reason that many of us become writers, but our unlimited possibilities need to be tempered with believability. I was hoping that Swain would spend more time on discussing what makes a character believable, and what makes a character more real and less like a cardboard cutout. Swain does hit this mark on occasion, but it is nothing more than accidental as the information I was looking for was few and far between.I also found Swain difficult to read because of his rambling. He starts to explain his idea in a new way before finishing the previous explanation. The book seems like he wrote it from the top of his head in one sitting. I was disappointed in this book, and I don't feel that my characters gained anything significant for the time that I spent reading it. There are better books out there that get more involved with characterization without taking up the space."},{"Title":"Creating Characters: How to Build Story People","review":"A whole book on characterization may be just what you need. Is this it? The chapters treat the usual aspects or problems of characterization: making your character real, motivating your character, giving some background of your character, offbeat characters, heroes, amusing characters, describing characters, characterization through dialogue, characters in unfamiliar settings. The central thing, says the author, is to make your character care about something-your character, not necessarily your reader. \\"It doesn't matter whether this something is major or minor, cataclysmic or trivial.\\" (p.1) Doesn't it? How is the reader going to feel about a character who cares about something trivial? According to Swain, this is unimportant. But be forewarned: it may be important to your reader if you choose such a protagonist for your novel.Further: \\"Finding a character means...giving human form to aspects of yourself that you like, or dislike, or wish you had. ... all your characters are you.\\" (p. 7) Besides the fact that many would disagree with this recommendation, it is risky advice.The details of each chapter also will be familiar to anyone who has read other books on writing: give the sex, age, vocation and manner. (p. 15) \\"Manner is...style.\\" (p. 16) And so it goes. How do you do characterization? Adjectives and incidents. (p. 18) This is the kind of vanilla advice this book consists of. \\"It's to your advantage to consider the tastes and prejudices of your particular audience.\\" (p. 54) Such redundant statements are not so much untrue as they are unhelpful. To make your character likeable: \\"The character is striving to attain something. ...The character is today-slanted....

Its simplicity and balanced approach toward designing your characters inside and out will prove successful for beginners as well as a review for more advanced writers.Though it's a great book to own if you are willing to dig for any helpful advice, it does have its major drawbacks. Its organization, at times, reads more like a student's compiled notes than a formally completed book. Chaotic, the chapters succeed in running into each other and create quite a confusion when it comes to understanding connections. Not only this, but I found that I disagreed with quite a bit of its advice.For example, at the beginning of chapter five, the author stipulates that \\"happiness is the universal human goal.\\" Maybe. But what I fail to understand is why Swain chose that as a centerpiece for so much of his book. There are many universal goals, so why choose happiness as the ultimate? \\"Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\\" has a similar tone, but would have provided a more in-depth area to pursue, possibly even more interesting and challenging since it deals with a much more abstract, yet personal, goal.Though I disliked the chaotic and highly disorganized layout, \\"Creating Characters\\" is still a great read if you don't mind sifting through all the verbage and oblivion in order to find the basic elements of character development.\\"I cannot believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be compassionate. It is, above all to matter, to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all.\\" -Leo RostenHappy Reading!"},{"Title":"Creating Characters: How to Build Story People","review":"This book was actually kind of painful to read. It was not awfully written, but there were two factors that made this not a joy for me. 1.) It's quite dated. I expected some of this considering the book is 20 years old, but for a modern writer it's quite off base when it discusses cultural norms, the state of the world and even writing careers and technology. So much so that it's jarring. 2.) I know most of the stuff already written about here. On the plus side, I did pick up a few ideas, and the chapter about writing humor opened my eyes to a few things. Again, not written badly, just not right for me at this point; 15 or 20 years ago I probably would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Creating Characters: How to Build Story People","review":"This book is at once both informative and disorganized.

At best, I consider this book to be a boondoggle (read as: wasted project)."},{"Title":"Pardon Me, But That's a Really Stupid Sign!","review":"I expected to find pictures of actual signs.

The emphasis is on the design and execution of research projects, and includes issues of planning and sampling, measurement, choice of statistical model, and interpretation of results. Frequently, the topics research design, measurement and statistics tend to be covered in three separate texts and any links are left to the struggling student or novice researcher, who too often finds it difficult to integrate these. The aim of this book is to encourage researchers to consider all the assumptions and their interactions when making decisions during the planning of research. They need to take into account the interrelationships between 'technologies' when designing the structure of the study, creating measuring instruments, collecting data, selecting statistical tools, and interpreting the results. Therefore, the statistical tests are not just after-the-fact, but are used as part of the planning process to help make such decisions as sample size and desired reliability of instruments.The titles of the chapters are: Part I: Introduction to Research Design 1 The Nature of Enquiry 2 Beginning the Process 3 Initial Sources of Invalidity and Confounding 4 Basic Designs 5 Identifying Populations and Samples 6 Additional Sources of Confounding by the Measurement Process and Interactions 7 Refining the DesignsPart II: Measurement Design 8 Principles of Measurement and Collecting Factual Data 9 Measuring Attitudes, Opinions and Views 10 Measuring Achievement 11 Evaluating Data Quality: Determining Instrument Reliability and ValidityPart III: Turning Data into Information Using Statistics 12 Descriptive Statistics Using a Spreadsheet 13 Probability and Statistical Significance 14 Power of Statistical Tests Part IV: Ex Post Facto, Experimental, and Quasi-experimental Designs: Parametric Tests 15 Comparing Two Groups: t-test 16 One-way Analysis of Variance: ANOVA 17 Factorial Designs 18 Randomised Block Designs and Analysis of CovariancePart V: Non-Parametric Tests: Nominal and Ordinal Variables 19 Nonparametric Tests: One- and Two-Sample 20 Nonparametric Tests: Multiple- and Related-SamplesPart VI: Describing Non-causal Relationships 21 Correlation and Association 22 Regression"},{"Title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics","review":"There should be a table of contents of this book on theweb.

He gives a more positive, ideology-free reading of many of Freud's basic ideas and thoughts. While he does not advocate tossing theory into the wastebasket, he does enjoin the reader to go deeper into psychoanalytical tenets, to think less dogmatically about them, and to realize that theory is only an aid, not a mold into which each analysand must somehow be forced to fit. The reader must be familiar with psychoanalytical writing in order to get the full benefit from the book, however, since the ideas presented assume that the reader understands their background and meaning."},{"Title":"Beast in the Nursery","review":"This is a collection of layered and complex writing by a clear and humane thinker -- and a wonderful writer.

Readers already have to be close to realizing for themselves the points Phillips is emphasizing in order to be able to &quot;hear&quot; them.If one is ready to hear it, Phillips's discourse on proto-linguistic realms and their residue in &quot;adult&quot; language is a unique and centrally important gem.

My stepson LOVES the movie that this book is based one. :)"},{"Title":"Amazing Adventures from Zoom's Academy: The Capture of the Crimson Cape","review":"Written and illustrated by Jason Lethcoe, Amazing Adventures From Zoom's Academy is the story of Summer Jones' first year at Zoom's Academy. Summer has to learn to cope with this new school, new friends, and face her fears. Hero's are sometimes just as afraid as we are--they just don't give up.Summer is thirteen; her parents are divorced and share custody. She's slightly ashamed of her Dad who invents really weird stuff that usually doesn't work. Her mom is a super-organized attorney. Summer doesn't fit in anywhere and her parents are so different she can't be like them both at the same time and she doesn't know who she is either. Reading this book reminded me of my early teens and I could so empathize with Summer. What child hasn't wished that they could be special so that the other kids would like them and be their friend? It's usually not until you're an adult that all that stuff parents tell you about it being who you are inside that really makes the difference begins makes sense. Amazing Adventures From Zoom's Academy tries, and I think succeeds, in really getting that message across. Summer is a typical young teen looking for an identity in circumstances that are, except for the super powers and the Academy, typical for most young people.I'm sure this book will be fun for adults but children will surely enjoy Summer's klutziness as she begins to suspect she doesn't have any super powers. It's chapters are short and it would make a great read-aloud book for younger children. However, it's written clearly enough for those who are beginning to read on their own."},{"Title":"Amazing Adventures from Zoom's Academy: The Capture of the Crimson Cape","review":"Summer Jones feels like she doesn't belong anywhere and she has no special talent. Her father Jasper is a nerd like her who invents things that don't work. One day while playing in a soccer game Summer does something that makes Jasper feel that she is very special and to prove his assertion he places a ring on her finger. It emits a blue glow which means she has a superpower.Jasper takes her by rocket to Zoom's Academy where she is tested to find out what powers she may have. She flunks all of the tests but the faculty allows her to stay on at the academy in the hopes her power will manifest itself. The school's enemies, the students from the Graves Academy for the Villainous Arts attack the academy and Summer is the only one who can assure the heroes a victory but first she must believe in herself and her power.This tale will appeal to the Harry Potter crowd. Readers will empathize and sympathize with Summer because almost everyone at one time or another feels like the odd person out; Summer feels like she doesn't belong anywhere and she doesn't have what it takes to be a hero. Although aimed at the young teen crowd, adults will enjoy this bold tale and will want to see the movie version of Zoom's Academy coming out soon.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"1,000 More Jokes for Kids","review":"This book is VERY FUNNY! there are a couple jokes that aren't too funny..but the rest...they crack you up!

I couldn't recommend this book without a number of caveats.It was valuable in its time, for countering that Victorian view of the angelic depoliticised and emasculated Shelley. But it's still a document of its time.There are two things that were wrong with the book even at the time it was written. One is the constant failure to mention instances of Shelley's extraordinary generosity and kindness to others. Maybe it was boring, to a 1970s writer, to mention the old women carried in out of the cold, the children fed, the money given away to strangers in hard times: but to leave most of it out badly distorts the reality of Shelley. He was no saint, but he was a remarkably kind person, and practical with it, and that central and salient characteristic is glossed over, though &quot;gloss&quot; is not quite the word. White's earlier biography is actually more comprehensive on this sort of thing.The second issue is a grotesque mis-reading of the &quot;Adelaide Shelley&quot; affair, in which Shelley put his name down as the father of an Italian baby. Holmes invents from whole cloth an incident in which Shelley seduced the maid, turning her out of the house when she became pregnant. This is simply bizarre, as Holmes himself later acknowledged. In his next book, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, Holmes concedes that not only was there no evidence in favour of this claim, but that it would have been completely out of character for all three of the key figures (Shelley, Claire Clairemont and the maid whose name, from memory, is something like Paola Foggi) who would have had to have been involved in Holmes' scenario.The story, acknowledged by Holmes to be false, did Shelley's reputation enormous harm (Paul Johnson siezed on it, and added inaccuracies of his own, for his attack on Shelley in the ludicrous &quot;Intellectuals&quot; book; Johnson's Shelley chapter is virtually a cut and paste job from Holmes).So this has always frustrated me: Why on earth hasn't Holmes corrected it in a later edition? I suspect that Holmes feels that it is a form of integrity, of trueness to himself as a young man, or something, to leave the book in its current form. But since the book is supposed to be a record about Shelley, not Holmes, I'd rather he made this and other corrections.As well as that, there's new information about the circumstances of Shelley's break with his family, and about his life in Italy, which Holmes doesn't include, because they are based on documents that have only recently come to light or been studied.So while this was a landmark in its time, it is from this distance not as good as some earlier biographies, and it is due for replacement. If I were to recommend a biographical work to someone with a strong interest in Shelley, I'd recommend his Letters.Laon (no relation)"},{"Title":"Shelley: The Pursuit","review":"How is it possible that the world's largest online bookstore doesn't stock any biography of Shelley? He was, after all, not just a poet, but a fascinating character even without taking his literary accomplishments into account. I found Mr. Holmes's great biography in an Oxford, UK bookstore. And I must say it's amazing. I can't believe it was written by a 28-year-old. The research done here is nothing short of astounding. I must say, however, that the long pages devoted to Shelley's political creed and activities can get a bit wearisome - at least for me, who was more interested in the personal and literary aspects of his life, than in the political ones - but then, I understand that this reflects my personal preferences, and admit it doesn't much deter from the book's qualities. In fact, you could say it makes it more solid and thorough, in including a part of Shelley's life that has been traditionally neglected by his biographers.A nice feature of Mr. Holmes's work is the description of the physical places in Shelley's life - for instance, the house where he was born and the ones which he inhabited during his years in Italy. All of these had some endearing and fascinating trait, from the rolling lawns of Field Place to the sun-soaked terrace of the Casa Magni. I only wish these descriptions had been more in-depth, since it is obvious that Shelley often built strong emotional connections with the places where he lived. I look forward to reading &quot;Footsteps&quot;, which is the account of Holmes's literary travels and research, and which is already awaiting me in my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Shelley: The Pursuit","review":"As a Shelley lover I've read numerous biographies, but this will be the last one as no amount of research or writing talent can improve on this book. Richard Holmes clearly did an enormous amount of research and his attention to detail is extraordinary. His love for his subject comes through strongly yet he remains objective throughout and is not blind to Shelley's flaws. His descriptive writing also paints a fascinating picture of the interesting and tough times during which Shelley lived and his wonderful vocabulary had me reaching for my dictionary many times!. He pays as much attention to the other colourful characters in Shelley's life as he does to the poet himself. His analysis of Shelley's complex psyche is intense and I believe his perceptions are very accurate. This book impressed and excited me more than any biography I have ever read."},{"Title":"Shelley: The Pursuit","review":"After reading Miranda Seymour's biography of Mary Shelley I looked around for an account of P. B. Shelley and found this excellent biography of the poet. The whole generation and family from Mary Wollstonecraft onwards makes a dynastic epic, and a good history of the social politics of a radical generation living through the Restoration. There the ethereal Shelley myth is corrected by a portrait of a radical who had the courage and will to attempt to extract himself form his aristocratic family and class to pursue a radical dream in the unforgiving world of the reactionary wake of the French Revolution. Literary portraits of Shelley still suffer the fate of the poet's work after his death when his reputation was crippled by the conservative age against he revolted. It reminds one of the fate of the Sixties in the minds of the (current) powers that be. It is significant, and mostly forgotten, that the early Queen Mab that so shocked the establishments of the times passed into the bloodstream of the left via the radical underground press, thence to influence the early labor movements and Chartists. Meanwhile the image of Shelley was sanctified by several packs of lies as the quality of genius forced its way into anthological immortality."},{"Title":"Shelley: The Pursuit","review":"Shelly:The Pursuit. By Richard HolmesAlthough I appreciate the incredible details of this book, I could not get past the first hundred pages. Clearly Mr. Holmes \\"knows\\" his subject in that he has done exhaustive research. But it seems that he really dislikes Shelley, so I was puzzled as to why he would even bother to spend so much of his life with him. I tired of Mr. Holmes constantly driving the point home that Shelley was crazy and spoiled. He was also one of the most amazing characters to come out of the 19th century, a visionary, a political activist who sacrificed all creature comforts to pursue his egalitarian ideals and, of course, he was one of the most gifted poets I've ever read. None of this comes across in this book. Mr. Holmes seems determined, over and over again, to portray Shelley as nothing more than a spoied brat. His very real convictions come across has tantrums. Mr. Holmes will typically throw out phrases like \\"this is one of Shelley's typically overblown poems\\", without stopping to anaylize what he means.

Francis chafes at the restrictions the crown puts to the press, and his outspokenness often gets him in trouble (actually, he ends up in jail for a stint because of it). The other two main characters in the book are exiled Frenchwoman Gabrielle de Salle (who Frank is head over heels in love with) and *Riding Bobby*, Sir Robert Wilson, a highly respected soldier despite his frequent tangles with his superiors. Frank signs on as a war correspondent and follow Sir Robert during the Peninsular wars, and again to Russia during Napoleon's Russian campaign and retreat - plus he's got his beloved Gabrielle to save.I've been putting off writing a full review on this one for about two weeks and I've realized it's not going to happen, I've got writer's block and this is one of those books that is too difficult to properly review (plus this is cutting into my reading time). I did enjoy this, although it was one of those books I could put down and pick it up again when the mood struck me, so it's not a page turner. I liked using Frank's career as a newsman to give the reader a different look at historical events, especially with the battles in the Peninsula campaign - hard to explain but it's a different way for the reader to observe the battles. If you are new to this period of history, I wouldn't recommend this book as the one to get you started, but worth while for those more familiar with Napoleon's Peninsula and Russian campaigns."},{"Title":"Ride With Me","review":"Thomas Costain is always a great read!

Stafford King had devoted his time to smashing the Colonel's gang. The Colonel was accused of robbing a merchant of sixty thousand pounds by means of card tricks. Cocaine, dope fiends, gambling, show girls, and stage-door Johnnies add tricky obstacles and frightening drama.

As usual Wallace crafts his story around a larger than life villain, seasons the pot with interesting characters, then provides a surprise ending to wrap it all up. Wallace always had the knack for creating a complicated plot, peopling his stories with lots of well drawn characters, winding it all up with lots of twists and turns, and then letting it rip. Essentially this is sensationalist pulp fiction with style and verve. You never have to worry about the plot running off on a tangent as a page or two later the story is always back on track and Wallace never loses the pace. In lesser hands this story might leave the reader's mind struggling with credulity as the plot unfolds, but, in the hands of a master story teller like Wallace the reader's attention is never left to wander off in that direction. One could argue the point that what Wallace was at heart is a teller of tall tales and that this story is as tall a tale as any ever told. There is a craft to writing, and Edgar Wallace displays a mastery of his craft in this tale."},{"Title":"Jack O' Judgment","review":"I really enjoyed this classic thriller. The characters were well developed and the plot moves well. The Jack O'Judgment character reminded me of the V For Vendetta character. The whole bit where his voice appears from nowhere was interesting and had me wondering. I think Edgar Wallace must have been a very gifted story teller. This is one book that all thriller readers should enjoy. Take modern day thrillers, set them nearly a hundred years ago, mix that in with some old Sherlock Holmes and you have Jack O'Judgment! A fantastic read from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Jack O' Judgment","review":"While not my favorite mystery of Edgar Wallace's (that would either be ANGEL OF TERROR or THE MAN WHO KNEW), this certainly is a good, fast-paced thriller. The villain, Colonel Boundary, isn't as interesting as I'd hoped he would be, and Jack O'Judgement is an idea that isn't as well executed as I hoped (his plans and backstory are cool).But the set-pieces are rather enjoyable, as is the plotting. And the sentimentality isn't overdone."},{"Title":"Jack O' Judgment","review":"This book held my interest like no other has for a long time. Not only was it well-written (very update considering the period it was written), but it was amazing to me that Wallace could pack in all those details and still keep the story moving.I nearly always have a strong feeling about whodunit and maybe the reason I was so surprised was that we already knew whodunit and the real mystery was WHO WAS JACK O' JUDGMENT?I agree with another reviewer that the story ends the way we want it to, not only for the police detective and his girl but for a couple of the not-so-bad crooks."},{"Title":"Tranquility: Pathways to Inner Peace","review":"This is by far the best book written on how to apply the 12 steps to real life. I constantly recommend it. I would like to buy more to give to friends (and my copy is falling apart) but it is currently unavailable. How do we get this book re-printed? It is too good and too soon to be put in book heaven."},{"Title":"Tranquility: Pathways to Inner Peace","review":"I bought this book for myself and gave it to my husband to read. He's is not a person who particularly enjoys or would normally even consent to read a &quot;self-help&quot; book. He did, however, read it and found it very inspiring. So much so that he kept my copy and I had to purchase my own. This book is full of creative ways to deal with our emotions and strengthen our relationships. It is based on the premise that one needs to learn to be at peace with themself before one can effectively deal with the external world around us, and gives effective tools to aid in the process. The ideas are similar to those of say Deepak Chopra's &quot;Seven Spiritual Laws of Success&quot;, but is a little easier to absorb, as the author uses examples based on his own experiences as a survivor of alcoholism. I re-read this book often to remind myself of certain truths when life seems to be spinning out of control. Just reading the book -- even without doing any of the meditation or exercises -- is comforting. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tranquility: Pathways to Inner Peace","review":"I was loaned this book - and have not returned it yet.

It has been a great help to me. I recommend it for you, too."},{"Title":"The Lonesome Cobbler","review":"For those who have an interest in a new and upcoming author, then you have found that in Conti. His first book The Lonesome Cobbler, is a very interesting read, and is from a unique viewpoint of World War 2 in its most critical time. What makes his viewpoint and storytelling ability so interesting is that he writes in Orwellian overtures from the peasants perspective. There are also some very strong tones to the likes of Catch-22, and Conti comes to similar conclusions, but from real life experience. This book is universal in the sense that it speaks powerfully regarding how the world really works, the underfight between the haves and have-nots, and his \\"cafoni\\" are akin to Orwell's \\"proles\\", or proletariat.Conti has a few other books in the works, and am looking forward to them."},{"Title":"The Lonesome Cobbler","review":"T'is true...people don't have the time that they use to for reading, including me. I MADE the time after reading just a small portion of this very well written book. This wonderful story is swell for all ages, backgrounds and gender.

Conti is writing more, I'll be in the checkout line with the book(s) open...great story teller."},{"Title":"The Lonesome Cobbler","review":"The Lonesome Cobbler is a great story of struggle during WWII in Italy. Mr. Conti writes with passion and humor. As I read this wonderfully descriptive story, I had very vivid images of the characters and places.

I'm definitely looking forward to more books from this gifted author!"},{"Title":"The Lonesome Cobbler","review":"The Lonesome Cobbler is a must read for all generations of Italian ancestory.

As Fascism tries to take over the town, and the men are taken into the army, the lonesome cobbler and the town priest thwart the Fascist party enforcers and also keep up the spirits of the townspeople.The story finishes with a dramatic and surprising ending. Wonderfully told with sensitivity and humor,this book is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"BBC Walking with Prehistoric Beasts: 3D Beasts","review":"I bought this book (and the companion sticker book) for my four year old daughter, who is crazy about the BBC Walking with Dinosaurs DVD set. The description made it clear that the book was about prehistoric beasts, not just dinosaurs, but there is nary a dinosaur to be found. The book is OK, but would have been a much greater success if it had included some of the creatures from the dinosaur series.

She has never been able to get them right. The first day the book came in she drew the body of the horse unbelievably well. Just by following the guidelines in two of the pages.

It has been her favorite for three years. We have been regularly checking it out from our local library and finally I decided it would be easier to just buy it for her. She loved it and continues spending hours practicing the Savitt techniques to improve her artistic abilities."},{"Title":"Draw Horses With Sam Savitt","review":"This book is a great book for anyone trying to learn the anatomy and body posturing of horses. Sam Savitt has done what most \\"how to draw\\" books have not, he not only shows you how to draw horses but there is obvious emotion in the drawings themselves. (from an artist's point of view I can clearly see it but some others might not). Like if on of his how to's is of a horse being angry, he draws the body, the movement, and especially the look on the face and in the eyes in an angry tone and actually captures that emotion in his image. This would be a great book for art and animal enthusiast to own. Just remember that it's not a coloring book and that this item is no longer being printed as of a good 10-15 years ago. So whatever books are out there now are the only ones left. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Draw Horses With Sam Savitt","review":"It would be hard to find a better resource for drawing horses than this book. It covers motion, anatomy, in a clear enjoyable way. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Draw Horses With Sam Savitt","review":"Great book for the beginners and the advanced. For young artists, Savitt sometimes uses large words and is a bit picky with some drawing styles that may not be seen by a young eye.

They include a variety of topics, and different reading levels for all ages. Whether it may be a read-aloud or a high school senior, this book is satisfying for everyone. Along with these great short stories, poems that relate to them, have been added at the end of many of the stories to go along with the themes. The three sections of the book include, \\"Stories of Impact\\", \\"Stories of Depth\\", and \\"Stories to Think About\\". You will not get bored with the selection and you're guaranteed to want more. From cannibals, to loving fathers, to haircuts, it has everything. In my opinion, this is the best selection of short stories ever."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"As a member of AA, I'm well aware of some of it's weaknesses. I was hoping to find, in this book, some improvements to AA, but I came away with the impression that the actions suggested in this book would be at *least* as difficult as the 12 steps. Yes, it takes away the &quot;god&quot; part of AA, which is a big stumbling block for a lot of people, but Dorsman then spends an entire chapter describing the ideal diet that will help you recover from alcoholism. It seemed unrealistic to me.I also think it would be difficult for someone who's just starting to quit drinking to go through pick which of Dorsman's suggestions they want to do. Recovery is a lot of hard work, and my guess is that most people need the structure of a 12-step or other program to help them through at least the first part of recovery. I was pleased to see that Dorsman listed some existing programs that are alternative to AA, and a nice listing of relaxation techniques and &quot;inspirations&quot; that could be incorporated to any recovery program."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"This author is thorough and positive. He describes many factors which can be helpful in recovery. Many people with alcohol abuse difficulties do not want to attend AA for one reason or another. Mr. Dorsman is able to describe an alternative process,and maintain a positive outlook. It is refreshing. I will admit, however, that a few of his descriptives were a bit far fetched. Generally a good alternative book about alcohol abuse and recovery."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"The title of this book, \\"How to Quit Drinking Without AA\\", assumes a key premise - that quitting drinking is the paramount thing for an alcoholic. The title does not mention that its intended audience is the alcoholic, but if one is not alcoholic, then they probably have not come to this book for help. If one is, then the solution they seek must be one that is effective for their disease. That said, I'm writing this review from the alcoholic point of view, rather than some other type of heavy drinker.If quitting drinking were the paramount thing in solving the disease of alcoholism, then the solution would be simple. Eliminate the physical cravings that are set up by the physical addiction. Any garden variety detoxification unit is your answer - and any local hospital will have a competent detox unit. But, frankly, if all you need is detox, then you're not dealing with the disease of alcoholism.Alcoholism has less to do with drinking itself, than it does with the root causes that lead an alcoholic to drink. Why would a perfectly sober alcoholic, not suffering the cravings that are symptomatic only of physical addiction to drink, choose to pick up that first drink that then leads to re-establishment of the addiction? It seems like madness - and, it is.Any alcoholic who has broken the bonds of craving, simply to find themselves led back to the whole vicious cycle, knows the problem isn't simply about stopping drinking. Alcoholics are driven back to that first drink by something beyond physical addiction alone. The only effective type of treatment for alcoholism, then, has to involve something something to treat that obsession that leads one back to pick up that first drink.Bottom line, AA does not claim to be the ONLY solution to the problem of alcoholism - simply that it has a solution that works for a great number of alcoholics. Perhaps the fellow who wrote this book is onto something - perhaps not. In either case, it will have nothing to do with whether someone should or should not try AA. Nor should this be a subject which is treated with a black and white worldview of \\"this won't work\\" - because, when one is at the bottom of their despair, such a worldview could cost their life.I hope that the individual who comes to rely on this book will find a solution that works. But if they don't, please remember that there are other options."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"I found this book very informative though a little preachy and new agey in some spots. It offers an alternative perspective on recovery."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"There was a time I disliked AA and it's sub-culture. Tried this book and like many things I tried, it didn't work ... for me. My rating would have been higher if I didn't see so many inaccuracies in regards to the AA program. What's funny is that at one time I agreed with 90% of it. Jerry Dorsman may mean well, however much of what he had to say in regards to AA was inaccurate under the &quot;Problems With AA&quot; topic.1) AA does not neglect the physical and/or the disease concept. In the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; the disease concept is clear in the Doctor's Opinion and it is spoken about frequently in the meetings I attend.2) AA does not necessarily require social involvement. There are those in AA who live in obscure places or are physically housebound. These people can connect via mail and their non-involvement in AA meetings does not keep them from practising the 12-steps. If there is not an alcoholic to carry the message to, there is always somebody out there somewhere one can reach out to ... if only to call to say hello or give a smile. The alturistic part of AA has it's purpose in getting the alcoholic's mind to think about someone other than one's own self.3) God does not have to be a &quot;Him&quot;. I know of members who refer to their Higher Power as a Goddess. I am non-religious and non-Christian. My spirituality has been metaphysically based and incorporates both non-tradition western and eastern philosophies. AA is NOT a religion and does not require one to be religious. It is &quot;not allied with any denomination, sect, politics or institution.&quot; per the preamble.4) AA's do not insist that anyone calls themselves an alcoholic. &quot;The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking&quot;. This is per the 3rd Tradition of AA.5) The AA way of life...which is the incorporating of the 12-steps in one's life is a holistic approach. Self-caring is part of recovery and cleaning up harmful habits is a natural progression.Since my own recovery, I've quit nicotine, caffeine, sugar, and I work out regularly. I am not unique in this.True, AA is not for everybody. My sincere best wishes to all alcoholics seeking recovery of any sort in any way. May this book be your answer or lead you closer to it. Peace be with all of you, your families, and friends."},{"Title":"How to Quit Drinking without AA: A Complete Self-Help Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book a couple weeks ago after reading a couple pages online, and finally got started on it at 3am -- couldn't sleep, hadn't drunk enough yesterday. The negative reviewers rely on slamming Dorsman as anti-AA, which he is not. He simply (and effectively, if you read it without that pre-supposition) communicates that AA is not for everyone. We are not cookies, all made from the same cookie-cutter. If it works for you, I'm very pleased for you. I know of AA successes, and I know of cases where AA was not successful. He suggests trying a few meetings. I very well may, though I suspect it is not for ME... I feel that the Dorsman approach will work better for ME. I am a firm believer in diet-based &quot;treatment.&quot; We truly are what we eat and drink (WATER!) To believe otherwise is to believe that sugar, booze, bio-engineered foods, pesticides and herbicides (eg Roundup,) hormones (eg rBgh,) animal antibiotics (eg, those widely used in poultry farming) are harmless or even beneficial. We didn't get to the 21st century by consuming those products thoughout history.

It is simply a comprehensive guide to alcohol addiction treatment that does not focus on one methodology, but all of them. No one therapy can boast a cure-all for every single person afflicted. One would be naive to think so (or is brainwashed). I'm not saying that one should not be proud of their accomplishment, believe strongly in how they recovered, and promote it. But, when your promotion is putting down other recovery methods that have worked for others, then that is foolish. The greater good is served when we embrace all methodologies; and just as each one of us is unique, we need to accept that certain methods for treatment will suit some people better than others. Why wouldn't we want to promote this? How does this harm anyone? The truth is it doesn't! It's just that a LOT of people in AA seem to think, (and will TELL you) that AA is the ONLY way to recover from your alcohol or drug problem. This is NOT true...so PLEASE do not believe this! There are MANY viable alternatives to aa, which this book reveals.If you want solutions and are wondering where to start or look, look no further than this book. It is the best stepping stone you can use to recover from alcoholism. But, if you think Jerry Dorsman would have you believe this book is all you need, you're wrong. This book will open your eyes and give you hope for a life fulfilled and full of happiness finally.

The reason I ask you to is that they have lost sight of the overall perspective and value of this wonderful manual. One reviewer, with their religious overtones, would probably have one replace one addiction with another. I don't believe that individual truly understands spirituality. I won't elaborate any further. Ignorance makes itself known.Jerry Dorsman's book simply is a comprehensive guide to alcohol addiction treatment that does not focus on one methodology, but all of them.

Why wouldn't we want to promote this? How does this harm anyone? Actually, it harms far more people if we chose to compartmentalize our problems like so many bills at the end of the month. I feel I can comment on this at length because I have used Jerry Dorsman's book extensively in treating not only alcohol addiction but other substance abuse problems. I have worked doubly with the chronically mentally ill and addicts of alcohol and drugs. Mostly, I have worked with the dually-diagnosed, those that are afflicted with both mental illness and addictions problems. I have seen tremendous results from my use and reference of this book. I encourage others to buy it to become more effective! Trust me, because I am a real person in the real world treating real people with real problems.

I feel that mentioning AA in the title is important in that I had been looking for an alternative to AA (which I used successfully and UNHAPPILY for 3 tears). A title is of course what you first take note of in a bookstore. It is not an AA bashing book, it is far too ethical for that.

And this book helped me to do that, by presenting new ideas and insights, with lots of clearly written information, and suggestions to try.This book is not anti-AA in tone, nor does it suggest that individuals should not use any group support (AA or otherwise).

I have tried AA and stayed sober for some time, but in the long run, it didn't work for me. I couldn't accept the first 3 steps of the 12, so I looked for an alternative. Unfortunately, this book is just factually wrong. The basis for the recovery program is based on Dorsman's assertion that alcohol is metabolized into glucose, so that alcohol consumption is equivalent to eating suger, causing hypoglycemia etc. This is plain wrong! Alcohol does have empty calories, but not because alcohol is a sugar. Alcohol is metabolized via it's own pathway through acetaldehyde to acetic acid to carbon dioxide (not glucose!) Your body will preferentially burn alcohol over any other foods since it is a poison and your body is desperately trying to get rid of the poison. As a byproduct of the metabolism, energy is generated.There are much better books for those looking to quit drinking without AA, Two suggestions: \\"The Easy Way to Stop Drinking\\" by Allen Carr and \\"Alcohol: How to give it up and be glad you did\\" by Philip Tate.I also wholeheartedly endorse giving AA a try. It didn't work for me, but it has worked for many people.

He may try Rational Recovery, inevitably fail, and if he lives through his next relapse, he may find that the 12-step programs that have worked for millions of others will also set him free from his addiction.

In the 19th century, camels were imported from the Middle East, along with Arab and Afghan drivers. Well, many camels got loose and bred in the Australian Outback. The legacy of this was that the railway going from Alice Springs was called the Ghan, after those Afghani drivers.The book is a short rendition of how the railway finally got to be built. Fuller describes the desolation of the Outback and the many obstacles met. The railway did not have the significance of the continent spanning lines in the US and Canada. The volume of traffic on the railway after it was built was rather modest. But at least for Australians, the account is a footnote in the nation's development."},{"Title":"James in a Mess and Other Thomas the Tank Engine Stories (Thomas & Friends) (Pictureback(R))","review":"Without going on too much, these stories are fragmented, unclear, poorly written, and the plots are lame and basically make no sense. I wrote a more in depth reveiw for \\"Edward's Exploit\\", which we bought along with this one. While some other (but most definitely not all) Thomas books revolve around a core group of charaters and seem to teach lessons and have some excitement to them, this book has a new character speaking less and less sense on every page. My toddler can't get into these.My two year old will read \\"Trouble for Thomas\\", \\"A Cow on the Line\\" and \\"Thomas gets Tricked\\" over and over and over, but he lost interest in this collection of stories before we had even read it once. It wouldn't have been too hard for me to have read one story before buying this, but since the other Thomas books we had we such hits I figured I didn't need to . . . BIG mistake!"},{"Title":"James in a Mess and Other Thomas the Tank Engine Stories (Thomas & Friends) (Pictureback(R))","review":"Our 4 year-old is excited about Thomas the Tank Engine characters, but I don't think he understands the points which these stories are making. I think he likes the *idea* of it being a Thomas book more than he enjoys listening to these stories themselves. He is just as happy to look briefly at the pictures while I summarize the story.I know that the stories intend to teach good moral lessons, but I am sometimes uncomfortable about how they attempt to do this. For example, James is rude to some less polished train cars, so they take delight when James' resentful freight cars make James crash, causing tar to get all over James' nice paint job. The underlying message (don't be rude to others) may be lost on children who see all the characters behaving in unkind ways toward others."},{"Title":"James in a Mess and Other Thomas the Tank Engine Stories (Thomas & Friends) (Pictureback(R))","review":"Not only does this collection of tales contain the usually wonderful Thomas tales, but it features actual photographs to accompany the stories. These add a realistic touch to the sticky mess James gets in after making fun of another engine, only to have a load of goo land all over him! All the tales (several more follow) follow suit. For example, 'Percy Proves A Point' is a fun illustration of the pleasant surprises that await someone who push themselves just a little harder than they thought they could...and the joy of celebrating those victories with friends."},{"Title":"James in a Mess and Other Thomas the Tank Engine Stories (Thomas & Friends) (Pictureback(R))","review":"We are not intimately familiar with the \\"Thomas\\" franchise, but my son selected this book from his preschool library and I read it to my children that afternoon.

These precious instructions are the most profound teachings of Highest Yoga Tantra and are the supreme method for purifying our environment, body, and mind.Geshe Kelsang gives detailed instructions on the eleven yogas of generation stage, which provide us with a special method for transforming all our daily activities into the spiritual path. In Guide to Dakini Land he also clearly explains the completion stage practices of Vajrayogini practice, which lead us to full enlightenment.There is no other book out there that describes the visualizations, practices, and methods with such clarity and depth. This book contains everything a Vajrayogini practioner needs to embark upon and complete the path to enlightenment. I feel so fortunate to have this book as a resource. I recommend it to all Vajrayogini practitioners who have the wish to deepen their experience of generation stage and completion stage. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso also provides a wealth of information on how to do a qualified Tantric retreat and how to build a strong foundation based upon Buddha's Sutra teachings, so our minds are well-prepared for Tantric initiations and subsequent practice."},{"Title":"Guide to Dakini Land: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice Buddha Vajrayogini","review":"As most of the previous reviewers have pointed out, this is for practitioners who have received the Vajrayogni empowerment. How do you get that? You join the author's sect (NKT) and after spending hundreds of dollars on \\"warm-up\\" teachings, eventually you can spend even more to get the empowerment at one of his pricey festivals.The money charged at the teachings and fetivals does not go to charity or to any good causes, unless you think building more NKT resorts, NKT golf courses and NKT World Peace Cafes is charity. Everything goes to building Gyatso's world financial empire or to fund his unseemly and on-going political wars with other Buddhist traditions.If you are easily influenced and have an inclination to believe in magic, the book (and the reviews for this volume) may be tempting with the usual Gyatso promise of \\"easy enlightment\\" (as if it came in a bottle), however, no one in the author's New Kadampa Tradition have ever done so, so the carrot they dangle in front of potential newcomers has no flavor.UPDATE 1Dr. Dean: Your comment requires accepting your word as indisputable. Since you provide no actual facts to support any of your comments (i.e.: \\"As far as no one has ever done so rest assured they have\\"), readers should disregard them as merely hearsay or wishful thinking. I certainly do not \\"rest assured\\" NKT members have been enlightened simply because Dr. Dean says they have. Oh yeah, by the way \\"Doctor\\" Dean: if you vote unhelpful for all of my reviews as you have, Amazon notices and your votes don't count. If you spent less time trying to exact revenge and more time practicing what you preach, you would be a better person for it.UPDATE 2A second comment comes from someone who stalks my reviews all around the world... bitterly complaining about them. On the one hand, she states Buddhists should not say anything critical about other Buddhists. On the other, she also admits to demonstrating against the Dalai Lama in another of her angry comments left for one of my reviews. The hypocrisy is astounding. I do not claim to be a superior Buddhist, however my Karma must be good enough to have given me the wisdom to leave NKT. Otherwise I would have ended up like my critics: \\"Do as I say, not what I do\\" ...but who can blame her? She is emulating her living god, Gyatso. Poor, angry self-righteous pseudo-Buddhists... I genuinely feel bad for them. I too once drank the Kool-Aid and know what is like to temporarily forget the meaning of hypocrisy.UPDATE 3By other teachers, do you mean the children Gyatso \\"ordains\\" (which he has no authority to do), or do you mean by authentic Buddhist teachers from genuine Buddhist sects, which NKT frowns upon and will not recognize? Gyatso is the pseudo-Buddhist, not I, as I do not claim to be more than I am. I also use my real name and do not hide behind \\"exotic\\" Buddhist names as some of my critics do, which only indicates how self-important they consider themselves.There is a common thread with all of the negative comments for my review: all of the writers are apparently failing miserably with their practice. They all claim I am the one who is angry, not realizing I am merely smiling with regards to their hypocrisy via their demonstrable rage."},{"Title":"Guide to Dakini Land: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice Buddha Vajrayogini","review":"If you are a serious student of this teaching, you simply have to own this book.

This books describes precisely the developpement phase corresponding to the mahayoga of the \\"ancient\\" classification, but this is not the only one book on that. It is very precious in the fact that it contains also the practice of the body mandala which corresponds to the completion phase of anuyoga of the ancient classification, and this is very rare in public diffusion. Gesh&eacute; Guelsang Gyatso has made with this book the highest gift: the gift of the Dharma. And this is the first paramita.This completion phase is precisely described with the chanels and chakras, and with the moving of white and red wind wirepools comming from the crown and root chakras and merging in the heart chakra. This is similar to practices of other non buddhist esoteric yogas and as such very interesting. Except from the fact that on a religious point of view it is advised not to do that, on a technical point of view you can do these yogas just by reading this part of the book. I have received the transmission in a long retreat of an other lineage, but it was more confusing than this book. Sorry for the integrists.This book is progressive, with the history of the transmission, the preliminary practices, and is written with such devotion that I was very moved when reading it. And I read it many times. I practiced according to the book because my notes at the retreat where unusable and the sadhana booklet ignored the completion phase and replaced it by boring prayers. After some months of practice, I had a sign which increased my buddhist faith. Buddha told us to experiment by ourselves and reject what is not suitable for us, be it advised by brahamins or masters. You can try with this book."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - The Debt","review":"The reivew by Ms. Klausner covers the plot. My point is to say whether or not I liked the book well enough to buy it. Yes, I do. I was pleasantly surprised to find this author and hope he has a long and fruitful writing career. His main character, New York Police Officer Steve Burnett, is young enough that I hope Mr. Brennan writes a series with this character.There was no sex in the book for which I was grateful. The languange was bearable, but I prefer no-sex/no-bad language. I have not commented on the paper a publisher used before--but the paper in The Debt felt really smooth and was a pleasure to feel between the fingers when holding and turning pages. I gave the book 5 stars because I liked the story, liked the character, and appreciated its relative cleanness in our day and age. But really, I would rate the story itself as 3.5 only because it was short and not really very in debth, but I do give it a 5 for the pleasure reading this book gave me. I hope there will be more books by Tom Brennan."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - The Debt","review":"Horror author Carl Shaw joins New York Police Officers Steve Burnett and Sam Hollis on mobile patrol. When the cops stop for a sandwich at Lazzini's Deli, a robber shoots both cops. Carl takes out an illegal hidden gun and kills the criminal. Afterward, Carl tells Detective Mendez that he grabbed the gun from the ground where the shooter dropped it when Steve shot him. Mendez tells Steve that the gun was used in a murder of college student Sarah Westlake last year in Eastham, Vermont, Carl's hometown.Before talking with Mendez, Steve needs to know the truth. On leave, Steve travels to Vermont, but as he investigates the case takes a strange turns. Files are missing at the periodical Eastham Courier; the link between Sarah and Carl surface; finally he accidentally meets Carl's wife in a bar. Though still sore from his injury Steve seeks the truth because if Carl is the killer he must tell Mendez what came down at the deli; if he is not a murderer, silence is golden.More a private investigative tale than a police procedural, THE DEBT is an intriguing personnel drama as Steve believes he owes a great debt to Carl, but if the author is a killer does he turn him in or if he stays quite pay his tab. The action-packed story line moves forward rather quickly whether it takes place on the streets of New York or small town Vermont. The support cast (in both settings) consists of a fine secondary group, but this thriller belongs to the hero facing an increasingly difficult dilemma.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Papa: A Personal Memoir","review":"While researching Hemingway's life, I was happy to discover this brief biography of one of the most intriguing and talented American writers.

He's not a writer and doesn't seem neither to try to become one nor to emulate his father's talents (although he tells us that he did try just both, when he was young). Instead, he gives more than a couple of interesting anecdotes. He puts some light on Hemingway's obsessions with his image and macho figure. At the time I read this book, a probably silly association came to my mind: Walt Whitman (another American hero from another age) and his supposed homosexuality -a complex statement that I, basicaly, disagree with. There're some aspects in Hemingway's postures in this book that made me think about his own unassumed conflicts with homosexual feelings and his image as a boxer and a 'viril' writer.

I have never written a review but feel it is my duty to do so to warn u of this terrible book."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"The book is very Russian, the best book about Russia by a non-Russian I have read. This is because it is concerned much with literature, publishing books and ethical dilemmas so dear to the Russians.I argue that *The Russia House* is neither the *spy thriller*, nor the *love triangle* story. Yes, there are elements of both, but these are decoys, literary devices the skilled literati John Le Carr&eacute; uses to confuse us while he is paying his tribute to the memory of the other literati - Boris Pasternak.The hidden hero of the book is Boris Pasternak. The character Goethe in the book is an embodiment of this remarkable Russian writer and poet.The clues are everywhere - Barley Blair meets Goethe at the party in the soviet writers' village (*Peredelkino*) where Pasternak used to live, they have a conversation by the Pasternak's grave, which is now a place of pilgrimage, etcetera.The Goethe's rebellion is against the *System* (first against the Soviet regime, but later against the western Capitalist order of things as well), which is designed *to trample the artist in man*. Goethe refuses to be bought up by *the West*, which is in a way similar to Pasternak's refusal to accept the Nobel Prize for literature (for his novel *Doctor Zhivago*). But like Pasternak, Goethe wanted his manuscript to be smuggled abroad and published.The curious fact is that the manuscript of *Doctor Zhivago* was smuggled from Soviet Union by Pasternak's friend Isaiah Berlin. According to Steven Dorril's *MI6*, Berlin used to be a British intelligence officer (probably before becoming a prominent Oxford academic). I highly recommend this excellent book."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"Sometimes I feel there are too many unnecessary details. I did see the movie based on this book.

Getting older, seeking something to add to his life, for another the book is a great tale written by a non-Russian, harkening not only to the politcal situation but to the literary state within Russia.All round if a reader enjoys this author's work, I cannot see that the book, movie, or audio will be a let down to them.

Yet there's something slack at the heart of \\"The Russia House\\" that makes it, in the end, a disappointing read.Barley Blair is an alcoholic womanizer who barely cares about his career as a publisher, not enough to bother making a Moscow book fair in the early days of perestroika. Nevertheless, a mysterious woman named Katya contrives to send him a package revealing major lapses in the Soviet war machine. When British intelligence discovers this, they send Barley, more or less against his will, to Moscow to meet Katya and learn more. At least for a while, Barley follows orders.Written in 1989, on the heels of his career-changing \\"The Perfect Spy\\", \\"The Russia House\\" cemented le Carr&eacute; at his most contemplative, and for me, less interesting. His once-tight stories, not loaded with action but at least jostling occasionally, became long gabfests, chapters of conversation or introspection in which protagonists question a larger purpose. For le Carr&eacute;, by this time, that larger purpose was never good, especially if they were working for the West.\\"Any decent Church would have burned you [...] at the stake long ago\\", Barley tells one British intelligence agent. \\"I'm the wrong man.\\"\\"We're all the wrong men,\\" the agent replies. \\"We're dealing with wrong things.\\"That's how you know the guy is more or less alright for a British intelligence man, in the world of le Carr&eacute;: He knows enough not to believe in what he's doing.The central nub of \\"Russia House's\\" plot is pretty good, not only for the way it plays to le Carr&eacute;'s radicalized predispositions but also his penchant for subtext. When Barley is cooped up at an island retreat off the coast of Maine by the CIA, le Carr&eacute; writes descriptively of the sight of drowning sailors on the ocean's horizon, before revealing they are in fact \\"ospreys and cormorants going about their hunting\\". Of course, it's Barley that's both the drowning man and the prey here.Alas, there's too much subtext, and not enough suspense. However much of a twist ending le Carr&eacute; tries to present, only the most casual reader will be surprised by it. The character experiences no growth or attitude change; from beginning to end he remains a mouthpiece of le Carr&eacute;'s contempt for late-'80s Toryism and its alignment with the United States. You know he's going to be okay, despite the tempters in his path, because he plays jazz and admires Lester Young. The development of his relationship with Katya is rushed and unconvincing.Thankfully le Carr&eacute; can write. Writing is something he does a lot of here, more so than plotting. If you enjoy fiction written well, you will enjoy \\"The Russia House\\", far more than if you enjoy spy fiction that reads fast. Perhaps I judge le Carr&eacute; harshly because once he did both."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"Yes character counts, and this book has plenty of that! The reader gets to know the characters intimately, feel every weakness, and see every flaw.With the connection to the characters, come the events and circumstances that put them to the test, and supply the intrigue!A good read for those who like characters fleshed out, and plots entwined with the not so perfect people involved!"},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"These reviews tend to be all lumped together - sorry, Amazon, but you really do your readers a massive disservice by continuing to insist on presenting reviews this way. I'm reviewing the audio version of The Russia House, the BBC full cast dramatization. I've never read anything by Le Carre, and that's a shame, because this story had me engaged from the first lines of dialogue.Early in the era of perestroyka, our 'hero' Barley Blair receives a mysterious manuscript from Moscow which, if it proves to be the real deal, could cripple East-West relations. Tom Baker (the scarf-wearing Doctor Who, thank you) plays the hard-partying Blair, who is coaxed into serving as Her Majesty's (and the CIA's) agent to try to solve the riddle of the manuscript's author and the explosive information it contains.So many excellent performances in this dramatization; there are obviously Brits acting as the Americans, and at times they tend to ham up the accents a bit, but the same is easily true when the Yanks pour on the Cockney (isn't that right, Dick Van Dyke?). Still, it's great fun, outstanding production, and well worth picking up a copy for yourself."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"A struggling book publisher sets up an audio cassette booth at a Moscow publishers fair and the tale begins.

The manuscript is not a creative work, rather, it contains detailed information about Soviet nuclear capabilities. When the agent can't find Barley, he turns the documents over to the British authorities. They recognize the value of it and find Barley and send him on missions to find the author of the manuscript and to verify that its contents are accurate.This was a really great story. Barley Blair is a fantastic character. He's a terrific example, in my mind, of a \\"larger than life\\" character that is still realistic. He's witty, somewhat clumsy, he drinks too much and he falls in love easily. He's not a natural spy, he's awkward, gets scared and is unsure. He really carried the story for me. Blurring of morality, right/wrong, etc are explored as always in LeCarre novels.My one criticism, and the reason that I don't give this book the full 5 stars is that I found it hard to read. Yes, the language use is beautiful, but sometimes I had no idea what was going on because the language wasn't direct or the time point wasn't specified (yes, I know the indirectness of these novels can be a strength but I found it detracted from the story at times).Nonetheless, I still love how LeCarre's spies are men first, and that is what makes them interesting."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"I read the book when it was first released. I saw the movie. Then I forgot about it. I was leaving high school; I didn't the moolah for an unabridged audiobook.A few years back, I was introduced to Mr. Jayston via BBC dramas: \\"Jane Eyre\\" (1973) and \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" (1979) chief among them.Chivers, Cover-to-Cover and BBC Audiobooks merged in 2003. I waited for the dust to settle, then searched and searched the audiobook stores for this title. Thankfully, Mr. Jayston pops up now and again, in theatre or on TV (\\"Foyle's War\\", Set Four) -- and Mr. Le Carre continues to write.Bingo! The Audiobook Company (UK) carries this on CD (No one said inexpensive.) Alright, he doesn't try to do American accents, and he lacks the supple-and-silky qualities of Mr. Rickman's growl. But I like this one."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"Firstly, one does not pick up a John Le Carre book to be dazzled with the flash-bang imagery of modern spy thrillers. John Le Carre writes 'spy literature', a look at the inner workings and emotions felt by his well fleshed-out characters in the espionage trade. Like meeting a life-long friend for the first time, you come to know his characters, and if patient enough, actually care about them. His prose often borders on poetry.I offer this warning of style for the sake of saving time for those looking for a quick pulse-quickening read. On to my opinion of \\"The Russia House\\". Barley Blair, the inner hypocrite comes clean. The book is an in depth tale of how a lackluster publisher with a penchant for self-destruction and jazz finds himself deeply embroiled in the hopeful defection of a Russian scientist, Goethe. Blair bumps into Goethe at a chance gathering during the hopeful glimmer of glasnost. Goethe overhears Blair's recited philosophical rhetoric for a hopeful future between the West and Communist Russia. The conspiracy begins.Le Carre steers us through how a communique meant for Blair is intercepted, where essentially we begin our journey. We are led through London, Moscow, an island off the coast of New England, and Leningrad in the attempt to confirm Blair in his new job of spy and get the elusive scientist to switch sides. However, Blair wasn't expecting to fall in love with Goethe's emmisary, and a whole new tasteful spin is added to the spy novel. Le Carre's characters here are equally intimate and distant, illuminating yet shrouded in secrecy...so very human. So, not to spoil the intricacies for the eager reader, I shall conclude explaining the plot here.Through all of this, Le Carre gives us a glimpse of life for both the Westerners and Easterners in Communist Russia. The lingering shadows of Stalin and Breshnev are never dismissed lightly, but rather the hope that was glasnost shines on through the murky depths of intrigue.Fans of the George Smiley books may find themselves disappointed with reading \\"The Russia House\\", but I think fans of Le Carre as the storyteller and writer will be very satisifed."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"Although some elements of this book may not seem overly realistic to the more discerning specialists of espionage, the general story line is believable. Being a native of Moscow, I enjoyed the masterful, if oversimplified, descriptions of things Russian. Le Carre diction is particularly pleasing -- his mastery of the English language is superb. The text flows easily; it is hard to put the book down. I highly recommend the book to anybody who wants to get a sence of intelligence operations, the difference between US and British apporach to espionage and what Russia was like in the 1990s. Additionally, readers will enjoy Le Carre's masterful command of English -- &quot;an example to us all,&quot; as one of his heroes points out. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"John Le Carre has the gift of storytelling. To me, he is the best espionage writer alive today. Most of the espionage writers put all the emphasis on the events whereas the main theme of Le Carre's books has always been characters. Le Carre does not write breakneck thrillers. He writes characters, lively and human. And that's why when you read a Le Carre book, a year down the road, you can't recall the story but you can easily recall the characters of the story. He is the creator of many memorable characters and Barley Blair is one of them.Barley is not a hero, not even a patriot. He is a careless publisher, a jazz player and a chess fan. He is not a spy. He is pushed into the espionage game because of his drunken exchange of thoughts with a Russian scientist, another of Le Carre's memorable characters. Barley has reluctantly agreed to play the part of a courier and agent-runner by British spymasters and on his arrival in Moscow, he falls in love with a girl, who very much like Barley himself, is pushed into the spy game.Barley soon reaches a point where he has to decide whom to betray. The girl he loves or his country. To me, that is the climax of the novel, the classical dilemma.And dilemma it is. Here is Barley Blair, the main character, forming one part of the triangle, who is not a spy, doesn't even want to be one. The second part of triangle is Goethe, the Russian scientist, who wants to tell something to the world but not through the spies. And the third part is Katya, loved by both Goethe and Barley, who doesn't even know what is she doing and where does she fit in the whole scheme of things. And in the background are the spymasters of UK and USA who think they have all the strings in their hands but have totally ignored the fact that human nature is an essential part of all the espionage equations.You've got to read the novel to know the whole thing. And if you are into serious fiction, you must read \\"The Russia House\\"."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"At his best John le Carre transcends the genre. His Quest for Karla trilogy (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy, and Smiley's People) and A Perfect Spy are marvellous novels, with deftly drawn complex characters, and a fine sense of the reasons for betrayal.This, though, is disappointing. It is le Carre's first post glasnost fiction, and in feeling for new subject matter his novels have seemed a little weaker, until finding new form with his most recent novel, Single and Single.The novel focuses on Barley Blair, a drunken book publisher from a small publishing house in London. Having applied for a place in the secret service some years before, Blair becomes a reluctant spy as a book with observations on Soviet military capability is handed over for Blair at an audio book convention. The novel is narrated by a wily lawyer advising the British secret service.There are some weak points in the novel. For this reader le Carre has never convinced when drawing female characters (even the estimable Lady Ann Smiley remains a cipher from le Carre's first novel to Smiley's People). Nor is le Carre convincing when writing about love, and here one of the pivotal characters is Katya, a Muscovite with children. She is better drawn than many of le Carre's female characters (perhaps the first person male narrative strangely helps in this regard), but she remains something of a blank canvas. Her relationship with Blair is never convincing, and sadly this taints the inevitability of the final chapters.There are the usual le Carre virtues. He has a mastery of novel openings (Witness the first chapters of Tinker Tailor and Single and Single for example) and this is no exception. In attendance at an audio book fair in MOscow a Polish emigre is approached and handed the crucial papers for Blair. How this is done, and how he deals with it, are handled wonderfully. Each detail making the situation credible. Le Carre's own style is again wonderful. His prose has a fluidity that is very readable.Le Carre also has astute observations on the relationship between the superpowers at the time of Gorbachev's restructuring, and - from the backdrop of the Smiley novels - the relationship between the United States and United Kingdom secret services.It is ironic that in a novel billed as a love story the most convincing relationships are those between institutions.If you enjoy the novel try to get hold off the BBC audio dramatisation starring Tom Baker as Barley Blair. The other le Carre novels mentioned in this review are more rewarding than the Russia House, but it is still an enjoyable, albeit disappointing, read."},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"Like most of the best-selling works that came before this one from the unchallenged master of the intelligent spy thriller John LeCarre, this is a treatise on the hidden and conflicted corners of the human heart. It is said that \\"The Russia House\\" represented a formidable new challenge for the author, so quickly and unexpectedly deprived of the forty year-old cold war he had built his career so deftly and memorably describing. Yet the author mines new tunnels of cunning, deceit, and betrayal, and at the same time weaves a quite memorable love story in the spaces squeezed between the two sides.Barley Blair, the failing boozehound scion of a collapsing British publishing house with a love for everything Russian, happens by drunken though eloquent happenstance to inspire a famous Soviet scientist into attempting to sneak his manuscript detailing the real sorry state of Russian ICBM capabilities into the hands of the West in order to foster a recognition of the folly of the arms race and to end what he calls \\"the great lie\\". The scientist attempts to contact Blair, but through a series of mishaps rivaling the deeds of the keystone cops winds up landing the manuscript in the hands of the British Secret Service. So they soon want Barley to intercede with the Russian contact point to find out who the author of the manuscript is and thus determine its authenticity. So Barley pursues the beautiful but conflicted contact, an idealistic angel of mercy who soon sparks Barley's love interest and paternal concern. The game is afoot.With his usual style, suspenseful prose, and intellectual gamesmanship, LeCarre stirs the reader's interest and dismay as we see the deadly games set into motion with deadly earnest by the Brits, the Americans, and the Russians, none of whom give a rattler's damn about Barley, the contact, or the scientist. This is a stunning, suspenseful, and somewhat rueful tale of what unfolds when we discover that there is a real possibility that the so-called Soviet ICBM threat is a sham, that the missiles cannot escape their silos, that their ability to achieve trajectory or destroy targets with any accuracy is vastly over-rated. And as one can expect from the shadowy and complex geopolitical world of espionage and power that LeCarre writes so brilliantly and unforgettably about, there are no simple answers or easy foregone conclusions. This is a wonderful read and a marvelous book, and has the ring of more real-life veracity and worldly wisdom than one can easily find on the non-fiction side of the bookstore aisle. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"\`Spying is waiting'. So believable. Unlike the breakneck speed of events of popular espionage fiction, John Le Carre takes us into the REAL world of spying where you do your bit and wait for the reactions. Things don't happen at the speed at which we wish them to.His characters don't speak from high moral grounds, so typical to Tom Clancy's characters. Nor they are reluctant heroes of Robert Ludlum. They are real people, afraid, greedy, selfish, people who you can relate with, people who don't have the power to eliminate the evils of the world single-handedly. These are the people who know that the evils are here to stay, and in some sense they are also part of it. Elimination of evil will mean self-destruction. They just play the part in the manner they are told to and wait to get out of the evil-machine of espionage. \`Spying IS waiting'"},{"Title":"Russia House","review":"The Russia House is my favorite Le Carre, although I'm just getting started on his books. I enjoyed it immensely. The characters were extraordinarly well developed, even for Le Carre who is quite good at that. I enjoyed the plot, the dialouge, the characters. The idea of human love being greater than political reprecussions was a great one. Barley Blair is an imperfect publisher, a saxophonist and a drinker. He is likable and he is in love with Katya, a Russian woman. He meets her as he is drawn into Cold War espionage by chance- the world of the \\"grey men\\". I liked Ned, the human intelligence agent runner, who got along well with people but not as much with science and such. Walter, an almost girlish, strange and awkward spy was my favorite because of his fraility, his seeming too fragile for the world of espionage, and how he turned out to be right in his theories.

LeCarre , is, of course, a master teller of spy stories; he certainly has ample first hand experience of the business, as he was an actual British spy, for five years, under his birth name, David Cornwell. According to internet biographers, he was, in fact, embedded in Soviet territory when he was blown by Kim Philby, most famous post-war British secret service traitor; Philby's treachery might have been fatal to him.\\"The Russia House,\\" stands on its own as a thriller. It's set in 1987, the third year of Russia's attempt to open up -known as\\"Glasnost\\"--and details the efforts of a brilliant Soviet scientist, code named Dante, to get information about the weakness of Russia's offensive armaments to the West. To do this, Dante uses Katya, beautiful Russian editor, and Barley Scott Blair, classy drunken British publisher. The spy story's well-backgrounded, and engrossing: it opens with one of the author's writing trademarks, a good set piece, a Russian trade fair, gives us generous helpings of another of the writer's trademarks, the midnight meetings of the spy managers, the \\"Whitehall Mandarins;\\" it has a resonant, complex plot, and his usual good dialogue/descriptive writing. It even gives us a happy Hollywood ending: not quite as happy as the actual Hollywood movie based upon it,(The Russia House) starring Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, but Barley does get the girl, her children and uncle, sooner or later. In fact, a later book of Le Carre's,The Secret Pilgrim (Mortalis), is narrated by Ned, who was Scott Blair's handler. Ned tells us that he could have gotten Scott Blair out of Russia, but Scott Blair didn't want the spy service: \\"he wanted the girl.\\"The book gives us a very acute look at Russia, just as their \\"Glasnost,\\" policy of openness begins to end --but not quite-- the cold war. It shows us life as it was lived in Russia at the time. The everyday struggles for the underprivileged, as Pfeiffer's character, despite her glamorous job, is. Three generations live cramped in a tiny apartment, queue for necessities, have difficulty obtaining new clothes, and find it nearly impossible to get shoes. The privileges of the privileged: the nice cars, the dachas (greatly-desired country homes), the designer duds. It further deals with the usual suspicions between the British and American secret services. Finally, it gives us an honest, unsensationalized, moving, non-mawkish view of mature, middle-aged love. Worth a read, any time."},{"Title":"Gulf War Journal","review":"I was familiar with Mr. Lomax's work previously (Vietnam Journal) and when I found out this work was available, I wasted no time obtaining it. I was not disappointed. His use of a fictional character (\\"Journal\\" Neithammer), mixed with factual events of the first Gulf War in 1991, made the book both compelling and quite readable. One of the problems that some may have is that the graphic novel is presented in black and white, and younger readers may find the comics (like film) as \\"boring\\" (I say this as I taught at a design college and the comment always irked me). I disagree. The basic B/W format forces the reader to read the text, as well as follow the story. My only critiques concerned a few minor things (Hussein being spelled a couple of ways, a lance corporal in the Army) but on the whole I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Americanization of Edward Bok: The autobiography of a Dutch boy fifty years after","review":"In 1920, the former editor of the Ladies' Home Journal, Edward Bok, published his fascinating memoir, an exceptionally well-written book through which he candidly yet eloquently recounted the step-by-step process of his 'Americanization' from penurious immigrant Dutch boy to affluent pioneering American editor and philanthropist; hence, it is not a surprise that the work secured for its author both the coveted 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Biography/Autobiography as well as the Gold Medal of the Academy of Political and Social Sciences. Succinctly written using the third person narrative format, the book chronicles the humble beginnings of Edward Bok from when he was a child in Helder, Netherlands to how he and his family-like many immigrants of the time-fled to the United States as a result of the 'technological order' that brought about a wave of new opportunities. But it would not be in the world of hard-core industry where he would make his name; when Edward Bok left the Netherlands in 1870, he had but three things to sustain him: his family, his meager belongings and some advice from his Dutch grandmother-\\"...make you the world a bit more beautiful and better because you have been in it.\\" {P. xxi} Through the acts of frugality, laborious toil, absorption of American ideals and visions of a better life, Edward Bok slowly rose above the unbending economic classicism that unfortunately soldified the roots of many families as well as their descendents into harsh blue-collar drudgery. Though he never received a collegiate education, because he quit quite early, his leaving school was not the limitation of his intellectual instruction. Life was, in fact, the expansion of it, for it led him to acquire his learning in a most unorthodox fashion. For people who never receive an education, there is, for the most part, a hidden kernel of regret that sometimes becomes everlastingly needling and tragically overwhelming. As that is the con, the pro would be that they would be liberated from the arrogant pretentiousness and bemused condescension that a liberal education can sometimed imbue in one who is well learned. Neither of the above plagued Edward Bok. To quench his insatiable thirst for knowledge about what the essence of success was, he wrote to men and women of eminence, asking them not merely for their signature, but for a piece of wisdom, advice. And many-including Henry Ward Beecher, Louisa May Alcott, Samuel Clemens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, among others-did not hesitate in the least to proffer advice. What began as a simple inquiry into success, ended as a voluminous mass of autographs and lettes that revealed the most intimate thoughts and beliefs of some of the greatest historical figures in American history, of which no dollar value could ever be placed. Through this inquist, Edward Bok not only found connections and valued friendships, but he whetted his editing and writing prowess, innate abilities that later led him to work for Henry Holt & Company, Charles Scribner's Sons and The Brooklyn Magazine (as editor); it too led him to establish The Bok Syndicate Press and eventually assume the helm, for thirty years, of the Ladies' Home Journal as editor and then vice president of the Curtis Publishing Company-which owned the magazine. While in command of the LHJ, he cultivated it into a powerhouse that brought about meaningful modifications to the United States, i.e. the better-babies movement, the teaching of social hygiene to youths of both sexes, the beautification of American cities (of which Lynn, Massachusetts was a part), the improving of home architecture and railroad cars, and most importantly, the passing of the Pure Food and Drug Acts by Congress. It was in America where he was able to prove himself: \\"As the world stands to-day, no nation offers opportunity in the degree that America does...the United States offers, as does no other nation, a limitless opportunity: here a man can go as far as his abilities will carry him...America can graft such a wealth of inspiration , so high a national idealism, so great an opportunity for the highest endeavor, as to make him the fortunate man on the earth today.\\" {P. 448} Durng the latter stages of Bok's life when he established the $100,000 American Peace Award, he did it because America gave him a second chance to work and prove himself, which is not always easy to come by. He did not adhere to the writings of Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner or Russell Cornwell, men with timeworn values who espoused the 'lordly' dogmas of Social Darwinism and the Gospel of Wealth-the former being \\"An ideology based upon the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, justifying the concentration of wealth and lack of governmental protection of the weak through the ideas of natural selection and survival of the fittest\\" while ther latter was a belief \\"that God ordains certain people to amass money and use it to further God's purpose; it justified the concentration of wealth as long as the rich used their money responsibly.\\" {P. 485 of America And It's Peoples: A Mosaic in the Making} Edward Bok clung to no person and no 'chic' belief, simply his faith, his industriousness and to humanity specifically.

It's the story of nerdy scientist Theodore Honey (the British term of that time was &quot;boffin&quot;--it specifically targeted scentists) who discovers a potentially deadly flaw in a new airliner. The problem is that nobody but his boss Dr. Scott (from whose viewpoint this story is told) has any faith in his theory. After all, oddballs don't have very high credibility factors. So Scott sends Honey over to Canada to investigate a recent crash of one of those planes, only to have it turn out that the plane he takes is also one of that model. Which makes for a particularly gripping scene--it's the centerpiece of the James Stewart movie based on this book. Other important characters here are Honey's motherless daughter, an actress he's a fan of who's also on the flight--he reminds her of an old friend she knew before she became famous, the plane's captain who is increasingly unsure that Honey is a crackpot, plus a stewardess who not only shares her captain's point of view--but finds Honey strangely compelling in an even more important way.

Bad choice--he is so unimpressive that when he learns that the aircraft he is on has already exceeded his estimated time to failure, he can only stop the flight by wrecking it when it stops to refuel at Gander. Almost everyone believes he's crazy except for a few--including the assistant director at his place of work, a stewardess, and a movie actress.Shute is at his best in his characterizations--such as Monica Teasdale the fading American movie actress, who falls in love with Honey as she once did with a man before she became famous. She soon realizes she can never have Honey and must step aside for the stewardess, who can give him children and maintain him in his work, as well as give him love. The details are amusing--the actress, from Indiana, uses the word \\"hoosier\\" to the mystification of the British charactersAs in most of Shute's books, there are no villians. The fact that many of the characters are working against each other does not make any of them evil, and when the truth is revealed, they quickly begin to work together.For the information of readers, the book made a fairly poor movie starring (I kid you not), Jimmy Stewart as Honey.

Such a book could never be published today, and in many ways that is a pity.Nevil Shute Norway was an aircraft engineer by profession, and most of his novels (of whichA TOWN LIKE ALICEis the best-known) touch to some degree on flying; in NO HIGHWAY, aircraft engineering is the entire background. The narrator, Dennis Scott, is head of a research department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, England. One of his scientists, a rather unworldly widower named Theodore Honey, is convinced that Britain's latest transatlantic passenger aircraft, the Reindeer, is liable to catastrophic metal fatigue in the tail after so many hours' flying time, and convinces Scott that all Reindeers must be grounded before they approach that maximum. Unfortunately, two aircraft have already reached the danger point. One has recently crashed in a remote area of Labrador, and when Honey is sent out to investigate, he discovers he is traveling in the other one.Shute's strength is that he writes what he knows, straightforwardly and without frills. He assumes that the reader will be interested in the technology, and in the bureaucratic procedures that Scott must go through to convince the appropriate agencies of the danger. It is true that some of Honey's theories sound kooky, to put it mildly, and it is hard to believe that time-to-fracture is as predictable as he makes out. But in 1954, six years after the book was published, Britain's Comet fleet, the world's first commercial passenger jet aircraft, suffered a series of fatal accidents that were ultimately put down to metal fatigue; the episode essentially ended Britain's domination of the transatlantic market. That era was about to change anyhow; one of the pleasures of the book is to go back before the jumbo jet, when transatlantic aircraft has to refuel at places like Gander in Newfoundland, and carried only a few dozen passengers in easy luxury.NO HIGHWAY is also a heart-warming love story. This requires some suspension of contemporary cynicism, for Shute's character painting (especially his women, often referred to as \\"girls\\") now seems rather simplistic, in common with many of the popular writers of his generation. They don't write them like that any more -- with one notable exception: I suspect that the popularity of Alexander McCall Smith (author ofTHE SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB) is precisely because he too writes in the simple emotional terms of his boyhood reading. If you want Smith's warmth applied to more boyish subjects, you might do worse than look into Shute."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is one of Neville Shute's best novels (I keep saying that) and a pretty good movie was made of it with Jimmy Stewart, Glynis Johns and Marlene Dietrich. The story is about a shy and rather homely aircraft engineer who was widowed in the war and lives with his eight year old daughter. He is reclusive and not very well liked by his bosses but he is brilliant. He has a theory about metal fatigue and is using a tail plane from the brand new British trans-Atlantic airliner as a test bed. It hasn't occurred to him that the test, if successful, will result in grounding the fleet of planes. Then, he learns that one of the airliners has crashed in Canada and he is asked to go to the crash site to see if the tail is intact. He is an \\"inside man\\" and doesn't want to go but he is \\"volunteered\\" by his boss. Flying across the Atlantic at night, he is horrified to learn that not only is this one of the \\"Reindeer\\" airliners but it has exceeded the safe number of flying hours according to his calculations. Upset, he confides his fears to a famous movie actress who is on the flight and who was a favorite of his late wife. The stewardess tries to discourage him from upsetting the passengers but both women begin to fear he knows what he is talking about. They make it to the fuel stop at Gander but, to prevent the plane taking off again, he pulls the lever on the undercarriage, causing the plane to settle down onto the taxiway. A furious row ensues and the story is an enjoyable scientific adventure story and a romance as both women become very attracted to this shy engineer. I read this book in the 1940s when it came out and, shortly after it was published, the British Comet jet airliners began to crash. The cause was metal fatigue. Shute was an experienced aeronautical engineer who had built up his own company before the war. He knew his subject. The book is excellent. This should be on every list of novels for engineers."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"The humor and tension are grounded in both the characters and the situations in which they find themselves. It's a tidy novel with no great action scenes and no auctorial fireworks. Nevil Shute tells the tale simply and with a muted affection for everyone involved.Dennis Scott works in the post-war British government and is chief of testing programs designed to insure aircraft safety. I may get these organizations mixed up because I'm not familiar with any of them. New to the job, Scott surveys the ongoing programs and finds Theodore Honey, an queer, middle-aged engineer, experimenting with metal fatigue on the tailplane of an expensive new passenger airplane, the Reindeer. Curious about this froggy little troglodyte, Scott surveys the Reindeer tailplane now taking a pounding from hundreds of vibrators in Honey's isolated corner of the universe. The vibrators reproduce the stresses encountered in flight. Scott asks what Honey expects to find out. \\"I expect the tail to fall off after 1440 hours,\\" replies Honey. Scott gapes because Honey doesn't seem to care about a couple of things that less eccentric people might find important. One is that, if Honey's theory is right, all Reindeers now in service will have to be grounded and it will cause an uproar in a strapped England in which goods are still rationed because of the debt incurred by the war. The second is that, if Honey is right, hundreds of passengers and crew will die as, one by one, the tails fall off the airplanes and they fall out of the sky.What follows is a fascinating story of solving conundrums in aeronautical engineering, of family dynamics, of character traits, and of romance.The story is plot driven and moves logically through time and space, never hard to follow, never difficult to read, but it's also sprinkled with ludic tidbits that are sometimes hilarious in an understated way. Honey is clearly an intelligent mathematician and engineer. The guy has a vision. But he's also otherwordly, a fool who doesn't own an ordinary mop or know anything about electric water heaters. The little home he shares with his twelve-year-old daughter is cluttered and filthy. He spends what spare time he has investigating certain obscure features of pyramids and the apocryphal peregrinations of Jesus Christ, including a kind of vacation the savior took at the site of King Arthur's Camelot. Scott backs Honey and his theory up, against the dismissive attacks of establishment figures.Some reviewers have called the novel \\"dated,\\" and I suppose it is. The most advanced aircraft are propeller driven. Women yearn for stability and homes. But so what? \\"Ulysses\\" is dated too. Nobody rides around in horse-drawn coaches anymore. And, man, is \\"The Iliad\\" dated or what?Personally I found Shute's description of the typical nuclear family rather appealing. Take the stewardess, Marjorie Corder, that Theodore Honey finds himself thrown together with by circumstance. She's twenty-five, she's been a nurse and a stewardess. She's been all over the place and seen much of what she wants to see. And she falls for Honey and wants to spend her life taking care of him, his daughter, and their home. Granted that it all looks a bit retro today, but if women should feel free to pursue careers, why shouldn't they feel free to NOT pursue a career?Nietzsche argued that two people living together had a \\"nest\\", while a person alone \\"had, at best, a cave.\\" There's nothing I'd have enjoyed more than coming home after a hard day in the jungle and having a wife give me a massage, bring me my slippers, mix me a drink, light my pipe, and see to it that my wounds were properly treated and bandaged. Of course, there are advantages to living alone too. You can talk to yourself, you can curse rapturously at will, walk about in your underwear, prop your feet on the table, stagger around drinking out of the bottle, smoke poisonous cigars, watch ESPN day and night, burp without discretion, and so forth -- but I'd trade it all for an obedient, beautiful, wealthy, sinuous, undemanding, loving young wife.Where was I? Oh, yes. I've read the novel twice -- the first time about thirty years ago, then again just recently. It was enjoyable both times. It doesn't carry much of a moral message. It's not \\"profound.\\" It's an entertaining and involving tale. Try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"Arrived as expected. It was great to find such an old book in such used condition -- obviously lots and lot of folks have enjoyed this story!"},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"This the sort of book I love to read over and over again every few years. I was exhausted this weekend and enjoyed reading this book lazily. I worked in the garden, made and ate a scone and read No Highway. It is an old fashioned novel slowly tells the tale if a \\"Boffin\\" a lonely scientist , his boss who is the narrator and what happens when research collides with life.IN the early 50's Mr. Honey predicts the tail of a certain type of aircraft will fall off. Unfortunately this same type of aircraft is flying across the Atlantic. Lives are at stake and the pure research of Mr. Honey becomes critical as does the character of Mr. Honey. He has a daughter and not one but two unlikely love love interests. The is a happy ending and all is well. but the charm of this kind of novel is you are drawn into the life of some likable people. I enjoyed the visit."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute writes a good, technically-sound tale of the perils of aircraft design in the immediate post-war era. His material is therefore dated -- yet because it is so obviously dated it has a charm that is difficult to fault.Memorable characters: you probably know people who are like the protagonists. Memorable plot. Written from the viewpoint of a semi-detached observer, though one with a keen stake in the outcome.The ending was a little disappointing, with a literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot; providing the solution to a really knotty problem -- perhaps it was feasible in the forties, but certainly wouldn't work today. But don't let this keep you from reading the book: it's a good tale that deserves dusting-off."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"Oh, Nevil Shute. I do so adore your unabashed authorial self-insertion. I haven't read all Nevil Shute, or even the majority, but the ones I have read, I have strong opinions about.In this one, Shute is himself twice, both in the narrator (a young manager at an aeronautics company) and the main character, a weedy, pathetic, but brilliant \\"boffin\\".The novel opens with the young manager, Scott, talking about his job managing a bunch of brilliant but mildly eccentric scientists at a safety facility, a job much like the one Shute had before the WWII. One of his scientists, Theodore Honey, is drawn as extremely eccentric. He is widowed, with a pre-teen daughter, and is essentially uncivilized in a way that is acceptable only in older novels. He doesn't know how to cook or clean or buy clothes. He is interested in many crackpot theories, including pyramidology, and the return of Jesus to England. He is also quite brilliant at what he does, aeronautics-wise.Honey comes to Scott and tells him that the tail assembly of the brand new plane currently flying the Transatlantic flight is going to crystallize and shear off after a certain number of hours. He is running tests on a tail to be sure, but it will be months before they get confirmation. Scott is torn on whether to take this seriously on not. On the one hand, pyramidology. On the other hand, planes falling out of the sky for a reason that manifests quickly and without warning.Scott orders Honey to step up the testing and goes to see his own boss to quietly freak out about planes falling out of the sky. He finds out that one of these planes HAS fallen out of the sky -- the prototype, which had almost the correct number of hours for Honey's theory, crashed in a stupid way. It had been ruled pilot error, but the coincidence made Scott edgy.Scott and his boss decide that someone needs to go out to Newfoundland to investigate the wreckage. Scott would go, but he is going to present his big important professional paper, and so he decides to send Honey, who is not... personable, but is the expert on crystallized metal fatigue.As you can imagine, the plot is more complicated from there. I shan't give it all away, except to note that I find it completely and hilariously charming that Shute, who was 49 when it was published, depicted the nerdy, asocial little engineer as charming both an aging movie star and a bright and beautiful flight stewardess.Thematically, I can tell that this book was written in the era when Shute still had faith in the British system. It was not long after this that he emigrated to Australia because he found the country no longer to his taste.This book is by no means as strong as A Town Like Alice or On The Beach, but it is not unworthy to be on the shelf with them. Shute's charming older men: the narrators in Alice and Pied Piper, the Trustee from the Toolroom, are all extremely homey and sympathetic. I always like to think of them as Shute himself, spinning stories. I haven't read much from his early works, but I may go seek them out. Evidently some of them are about daring young pilots, which Shute also was.I enjoy reading period books that do not think of themselves as period books. It is not notable that Honey has trouble working his ration coupons and has three years of his jam sugar allotment saved. Of course air stewardesses are unmarried and of course young wives don't work. When I read stories that are ABOUT a period, these things always feel highlighted, but when I read books IN a period, they are just part of how life goes.Read if: You want to read about failure and risk analysis. Stories about nerdy little men who have women contending for them are amusing to you. The installation of domestic hot water heaters is something you had never thought about. You can tolerate some strange woo-woo in your mostly-science.Skip if: You want a lot of action, intrigue, or plausible romance. You have problems with outdated science. You are unwilling to read about the typical breakfasts served to transatlantic passengers of the era*.* I did enjoy reading about the time in Gander. I mostly know it as the place a lot of transatlantic flights ended up at after 9/11, but of course, it's been an airport for a very long time."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"I enjoyed re-reading this story but I was very disappointed at the quality of the Kindle edition. There were many contextual typos (eg tack instead of tact -- made no sense in sentence) and I found it very distracting, especially having paid top $$ for the Kindle edition. It needs to get cleaned up.Also what's with putting the title page and associated publishing information at the END of the book? I know this isn't restricted just to this book but I would prefer 'normal' book format please."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is one book that is fun to read if you've seen the James Stewart movie about a scientist who believes a new type of airplane has a basic defect and will crash after so many hours in the air.Visualizing the well-cast actors as you read makes the book more interesting. The plot is well laid out and even though you know basically that the hero will be vindicated in his beliefs, it keeps your interest to the end."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"Having seen his various movie adaptions decades ago, I was looking for something new to read and hit on Mr Shute. Maybe it helped that I too am an expat Pom living in Oz?I knew nothing about the man so did some research on his background. I'd assumed, (incorrectly) that he was Australian born & bred and was surprised to find his rather privileged English background (private school & Oxford) and that he only moved to Oz 10 years before his death.An aircraft engineer, I knew, as my father was too and had always spoken highly of him as a writer. I should have known better!I find Mr Shute's prose style that of an engineer writing a novel. His style is completely lacking. He is stilted, repetitive, long winded (where was the editor?) and lacking imagination. (If I have to read the title of Scott's lecture once more - in full - I shall throw that book across the room!)Quite simply, he is no writer.Even overlooking his dated attitudes to women ('girls' should be housewives - how dare they even think of having a career!), race (snide reference to the Jewish movie producer.....good heavens, this was a year or two after the death camps!), the 'lower orders' who are unreliable and dishonest - yes he was an insufferable snob! (see other of his novels re the post WW2 Labour govt).I am only 2/3rds of the way through this novel and I feel the need to comment. It's not often I do that!I'd like to read other of his novels (On the Beach being top of my list) but if this novel is anything to go by, I don't think I'll last the distance.I can only assume that he made his name as a novelist due to the unique subject matter.He might tell an interesting story but, personally, I think that he doesn't do it very well."},{"Title":"No Highway (Charnwood Library)","review":"A Raindeer airplane crashes in Labrador after a little less than 1440 flying hours.

I saw A.E Hotchner on TV talking about Doris Day, and he just struck me as a likeable, earnest sort of guy. Unfortunately he didn't live up to his Tv-self in print. Most of the book is comprised of large chunks of interview material, both from Hotchner's own research and Rolling Stone magazine interviews you've probably already read. The rest is made up of highly subjective meanderings and vain attempts to link two ideas together.It's hard to make this story dull, and some of the Marianne Faithfull stuff is good, but there are better books with less academic-sounding titles about the same subject. Or you could just watch &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; for the condensed version."},{"Title":"Blown Away: The Rolling Stones and the Death of the Sixties","review":"I just reread \\"Blown Away\\" after almost twenty years, it floored me back in the day but despite being interesting it just seems to fizzle now in comparison despite still being an essential Stones read. I not only caught many mistakes when it came to basic class and historical aspects of the UK (eg:Cheltenham Spa is NOT or never was a \\"lower class suburb of London\\"-it is a perennially wealthy area almost two hours away tucked into the Costwolds countryside! Nor was \\"John F Kennedy's speeches the catalyst for England's swinging sixties\\"! A.E. Hotchner was a great writer with his Sophia Loren bio being top shelf but he should have had a continuity/fact checker person working on this book with him. Hotchner also should have dropped the whole American anthem theme as well. It is a good read though, DO check it out just keep the aforementioned drawbacks in mind. I DO NOT doubt for a second the parts about \\"Marty\\" and Frank Thorogood murdering Brian Jones. I DO believe it was a game of swimming pool chicken and horse play dunking that became at first bullying and then deadly. With a asthma and epilepsy Jones, despite his youth was very vulnerable. I think they wanted to scare him to death and sadly they did. The book contains great interviews, photos and cultural assessments that when taken along with the fact that Hotchner is an old timer, are actually interesting and unintentionally funny.

It was interesting to look at some of the ways people in the Heartland lived during the Depression (Bloyd's house had no running water or electricity). His journey through air training was quite an experience. Amazing how the Army can really find ways to screw you, from bitter instructors to telling you they don't need you flying a certain aircraft after you've just qualified on it. He did talk about some pretty hairy experiences, from flying through storms to getting bounced by flak to having German Me-262 jet fighters blast through his formation. Quite a few times I would have liked Bloyd to go into more detail about those events. Bottom line, he had some good descriptions, but not to the point where I felt I was in the cockpit with those guys. Same with some of his stories on the ground. Good stuff, but a little more detail would have really rought it to life.Still, it certainly is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Culture of the Fork","review":"I would have given this book *five* stars, had it not been for the shoddy - literal translation from Italian to English. Being an Italian speaker, I sometimes had to re-read certain sentences with my &quot;Italian&quot; hat on to discern the meaning. This would have been an excellent book if the translation had been both literary and cultural but it is neiter. This, unfortunatly, detracts from the book a great deal as some references are not explained to the english-reading audiance who may not be familiar with Italian history. Since Italians use a great many words to describe something that would only take a few in English- the literal translation makes them read like run-ons and often leaves the reader lost at the end. If you are able to overcome all these obstacles, the content of the book is enlightning and educational. I learned that industrial olive-growing in Greece was implemented when they were under Venitian rule and that the fork, was originally a small spear that eventually became the four-pronged utensil that we now know with the development of newer, longer, slippery pasta shapes."},{"Title":"Culture of the Fork","review":"Constantinople went Muslim on May 29, 1453. America went Spanish on October 12, 1492. Months before, Spaniards fired the last Islamic king. All three happenings jump-started new food trends.Another jump-start was new money- and power-holders. Bankers, mercenary captains, and merchants governed 15th-century Italy. They weren't from the traditionally Germanic nobility. They were open to new ways of doing things.So too were glass- and tablecloth-makers, potters and silversmiths. Making cooking- and dinner-ware brought money and power. It was gold and silver for the rich, pewter and fine pottery for the middle class, and ceramics and wood for the poor.Discoveries, politics, trade agreements and war also changed what people ate. Tradesmen swapped customs and ideas while dealing in goods and money. With enough savings, trades and palace cooks opened carry-outs, drinking houses, inns and taverns. There, the public found out the latest too.One thing new was the CULTURE OF THE FORK. It came into use with eating pasta. A cookbook from medieval Naples urged eating lasagna with a single-pronged wooden utensil. Known as punteruolo, it led into the fork.In Portuguese, when a poor man eats a chicken one of the two's sick. Selling the chicken meant the peasant could ape luxury-buying and use forks. This was possible when larger amounts of foods, such as spices, became easier to get. Prices went down. The elite stopped buying. Instead, the wealthy French switched to countryside herbs. Wealthy Spaniards took up hot chili peppers, new from America. In the Piedmont and Tuscany, cloves and pepper, respectively, went from elite to peasant use.Giovanni Rebora says that the subject needs more looking into. For example, are hunger, boring food and alcoholism recent problems? Other than rare famines, the poor had the basics. They generally didn't have luxuries. But the wealthy gave the poor good drinking and eating, on Carnival, Christmas, Easter, local saints' days, New Year and seasonal festivals. So, according to the author, hunger back then was nothing like those suffering concentration camps, gulags and slums in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Jane Austen and the Fiction of her Time","review":"Mary Waldron discusses each of Jane Austen's major novels in a separate chapter. Her views sometimes differ from those of other well-known critics, but her reasoning seems sound. For example, many critics believe that Jane Austen failed in her portrayal of Fanny Price in MANSFIELD PARK by making her too good. Waldron argues that Austen knew exactly what she was doing and that a careful reading shows that Fanny is not as good as she appears on the surface. The famous Austen irony is at work in Fanny's character.Waldron, thankfully, refrains from Marxist, feminist, and Freudian critical readings of Austen's texts. She uses no incomprehensible jargon. Perhaps she is part of a trend.

The most of the plants contained can be found all across North America, though medicinal plants of dry/arid/desert environments are underrepresented.This book includes an extensive medical glossary."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"Very helpful in identifying the plants, the pictures are wonderful and also for identifying some of the uses these plants have been used for"},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"This book, one of the Peterson Field Guide series, should please naturalists, hikers through woods,meadows and thicket--and of course amateur and professional herbalists. The second edition fosters a new awareness of the need for ecological sensitivity and determination to preserve endangered species. Color photos are abundant. In addition to the indexes, there's a life list, similar to what you find in bird guides. I bought this as a companion to a herbal medicine handbook. It's a good companion for a walk, too, in woods or along roadsides."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"This compact book is prefect for carrying in your pocket when out in the fields and woods.

I guess if you already knew how to prepare tinctures and when they were useful, for example, this book may be helpful. My search for a good book/books continues."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"This book is a wonderful field guide to carry with you while wildcrafting. The guide makes it easily available to reference and look up what certain plants and herbs look like and are accounted for in an easy colour guide at the bottom of the book. It has a nice bit on the history of each plants and what they were or are used for. I also enjoy the easy symbols for telling if a plant is poisonous or not, and the recognition, in safe plants monographs, about poisonous look-alike plants.Most of the pictures are wonderfully illustrated and very accurate depictions, although some of the images I noticed are blurry and have hard-to-see specific details about some herbs that could make or break the decision to harvest it. I will also add that I love the plant index and the medical index because you can look an herb up by it's common-name or it's Latin counter-part, and you can also look it up by medicinal value (e.g. headache, stomach pains).The physical book itself is also made of a hardy laminate-type paper so if you get down and dirty with the herbs the dirt won't hurt the book at all! I ended up splashing my book with some water and it didn't even seem to phase it.Overall I still rate this book a 5/5 because of it's lovely pictures, accurate depictions, easy text identification, and lovely history tid-bits on the plants/herbs themselves. A must have for any herbal enthusiast and wildcrafter."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"This book gives good pictures to help identify the plants.

It would have been much better if they had made the book wider and longer so they could use larger pics. i understand that it's small in order to be handy to take into the field with you. But i would rather be able to see what i am looking at. i can handle a larger book. Many of the pics are on DIFFERNT page from the description which is very confusing!!! If you get the book, make sure you match up the pic with the right description! Then there are not enough details on HOW to use the plant. Ok, i know what it is, but how do i use it?????????? Those those are the 3 bad things about the book. However, i still recommend it because it gives over 300 plants including photos, which some do help. The index is excellent. And the back cover doubles as a ruler. The book is better for those that are not beginners."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"Very good book good quality easy to read well organized but I am looking for somthing that's more focus on more commonly useable and usefull plants and details preparation.

I'm not sure if this is the best book to start learning plants with, but it does give adequate instructions on identification. The medicinal sections could use a little more depth, but I'm pretty pleased with it and dying to go on a hike and try it out. Been flipping through the pages happily since I got it. It will tell you which parts of the plant are edible, and if applicable, which parts aren't edible. The only thing that stinks is it doesn't really get too-too into specifics, which is what I was kind of hoping for, but hoenstly, I'm very pleased with this.Also, the paperback's pages are all laminated, and while I'd be hesitant to go swimming with this book, it seems to be reasonably waterproof.Very pleased."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"First I have to say that Steven Foster is one of the best...can't be much better...I have used Pederson's books in the past.

Well, unless I'm actually out in the woods and then I carry it with me in my pack. I have many books about herbs, having studied herbalism for about 20 years now, but I have yet to find a better field manual to actually getting out there and identifying herbs in the fields, mountains and woodlands of the Eastern U.S. Dr. Duke has long been one of the foremost American authorities on herbal and folk medicine - and with great reason. He approaches folk & herbal medicine with a scientific, no-nonsense, no \\"ooey-gooey\\" approach; and he backs up his assertions with research that he has personally done or with other empirical studies. If you're going wildcrafting, this book is invaluable for the color plates and accurate descriptions, which makes mistakes very hard to make in the field.

Otherwise it looks great and seems to be packed full of information and photos."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"I have just recently become interested in learning about the wild plants of my area and this book seems to be the most extensive resource about medicinal plants available. I like it because it is clear and concise, contains information on plant use and history, has color photographs to go with each entry, and includes poisonous look-a-likes and possible side effects of otherwise safe plants. I do, however, find the organization to be a bit confusing. For instance, it is simple to find the section on plants with yellow flowers, the pages are color coded, but difficult to differentiate between sections for button like composite flowers and dandelion like flowers. This results in a lot of time spent looking at pictures of yellow flowers. I much prefer the orginization of the Peterson Guide to Edible Wild Plants, which is similar but more clearly labled. I also think that the line pictures in that book have many benifits over the photographs contained in the medicinal plants field guide. The drawings offer well focused close up views from more than one angle if neccessary, this is not always possible with photos and a few pictures in the book are fuzzy. Overall I think that this is an excellent resource book."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"Here is everything that a field guide should be and contain--small enough to stick into a pocket but comprehensive, definitive, dependable and well-illustrated. Pictures, descriptions, locations, uses, warnings. Foster is not only an herbalist of the first rank but one of the finest plant photographers out there clicking. His gorgeous Healing Plants calendar is on my wall; the verdant photos provide daily pleasure. Herbal preparations as alternatives to synthetic drugs are increasingly chosen. St. John's Wort for depression, Saw Palmetto for prostate treatment, Goldenseal for a multitude of symptoms. Not typically thought of as herbs, trees are also a part of our living pharmacy and 66 are included here. Ginkgolides extracted from leaves of the Ginkgo tree (ginkgo biloba) are the best-selling herbal preparation in Europe. Aspirin derives from the willow. Amongst shrubs I learned that Hawthorn leaf and flower preparations are used in Germany to treat congestive heart failure, based on at least 14 controlled clinical studies. With increasing usage, many plants are in danger of being overharvested. Conservation is necessary to preserve a viable natural community of plants that can and may help alleviate human suffering. Stopping plant thieves is a law enforcement challenge but easy identification of plants may save others of us from bulldozing a patch of ginseng for a house site. It is noted that Pale Purple Coneflower (Echinacea pallida) \\"is common in eastern Kansas but it is very rare in western North Carolina at the eastern extreme of its range. The plant might be judiciously harvested in Kansas, but in North Carolina it should be left alone.\\" More than just a field guide, Medicinal Plants and Herbs is an essential reference book for our personal library. The value of this big little book can hardly be overestimated."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"Just when you thought there were no more plant identification guides to be written, Peterson's came out with this interesting little guide. In its pages you will find the many thousands of uses that numerous cultures have found for North American plants. From dubious cure-alls to modern cancer drugs, this guide describes them all, and their poisonous look alikes. If you already have Peterson's tree or wildflower guides, be prepared for a bit of Deja vu - there is considerable overlap in both text descriptions and illustrations. Also, don't set up your folk remedy pharmacy just yet - this book doesn't give dosage advice for the vast majority of species it describes. The authors are very strident in saying that this book is for information only, not clinical advice. That said, you will find innumerable fascinating tidbits of herbal lore between its covers."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"It is obvious that the other reviewers haven't tried to use this book to do actual field research. I have Peterson's Edible Wild Plants, Eastern Trees, and Mushroom Guides. All three of those books were well done with focus on the unique traits of each plant. They have hand drawn pictures as well as photos with a complete description of each plant. This book has photos of plants mixed with other plants so you can't tell one from the other, has a photo of just one part of the plant, or no photo at all. The Yarrow looks like Poison Hemolck and the Sweet Grass is just the grass blades, no identifying traits at all. The descriptions are scant and half the time they don't know if the plant is poisonous or not \\"Warning: May be poisonous.\\" And don't even try to use the cross-reference in the back for it is labor intensive. They don't tell you what the plants are truly good for but what the plants have been used for since the time of Adam. I have taken this book in the field 6 times and have not been able to positively identify a single plant without cross-referencing it with Peterson's Edible Wild Plant Guide. I was sorely disappointed with this book especially after using the other Peterson Guides. I don't know how they even consider this a field guide.

That old book has black and white drawn diagrams and specifically points out identification marks.The info in the medicinal plant guides is very good. They tell you approved uses and folk lore uses.Overall a great book, shame the identifing aspect lacks some. That is the purpose of the book I would think! Its a field guide after all.I dont regret buying it, I am glad I did. The info is great. But it sucks needing another book for identifying from pics!"},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"When I ordered this book, I was expecting to receive a field guide to identifying plants that I could then use in my own homemade teas and such to cure headaches, act in place of medicines like Tylenol and Advil, put on wounds when neosporin isn't available...that kind of thing. What I got was a book on how to identify plants that somebody once used but I should not use because they are all poisonous. For example, many specimens have similar descriptions to the following: \\"USES: American Indians used plant for jaundice, lockjaw and diarrhea. WARNING: Berries are reportedly TOXIC. Leaves TOXIC. Bark TOXIC.\\" Is there any part of the plant that WON'T kill me? I appreciate the warning, but I would rather learn about plants that I CAN use for practical things. I don't really care if American Indians chewed the root and spit it on each other as a love potion.While the pictures are very helpful in identifying plants, there are only a few sentences on how to make poultices and tinctures in the introductory pages. Under the DOSAGE listing it reads, \\"Since this book is intended to help the reader identify medicinal plants and appreciate their traditional uses, and not to serve as a prescriptor, we have not included dosage except in historical context.\\" While I am sure somebody somewhere is at this very moment appreciating the historical uses of Wahoo as an expectorant, there must be a better book on identifying useful medicinal plants and herbs."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants and Herbs: Of Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)","review":"First, I have to say, I bought this book from an Amazon.com seller,and am very satisfied with his customer service, my used book appeared to be new and he shipped faster than most amazon sellers do.Unfortunately, the book is less informative than the older versions of this book.

But her impulsive and imprudent act lands her in the clutches of none other than the \\"Rogue of Cornwall\\", a man as dangerous as he is gorgeous!Dienwald de Fortenberry is cursed with the desire to do better by his young son and serfs, but lacks the funds to accomplish his worthy goals. So when a filthy young wench appears in his castle's courtyard insisting that she's a lady-- the daughter of his despised but wealthy neighbor no less, Dienwald believes that deliverance from his financial woes is finally at-hand. All he needs to do is ransom the girl back to her family for an obscene amount of money and all his problems will be solved.But it will take time for his perfect plan to come together; time that Dienwald may not have because the longer he waits the more opportunities Philippa has to break his head, his heart, or both!What worked for me:I've loved medieval stories ever since I discovered King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe, so \\"Earth Song\\" gets points from me just for being set in this time period.There were some wryly humorous lines peppered throughout the book that kept me smiling, and of course it was very nice to see a woman escape from a dire predicament for once without a man swooping in to rescue her.Size-wise Philippa was very tall and solid and frequently teased about her great height.What didn't work for me:I realize that the hero and heroine were thrown together, but still they bickered right up til just about the last page of the book. (And that's a just a wee bit long for my tastes.) Also, there were a few plot elements that were a bit too transparent, and in a handful of places the writing felt stilted, not at all what I expect from a Catherine Coulter novel.Overall:Fans of Medievals should enjoy this one, but fans of Ms. Coulter may not find it to be her very best work.Warning: While it didn't quite cross the line into full-fledged \\"bodice ripper\\" territory, \\"Earth Song\\" balanced itself precariously on that line. If you are uncomfortable with stories which are less-than-PC, then you may want to give a pass on this one, which tries to be true to the harsh realities of life in Medieval times."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"If you are searching for a merry dance to warm you to the depths of your soul on a cold winter night, this is the book for you. Deinwald is a refreshingly tenderhearted rogue, with a sincere belief in himself as a scoundrel. Philippa is an impulsive and outrageous heronie who can't seem to think before she acts. Together with Deinwald's 9 year old son, theese two will have you clutching your sides, throwing back your head and roaring with laughter. I much enjoyed Deinwald's refusal to be anything but exactly who and what he wanted to be, even when faced with the shock of his life! These characters were vividly alive and enchantingly human. Philippa, Dienwald and the family of St. Erth will remain firmly wrapped around my heart strings for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"The only time I stopped reading this fabulous novel was to wipe the tears of mirth from my eyes. Why ? Because Philippa threw a bucket of water on Dienwald &amp; sent him flying toward a goat, who reared back &amp; kicked him on the thigh. Ms Coulter should be given the lifetime-achievement entertainer award ! Philippa is tall &amp; gangly, saucy, courageous, strong-willed &amp; unruly. Against Dienwald, Edmund (his brat) &amp; the people of his keep, she matched 'em word for word &amp; gradually won their admiration &amp; hearts (although Dienwald is the most reluctant of all). I own 26 - and counting - Coulter books &amp; this one ranks right up there behind my favorite = Moonspun magic (Rafael's obscene molded bread &amp; all that). Graelam &amp; Kassia also show up to my delight &amp; Dienwald's despair. Dienwald is adorable &amp; the nickname 'wench' he gave Philippa is endearing. They still bicker &amp; make up like the odd couple in 'Secret Song' (Another terrific effort). Go to the bookstore, spend 6-7 bucks &amp; get a refund if U feel tricked. This one never ceased to amaze me !"},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"I think most fans of medieval romance will really enjoy this book. The characters are well fleshed out, there is tons of humor, plenty of action and some really steamy love scenes. But I didn't like the book at all even though I read it in one sitting (I kept hoping that it would get better). Apparently this is my problem since most people seem to love this book. As a woman, the hero is the most important character in the book to me so I have to like him to enjoy the book but, I hated this guy. Here's why:*warning spoilers*I don't like my hero's to have sex/love scenes with anyone other than the heroine. Talk about mood killer. There are several here and they are described in detail. In one of them, he even thinks of the heroine. ICK!I don't like my hero's to verbally abuse the heroine. Once or twice MAY be forgiven, but till the near end of the book? No. Why would anyone love somebody who called them a bit*h? Or someone who constantly made fun of them? Its not funny after a while.And I don't like hero's who cross the line (or nearly) into rape territory. Its one thing to steal a kiss, but to touch (forcefully) someone intimately? More ICK! The fondling-against-ones-will just gives me the creeps.So although the hero acted like the typical barbaric medieval man, that doesn't mean I have to like him. I don't read romance for that kind of reality. But some people do, but I don't. If these things don't bother you then read the book, you'll probably love it. Otherwise skip it and read something by Julie Garwood instead. Her hero's are strong without being condescending jerks."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"The author said the book was very funny, but I didn\`t laugh even once. The story is not interesting and it\`s not very compelling. I couldn\`t finish reading the book. But I\`m sure other people may view the book differently. This is just my opinion."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"I very seldom hate a book, but this one I did. The hero was a worthless human being, he was Constantly belittling and verbally abusing the heroine. And I didn't like how he had sex with other than the heroine and I say sex because it certainly could not be called making love when he did. And she was beyond stupid, she put up with all his name calling and she never thought before she jumped into anything, which I also found tiresome. The two of them deserved each other, as I didn't like either one of them. I kept reading hoping they would both have a great personality change but they never did. So, I finally just tossed it in the 'To Donate bag'. Good riddance!"},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"Ok, let me start out by saying I love CC's work, she is almost my favorite, right behind Judith McNaught! I did enjoy this book, it was a little hard to get into after the first few pages, I like how the girl was so headstrong to do the things she did but it just took too long and there were too many intermediaries in the story. Warrior Song - the first of this series was really good, the best of the series, in my opinion. Earth Song was good, I will probably sell the book and not read it again, it didnt hold me that long for me to read again.Sorry Ms. Coulter, You are a wonderful writer but this one was a bit lacking. I guess we all have bad days."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"This was a great book with a well written plot and lovable characters including a pet pig named Tupper who doesn't hesitate to jump into battle.

In this case, Kassia and Graelam de Moreton from Fire Song play a minor role.

I loved how Deinwald put up with her physical assaults on him. The mud fight was great! When the news came as to who she really was I was laughing aloud. They both were straightforward in their dealings with each other. I enjoyed this because it's nice to not always have the misunderstanding that usually seperate lovers.

Get on with it, read this book."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"Coulter's best of the \\"Song\\" series! Plucky (what else?), statuesque heroine determined to be her own person and avoid an arranged marriage. With a case of mistaken identity and a family secret, the plot may be a bit predictable but that's what most of us expect from this tried and true genre. I found thehero a likeable rogue, the son delightful, and the a villain to hiss. Just expect an engrossing and well research ambience, and go along for a transporting journeyto another time with characters that you will love!"},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"This one is the best of the \\"Song\\" series - the hero is not a rapist, the heroine isn't dumb, and the plot is actually a bit different from the others. Nice light reading - renews my faith a little in the author."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"I really loved Fire Song, the first story in the series. But I was really disappointed in this story. I did not like Deinwald de Fortenbery. He treated the heroine with verbal disrespect and made fun of her because she was not little and petite. As for the heroine, Philippa began the story fighting him and not tolerating his insults, but, after a few chapters, she tolerated his disrespect like it was nothing. He said he loved her, but he was never tender or loving even when they were in bed together. He treated her like she was his whore. And it really irritated me to hear him call her &quot;wench.&quot; I was hoping he would change like Graelem did in Fire Song, but the change never came. I actually threw the book across the room. For those who have not read this story, I would recommend that you not waste your money on it. I am still angry at the six dollars that I wasted on this book. Read another of Catherine Coulters books like Devil's Embrace, Valentine Legacy, or Fire Song."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"She continues to maintain a high standard of fact and fiction. she mixes it all well together to create a world of fantasy."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"Third in the Song series, and like the others set in 13th century England (Cornwall), this tells the story of Philippa de Beauchamp, very tall and impulsive daughter of Lord Henry. When she overhears her father planning to wed her to an old man, she runs away and ends up in the castle of Dienwald de Fortenberry, whom we met in FIRE SONG. Dienwald's castle is rundown and his people and he dress in rags (which I didn't like and felt was unrealistic). Held as Dienwald's captive, Philippa brings an order to the castle and its people and with the wool Dienwald stole from her father, she manages to clothe the people. Of course, Dienwald who seems to sleep with all the women in his domain, lusts after Philippa.This one seemed more fanciful to me, especially given the multiple times Philippa was naked in front of people and naked sleeping with Dienwald (ostensibly because he was worried she'd run away...what? No guards?). It may also have been the dialog which I think Coulter intended to be tongue in cheek since she told me to be prepared to laugh when I read it. The chemistry between the two was late in coming and two thirds of the way through the book Deinwald thinks the worst of Philippa and is still constantly berating her as being \\"over large\\" and having big feet. (Again, since she was a beautiful girl who, we learn early on, is actually King Edward's illegitimate daughter, I assume his criticism was also tongue in cheek.)It's a clever plot in many ways and Coulter serves up witty dialog and some new characters though you might not recognize the serious Deinwald we met in book 2, FIRE SONG. (Of the series thus far, I liked WARRIOR'S SONG best.) Still, it's entertaining and I can recommend it.The Medieval Song Series:WARRIOR'S SONG (earlier version titled CHANDRA)FIRE SONGEARTH SONGSECRET SONG"},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"This book is definitely entertaining..The characters are strong and funny. The carefree hero who doesnt' like to be tied down ends up with more than he bargins for when he encounters the heroine.Although I was laughing throughout the book, I didn't feel like there was much romance development and I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main characters. As a couple, you just weren't drawn to them.But overall very entertaining."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"I thought this book was a fun read. I loved the secondary characters and how the whole story unfolded and the many twists and turns it took along the way. Phillipa was a brave girl who had a giving heart and a fire in her spirit. This book was fun to read and kept me on my toes wondering what might come next. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of all the fighting between the two characters. I don't mind some fighting, but I don't like it when they are constantly going at it all the time. I just wished everyone didn't make fun of Phillipa's height. It got kind of mean and old after awhile. I believe there is a fine balance and this one just tipped a little too far over to the hostility side. But, don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this book. There were some real funny and cute parts in it (i.e.my favorite was the mud scene)."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"After reading Fire Song I could not help but wonder what happened to Kassia and Graelam. Catherine did a marvelous job w/ the connections between both books. This is my first time reading a quartet and it is very satisfying to read their continuations. Deinwald and Phillipa were humorous, there were challenges they had to overcome, and to my predicament they did. They met in such an unsual way you can't help but laugh and want more. You will be glued to the book from the very beginning and the including of old friends from Fire Song will delight you. This was by far the best book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"This is one of the best books I've read, for pleasure, in years.

A very interesting and entertaining read. One very good historical romance."},{"Title":"Earth Song","review":"This is one of four SONG books, the last, but it stands on its own very well, and is the best of Coulter's works. It is funny, warm and you really love these characters.Philippa de Beauchamp, is a long-legged girl, tall as many of her suitors. After her sisters fianc&eacute; tries to kiss her, her father says he is going to marry her to the repugnant Baron de Bridgeport. He was merely telling the suitor that, but Phillipa believe it, and decides to escape her fate. She stows away in a waggon full of wool, heading to town. Only the waggons are stolen by one Dienwald de Fortenberry. Dienwald is a self-styled lord of the manor, a rogue, a robber and answers to no one, though he does try to take care of his people. Which is why he was stealing the wool. They are in desperate need of new clothing. What he did not need was the woolly monster that rose up out of the waggon. Once it is cleaned up, he find he has a woman nearly as tall as him, one worth a ransom. So he keeps her prison. However, she takes over the castle. It is a pigsty and she sees it cleaned, she sets about to having the wool spin for cloth, then clothing made for everyone. And she slowly falls in love with Dienwald. Only romance is not smooth!! Especially when he learns that she is the bi-blow daughter of Edward the Longshanks.This is so wonderful, much in the style of Lynsay Sands engaging &amp; warm historicals. So if you enjoy Lynsay, I highly recommend this to her fans.Many of Coulter's older historical were rather rough in the treatment of the females, so it a delight to see one so charming and endearing."},{"Title":"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire","review":"The other Complete Decline and Fall that gets lots of reviews has in-line footnotes, which are awful. This one has hyperlinked footnotes, which is great but...The section headings for each section succeed rather than precede each section. So you read a section on Spain...and when you read the last word in that section, you get the Spain heading. Then you read a section on Gaul...and get the Gaul heading. Horrible since the guideposts all follow the relevant text. Not as unreadable as the Kindle editions with in line footnotes but pretty awful nevertheless. For $13, I'd just save your money. Come on Penguin: Straighten this out. I'm willing to pay money but you screwed me. As an avid Penguin reader, I'm very disappointed that they let something like this out...in a world full of Free Gibbons, if you are going to charge $13, it should at least be free of obvious mistakes.Poorly done--stars reflect the price:quality ratio of the Kindle edition.

The battles are chronicled between biographer and subject, and sometimes between biographer and book, and then between biographer and reviewer.Conflicts? What is irrelevant and what is fair game? When sources conflict, which is to be believed? Does it matter whether the subject agrees or approves of what you print? What ethics apply?Detailing his own experiences with subjects like Lillian Hellmann, Norman Mailer, Martha Gellhorn, and the late Susan Sontag, the author shows how the decisions are made, and the reasoning behind those decisions.This is a handsome hardcover with easy-to-read print.

Boswell and Samuel Johnson are brought into court as co-defendents, along with Kitty Kelly and a host of others. The author has no kind words to say for \\"critics and reviewers\\", clearly to him the vermin of the literary world, and feels much aggrieved by his unjust treatment at their hands.While one may be less than convinced by his arguments, and be irritated by his frequent whining of being much put upon, his chatty tone, wealth of biographical lore and surprising revelations about the biographer's trade make this in the end a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Higher Form of Cannibalism?: Adventures in the Art and Politics of Biography","review":"\\"The truth is that biography remains invasive, however you dress it up.\\"Rollyson's book is so lucid, revealing, and entertaining that I have ordered it for my next course on biography (I have used two of Rollyson's shorter books, Documentary Film: A Primer and Reading Biography).This book offers a nuts and bolts look at the challenges of writing biography. Rollyson discusses his own projects and those of his fellow biographers, going back as far as Johnson and Boswell and even touching on Plutarch. The discussion is always lively.I expect students to enjoy particularly the moral and legal issues surrounding the author's chosen profession. There are other books on the market covering these specific topics, but I have yet to find anything as engaging as this work.The brilliance of Rollyson's approach is easy to describe: he acknowledges the almost monstrous qualities of the \\"biografiend\\" (\\"there is something demonic about biography\\"), then goes about defending the monster (whose work can represent \\"a disciplined effort to suit our sensibility to another's, to move beyond the self\\"). The biographer comes out of it looking like a classic Universal movie monster of the 1930s, dangerous yet misunderstood.That is as it should be, for both Dracula and the biographer offer their \\"victims\\" a kind of immortality--in exchange for a little blood."},{"Title":"A Higher Form of Cannibalism?: Adventures in the Art and Politics of Biography","review":"Carl Rollyson's A Higher Form Of Cannibalism? questions whether the enthusiasm over biography has in fact led to its downfall into bad taste.

Since the book was published by Lyle Stuart in l986, the Eberles have been cited as experts in sexual abuse trials ... What is startling about the Eberles' reputation as ground-breaking experts in the field is that their dubious credentials have not been widely challenged ... Their publication, Finger, depicted scenes of bondage, S & M, and sexual activities involving urination and defecation. A young girl portrayed with a wide smile on her face sits on top of a man whose penis is inside of her; a woman has oral sex with a young boy in a drawing entitled \`Memories of My Boyhood'.I suggest anyone wanting to use this book as \\"proof\\" that there is such a thing as \\"false memory\\" try to find more credible experts. Unfortunately, nearly everyone in this \\"field\\", including Elizabeth Loftus, are, in my opinion, of the same dubious background as the Eberles.

Look up the article on the Eberles by Maria Laurina on Google. I rest my case."},{"Title":"The Politics of Child Abuse","review":"In this novel the authors; Paul &amp; Shirley Eberle, explore the corrupt world of child protection services. They provide a very convincing and intellegent arguement that the very government agencies that are supose to protect children are infact the ones who cause the most harm.By the end of this novel you will not help but agree with the author's theory that a child abuse industry does indeed exist.This industry mainly consists of social workers, police, and poliicians. You will find that the purpose of the industry is to find as many &quot;victims&quot; as they can. The methods they use to acomplish this goal are morally bankrupt. They brainwash little children to believe that they have been sexually molested when they clearly have not been. Their motives for doing this are new grants for child abuse clinics, promotions, and politcal gain.In conclusion I would recomend this novel to everyone.

Each page is full-color with text that reads more like the author's stream of consciousness about what makes good design.For instance, he shows four identical photographs, but framed differently (inside a circle, inside a square, etc) and invites the reader to ask themselves which vacation appeals to them. Which one looks more fun. Etc. But there's no takeaway; the author says \\"there is no right answer. Don't try to analyze, just react emotionally.\\" Okay, fine. But why am I doing this exercise? The author doesn't linger, but moves onto his next stream of consciousness activity - the same pictures, but with a colored background. Again, the takeway is \\"don't try to rationalize. Just pay attention to your emotional reaction.\\"I flipped through page after page, waiting for anything the author had to say or show to resonate with me as useful or insightful.

If you want to know how economic policy making REALLY happens inside the beltway (including even the most boring parts, the ugliest warts, and more!), this book gives it to you straight.What will you learn from this book? How both good and bad economic policies are distorted by the media and propagandized by politicians. The bottom line -- why DC politicians continue to produce economic failure after failure."},{"Title":"Supply-Side Revolution: An Insider's Account of Policymaking in Washington","review":"I read this book because I was studying the economic changes brought about by the Reagan victory in 1980. I've seen many favorable and unfavorable mentions of the &quot;supply-side&quot; theory, so I was looking for an account from a true supply-sider. This book fits that need. It desribes the immediate intellectual origins of the policy (but not the fundamental long-term origins). It then describes the political battles that went on in the legislative and executive branches from 1978 to about the end of 1981. I enjoyed reading how the free-market Republicans, Keynesian Republicans and liberals fought it out behind the scenes. These battles shaped the relatively vague &quot;supply-side&quot; theory into a specific government policy. This book is a good view into those years and provides perspective to the more recent government tax and spending issues."},{"Title":"Supply-Side Revolution: An Insider's Account of Policymaking in Washington","review":"Dr. Roberts has written a beautifully written and compellingly factual and detailed view of how the supply siders came into \\"power\\" and began to dominate economic policy formulation in Washington DC.

I found disappointly that he's gone off the deep end politically so God only knows what his positions are today except anti-Bush and anti-American hegemony (his own myth).

I had no idea that I was held up in something addictive, but this book explains how and why this horrible pattern continues. You can't help but get some direction from it when you read it. It saved my life, and I have since purchased it for 2 friends and gave them a copy to keep. Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"The spider and the fly: Are you caught in an abusive relationship?","review":"This well-written, easy-to-read book explains the signs and symptoms of an abusive relationship in understandable language. The author expands the definition to include physical, emotional, sexual and mental abuse. Basically, anything where one partner is controlling another against that person's own best interests and well-being. Just because your partner's not hitting you doesn't mean they're not abusive. The author also explicates the subtle mechanisms of abuse including how it begins, grows, and the ultimate outcome. In doing so, the question, \\"Why does she stay?\\" gets answered. Although using an addiction model, the author adapts it appropriately so as not to blame the victim. The primary messages are: \\"It's not your fault.\\" and \\"You CAN get out.\\" If you suspect that a friend is in an abusive relationship or even if you \\"have a funny feeling\\" about it, then this book is your key to understanding what's going on and how to help (or get help). Recommended for any concerned friend. Ought to be required reading for all social workers and law enforcement officers, i.e., anyone who comes into contact with people who are caught in the spider's web of abuse."},{"Title":"The modern witchcraft spellbook","review":"some of the other reviewers of this book don't really seem to understand what it's about. it's about WITCHCRAFT. it gives SPELLS. now, i'm sorry if it bothers you that witchcraft and wicca are not the same thing, but they aren't. and, incidentally, this book can in no way be called ceremonial magick. it is a perfectly good collection of spells and bits of folklore, largely from a hoodoo/folk magic vein. oh, and incidentally, the spells in it seem to work just fine, (as do many other spells that involve calling on the Lord or reciting the psalms.)"},{"Title":"The modern witchcraft spellbook","review":"This book is one of the best by Anna Riva.

I was no exception. However, this book introduced the subject matter to me in very clear, easy to get and precise way.Logically presented theory in this book makes the subject simple and understandable. The immediate practical applications of the theorems to real life problems provide a meaningful perspective for the students. Detailed solutions in Maple teach you how to invoke Maple functions to solve Linear Algebra problems. Thus you get three books in one: Linear Algebra theory, Linear Algebra examples and solutions, and instructions on how to use Maple.Working in data analysis it was nice to be able to have this book as a reference (especially the SVD part) - simple, fast, and reliable. On top of it, this book has helped me to understand the concepts for other classes (Probability and Statistics - Linear Regression Analysis), Functional Analysis (Linear Functional and Transformations), Topology (Topological Spaces, Bases).I would definitely recommend this book to students who are just starting to learn Linear Algebra, as well as to those who have difficulty understanding the main concepts of this beautiful subject.

An interesting resource for the historian, but don't use this for costuming ideas unless you either don't care for accuracy or know enough to sift the false from the true."},{"Title":"Vecellio's Renaissance Costume Book (Dover Pictorial Archives)","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that it would cover all of Renaissance Europe and not just the usual area of focus for this subject (i.e. Elizabethan England). However, to my disappointment at least half the book concentrated on Italian costuming, which in retrospect is to be expected, since the author was Italian! The author definitely focuses on middle to upper-class clothing and will not be helpful to someone who may be looking for lower class clothing.However, in general, the woodcuts are exquisite and the organization is very easy to use. It is certainly a 'must have' for anyone looking for historical pictures of Renaissance period clothing, written by someone who was a contemporary of the time."},{"Title":"Vecellio's Renaissance Costume Book (Dover Pictorial Archives)","review":"I had heard of the Vecellio book and had even seen excerpts from it here and there.

However, any costume depiction in this book that is of costume outside of Venice or Italy should be taken with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Irish Ulysses","review":"Maria Tymoczko's The Irish Ulysses is an amazing read and a must for anyone interested in Ulysses or James Joyce. It is difficult for me to express, properly, my admiration for this book as it delivers James Joyce to his proper status as hero of the Irish Literary Revival.I read Maria Tymoczko's The Irish Ulysses shortly after finishing Edna O'Brien's biography of James Joyce. The timing was perfect. In reading Ms. O'Brien's biography, I almost had the sense of reading a scandal sheet and wondered why it is that we so easily confuse a writer's fiction with his or her reality. Why we feel so triumphant in connecting moments in real life with moments in fiction and allowing our imaginations to fill the blanks between those connections.Ms. Tymoczko resists the temptation to tread the same ground of Joyce's real life and moves, instead, to the Irishness of Ulysses. After reading The Irish Ulysses, I cannot imagine harboring doubt as to its conclusions, nor can I imagine a reader who might fail to see the specifically Irish nature of Ulysses. The argument based on a comparison between various moments in early Irish literature and Ulysses was sound enough, but Ms. Tymoczko does not leave it at that. She thoroughly examines what literature would have been available to Joyce, as well as that which he actually had as part of his library. From newspaper sources to the holdings of the library in Trieste, Ms. Tymoczko leaves little room for doubt that Ulysses is Joyce's creation of an Irish epic to rival that of any nation's literary tradition. I cannot do justice to this book or it's import to the world of Ulysses scholarship."},{"Title":"The Irish Ulysses","review":"Maria Tymoczko, long respected Joyce scholar and investigator of ancient, even pre-literate Irish history and legends, in the polyglot original, brings together these two fields of her expertise in a brilliant volume which introduces the reader gently and fully to both.Anyone intrigued by that greatest novel of the twentieth century: Ulysses (or is it actually the record of the dreaming soul: Finnegans Wake) and hungry for fuller understanding does well to study carefully this large book, bearing both great tomes in hand like Breen outside Barney Kiernan's. Anyone desiring to feel fully the great Irish literary tradition does well as well to study carefully this book, finding the millenium long tradition's fullest culmination within the labyrinthine works of Joyce.I always feel the greatest commentary on James JOyce is the one I currently consider. This Irish Ulysses is the greatest commentary of Joyce, case closed, and the greatest plea for a recognition of Irish literary tradition and political history, both of which were long denied under the bootheel of the British oppressor.Kindly see the current price for a NEW copy of the paperback edition. It is less than the cost of shipping, and far less than the cost of less worthy commentary. Please, I encourage you to acquire this multi-levelled text, which opens the door not only to Joyce but thusly to all of Irish literary and historical tradition (have I already said that? sorry, forgive my redundancy!)"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"I was drawn in by the first Shakespeare book by Gary - \\"Shakespeare Stealer\\" and was pleased to read more about Widge and his continuing adventures in this 3rd book - \\"Shakespeare's Spy.\\" Gary Blackwood is an extraordinary writer and amazingly brings Widge and the other characters to life in this non stop, what's going to happen next, who did it, tale!! This particular book has many plots: who is stealing from Mr. Shakespeare? Will Widge write his own play? Will Widge get the girl? and more importantly, does he really want the girl?? and what about that fortune teller? Must read to find out!!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"Shakespeare's Spy is the third (and apparently the last) book in Blackwood's Shakespeare Stealer series. I would like to think that there might be more books in the future, as I have enjoyed this series quite a bit, but the events in this book have a coming-of-age feel to them as we see Widge having to confront the challenges of love and death, not to mention having to find a way to aid an old friend and to find out who's been spying on Master Shakespeare's troupe at the same time.As always, Blackwood does an excellent job of working in details about life in Shakespeare's London and about life in the world of Elizabethan theater. And as he did in Shakespeare's Scribe, Blackwood here goes into even more detail about what goes into the writing of a play as Widge tries his hand at writing a play of his own. Using this, Blackwood also cleverly shows the reader at the same time how it is possible that not all the plays we think of as being Shakespeare's were necessarily his work. One of the things I like about Blackwood's books is that you learn things about the actual historical period in the process of an enjoyable read. The actual history in this case adds to the drama as Widge and his fellow players must deal with the impending death of Queen Elizabeth, under whose reign the theater prospered. They must wait anxiously to see whether her successor, James, will be a patron of the theater or, if the Puritans have their way, will have it banned as a sinful indulgence, putting an end to all theatrical performances and to their way of life.Another thing I particularly liked about Shakespeare's Spy is Blackwood's use of a fortune teller who early on foretells what fate has in store for Widge, his friend Sam and his rival Sal Pavy. And just as Shakespeare often did, Blackwood cleverly shows that just because you've been told your fortune does not mean that you have correctly interpreted it, let alone that you will understand until it finally happens.All in all, this third book is yet another highly enjoyable and educational read. My only regret is that Widge's tale is seemingly done and there won't be any other books to follow. Highly recommended for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"This book was as good as the ones before it. The information laid out in the book was intriguing, especially the parts about the Papists and the queen's failing health.

I think overall it was well done!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"I have enjoyed the other two Shakespeare books by this author, but this one began to delve into the occult with fortune telling. Because of that I cannot recommned this for anyone who had convictions against such things. I am writing this to warn others who share the same conviction so they won't waster their money."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"It was a month ago that I read \\"The Shakespeare Stealer\\" and found myself absorbed in the world of Elizabethan theatre and the life of the plucky orphan Widge. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next two books in the series. \\"Shakespeare's Spy\\" is the final chapter of Widge's adventures. In this novel, a series of thefts and the attention of anti-Catholic authorities bring it to the attention of the Lord Chamberlain's Men that there is a traitor in their midst. As the players speculate amongst themselves as to which of them it might be, Widge is preoccupied with a new project: writing a play, in the hopes that he can impress Shakespeare's beautiful daughter, Judith.This wasn't my favorite book of the trilogy; it seemed a little more contrived than the others, a little less natural, a little more reliant on standard fiction \\"devices.\\" However, this minor flaw hardly disqualifies the novel from a place with its predecessors among the ranks of excellent juvenile historical fiction. The same candor, wit, and tenderness that made the first two novels such a delight are intact in this sequel, and once again, Gary Blackwood offers just enough clues to enable the attentive reader to uncover most of the novel's secrets. His audacious treatment of real historical figures, depicting them as flesh-and-blood creatures as splendidly imagined as the wholly fictitious characters, rather than untouchable relics, is on display here more than ever. Blackwood feels thoroughly at home in Widge's world, and it shows. A fortune-teller who makes several brief appearances offers an offbeat sort of foreshadowing, as her predictions do all come true by the novel's end, but not in the way either the characters or the reader would ever have expected.\\"Because of you,\\" the fortune-teller informs Widge, \\"someone . . . will return to life.\\" She might have said the very same thing of Gary Blackwood, who has succeeded yet again in drawing the reader back into a fascinating slice of history and imbuing it with a fresh vitality. Readers who enjoyed Widge's previous adventures should be eager indeed to get their hands on this final installment."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"In this third adventure for young Widge, apprentice to William Shakespeare's London theatre company, we find the city in a depressing and uncertain time, waiting for the ailing queen to die, afraid that the new king may ban theatre performances altogether. Widge is also facing personal dilemmas as he tries to get passage money for his friend Julia to get home, and he makes a play for Shakespeare's daughter -- literally; Widge boasts to her that he is writing a play, and when she asks to see it, he decides he really must write one. WS gives him a play he's given up on, which is funny because many say it's one of Shakespeare's \\"least good\\", and I think it also allows kids to entertain the idea that history is not really written in stone, and that many stories fill our past, each one unique and interesting.Our family has read the three Widge books. They've been terrific on many levels: we've learned about England of the time, London and Shakespeare's troupe in particular; we've read almost a thousand pages about an interesting character in intriguing situations; we've watched the character grow and mature, experience happy times, bad times, sad events and growth. The writing is easy on the ear and eye, the dialogue natural, and the fiction believable.Wonderful series. Wish there were more."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Spy (Shakespeare Stealer, Book 3)","review":"In this third book of the series, the author is back to lively writing and entertaining storytelling. (The second volume was a slow starter.)Times were hard for theater people in London in 1603, and the plague continued to endanger lives. Widge tries to solve a mystery of stolen costumes, meets Will Shakespeare's daughter, and with Shakespeare's help, also tries his hand at writing a play -- acquiring a new name in the process! Small references to events in the previous two books -- The Shakespeare Stealer and Shakespeare's Scribe -- are more easily understood if you've read them first.As always, I enjoy learning about historical facts while I am reading fiction. Although I have read in history books about the fact that the English (Anglican) Church was the country's mandated church during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, I hadn't realized until I read this how hard life would have been for Catholics at that time. (I did know that the Jews were persecuted in the Middle Ages.)Some people have expressed alarm that there is a \\"fortune teller\\" in this book. I don't think the author is trying to convince anyone that this was anything other than a phenomenon of the times. In the Author's Note at the end, the author explains this and other historical facts.

He also relates cases from Ceylon, Australia (the Sydney Shark affair), and other far-flung ports of the British Empire.The author most especially seemed to relish his medico-legal battles with the famous Home Office Pathologist, Sir Bernard Spilsbury. In one of his most interesting trials, Sir Sydney testified on behalf of Sidney Fox, a convicted forger, blackmailer, swindler, and thief who was also accused of murdering his own mother for the insurance money--she died less than an hour before her accidental death policy was due to expire.Dear old mom was a confederate in most of her son's crimes, but Fox emphatically denied strangling her and setting her hotel room on fire, and Sir Sydney believed him. At least he believed that the con man's mother showed no physical evidence of strangulation. He and the great Spilsbury locked horns over the forensic evidence in court and Sir Sidney's client was condemned to the gallows, but was it for the wrong reason?The fact that Fox renewed his mother's accidental death policy the day before she died was the evidence that hung him, but was he really guilty of murdering her? Sir Sidney thinks not.Mordant wit abounds in this book, most especially in the chapter, &quot;Accident, Suicide, or Murder?&quot; Sir Sidney relates the suicide by coal-gas of a plumber from Aberdeen who &quot;connected a tube to the gas-pipe before it entered the meter, and so all the way to the room where his body was found.&quot;We've all heard stories about thrifty Scots, but Aberdonians seem to be a legend even amongst their own countrymen.&quot;Mostly Murder&quot; contains several gruesome photographs from the author's forensic files, but nothing we haven't already seen on television."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"Murder is not funny. Yet this obviously major first book on early forensic science turned out to be a 'snort of laughter' funny book. It's a very wryly written and very wise autobiography, with no backstabbing or self-congratulatory remarks. If anything, Smith was way too modest, in dealing with the many parts of forensic science (which are now dealt with by different departments in police, FBI, etc). He managed to deal with ballistic forensics, stringing a couple of microscopes together while in Eqypt in order to compare bullets and casings. This was way prior to the invention of comparison microscopes that are regularly used even in med school.The stories he tells are usually not well-known, but he had a good reason for sharing the story because it showed a particular means of solving a crime (or not solving it) using what they had available in forensics during the early 1900's. Smith imagination and ability to 'make do' are something that is badly missed in most sciences today. He certainly lived a very productive and valuable life, and obviously his inventions and unique ideas have been built upon in forensic science. I think he would not be surprised, but would have enjoyed the other newer fields in forensics such as entymology.This is an older book, found at my university library. Quite frankly, it would be worthwhile to publish again and recommend to the many people who are showing such an interest in forensics due to shows such as CSI. Many of the concepts Smith teaches are still valuable today. If readers cannot buy this book, try to find it at a university libary. It is extremely well-written and enjoyable.Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book tells of the many interesting cases in his career. If you liked &quot;Quincy ME&quot; or &quot;CSI&quot; you'll love reading true stories about his pioneering work in the first half of the 20th century. He is an outstanding writer as well. This book shows how legal medicine can convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent. Most of these cases deal with murder, and tell how the doctor let the dead bones speak to the living.Erle Stanley Gardner says a successful practitioner of forensic medicine must not only be outstanding in his field, but most be quick-thinking and keen of mind: a real version of Sherlock Holmes. A good medical expert should search for the truth, not the facts to support a pre-conceived theory; this usually results in a miscarriage of justice; chapter 20 illustrates this.Page 90 tells of his analysis of the British .303 cartridge. The bullet had an &quot;aluminium tip enclosed in a strong cupro-nickel jacket&quot;. This tip often broke off when the bullet entered a body. This could result in a blunt-edged bullet that could tumble in a body and create more damage; in effect, a dum-dum bullet.On page 152 he says that in the British legal system, expert witnesses are made available to the defendants, and paid when the defendant is without means. This is an improvement over just providing a public defender. &quot;While the life of a scoundrel may not be worth saving, the principles of justice always are.&quot;Sir Sydney Smith writes with a dry, subtle sense of humor, and with understatements. This book cannot be easily summarized, except to say: get it and read it!"},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"Mostly Murder is the autobiography of Sir Sydney Smith, the doyen of forensic pathology in Edinburgh in the early decades of the twentieth century. The book briefly covers his early life and medical training (some of it under Bell, best known as the inspiration for Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes) before commencing a comprehensive review of his professional life. Forensic medicine was in its infancy in the 1920's and 30's, and Smith was one of its pioneers. He was involved in investigating many of the high-profile cases of his time, and these are discussed in depth, understanding for the layman being aided by the use of illustrations throughout. Written in a humble and accessible style, the book serves not only as a fascinating insight into a remarkable man, but also as a useful introduction to the basic techniques of forensic science. The author's life and work is placed firmly within its contemporary context, commenting in detail, for example, on his sometimes fractious relationships with other emerging pioneers such as Sir Bernard Spilsbury. Surely a book that desrves a wider audience, though unfortunately now out of print."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"Mostly Murder, Sir Sidney SmithSir Sidney Smith was one of the most brilliant and famous professors of forensic medicine in the first half of the 20th century. The British police relied on his help to solve baffling and bizarre crimes. Smith was a real life \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" who solved real crimes by real murderers. This 1959 book was a best seller. Most of these cases were reported in professional journals earlier. This 1973 book is a reissue of the original with a Foreword by Professor Keith Simpson. Smith was compared to Dr. Joseph Bell, the inspiration for \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". These chapters contain cases that involved Smith. Some became true crime classics, like the Ruxton case. The background tells about the life and culture of those times.Smith was born in New Zealand, worked as a pharmacist, then went to the University of Edinburgh (Chapter 1). A successful medical diagnosis requires observation, deduction, and exact knowledge (Chapter 2). Forensic medicine goes back thousands of years (p.38). The bodies of two young boys were found in a water-filled quarry. Chapter 3 tells how this case was solved. Smith was appointed head of the medico-legal section in Cairo in 1917, where the French legal system is followed (Chapter 4). Laboratory evidence was respected because of the fallibility of witnesses (p.56). Poisoning for gain was common (p.65). So was murder (Chapter 5). Polygamy caused domestic turmoil, jealousy, and crime (p.75). The end of the Great War saw riots for independence in Egypt (Chapter 6). British .303 cartridges have a bullet tip that broke off when it hit a body (p.90). No other military used this. The 1924 assassination of the Commander of the Egyptian Army was solved by ballistic evidence that linked the bullets to a pistol (Chapter 7).Chapter 8 tells how Bedouin trackers helped to solve a murder in the desert sands. An empty rifle cartridge identified the killer. Other cases are described. Smith published his \\"Forensic Medicine and Technology\\" in 1925 (Chapter 9). The British legal system pays for a defendant's expert witnesses (Chapter 10). Can a person be strangled when there are no physical signs (p.164)? Arsenic is the most commonly used poison (Chapter 11). The Marsh test showed the presence of arsenic since 1836. Chapter 12 tells about the unusual strangling of a young woman. Abortion was a criminal act (Chapter 13). But not if the child died in the uterus. The legal procedure in Jersey is a relic of Norman French (p.201). A young girl went missing and was found murdered (Chapter 14). Medical and scientific evidence solved the crime. A murder was revealed when a captured shark vomited a human arm (Chapter 15). A tattoo led to an identification by fingerprints. Parts of two bodies were found and linked to two missing people (Chapter 16). Evidence in the house for dismemberment, conviction on circumstantial evidence.A doctor should not report comments from an examination (Chapter 17). A physical presence leaves traces (p.240). A person's walking leaves traces on their shoes (p.248). The question of murder, suicide, or accident is common in real life (Chapter 18). Smith lists many examples. A bullet in the head may not cause immediate unconsciousness (p.263). Could telling the truth be more dangerous for an innocent man (p.267)? Chapter 19 explains the unusual effects of bullet wounds and other cases. Time of death can be fixed by body temperature, the extent of rigor mortis, and the state of the food consumed (Chapter 20). [The last time seen alive?] The last chapter tells of arsenic poisoning in Auckland. A woman became sick and died. Who did it? Her husband had no motive but was charged with murder. Smith testified for the defense; not guilty. The first half of the 20th century produced the greatest advances in human knowledge compared to the rest of recorded history (p.306). The total of all forms of indictable offenses has skyrocketed (p.307). The people most in need of defense are the least able to pay for it. The publicity given to murders is out of proportion to its social significance (p.308). He says murderers are mostly \\"ordinary individuals\\"."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"I first read this book around 1991 I borrowed it from one of the prisoners under my charge. I found it enthralling and very difficult to put down, what an early insight into the fascinating world of forensic science through the eye's of Sir Sydney Smith a (Kiwi) New Zealander. I found a fascinating story intertwined within this book related to Arthur Conan Doyle and his extraordinary power of observation. All up a book worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"\\"Mostly Murder\\" by Sir Sydney Smith, late Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Edinburgh is another great true-crime autobiography from the first half of the twentieth century, very similar in its witty, epigrammatic style to British Home Office Pathologist, Professor Keith Simpson's \\"Forty Years of Murder.\\" Both books are fascinating memoirs of 'mostly murders,' famous and obscure, although not always committed in Great Britain--Sir Sidney went to Egypt during the First World War and stayed on as the Principal Medico-Legal Expert to the Ministry of Justice until he returned to Edinburgh in 1928. He also relates cases from Ceylon, Australia (the Sydney Shark affair), and other far-flung ports of the British Empire.The author most especially seemed to relish his medico-legal battles with the famous Home Office Pathologist, Sir Bernard Spilsbury. In one of his most interesting trials, Sir Sydney testified on behalf of Sidney Fox, a convicted forger, blackmailer, swindler, and thief who was also accused of murdering his own mother for the insurance money--she died less than an hour before her accidental death policy was due to expire.Dear old mom was a confederate in most of her son's crimes, but Fox emphatically denied strangling her and setting her hotel room on fire, and Sir Sydney believed him. At least he believed that the con man's mother showed no physical evidence of strangulation. He and the great Spilsbury locked horns over the forensic evidence in court and Sir Sidney's client was condemned to the gallows, but was it for the wrong reason?The fact that Fox renewed his mother's accidental death policy the day before she died was the evidence that hung him, but was he really guilty of murdering her? Sir Sidney thinks not.Mordant wit abounds in this book, most especially in the chapter, \\"Accident, Suicide, or Murder?\\" Sir Sidney relates the suicide by coal-gas of a plumber from Aberdeen who \\"connected a tube to the gas-pipe before it entered the meter, and so all the way to the room where his body was found.\\"We've all heard stories about thrifty Scots, but Aberdonians seem to be a legend even amongst their own countrymen.\\"Mostly Murder\\" contains several gruesome photographs from the author's forensic files, but nothing we haven't already seen on television."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"For this U.S. trained forensic pathologist, anyway, Sir Sydney Smith was until recently not a familiar name. He and his perhaps more famous contemporary Spilsbury were the generation ahead of the \\"grand old men\\" with whom we are more familiar - Knight, for example. Smith's career was fascinating, though, coming as it did right on the edge of scientific death investigation. From the perspective of 2008, he made deductions and judgments that would simply never fly either scientifically or under contemporary cross examination. However, at his time he was truly at the top of his profession, and a terrific author to boot. This book should be part of any forensic pathology fellow's reading list, and for those outside the profession, offers unique insights into the pitfalls and pressures of this most fascinating craft."},{"Title":"Mostly Murder (Charnwood Library)","review":"In this book, the famous British Forensic Pathologist Dr. Sydney Smith narrates with a distinct Scottish charm and in factual manner the way he solved several noteworthy crimes committed in England and in some of its Colonies using his knowledge of Forensic Pathology during the mid 20th Century. Often, he would identify a murderer from a few bones as was once found in a dry well in Egypt where he established in Cairo, its first Forensic Pathology Laboratory. He gives the reader a glimpse of the court-room drama that attorney, Sir Bernard Spilsbury, for the Prosecution and Defence alternatively and Sydney Smith himself opposing Spilsbury produced in the courts of law in Britain. Several B&W photographs add greatly to the narrative of each solved case."},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I picked it up, read it and shared it with another friend. I immediately went to the bookstore to purchase several other books written by Mandino. Easy, concise and motivational. Those are the three words I used to describe the book when I loaned it out. This was 3 weeks ago. Since that time several people have purchased some of his books via Amazon (unfortunately for me I discovered Amazon.com after I made my purchases!!) as well as at different bookstores. I will recommend this book to all of the young people I know. As a matter of a fact I may purchase duplicate copies and distribute them myself. I believe that this author can make tremendous differences in the lives of all people, particularily those young people that are confused, lost and feeling unimportant!! Thanks to Mandino for great literature!!"},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"Even though this book is great by anyone's standards, it is not Og Mandino's best. It is very similar to &quot;The Greatest Salesman in the World&quot; (also by Mandino) but it somehow does not live up to the eternal masterpiece. The story itself is as striking as &quot;Salesman&quot; but the 10 principles are rather lethargically added to the end and do not carry the power of the ones in \\"Salesman\\". If you already own &quot;Salesman&quot; this is a worthwhile investment for sure, if not get &quot;The Greatest Salesman in the World&quot; instead. Whichever one you choose it will change your life that I can guarantee.Ps. Anyone else notice Anthony Robins copies Mandino's principles exactly and makes it more detailed?"},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"A magnificent fictional story about Zacchaeus from the Bible and how he became successful using what is called in the book as \\"The Commandments of Success.\\" The commandments are the guiding principles which led Zacchaeus to financial and spiritual prosperity, in which he reveals to the masses upon being begged to do so. They are simple yet effective principles that can help lead anyone to achieve their goals, whatever they may be. As Og Mandino presents to you his commandments, he does so in a splendid and marveling way with its Biblical characters and references."},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"I WAS DOWN, AND NOW I HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP MY STORE AND FORMULA FOR SUCCESS GIVEN.

That said, it's still a great book."},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"I have read everyone of Og Mandinos Books and all I can say is that he writes with brilliance, clarity, enthusiasm, and spirit. You can never go wrong with any of his books. He points out the path to success and motivates the spirit within to achieve all that we as human beings are capable. He helped me to tap into my innate genuis and create a life of prosperity and creativity. If you havent raed his books, start now and your journey of the spirit will begin. He was a born writer and even after his passing continues to have a great influence on many people old and young. He truly lived a purposeful and divine life. Go buy all his books and enjoy the growth and enlightenment. After that Buy my Book \\" Your daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present\\". Enjoy and rememeber you are capable of great things in your life."},{"Title":"Greatest Success in the World","review":"I'm not an expert on inspirational books. I read this because I love reading and I picked it up from my wife's grandmother's book collection when she passed away. Anyway, on to the review...The story in the book is about a man named Zaccheus but is told from the perspective of his friend and confidant Joseph. Zaccheus is disfigured/crippled in the sense that he is extremely short because of his misshapen legs. He is also an orphan. But despite his trials in life he becomes the richest man in all of Jericho and possibly all of Israel. Joseph is kind of like his chief counselor.The story is really a facade for the rules of success that Og Mandino wants to teach you. Near the end of the story - it took me about 30 minutes to read the entire book - the 10 rules to success (only 9 are listed initially but the 10th appears soon thereafter) are presented as entire chapters. The rules aren't really all that much to shout about, but I guess it could help some people so, here they are (simplified for you by me):1. Work hard.2. Be patient.3. Set goals.4. Plan on hard times.5. Don't let the hard times get you down.6. Dreams are worthless unless realized.7. Don't ruminate about the past.8. Simplify your life (not really sure what he means by this one).9. Live like today is your last day on earth.10. Be yourself.Seems like common sense to me, but that's just me. Suggestions... If you like stories, look for a good novel and not something by Og Mandino. If you want self help or inspirational, I guess the format makes it more enjoyable than something by Stephen Covey but I would still recommend Dale Carnegie's books for usefulness and entertainment value."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - The Heist","review":"Desert Storm veterans Linc Jackson and Rick Weaver served their country well, but have been discarded since returning to civilian life in Chicago. However, an opportunity arises when a rare flood threatens downtown.

At the same time, cops, some questionable on which side of the law they lie also want the former marines and the money they stole. High noon in the ocean of Chicago is coming.This is an action packed thriller that moves at a rapid pace once Linc and Rick decide to use their military skills under the cover of the weather to pull off THE HEIST and never slows down as the Regulator keeps coming after them. The story line is caper driven with the events enabling the audience to somewhat see how the characters, especially the lead duo, react. No one stays on the legal side of the law leading to a fun testosterone overflow Chicago joy ride.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in current release, I am greatly impressed by Max Allan Collins and his HINDENBURG MURDERS. His choice of Leslie Charteris, once an actual passenger on the Hindenburg, as a sleuth was a masterstroke of brilliance. The novel's use of a historical situation and actual people's names was deftly handled. Collins has built a crisp mystery in a realistic-feeling setting. THE HINDENBURG MURDERS is most deserving of its recent Shamus Award nomination."},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"Usually I am leery of writers who use real life historical characters as sleuths, they tend to just rely on the gimmick with the mystery angle being rather blah, however that's not the case with this book.Collins choice of Leslie Charteris as his protagonist is ideal. Charteris was a colorful character in his own right and he *was* a passenger on the Hindenburgh (on it's maiden voyage though not on the final trip). Collin's also uses the real names of the passengers and crew for his fictitious characters, creates a credible mystery around the events in pre-war Nazi Germany and builds to a spectacular climax. All makes for very satisfying reading.Not only will I be looking for more Max Allan Collins this book has made me want to find out more about the Hinderburgh and to re-read the Saint stories."},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"He is the famous author of the Saint mysteries, novels read by millions of loyal fans throughout the world. He was also on the maiden voyage of the Hindenburg dirigible and the finally voyage as well. On May 3, 1937, after the passengers boarded under the uncomfortable scrutiny of the Nazis, the ship leaves for the one-week trip from Frankfurt to America. On the trek over the ocean, Charteris notices that the officials have confiscated all lighters and matches, leaving the author to wonder if someone reported a bomb threat.An SS informer mysterious vanishes, and the writer thinks an unknown assailant(s) tossed the missing person off the ship during the night. The officers fear bad publicity and the reaction of their own government. They ask Charteris to discretely investigate what happened to the SS informer. During his inquiries, he learns more than he wants to know about the passengers, the reaction to world events, and the military gamesmanship going on board the ship. Charteris is the only person left living who knows what really happened over the ocean and over New Jersey.Using an actual catastrophe within the framework of a mystery entertains readers while educating the audience as to a world's reaction to Hitler just before the war. The protagonist, the renowned author of the Saint novels, symbolizes the upcoming battle with the Nazis even as he appears too self-indulgent, making for an interesting dichotomy. Max Allan Collins has become one of the masters of the twentieth century historical mystery and THE HINDENBURG MURDERS will only augment his growing reputation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"This book was excellent in the way that it was historical yet, it was interesting (not that history isn't interesting!) It was great because it was easy to relate information that you already know to information that you didn't know. It had an excellent story line and you can't put it down! It is so intriging you just keep reading! Buy it today and, I guarantee you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"I debated whether or not to give this book an extra half star for the research that went it to it, but decided not to. Sure it's impressive to know that the characters in the story are based on the name of passengers in real life and that some of the tale is based on facts, however I couldn't come away with a ringing endorsement of this book but can say that it is an average book. I didn't find the story that riveting overall and I thought the depictions of the characters themselves were fairly simplistic. Now this may due to either the author's style or constraints that Collins placed on himself not to get too involved with creating insight into real life individuals. What does this mean? This book is not grueling or horrible by any means, it can be read without agony, but if you are looking for a great book you should take a pass on it unless the Hindenburg itself is what draws you to the book. Otherwise, I think there are better books that center around some historical basis or what if scenarios. (i.e. Follett's &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; or Higgins &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;.)"},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"The plot, characterization, etc. are all on a par with standard murder mystery novels.

My biggest issue was with how &quot;perfect&quot; our protagonist is. He always knows everything, and gets away with completely unbelieveable dialog that makes the book a bit of a dog. If you are a fan of history and airships, this isn't a bad read. The author did their homework. Unfortunately, that is the apparent gimmick. Historical disaster, 2-D hero, and a cheesy plot seem to be all there is. It is amazing that an author can develop such a following with such a pat formula."},{"Title":"The Hindenburg Murders","review":"Max Allan Collins turns in a fast, fun adventure based on a historical catastrophe (his forte, it seems). Fans of The Saint will love what he's done here; others needn't worry about being left out, as Collins keeps the mystery crackling and the in-jokes to a minimum. An afterword by the author puts the fictionalized elements of the tale in proper historical context. Collins pulls a few neat tricks out of his mystery-writer's hat to keep you guessing until the final pages.Any chance of seeing Leslie Charteris in another adventure?"},{"Title":"101 Ways to Massively Increase the Value of Your Real Estate without Spending Much Money","review":"I personally really liked this book. I refer to it when I want ideas for improving on a property that I'm looking at. I also trust Dolf de Roos because he was one of the first Rich Dad Advisors with Robert Kiyosaki. To me, that says a lot in establishing his credibility, because Kiyosaki's books are excellent.I find it interesting one of the reviewers below hates Dolf de Roos so much, yet has taken the time to read all his books and attend his seminars. ... if I read one book or attended a seminar by a particular author and didn't like it, I certainly wouldn't go out and buy all of their works.Anyway, I would say this book is not a comprehensive guide to real estate investing.

I loved reading through the different ideas. Some cost more money than others, but the way the author describes it makes you want to buy real estate tomorrow and add value. For example, tenants like to have carports. They are willing to pay additional $80 per month which equates to $960 per year, and it costs approximately $1,000 to build them. So you get your money back in one year, and this addition increases the value of the property by $10,000. What a good deal!

A contemporary of and sometimes associate of Edison, he held a great many pivital patents in the area. Largely ignored during his lifetime, many of his inventions were used by other companies (Westinghouse, Edison, GE, Marconi) without acknowledgement or payment to Tesla. As a result Tesla died alone and broke. Eight months after his death the Supreme Court reviewed his earlier radio patents and ruled that he had indeed been the basic inventer of radio, not Marconi as is still commonly believed.Tesla is also remembered as a \\"way out\\" thinker. He worked for years on the transmission of power through the air rather than using wires - it didn't work. He was trying to build a death ray, the papers of which are held in a classified library at a U.S. defense research agency and are accessible only to members of the intelligence community - no one knows why they remain so closely guarded sixty years later.Tesla is a person who should be remembered better.

Instead, he's the comical storyteller whose offbeat tales of cockfights, scuba lessons, jungle caves, parasailing, Hand Job Park, taxis and a plethora of other amusing if not quirky adventures will show you a side of traveling that most of us may never see (and probably don't want to, in some cases).An adventurer at heart--for who else would travel a la carte with little money, backpacking across uncharted territory--Soliski has an obvious dedication, persistence and thick-armored heart that writers need nowadays, as is shown by the foreword in \`Does Your Meter Work?. Here is a gritty look at what writers have to endure in order to become published. However, I must admit that I have yet to receive such biting rejection letters as he has. (I think I'll be happy with my collection of standard form-letter rejection letters that wallpaper my office!:)As a fellow Edmontonian and author, I have worked with Jim in multi-author events. And there is one thing that is evident. He exudes passion when he speaks of his travels, and his humor is never far away. I am waiting for his next book and contemplating its title.~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"},{"Title":"Does Your Meter Work?!","review":"Jim Soliski is a travel writer who believes going first class means thumbing your way around the country, sleeping in low-cost hotels and getting to know the locals.Soliski had saved $11,000 from teaching English in Taiwan, and he was off to spend it in the Asian countries. With him, you travel on boats, taxis with human drivers or human energy, and every vehicle imaginable. Quoting Nathaniel Hawthorne, the author agrees ... \\"The soul needs air, a wide sweep and frequent change of it.\\"He believes in \\"ala carte\\" travel to places with no restrictions, distractions or interruptions on plans--because you usually don't have any.So he takes a trip that became this Does Your Meter Work, about the taxi drivers whose fees are negotiable. The author has wonderful stories; some that show the good or bad side of each culture and its people. Mostly he has been treated kindly by strangers as he thumbs (hitchhikes) his way from country to country.Doing what he did takes nerve, undying faith in human nature and his personal ability to survive and thrive with something different every day of his travel.My favorite line described standing in line \\"like the in and out box of humanity\\" as everyone on a bus was searched to ensure they were not a terrorist.

And listing so many (currently 31) of his stories on that site earned me a miniblimp of text in his book 'Does your meter work?!'.I finally got round to reading the book, and I thuroughly enjoyed it. Soliski is not the greatest writer ever, and not all of his stories are that fantastic, but that's exactly why I found the book so very entertaining.Reading Soliski's stories, it felt that what Soliski describes about himself, could have happened to me. Or, I assume, to any other 'real' backpacker. Soliski's stories ring true, honest, authentic.The down to earth stories and style make the book into something that resembles listening to a friend, telling you how his trips abroad were. You're not always that interested, but you keep on listening, because you can't help yourself. You WANT to know.Enjoyable to read.

Lois Potter does a splendid job of giving a well-edited text, with thorough notation of emendations of the First Quarto of 1634, and offering an informative introduction detailing the theatrical and critical fortunes of this work."},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"I will be the first to admit this is not the &quot;best&quot; or the &quot;greatest&quot; play written by the bard, but it is still very worthy of his name, and incredibly beautiful! Kinsmen is a romance in the style of Shakespeare's other late plays, Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest (my favorite). In many ways it reflects his earlier works, namely A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet, and The Tempest. It tells a wonderfully romantic story of two good friends who fall for the same girl (I know, sounds familiar, but trust me, it's a different take on the setup) in Athens. The poetry in it is lovely, the characters very well developed, and the plot is incredible. Many people haven't heard of this play as Shakespeare cowrote it with Fletcher, but belive me, it is still wonderful. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"The Two Noble Kinsmen was only partially written by Shakespeare. The primary author was John Fletcher, and Shakespeare seems to have been doing a rewrite more than a collaboration. As a result, you get two different styles of narration and development in the same story. The underlying tale follows very closely on the famous Knight's Tale from Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. As a result, you get a three way perspective on Shakespeare that is not available elsewhere -- what his co-author did, what Chaucer did, and how Shakespeare handled similar problems in other plays.Where the Knight's Tale was primarily a story about chivalry, love, and spirituality, The Two Noble Kinsmen is very much about psychology and human emotions. Like other plays that Shakespeare wrote, this one shows how conflicting emotions create problems when we cannot master ourselves. In this case, the two loving cousins, Palamon and Arcite, fall out over having been overwhelmed by love for the appearance of Emilia, Duke Theseus's sister. The play explores many ways that their fatal passion for Emilia might be quenched or diverted into more useful paths. The dilemma can only be resolved by the removal of one of them. This places Emilia in an awkward situation where she will wed one, but at the cost of the life of the other. She finds them both attractive, and is deeply uncomfortable with their mutual passion for her. In a parallel subplot, the jailer's daughter similarly falls in love with Palamon, putting her father's life and her own in jeopardy. Overcome with unrequited love, she becomes mad from realizing what she has done. Only by entering into her delusions is she able to reach out to others.What most impressed me from reading this play is how much better Shakespeare was as a writer than either Chaucer or Fletcher. You can tell the parts that Shakespeare wrote because the language is so compact, so powerful, and so filled with relevant imagery. The tension is unremitting and makes you squirm.By contrast, the Knight's Tale is one of the dullest stories you could possibly hope to read and admire for its virtuosity without experiencing much enjoyment. Although the same plot is developed, few emotions will be aroused in you. When Fletcher is writing in this play, the development is slow, the content lacks much emotion, and you find yourself reaching for a blue pencil to strike major sections as unnecessary.In fact, this play would not be worth reading except for the exquisite development of the dilemmas that are created for Emilia. Her pain will be your pain, and you will want to escape from it as much as she does. In these sections, you will find some of Shakespeare's greatest writing.I also was moved by the way several scenes explored the duality of cousinly friendship and affection occurring at the same time that lethal passions of love and jealousy are loose.Although this play will probably not be among your 50 favorites, you will probably find that it will sharpen your appetite for and appreciation of Shakespeare's best works.I also listened to Arkangel recording, and recommend it. The performances are fine, the voices are easy to distinguish, the music is magnificent, the singing adds to the mood nicely, and you will find your engagement in the play's action powerfully increased over reading the play.When do you lose control over your emotions? What does it cost you? How could you regain control before harm is done?May you find peaceful, positive solutions to all of your dilemmas!"},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"The Arkangel Shakespeare series being issued by Penguin Audio is now halfway through the plays and the surprise is that &lt;The Two Noble Kinsmen&gt; was given preference to the remaining more familiar works. Co-authored by Shakespeare and Fletcher, this play remains an odd man out for several reasons. Based fairly closely on the &quot;Knight's Tale&quot; from Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; it tells of two cousins, who just after swearing eternal friendship in one of Duke Theseus' prisons immediately fall in love with the same woman, Emilia, and become bitter rivals for her affections. One of them, Arcite, is exiled but returns in disguise; the other, Palamon, escapes with the help of the Jailer's Daughter, who goes mad for love of him; and...well, see for yourself. Of the play's 23 scenes, 7 and part of an 8th are attributed to Shakespeare, a 9th doubtfully so, and the rest to John Fletcher, who was probably handed over to Shakespeare to learn the ropes as it were. The Shakespeare parts are easy to spot: they are nearly impossible to understand without a heavily annotated copy of the text open before you! Even more so than in his late plays like &quot;Cymberline&quot; and &quot;Winter's Tale,&quot; the syntax is so complex, the thoughts so condensed, that one might (and has) compared his writing with the late Beethoven String Quartets. As one of the scholars quoted in the excellent Signet Classic paperback edition of this play comments, the play is most unShakespearean in that none of the characters change over the course of the play. And I should add the subplot of the Daughter's madness is never integrated into the main plot. One scene, in fact, is devoted entirely to the description of some minor characters and might have been influenced by a similar and much longer sequence in &quot;Seven Against Thebes.&quot; In short, do not play this for a casual listen; but be prepared to be challenged. Look especially for echoes of the earlier all-Shakespearean plays. The nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta recall the opening scenes of &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; the main plot that of &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona,&quot; the Daughter's madness of Ophelia, and so on. As for the actual recording, it would be difficult to better it! The voices of the two kinsmen (Johnathan Firth and Nigel Cooke) are easily distinguishable, Theseus (Geoffrey Whitehead) sounds advanced in years and noble, Emila (Helen Schlesinger) mature and alert, Hippolyta (Adjoa Andoh) vocally of African origins as perhaps befits the character, and all the rest as understandable as the text allows and &quot;into&quot; their roles. Thank you, Penguin, for this noble entry in a series that is getting better and better."},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"In this play, Shakespeare is widely regarded as having authored most of Acts I and V whereas Fletcher did the rest. Other scholars have suggested a more even distribution of the writing. It is a tragi-comedy based on Chaucer's &quot;Knight's Tale&quot; and takes place in Athens when Theseus ruled. Two Theban prisoners, Arcite and Palamon, see the sister-in-law of Theseus, Emily, and both fall in love with her. This causes a break in the friendship of the two cousins. In the last act they fight for the honor of Emily's hand. One significant difference from the Chaucer tale is the presence of the jailor's daughter who falls in love with Palamon. She goes a little mad from her unrequited love but is cured by a lower class man pretending to be Palamon. The play is rarely produced today and does not come up to the lofty standards of the other works of Shakespeare. In fact, I suspect that more people have read Chaucer's version than Shakespeare's and Fletcher's. Nevertheless, it is a play that an educated person should read."},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"I just want to cast my vote for the play: I love it. (I love the Knight's Tale, too). If you've ever known love to ruin a friendship, one of the other sex to come between you and your friend - doesn't this happen quite often? - this play is for you. I ached and wept. Besides it has Amazons. It's about friendship rather than love, it's a tragedy of friendship, and for portrayal of both woman-woman and man-man emotion, for the thesis that this love beats the \\"sex dividual\\" love, often, here's your play. It's late, dark but elegiac, at times staggeringly bitter, with a ghastly hymn to the Goddess of Love, and can be as gory a romp as Titus."},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"\\"The Two Noble Kinsmen\\" (1613) was William Shakespeare's final play. After having completed his solo farewell to drama, \\"The Tempest,\\" in 1611, Shakespeare went on to write three more plays in collaboration with John Fletcher: \\"Henry VIII,\\" the lost \\"Cardenio\\" (based on a subplot found in Miguel de Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote\\") and this final work based on Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Knight's Tale.\\" Shakespeare is believed to have written Act 1, Act 3.1, and Act 5 (minus the second scene). Fletcher wrote the other 3/5ths of the work.Shakespeare's poetry in his final work is in many ways unique. It is very abstract and quite difficult even for those readers otherwise quite comfortable with 16th century verse. The play is very pageant-like from the very first scene, with magniloquent, choral speeches, songs, processions, flowers, divine mythological characters played mute, fluttering doves let loose on stage, disappearing hinds and women's dresses with long tresses held up by attendants. The play begins with three recently widowed queens kneeling before King Theseus' procession, begging him to declare war against King Creon of Thebes, who has refused burial to their husbands' bodies after defeating them in battle. Theseus has just returned from conquering the Amazons and is on his way to be married to their former queen, Hippolyta. In Thebes, meanwhile, two noble cousins, Arcite and Palamon, converse of their intent to abandon their native city in disapproval of its sinful nature and the temptations it may pose their self-recognized prelapsarian state of innocence. Their friendship is of such a kind that they never doubt that anything could come between them. Theseus' desire to embrace a just war is weakened by his desire for erotic union with his wife. Likewise, Arcite and Palamon's love for each other is destroyed by the day that they both fall in love at first sight with the virgin Emilia, the sister of the Amazon queen Hippolyta. Venus, Diana and Mars are the plays patron deities, as they are for Chaucer and, like in Chaucer, Fortune or Chance is the blind arbitrator who decides our fates.Shakespeare's portions of this work are tragic and philosophical. Eros is the ultimate patron of human suffering, who steals from us the grace that existed in the sexual innocence of childhood. Unlike Chaucer, Shakespeare takes us into Emilia's point-of-view and gives up a backstory which illustrates her attachment to her virginity. It is perhaps one of Shakespeare's greatest pieces of poetry:Emilia: DoubtlessThere is a best, and reason has no mannersTo say it is not you: I was acquaintedOnce with a time, when I enjoyd a Play-fellow;You were at wars, when she the grave enrichd,Who made too proud the Bed, took leave o'th Moon(which then looked pale at parting) when our countWas each a eleven.Hippolyta: T'was Flavina.Emilia: YesYou talk of Pirithous and Theseus' love;Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,More buckled with strong judgement. and their needeThe one of th'other may be said to waterTheir intertangled roots of love, but IAnd she I sigh and spoke of were things innocent,Lov'd for we did, and like the ElementsThat know not what, nor why, yet do effectRare issues by their operance; our soulsDid so to one another; what she lik'd,Was then of me approv'd, what not condemdNo more arraignement, the flower that I would plnckeAnd put betweene my breasts, oh (then but beginningTo swell about the blossom) she would longTill she had such another, and commit itTo the like innocent Cradle, where Phoenix likeThey died in perfume: on my head no toyBut was her pattern, her affections (prettyThough haply, her careless, were, I followedFor my most serious decking, had mine earStolen some new air, or at adventure hummed onFrom musical coinage, why it was a noteWhereon her spirits would sojourn (rather dwell on)And sing it in her slumbers; This rehearsal(Which fury-innocent wots well) comes inLike old importments bastard, has this end,That the true love tween Maid, and maid, may beMore then in sex individual.Act I, sc. III; lines 55 - 93But although Shakespeare gets all the fanfare the majority of the play belongs to Fletcher. This is unfortunate since what Fletcher gives us is pretty uninspired stuff. While a capable poet, psychology, characterization and insightful dialogue was not one of his gifts. The scene in which the two kinsmen fight over Emilia in their prison cell and the one in which Emilia compares the two men by their portraits are painfully uninspired and undo much of the characteristics already established by Shakespeare's portions of the play. The philosophical and tragic elements of the play almost completely disappear for 3/5ths of the play only to be replaced by cliche melodrama and facile delivery of information. Rather than being tragic figures the two kinsmen become insufferable brats whom it becomes very difficult to care for in any way. The middle portions of the play are truly something very different in tone, temperment and quality from the two acts that begin and close the play. For this reason, ultimately, \\"The Two Noble Kinsmen\\" is not quite the experience it should be. But the ending, via Shakespeare, is pure Chaucer at his best:O you heavenly Charmers,What things you make of us? For what we lackWe laugh, for what we have, are sorry still,Are children in some kind. Let us be thankfulFor that which is, and with you leave disputeThat are above our question: Let's go off,And bear us like the time.Act V, sc. IV; lines 154 - 160"},{"Title":"The two noble kinsmen, (The Temple dramatists)","review":"Last night I completed my 2010 goal of reading or re-reading all of Shakespeare last year by finishing this play. This New Year's morning I read some of Harold Bloom's essay about it. I think Bloom (who confesses he'd rather not ever see this play staged) struggles to make it sound credible as possibly Shakespeare's last (and co-authored), at moments superb, work. Though many of the lines are fine, all in all it's a botch, as you may agree when you read it and approach the ending with the sickening feeling that the play will only be resolved with the cheapest of tricks. You'll know by act IV that the playwright(s) are painted into a corner.But it's also the botch that Shakespeare mined to write one of his greatest plays, A Midsummer Night's Dream, a much \\"earlier\\" work in the traditional dating of the plays. Many of the distinguishing elements of MSD are there in rough form TNK, though they don't really hang together. I think the author of Shakespeare was still a young playwright learning his chops (and leaning more heavily than he ultimately could on his source, Chaucer)when he wrote the basic draft of TNK. Then, fortunately for us, he let it metamorphose into the magic of MSD.One reason I wanted to revisit all of WS in the last year was to get a better sense of the march of his work and of the problems with arranging the plays in the generally accepted chronological order. That interests me because I tend to think increasingly that the \\"authorship\\" problem is real, and that most likely Shakespeare's works came basically from Edward de Vere, who was born ten years before WS the man and who most likely died in 1606, after finishing his most famous four tragedies. My sense of TNK is that it fits with the likelihood that all the plays believed to have been written after de Vere's death were in fact written in more or less stageable form much earlier, then trotted out again (or for the first time) for performance with some doctoring by Fletcher and maybe others in the 1610s.I was surprised how well TNK fits this line of thinking. Hats off to all the writers, researchers, and other \\"Looneys\\" who continue to build a better understanding of where the magnificent works of Shakespeare come from."},{"Title":"Target","review":"Target hits hard from the beginning and won't let go.

This book revealed to me the importance of women in this fallen world and how to discover what makes women truly captivating.The authors dig deep into the importance of the \\"captivating\\" beauty found in the soul of a woman, and how it can powerfully and gently be given to those around us. Yet there is devastation everywhere, waiting to tear the beauty away from a woman, leaving her feeling anything but captivating. Captivating guided me on a path towards restoration.Although many verses were credibly incorporated into the text, not all verses were used properly. Several theories in Captivating rubbed me the wrong way. The main critique I derived from the text is the misconstrued question of: Who is captivating whom? Although God does ravenously desire for us to pursue Him, the book does not emphasize how much more captivating God is than woman. One can see an example on page 28 where Stasi Eldredge says, \\"This may be the most important thing we ever learn about God-that he yearns for relationship with us.\\"(28) This lesson is vital; however, certainly not the most important lesson one can derive from the Bible, rather that humans are nothing without God.Even though I did not agree with all of the authors' Biblical inclusions, the message as a whole made me feel beautiful and important. These are feelings that can easily slip away from a woman in this demeaning world, yet these are feelings that God desires us to obtain. Let us remind ourselves daily of how lovely Christ is. For He is where our beauty and importance is derived from."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I gave Captivating four stars because I was able to relate to it very well and it opened doors for healing to take place; however, there were a couple things I disagreed with. It was relatable because it discussed the desires of a woman's heart. I, being a woman, have felt the need to be loved and the need to be thought of as captivating that is talked about in the book. The section of the book that was particularly helpful was when the authors explained that fear is Satan's way of keeping us from doing what God has called us to do. It opened my eyes to the power of Satan and made me want to conquer him all the more. One part of the book I did not agree with was when the authors were talking about affairs. They made it seem like it is always the wife that pushes the man into the arms of another woman. While that may be the case in some situations, it is hardly universal. I would change the marketing strategy for this book. It is geared only toward women, but I think men would benefit greatly from reading this book. They would have a better awareness of the hearts of women and would be able to understand women more completely. Overall, the book was insightful and discussed the hard truths regarding a woman's heart, which made it an enjoyable and challenging read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you are looking for a book that will both be challenging and inspirational this is the book for you. Captivating gets to the core what it means to be a woman, particularly what it means to be a woman in the image of God. The authors unpack why women are the way they are, and how they are perfectly and wonderfully made. For me personally I found this book to be very beneficial when trying to understand who I was as woman and who I was to God. After reading this book I found that my relationship with Christ was enhanced because I had a better understanding of the love that Christ has for his people. The writing of the book was very well done. Each chapter was built off the previous one, which was helpful when trying to get a better understanding of the big picture that they were trying to capture. This book is an easy read, and the concepts are easily grasped.Overall this book was challenging and inspirational. It gets to the core of who we are as women and what we mean to our creator. I found that this book is very beneficial when trying to understand who I am as woman. I hope it does the same for you."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I love this book.

We wanted to be honest, genuine, and get to the core of who we are. After several life changes, we never did manage to get the book together. However, years later when this book came out I was in such a state of anticipation to get it. I think I busted down the door of my local Christian bookstore to get my hands on it!! I had been an avid read of John Eldredge's books and now having this one focused solely on the heart of a woman just captured me.I cannot tell you how many times my soul just sighed in relief as I read this book. It was so me and I felt like it was okay to be that way...a way this world was trying to beat out of me. It is a poignant and moving book that really explains the heart and soul of women. My friend and I who wanted to create this type of book many years before were relieved that this was getting into the hands and hearts and souls of women...they did it better then we ever could!I actually revisit this book every 2 years or so and have the companion guide too. My husband has read this book twice, which I am so grateful for too. This is a must read for any Christian woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book.

I would recommend this book to all women and even to men so they can get a glimpse of what God sees when he looks at a woman. I enjoyed the personal stories and the writing styles and would easily agree to read another book by the authors if given the chance."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The female companion to Wild at Heart, Captivating \\"unveils the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" According to the authors, not even women are as tame as we once thought. Instead, women have an inner desire to be involved in an adventure, something that will test their strength as women. Captivating is a revolutionary book on Christian femininity. Rather than focusing on the almost infamous example of a good Christian woman found in Proverbs 31, this book focuses on the godliness and courage of women like Rahab and Tamar. The basic message is that women are deeper than clothes, makeup, and a seemingly submissive spirit. Woman's soul is a treasure chest filled with wealth to be discovered and enjoyed.Similar to Wild at Heart, Captivating contains an important, but rather depressing, section on \\"her wound.\\" Although this section was not particularly uplifting, I endured it because I considered it useful for my own growth. The rest of the book, however, was much more enjoyable. I believe the most important concept taught in the book is that neither Christian women nor any other woman should expect men to give them the love and affirmation they need. This affirmation can come only from God. Although this book contains a lot of great material, I did not enjoy it quite as much as I enjoyed Wild at Heart, partly just because the transition between the two authors was slightly distracting at times. Despite this minor drawback, I recommend this book to women of any age but especially to young girls 16+. [Reviewer's note: Since I am not and have never been a man, I am not qualified to say whether men would appreciate this book.]I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review bloggers program.

I was at a place of soul searching in my life. So when I had the opportunity to read through it again, I jumped at the chance. Although I have had it for quite some time, I finally have gotten to read through it, again.This book goes through topics that each woman will someday, if not already, encounter. We all have a past, joys and sorrows included in our past. This book helps you look at each situation in your past, and figure out how to bring out the best of your past. We all need to use our past to grow in the future. Learn from our mistakes, and move on. When we are stuck in the muck, we are not the Captivating spirit our Savior wants us to be, nor are we Captivating to the world.I highly recommend you reconcile with your past, and use that to move forward with your future...your destiny in where you should be!I am not paid to review books by Thomas Nelson.

Although I found the book to be interesting and thought-provoking; I had a hard time relating the book to myself. I think that many women would find this book helpful, and I'm not discounting that fact. I feel it is written toward the melancholy and very emotion-driven woman. If you are in the market for fairy-tale like writing and woo, then you are in the right place.

There was only one area in my life that I wasn't truly content, my husband. I held a lot of hurt and bitterness in my heart toward him, I was very lonely in my marriage. I was basically pushing him away and could not figure out why. Last Sunday before church, I found myself wanting some quiet time so I wandered into the library. I found 'Captivating' on the shelf and started reading. I was totally consumed by the message. At some points during the book I cried uncontrollably releasing some of the pent up hurtful thoughts I had been letting the enemy fool me into believing: I'm too fat, my husband can't possibly find me attractive, He doesn't really love me because he doesn't do [whatever it is]. It was just the breakthrough I needed. The authors made a connection about how we, as women, are made into the feminine form of God and men are the masculine form of God. Wow! I had been pushing my husband away....therefore, I was pushing God away! 'Captivating' has totally changed my view of my marriage and has quieted that little enemy voice in my head. I am beautiful and worthy of being loved by our Amazing God!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was asked to read this title by the lovely people at BookSneeze and can only apologise for taking so long to do so.This is a new edition of Captivating (a title I've read before) and have greatly enjoyed revisiting. It contains some new material but is basically a re-release of the rather battered paperback I already own.The Eldredges have a theory. They believe that every woman (and every man for that matter) is born with a Question etched on their heart which only God can answer. It is in looking to other sources for answers that we tie our selves in knots, hurt others and open our arms to the Enemy (Satan). Captivating makes extensive use of the Bible (starting right back with Genesis) to explain why this is so and then offers a Biblical alternative.As I read this book I found myself drawn in by the excellent writing and entirely agreeing with the authors - yes, I have a Question. Yes, I've looked for answers in all the wrong places. Yes, I've been wounded and, yes, I want Jesus to heal me. I've found that my faith has been rekindled and, for the first time in a while, I'm spending quality time with Him.Although there were areas of this book with which I was less comfortable - I'm not big on spiritual warfare - there's enough here for me to mull over and work on without focussing on that aspect. Although I know the Eldredges have their critics, think this is one of the best books on femininity that I have read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is so amazing!

I picked up the book to see what all of the fuss was about. I quickly concluded that it was nothing more than a mix of feel-good psychology and a sexist reading of Scripture (a very poorly supported one, at that). Captivating is just as horrible.For starters, the main premise of the book is very inaccurate-- every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, to have an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil.Sadly, there are probably millions of young Christian women who will read this message and agree with it-- young women who dream of fairy-tale marriages, strapping but strong Christian men to lead them and their children while taking a back-seat role in the \\"adventures\\" of life, women who believe that because a man's desire is to win the \\"beauty,\\" they must adhere to this conjured-up theory that to be beautiful is one of the three main longings of our heart. Sorry John and Stasi, but I don't buy it. Not only do I feel a complete lack of connection with this message, I also believe it is a harmful one to preach.Do you want to the know the longings of my heart?Why is it that a man's main desire is to seek great adventure while the woman \\"plays a role\\" in that male-dominated adventure? You are dead wrong when you say that \\"every little girl dreams of being a princess.\\" I never once had that dream. I enjoyed playing with toy guns, climbing trees, getting into fights with my older brothers, and playing every sport that was offered. In short, I identify with the male version of \\"desire\\" more than with the female. Does that make me less feminine?And this is not because I am in denial or have a mortal feminine injury. It is because I am a self-sufficient, self-confident and yes, beautiful 22 year old woman. But beauty is not part of the equation. I rarely notice my beauty; in all honesty, I am annoyed and sometimes offended when it is pointed out to me by men. I do not long to be \\"romanced\\" and \\"fought for\\" and told that I am beautiful. I fight my own battles, and that includes the battle in this society to overcome the sexist stereotypes that drive young women to feel insecure, needy, or \\"Feminist Nazis.\\" By the way, I am very offended by your referral to that phrase, as included in a letter from a reader. What does \\"Feminist Nazi\\" mean anyway? Its simply a buzzword used to perpetuate hatred towards women like me.The true desires of my heart couldn't be further from the thesis of this book. I long for adventure, for travel, for life's romance-- but this has nothing to do with the presence of a MAN in my life. The longings of my heart include fighting for social justice, improving the living conditions of women and children in this country and across the world, and rejecting the traditional female role outlined for me by my Christian background. If I can accomplish this, my heart's desires will be truly fulfilled. My happiness is not contingent upon being romanced, won over, or privileged to merely \\"take a role\\" in the adventure of a man. Please girls, get some self-respect! I am lucky enough to have had two parents who pushed me to follow my own dreams instead of find a way to fit this masogonyst world. I refused to be the little princess crying out for help; I was the princess who found her own way out of the tower, into battle and into victory. I hope and pray that there are girls out there who are courageous and intelligent, who will question the message of this book and seek out their own adventures, who will discover the unique longings of their own hearts instead of believing sexist lies poorly disguised as spiritual truth."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"are things that you would better spend your hard earned cash on than this insipid book. \\"oohhh....

Our Sunday School has this book for their study book, and I don't think it is for sincere Christian women. I NEVER miss Sunday School, but I am so turned off by this book that I haven't gone for the last two weeks. All about what a woman needs -- Beauty, Romance, and Adventure. I, for one, need the Lord first -- that is my main desire. This book has some good points, but not a lot. The main theme is what we need to feel good about ourselves and then to follow the Lord. The women used for examples are from movies -- even \\"Pretty Woman\\" -- she was a prostitute. Prostitues are used by God -- check the Bible! I watched this movie and am appalled that he uses this -- I know, I am being critical. But why not use women of the Bible and show their weaknesses and strengths and pattern ourselves after them. The book was not suggesting that we pattern ourselves after the women from these movies -- about 32 movies were mentioned!!!-- BUT why use the movie examples when we have many women in the Bible. He used Eve, but not in the way she should have been used for an example. I noticed feminist view points in the parts that I read. I have read and studied several book on a woman's soul and have grown tremendously from them, but this is NOT one of them. I feel good about myself -- the Spirit dwells in me -- I feel rich in my soul. This doesn't paint a true picture of what a Christian woman needs."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book - LOVED it. The authors look at the challenges that face women in today's society, but they look at it from a completely different angle. Their observations are refreshing and liberating.... we women should free ourselves from all the \\"rocks\\" that hold us down, and John and Stasi encourage us to be like Mary and sit at the Lord's feet, rather than rushing around being Martha to everyone and everything on our endless \\"to do\\" list. Truly, as Christ said to Martha, only \\"one thing\\" is important and Mary chose that one thing! (Thank you Mary!) Women, God chose YOU as the crowning glory of his creation - think about that for a second - we're the \\"piece-de-resistance\\"! You were MEANT to be captivating and beautiful and you ARE captivating and beautiful in His eyes. How cool is that?!Awesome. I'm buying copies for my mother and all my close female friends for Christmas. Women, life is but a breath, and a short one at that. Put down that long laundry list of \\"gotta-get-dones\\" and enjoy beautiful intimacy with the Lord who MADE you captivating, indeed....Thanks, John and Stasi - your book is a blessing."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I am currently reading this book and it brought me to tears so many times already. I've read the reviews by other women who object to the mentioning of movies, 'worldliness', etc. and even one who said basically, 'I don't need beauty, romance, etc. I need the Lord first..' Hm.. I think the point has been missed! The Lord is offering beauty and romance to us through himself, that is the whole point of the book, and those things are what we are created for as women. How are the two mutually exclusive? Where do we get the idea that to long for these things means that we no longer want the Lord as much? I find it the opposite! I've found that this book made me hunger MORE for God, while at the same time valuing my beauty as a woman more too. Why not have the whole she-bang?? Is God really that stingy? I think not. He offers the whole world's beauty to us to enjoy, why not enjoy ourselves and our beauty too? That doesn't make us self-centered and nowhere in the book did I see them advocating staring in the mirror as opposed to seeking God, on the contrary. Stasi was incredibly brave as she exposed her past wounds and mistakes and her true heart, and I think she must be such a beautiful woman herself. I love their descriptions of their part of the USA, especially being from Northern Canada. I am recommending it to all my female friends whose hearts and beauty have been hidden and shut down for far too long. As they say in the book, a woman's beauty brings us to greater awareness of God's heart. What a treasure to find such a down-to-earth book like this - I, too, am tired of the 'Christian femininity' books that say you need to serve other people from dawn til dusk. We do that anyway - why not celebrate beauty on top of it?? Thank you Eldredge's for this book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's SoulThis book came highly recommended by a few friends and a myriad of strangers who had rated the book online. I did my best to give it a chance and to read it with an open mind. Although I made it all the way through, I gritted my teeth almost the entire time.Countless bad (and also secular) movie references aside, this book was filled with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; about girls' dreams of being fairy tale princesses and the message that women are damsels in distress who need to be rescued by a man. John and Stasi Eldredge obviously share poor opinions of women's abilities to take care of themselves, viewing them as fundamentally broken and incapable of having stable emotions. Oh, and we're so pathetic as women that we need not even have ambitions, we just need to let things happen to us. \\"As a woman, you don't need to strive or arrange; you don't need to make it happen. You only need to respond\\" (Kindle location 2217). Seriously?This book might as well have been Stasi's memoir about her neglected, traumatic childhood on which she based the idea that all women have \\"daddy/mommy issues\\" that have dragged into their adult lives and impacted them in ways they can't see. I felt the whole time that the Eldredges were hoping I would stumble upon some dark, long-buried, awful memory of how my parents abused me or didn't love me enough (which is not the childhood I experienced, by the way). I imagine this book is beyond helpful for women who did suffer from abusive experiences they did not deserve as young girls or teenagers, but this book assumes more women had bad childhoods than not.And if that wasn't enough, the conceited, holier-than-thou tone of the book made me feel as if I am guilty for NOT having had a horrible childhood or having had something awful happen to me. Did (and do) I go through trials in my life? Absolutely. Did I have a perfect childhood with perfect parents who treated each other like gold and stayed married? Nope. But I always felt loved and I was blessed to have parents who instilled confidence, strength and a sense of capability and independence in me from a very early age.I won't even go into the poor writing, disregard for scriptural context and/or accuracy, calling God my \\"lover\\" or the authors' multiple references to casting out demons in Jesus' name either. That would just be too much.I would give this book zero stars if I could."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who have noted that this book has a very narrow view of women. It's so focused on the wounded or helpless woman seeking rescue, you'll probably wonder if these authors developed their view of women from patients in crisis therapy. Or maybe that's the kind of woman who shows up in their Christian-fundamentalist seminars. Either way, It just doesn't describe the women I know.Also annoying was that this book didn't seem to have a clear purpose or much substance. It's easy to find a fictional movie character or Bible quote to support anything in the world (you can find Scripture passages recommending killing children), but what does that prove? Not much. It circled around and around vague phrases like 'the secret of a woman's soul', but didn't provide much in the way of insight or interest. It's like they kept promising they had something important to say, but by the end I was wondering 'what was the point of all that?\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"From ladiesagainstfeminism.comBIBLICAL WOMANHOOD AND CHRISTIAN LIVINGCreated to be Captivating?By Natalie Marie NyquistJun 27, 2005, 14:41Visiting the local Christian bookstore these days can prove disheartening if you are not searching for the latest self-help books or Christian culture icons. Spiritual classics, theology, and the like are relegated to a back corner, while best-sellers take the central shelves. I see a common theme woven through the most popular books, and it is not one I see in Scripture: It's all about me. I must discover who I truly am to find ultimate fulfillment. I must know myself better. Not know God better. Not understand how to live in His will. The theme seems to be how to ensure that I have the best life possible.One new book out is called Captivating, written by Stasi Eldredge and her famous \\"Wild at Heart\\" husband, John. I really did not know what to expect, beyond that it would delve into the heart needs John said that women had in his book: the desire to be pursued, to share an adventure, to unveil beauty. I have nothing against those desires per se. They are probably true of most girls.However, my issue comes with the emphasis the book carries. By the third chapter, I felt very strongly about this review I would be writing. I kept reading, and by the time I finished (I read it straight through one morning while waiting at a doctor's appointment) I felt...empty. Captivating did not leave me with anything to ponder or by which to be encouraged. There were a lot of words, a lot of stories, and a lot of emotive language, but very little \\"meat.\\" I hope my readers who like the book won't write off my reviews forever, because of this; please hear me out. This is very important.This month I am reading Created to be His Help Meet by Debi Pearl, and, quite simply, it is unlike any book I have ever read or heard of. I have never bought a book to give someone else simply because they had to read it. I just tell them they ought to read it. This time I was buying copies and giving them to my soon-to-be-married friends and relatives-they have to read this book!I mention this because the contrast between Captivating and Created is astonishing. I did not come into the reading with a bias toward or against either book--though I knew that I disagreed with John Eldredge's theology on some points--but the same is true of Debi Pearl's.To put it simply, here is my concern with Captivating:Captivating emphasizes an unhealthy perspective on life by encouraging us to focus on ourselves. The whole book is about who we are, our needs, what we feel, what we want. I think it is dangerously self-absorbed and carries an unbiblical message that it is all about us.Let me provide some examples.The chapter titled \\"What Eve Alone Could Tell\\" had some feministic undertones. Some of what was written is in contradiction to the Word that the Eldredges sometimes quote. I had a rough time going through this chapter. I wanted badly to give the author the benefit of the doubt, and I kept looking at the excerpts that upset me and trying to see them in context. I will quote at length so that you can see I'm not just pulling random phrases and twisting them around.Here are a few portions that may show what my concern is:\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman. In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam, but with Eve. She is the Master's finishing touch...Given the way that creation unfolds, how it builds to ever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt that Eve is the crown of creation?\\"Whether intended or not, this exalts woman above man, and sets her above him in perfection, which is nonsense. I understand some women struggle with self-esteem, but even more, we all deal with pride, and I don't think that this is helping us find a balanced perspective if we are having an identity crisis. But it gets worse.\\"She is God's final touch, his 'piece de resistance.' She fills a place in the world nothing and no one else can fill. Step to a window, ladies, if you can. Better still, find some place with a view. Look out across the earth and say to yourselves, 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me'.\\"Mercy! This borders on blasphemy. I don't know what their point is here, but it is dangerous stuff. We do not find our worth and need for purpose in this sort of self-love talk, but in realizing we are nothing without our Creator, and all we have is by His good pleasure alone.There is another part of the chapter that displays God in a way that I believe is false or at the very least, grossly unbalanced. The authors seek to compare woman to God, and say that God is expressed in unique ways through women. I quote:\\"Not only does God long for us, but he longs to be loved by us. Oh, how we've missed this. How many of you see God as longing to be loved by you? We see him as strong and powerful, but not needing us, vulnerable to us, yearning to be desired. God wants to be loved. He wants to be a priority to someone. From cover to cover, from beginning to end, the cry of God's heart is, 'Why won't you choose Me?'\\"They quote some verses here, but they take them too far, I think. They are not looking at the Bible as a whole and what it says of God. God does not need us! He did not create us to fill any void in Him. The Trinity experiences perfect and complete fellowship. We are made for His glory, not for his need. Exodus 15:11 says \\"Who is like Thee among the gods, O Lord? Who is like Thee, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?\\" \\"The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord has clothed and girded Himself with strength; indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved\\" (Ps. 93:1). Our God is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords (1 Tim. 6:15)!These passages in the Eldredges' book weaken our God. They reduce Him to the level of an emotional woman. Please, let's not take the comparison to such an extreme. It's gone too far.The book quotes far more movies than Bible verses, and it often seems to draw lessons from the movies and offer them as truth, even though there is no support other than what our \\"hearts\\" tell us. Also, the translation of the Bible used is very unique--translated by one man a few years ago. It's called \\"Alter.\\" What texts did he even look at? I was unable to find any explanation for his variance from the traditional translations. The wording he chooses is not accurate, and that bothers me.Another problem with the book is that it mocks the role for which God has specifically created us and our very identity as helpmeets. At one point, the Eldredges discuss Genesis 2:18 and use their \\"Alter\\" translation again:\\"The various attempts we have in English are 'helper\` or 'companion\` or the notorious 'help meet.' Why are these translations so incredibly wimpy, boring, flat...disappointing? What is a help meet anyway? What little girl dances through the house singing, 'One day I shall be a helpmeet\`? Companion? A dog can be a companion. Helper? Sounds like Hamburger Helper.\\"This is offensive. Mrs. Eldredge is mocking the words in which we women find our purpose. I know many little girls who dream of someday being helpmeets! To be a companion is a very glorious thing. I challenge the insinuation that these words are wimpy and boring. Look at what Debi Pearl says about the phrase \\"help meet\\":\\"If you are a wife, you were created to fill a need, and in that capacity, you are a 'good thing\` (Prob. 18:22), a helper suited to the needs of a man. This is how God created you, and it is your purpose for existing.\\"Later she says: \\"When you are a helpmeet to your husband, you are a helper to Christ.\\" Not quite \\"Hamburger Helper,\\" eh?When you read Mrs. Eldredge's words, a help meet is portrayed as a spiritually dead, going-through-the-motions waste. She writes, \\"Seriously now, picture the women we hold up as models of femininity in the church. They are sweet, they are helpful, they are busy, they are disciplined, they are composed...and they are tired.\\"There is definitely a disparaging tone in those words toward women who are helpful, disciplined, and sweet. As if serving God is not enough. We need more \\"fulfillment!\\" We need to remember we are the zenith of creation, reclaim our desires to experience adventure, be seductive (their words in several places--they try to soften the meaning), and to be adored. Please. There were other similar passages, but I did not mark them all. These should suffice to raise some serious red flags.Study the women of the Bible who served the Lord. They were disciplined, worked with their hands, and served others gladly. The example of Dorcas in Acts 9:36 shows us this: \\"Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity, which she continually did.\\" The Proverbs 31 woman \\"works with her hands in delight...extends her hand to the poor; and she stretches out her hand to the needy\\" (Prov. 31:13 and 20). What does verse 30 of that chapter on virtuous womanhood state? It does not say that we find our ultimate purpose in life through a focus on ourselves. Instead, \\"a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.\\" Captivating does not praise a woman who fears the Lord and lives her life in service to Him and others.For new believers, women who have had horrendous pasts, like Mrs. Eldredge, perhaps this book can be helpful. I still think there is a better alternative, though, and without the dangers, biting sarcasm, and annoyingly frequent references to movies, secular philosophers, etc.Who knows, maybe someday things will change. For now, I'm setting Captivating aside and going with what I was created to be: a woman who pours out her life in service for others, who finds her greatest fulfillment in completing another, not in superseding another.Copyright 2002-2005 by LAF/BeautifulWomanhood.org"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As indicated by the title of the review, I was quite disappointed by the book. But I must also add the caveat that I had come with great expectations based on my readings of John Eldredge's other works -- namely,The Sacred Romance: Drawing Closer to the Heart of GodandThe Journey of Desire: Searching for the Life We've Only Dreamed of. Perhaps it was in the attempt to appeal to the women audience and their more emotional sides, but there are too many accounts of personal stories used to evoke the readers' emotions and not enough Bible references to support the authors' points or to provide the readers with a take-away of substance.An example (as mentioned in other reviews) is the reference of God as full of emotions but leaving out His other characteristics of being just, sovereign, and powerful.My disappointment was only increased after perusing through the men's counterpart of this work,The Way of the Wild Heart: A Map for the Masculine Journey, which was less \\"fluffy\\" than this work.Although there are a few take-away pointers in this book, they did not make up for the overall cringing reading experience."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book gave me permission to quit apologizing for who I am. God made me who I am on purpose. I am not too much; I am not too little. I have unconsciously been living for years feeling sorry for the people in my life because of my perceived sense of failing them. Now I can lift my head because the blanket of guilt I wasn't even aware of has been removed. It's ok to be feminine. It's ok to be vulnerable. It doesn't make you weak. I don't have to prove anything to anyone.I can raise my daughters to be empowered by their femininity. If you have little girls, this book is a must-read. I would also recommend it to anyone with aspirations for counseling or therapy. It tangibly illustrates and puts into words much of the why behind female responses and reasoning. Women are not irrational and controlled by emotion. We are designed by a loving creator as we are for a reason."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a book that the world needed so very much. It has given me words to voice what has been inside of me for years. It is Biblically sound and relates well to our culture today using movie quotes to illustrate some of her points."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"this book is purely incredible.however, i must make one thing clear for people who have reviewed it already and have complained about the misuse of the book of Song of Solomon. i've heard people say that the book is written purely for a literal man and woman's sexual relationship. This is incorrect. No books in the Bible refer to something without God. This book was meant to be interpreted both literally and non-literally. For example, in the book of Hosea, he marries a prostitute and tries to win her back. This could be interpreted as God chasing after the body of the church and winning us back, or it could also be a message on forgiveness. Song of Solomon refers to the love a man and woman have for each other, as well as the love God has for all of mankind."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had desires and hurts that I felt I was alone in. This book showed me that I am normal and actually I was created this way for a reason and a purpose. I have always felt like I was too emotional or too needy....but I came to find out I was normal. I want to be sought after, a desire Christ put in me. This book really opened my eyes and has helped me be more secure in who I am and why God made us the way he did. I am now starting \\"Wild at Heart\\" so I can more fully understand my husband :-)!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"And then they lived happily ever after...\\" Happily ever after? A 21st century woman certainly doesn't live the life of a princess. John and Stasi Eldredge's Captivating takes a journey through the Fall of Eve, and points out the results of that fall in women today. Captivating brings a woman back to her years of innocence, and may even open the eyes of men to answers for their many questions about the opposite sex. Useful messages fill front to back cover of this self-helper, but other aspects of this book fail to receive this same glory and praise. The Eldredges' word choice, just like a broken record, repeats...repeats...repeats. Any educated reader with a vocabulary of more than five words will grow weary with this text selection. The authors' opinions also jump around with no real direction. Logical transitions don't appear at all between page 1 and 224. This wishy-washy style creates problems at the end of the book, making it hard for readers to arrive at a resolution. Captivating certainly deserves acclamation for ideas, but other areas of this book need a little TLC. An emotional connection may not be enough to captivate a large audience."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book speaks to the God-given romantic side of women and shows how much scripture speaks of God wanting to pursue us, protect us, how He longs to have us be in His presence and win our hearts as one who is smitten by our beauty, character and strength.I've never been comfortable with the concept of Jesus as lover but after reading this book I see that the Bible is full of such a metaphor...the church as the bride of Christ, for example. I think in our carnal, human minds we tend to think of a lover in a sexual way and that is what causes the discomfort with the concept. But, what it REALLY means is one who loves us so much that he can't wait to talk to us, to be with us, to have a unique and intimate relationship that is shared with no one else. It is with that kind of extravagant love that God pursues each of us and wants us to reciprocate with Him.God took what He knew we could understand as humans (the courtship and marriage relationship as He intended it to be) to describe the depth of intimacy He longs to have with us all, men and women alike. He wants to captivate us with a love so strong that He was willing to die to save us. He wants to help us see how captivating and beautiful we are to Him no matter what we have done and no matter how much the enemy and world tries to tell us we are unworthy, ugly, beyond repair or a waste of God's time and effort. That is what a lover does...he sees beyond the faults and blemishes and loves us unconditionally - not in spite of what we've done or what worldy standards of physical beauty we don't live up to - but because of who we are.Stasi and John make references to fictional characters from books and movies (as well as plenty of Biblical exampes!). I had no problem with that. I felt they were just using these cultural fictional characters as examples of different types of women, showing how God created us all different with different strengths, talents and desires. The work of a mom at home is just as esteemed and precious to God as that of a warrior princess.Embracing the sacred romance of our relationship with the living God is not sappy nor weak. It doesn't reduce us to submissive wimps with no voice or women with no power. If anything, I found this book incredibly empowering as a woman, wife and mother.This book teaches the balance God intended for women to bring to the world. We can listen to imbalanced message of the anti-male, secular feminists of our day and reject all aspects of our powerful and unique femininity. We can listen to the other imbalanced extreme, often promoted by religion, that tells us to be ashamed of being a woman and reduces women to mere servents of men no matter how demeaning and abusive that becomes. Or, we can listen to the heart of God and live up to the joyful potential and beauty He personally created in each of us."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Given to me as a gift, I found this book heart piercing, thought provoking and eye opening. For the first time in my life, I began to see who I was from the inside out. As I have gone back through the book with the companion journal, my heart has been stirred beyond my wildest expectations. The information in this book is too important for females to overlook!Yes, there are scriptural references in the book that have made me search for myself to see if they were taken out of context. Yes, there are references to the Eldredge's beliefs that made me question my own. Yes, there are numerous references to books, movies and personal experiences throughout the text. The writers have a wonderful sense that the concepts given can be seen in their everyday world, and they are helping me see them in mine.As a grace-centered Christian, I found this book fascinating! I could not wait to begin a book study on it for the women in our church. I have known several other women who have read this book and literally blossomed in their spiritual walk. No book is perfect (other than the Bible), but in the pages of this one, I found through my many readings of its pages (and numerous tears) a new perspective of how I am seen by my Father...Captivating. In humility and His strength, I hope to begin to convey this to others in my world, helping them see that He who is in my heart can be in theirs as well.Guys...if you want to understand the heart of a woman, read this for yourself!Thank you John and Stasi!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The troubling thing about this book is just how captivating it really is.I, like most women who have written reviews, was caught up tremendously in the good feelings it gave me about myself and God's love for me. When I started reading the book, I was struggling with my faith because of the way Christianity has treated women over the years. I came out of my reading feeling much closer to Jesus.But when the emotions wore off and my ability to think clearly returned I felt cheated: this book is not about Jesus or any other biblical representation of God. It is about an invented character that makes readers feel good.If you want a relationship with the God of the Bible, look elsewhere. The representation of Jesus is completely invented, created by Stasi Eldredge to make herself feel better about the less-than-satisfactory reality of how God relates to women in the Bible. I understand that it was not intended to be a work of biblical scholarship, but it completely ignores the true text. Women in the Bible are presented as captivating, indeed, but not in any way that should make us feel like God gave us a Hallmark card - think of David so \\"captivated\\" by Bath-sheba that he raped her; Jael so \\"captivating\\" that she seduced and drove a mallet into the enemy's head; Jezebel so \\"captivating\\" that she was able to lead Ahab away from the true God.All that being said,if you need a self-help book, this will make you feel great.

Most of the women in my group could not relate to the extremes and are therefore missing the truth that is there. I would recommend \\"The Sacred Romance\\" and \\"Waking the Dead\\" (both written by John Eldredge)as better reads than this book.

That being said, it's wonderful to read this offering from the Eldredge family - because \\"Captivating\\" is chock full of the one source of Truth we can all count on...page after page of heart healing scripture and insight - along with personal applications by real, thoughtful, imperfect, beautiful women. Their stories and testimonies of their search for healing, truth and a closer walk with Jesus have inspired me to pause and recommend this book as a must read for both men and women...seekers of God...doubters and believers alike! Please don't take my word for it; while reading this, examine the book of Genesis for yourself - where God our Father speaks to us! God's timing is so perfect...while reading \\"Captivating\\", He also is revealing Himself to me and countless other women through His word at a women's Bible study covering the book of Genesis, word by word and verse by verse. So far, \\"Captivating\\" lines up perfectly with what is being taught through BSF. It saddened my heart to see a pretty critical review of the book or possibly it's authors from a sister who apparently never finished reading \\"Captivating\\"!

I thought the first chapter was a joke. Seriously. It is poorly written. Poor, incorrect unBiblical theology. The author seems to imply that all women have had some deep, dark secret (sexual abuse, ect) that they need to sob over. In one part of the book it told me that I needed to heal from my abusive past and just let the 'flood gates' open and cry it out. ??? Also, making it out that God NEEDS women. That somehow He (God) was incomplete without women. That's right- the author reflects that *God* needed Eve. It also becomes disturbing how the author reflects that Jesus should be our 'lover'. I don't know about you- but if I said 'lover' in any context whatsoever- it would imply 'someone with whom you have sexual relations with'. Creepy, inaccurate take on demon possesion and even going so far as to imply that sickness is a type of demon-possesion.I wanted accurate Biblical advice and instead I get moreso a ranting, off the wall, rambling \\"book\\"."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There have been controversies in Christian circles about the authors of this book.

How could they know I was feeling exactly like that and hurting in exactly those ways?What an excellent gift for the women you know and love. They struggle with many of the same thoughts as they strive to find a balance between the false messages the world offers, and the misguided messages the church often offers women to combat the lies the world sells.

The root of the word captivating is captive. John Eldredge, a former counselor for Focus on the Family, also wrote Wild At Heart, which is sort of the Christian answer to Robert Bly's Iron John. I ask myself, does a man who yearns to be \\"wild at heart\\" really want to be taken captive? Wouldn't taking people captive actually be a negative quality in a woman, or, for that matter, in a man?Then there's the premise of the book: all little girls dream of being princesses and being rescued by a prince. I scratched my head on this.I confess I was a bit of a tomboy. Maybe that's why I didn't long to be a princess. I didn't play prince and princess with the boys in the neighborhood. I played war. We converted the neighbor's swing set into fighter planes and swung back and forth making machine gun noises. \\"Da-da-da-da-da-da-dow!\\"Joan of Arc resonates with me; princesses do not.My husband, who also read the book, thinks this longing to be a princess may be a response to cultural conditioning from Walt Disney movies about princesses. Which makes sense, since my parents didn't take me to those movies. When I was eight, my mom took me to see A Man For All Seasons, about Sir Thomas More. I have a stronger affinity for Christian martyrs than for princesses.I don't want to belittle women who actually did want to be a princess when they were young. By all means, buy the book. Enjoy. A lot of women fantasize about being made love to by a god. I have no doubt this is what made the Da Vinci Code so popular.Personally, I'd rather be a goddess than a princess any day. Tamar, the only princess deemed worthy of mention in the Bible, ended up being raped by her half brother.But the Bride of Christ, Goddess of Heaven, seduced by the Love God himself. Methinks the Eldredges are setting their sights too low.I suspect most women experience longings in their lives from time to time. A sense of ennui, that somehow the things we wanted in life have passed us by. Many women struggle with wounds as well, some particularly deep. I'm often amazed at the number of Christian women I know who suffer from prolonged depression. When homeschooling mothers are drowning their children in the bathtub, books like Captivating are not only well intentioned, but also much needed.As I talk to Christian women, though, I often sense they're already waiting for some proverbial prince to rescue them, to save them from their empty lives, rather than taking the initiative to change their own lives, like Joan of Arc and most of the female heroes in the Bible. In courageously addressing some of the problems Christian women face, the Eldredges unfortunately promote the passive mindset that causes them.My husband and I couldn't help noting that, in spite of the fact Stasi Eldredge is listed as coauthor, the writing style is entirely that of John Eldredge. Only occasionally does he allow his wife to get her own ideas in, generally to confess that she was once (oh, Lord, help us!) a feminist.The true irony of Captivating is that, in a book ostensibly about the deepest yearnings of women, in which the author argues-truthfully I think-that the church has repressed those longings, John Eldridge has effectively stolen his own wife's voice, making her like The Little Mermaid. A princess, yes, but one who has relinquished for her prince the very power that made her captivating.Unfortunately, the Disney version has a happier ending than Hans Christian Andersen's original story."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just could not relate to this book at all.

Honestly, I didn't learn anything new. I am a princess. I am loved as I should be. I value myself as I should. I don't really need the things this book espouses.A fairly good book,but not one I would go out and buy."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is co-authored by John and Stasi Eldredge. Sometimes it is clear who is writing, other times it is not.Overall the premise of the book is for women to be captivating. Their hearts should provide the invitation to romance so they can let their true beauty shine forth all the while having an adventure throughout their lives.\\"What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating will do for you\\" is the caption on the back of the book. When I read the caption, I was a little annoyed because \\"Wild at Heart\\" did nothing for me. In fact, I though the book was wrong, so I had little expectation for this book.As I started reading, however, I found this book to be better in places than \\"Wild at Heart.\\" The places I found myself enjoying were when Stasi wrote. I found myself usually disagreeing with John's writing.This book is an okay read, but could have been better if Stasi would have wrote the whole book. As with \\"Wild at Heart\\" the theology is a little off in places and the authors seem to use more movie and cultural references than scripture to prove their point. Sometimes (as with \\"Wild at Heart\\") the scripture is interpreted in a weak or liberal way to further attempt to substantiate their point.This is another book you can safely skip."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is a fabulous encouragement to be a balanced feminine woman who draws out the best in others. I learned to be a catalyst rather than a door mat or a steam roller. As I've grown in learning to invite my husband to do something rather than wish he would read my mind or try to push him into it, my marriage has been enriched. I feel empowered in my roles of nurturer, provider of beauty and gentle strength in my home. I bought 5 books to give to my closest friends because I think this book is that worthwhile and applicable to Christian women regardless of circumstances."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is an amazing book! Stasi and John do a wonderful job of making it feel like they're talking to you. It's beautiful and inspiring and everyone woman deserves to own a copy of this book!

There is also a similar book written by John Eldredge for men called Wild at Heart."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I started an online book study with my 3 daughters using this book. All three of them are long distances away. This book has really opened up some great discussions and opened up their hearts to the Lord and the beauty of being a woman. One of my daughters said \\"That's exactly how I feel! I hated myself for feeling that way, but now I realize that is the way God made me!\\" It has helped us see ourseves and our wonderful Lord in new ways. Very recommended.

I have such little time for reading but I was continously drawn to Captivating. I found myself nodding my head in agreement with every word and more often then not a tear was rolling down my cheek. The book made me proud to be a woman and to read that the seemingly innate desire for a true love affair was not only normal but what God had intended, released my deep buried insecurity that something must be wrong with me. Captivating is a must read for the independent woman. I have never been more proud or felt more priviledged to be a woman. Thank you John and Stasi!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Some of my friends at church are beginnging to read this book. I was curious about it, so I decided to read the book a bit before buying it. I was shocked with how much examples from movies that the author uses in her book. I've never read a christian book with so many examples from movies. I don't think movies are a good source to use as examples for matters of the human heart. I did notice some resentment towards the Proverbs 31 Woman. How can you be resentful towards the Word of God? Just reading the back cover made red lights turn on in my head. I hope that whoever reads this book will be sure to not take it literally.

I cried, laughed and have given multiple copies away to friends and family in effort to get the word out about this book, it is a bondage breaker, a life giver and a hope spreading book. People spend so much time mocking it but I truly believe that the books etc that God wants to bless are the ones that are going all over the world. anything he is pleased with will be blessed it is proven over and over again, in large churches, in growth of certain bands over other ones....when people are doing things right...God is there blessing it.

If I read one more purple-prosed paragraph about precious hearts and the 'mystery of the feminine soul', I'm going to throw this book across the room. Ooops, too late. Anybody who wants it can come pick it out of the dirty-clothes pile.No, I didn't buy this book. My husband's sister gave it to me (which is why I'm using an anonymous name here) and I should have known better because she is one of those wackos who says things like \\"Jesus is my best friend.\\" (To which I'm tempted to reply: 'Honey, get some friends your own age').This book might appeal to you if -- and only if -- you're one of those dopey 14-year-olds who draws smiley faces on everything and swoons over TeenBeat magazine and dreams of being a fairy tale princess. I wasn't like that at 14 and I'm certainly not like that at 32.I don't need a knight to rescue me, I need a husband who is capable of handling his equal share of family responsibilities instead of retreating into his cave every night. The Eldredges got one thing -- and one thing only -- right: women are tired. Tired of handling the lion's share of responsibility for the marriage, the children, his family, the finances, the household, etc. But their solution -- Jesus wants to be the lover of your precious heart -- is the kind of useless platitude you'll find on a Hallmark card. After 150 pages of this, I realized they had nothing more to offer.Save yourself the money. Come get the book off my floor ... or save yourself the trip and just go the Hallmark store and buy yourself one of those \\"precious hearts\\" cards."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a wonderful feel-good book for women!

They look at the world and take it as is without INVESTIGATING WHY things are the way they are. They look at the iceberg and they see it above the surface and they think \\"there's the iceberg in it's entirety,\\" rather than LOOKING UNDER THE OCEAN to see the ENTIRE iceberg! They say things like \\"boys would never dress up as fairies\\" \\"boys innately like playing with weapons\\" (not because they bought their children toy guns, of course) , \\"women long to be rescued by a prince and men long to be the rescuer\\" and \\"almost all nude paintings are of women because the male body looks ridiculous naked and half covered with a sheet...\\" Not because most of the painters were MALE or anything. These things are NOT facts, they are the authors OPINIONS. If one would simply do some RESEARCH, you know, other than consulting popular movies, then perhaps they could have an academic argument. If you're interested in reinforcing horrifying and debilitating stereotypes of gender that have been used to oppress women for centuries, you'll enjoy this book.It doesn't even deserve the one star. My Christian women's group was studying this book and all 10 of us decided to stop reading it because we all hated it so much.However, if you're a Christian who believes in equality instead of sexism, then let me suggest \\"Is It Okay to Call God Mother?

If you are unsure of your role as a woman of GOD, this book will clear up your confusion. It helped my walk with the LORD to be stronger and concrete.

Really. Well-written, each chapter impacts you and leaves you with the question, \\"How can there be any further revelation?\\" and then there is. It doesn't cater to the perfect woman, nor does it impose any 'burdens' on you to be one. Rather, it explains why you are stressed, frustrated and not living the life God intended for you but hiding behind the mask of dominating or desolate woman (or in my case, flip-flopping between both). Prepare for tears, even if you think you are a strong woman - God is waiting to reach you in this book and make you understand how truly captivating you are."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I went to the Captivating Retreat in 2005. It changed my life. I experienced God and the Holy Spirit in a new intimate, exciting way. This book is based on that teaching. It is biblical, it is powerful...it is something the Enemy doesn't want women to know. I'm actually leading a women's study on this book...using the DVD series available on the RansomedHeart.com website. Got the books thru Amazon. I'm humbled and honored to be chosen to lead women to healing, and glory thru Jesus...who said this as his mission statement \\"I've come to heal the broken-hearted and set the captives free\\". Jesus isn't about a religion as it is about a relationship...in fact as you'll learn in this excellent book...it's a ROMANCE. If your heart is heavy, if you want to live your fullest life...if you're curious how you as a woman reflect the female side of God, get this book and hear the truth of who you are and why the things that stir your heart, also stir the heart of God.

I've only seen one review of the videos..has anyone else viewed these? I think I've decided to do a different study called \\"The New Eve\\" which is by Robert Lewis - I think it stays more on track and hit the nail on the head for women these days.

Although I found some insights worth reading the book for, I was a little put off with the language by which she conveyed her ideas, (e.g. At one point she refers to Jesus in his role as a Lover. Not as in, the Lover of my Soul, but more of a sexual connotation. Kind of, Jesus, my Luva') and I did not necessarily agree with her total theology. She also relied way too heavily on pop culture references and heavy injections of melodrama. After the third story about incest and rape, you think to yourself - I am just not wounded enough to read this book!Eldredge states that the question deep in every woman's heart is, \\"Am I lovely?\\". The group of ladies that I was meeting with to discuss the book universally agreed that this was not our question. Not one of us were consumed with heart-rending doubts about if we looked cute that day. Now as you read further, it can be understood that what the author means by that question is - Am I loveable? I think that she really had the start of a good idea with her theme that God has written some desires on your heart that are just for you! And the blessing of a \\"gentle and quiet spirit\\" is not just for women that have it all together, are good time managers, and have nicely shaped nails! But the idea is lost between too many movie references and not enough sound scriptural advice. Overall, the book did not live up to my expectations, and I have concerns that newer Christians may not have enough of a grounding in biblical knowledge to weed through the fluff without being completely confused."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The way you respond to this book has a lot to do with how you see yourself. If you're a woman who sees herself as a wounded bird or an ugly duckling that nobody loves, maybe this book is for you. If you need constant reassurance that God loves you, maybe you'll like the notion that Jesus is your strapping hero right out of the pages of a romance novel. If you see yourself as a victim in need of 'healing' or rescue, this book might appeal to you.But if you're a strong, healthy, and capable woman, you'll probably find the book not very relevant. I'm not perfect, there are things I'm working on, and there are things in my life that I'd like to change, but I wouldn't describe myself as a wounded bird waiting to be rescued. The need to feel 'captivating' is on a par with the need to feel like a world-class chef or a Pulitzer-winning writer -- it'd be nice, but it's not my overriding concern.And I'm not sure what kind of marital relationship the Eldredges have, but I don't look to my husband to \\"fight for me.\\" I want his support and respect and love, but I don't need him to start a fight and then claim he's doing it for me. I think he's a lot smarter than that.Sorry, can't give it more than 2 stars -- and those two stars are in the hope that most women aren't as damaged, weak or victimized as this book presumes."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently received a review copy of this book from Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program. It was one of the most unique books I've ever read. I admit, it took me a long time to read it. A very long time. It forced me to think about myself, my life experiences, and my God so differently, that it was difficult to take in. I had to read it in small chunks, to digest what the author was saying.Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul was written by John and Stasi Eldredge. This husband and wife team take a couples' approach to writing this and it's companion book Wild at Heart (the men's book). It was so interesting to have the man's perspective on the subject of women. They so beautifully illustrated that our beauty comes almost entirely from inside, and that most women just don't even feel worthy of showing their true beauty.They address why we strive for beauty, how we strive for it, and what the unintended consequences of the striving are. What we miss as women is that each one of us is beautiful, because we were made in the image of God. We try so hard to be beautiful for ourselves, for men, for others, but we either aren't aware or we ignore the beauty that God instilled inside of us that would shine through if only we let it. It is the inner beauty that makes us captivating.Captivating made me think. It was hard for me to read because the subject matter was so different than any book I have ever read. It made me examine myself, my motives, my hurts, and my fears. It hit right in the heart, and forced me to pray. It also helped me to begin to see myself differently. Through the entire book, the authors bring us back to what the Creator whispers to our soul, if we would listen. You are beautiful. You are captivating. You are worth it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"CaptivatingBy John & Stasi EldredgePublished by Thomas NelsonIn this revised and expanded edition of Captivating, John and Stasi Eldredge seek to \\"unveil the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" God has given each one of us a heart that yearns to be romanced, a desire to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. Yet, in order to accept these truths, we must first work through our wounded pasts, be aware of those who aim to thwart our efforts, and embrace the love that is only offered to us through Christ our Lord.Well written and inspirational, Captivating has become a widely read and lauded women's study. I was often surprised by my inner responses to the theories being revealed, and John and Stasi's interpretation of scripture. Although I did not always agree with certain contextual inferences, I did find the book beneficial overall.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [..] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend a few years ago but I had never ended up reading it. My teenage daughter came home one day recently and wanted to know if I knew anything about it. It had been recommended to her by a couple of her girl friends so I ended up buying it. She has read it twice since then and I have read it once - my book group ended up selecting it for our July book since they were intrigued about it when I mentioned it to them.When I look at the reviews, people have very strong opinions and either love it or hate it with very little in between. In my case, I am more of an \\"in-between\\" leaning toward the positive side. To be honest, it took me a while to get into it since the premise is that all women want three things in life: 1) to be swept up in romance, 2) to have a great adventure, and 3) to be beautiful (captivating). On the surface, I had an immediate reaction that they didn't know THIS woman and I really wasn't buying it. Keeping on and moving through the pages while trying to remain open, I came to understand what they mean by these three things and it isn't what immediately came to my own mind. For example: The whole \\"beauty\\" thing made me immediately think about women who are young, thin, blond, gorgeously dressed and beautiful (our society's definition) and not only do I not fit that, I don't really aspire too -- for example, shopping for clothing is something I avoid at all costs. When I better understood what they meant by the term \\"beautiful\\" - more related to inner tranquility and a heart at rest - I was totally able to buy into what they were saying.There is a premise here that most women have been damaged in some way, all in varying degrees. While many women may feel differently, I largely agree. Some have been hurt dramatically and some have only had hurtful comments made over the years that they have internalized and believed. Regardless of which camp we fall into (or somewhere in between), even those small things can take root and have a huge impact on our lives and decisions as we grow older. It's my belief that many women are carrying something around with them that they are not even aware of until they look deep for some reason and it's there, waiting to be uncovered. There were a few times that I was absolutely shocked to find something that I thought was my own deep, dark thought was in print on a published page and other women had the same feelings that I did.Whether or not you believe every single sentence in this book, if you read it with an open mind, you can still learn something -- or at least challenge yourself about how your life is unfolding and if it's what you want it to be. It can be unsettling and I don't hold the same beliefs the authors do on every single topic, but it still was an excellent read for someone who wants to learn more about themselves and question the status quo."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was very excited about receiving my 1st book called Captivating by John & Stasi Eldredge. It is a New York Times Bestseller. The cover is beautiful, a white vellum with gold accents, and it's very appealing. What do they say about not judging a book by it's cover?The first few chapter's were indeed interesting. Some good points were made about the importance of Women in God's eyes. Another important point is that the enemy is really out to undermine our femininity, and our roles as God would have them. For me, this was the take home message.Then the book started to get weird. The authors use ALOT of references to movies, songs, and pop culture in general. The scripture references were used out of context in many instances. Some were disturbing, for instance they implied that Jesus should be seen as our \\"lover\\". As in husband lover, not just someone that loves us unconditionally. They used references from the Song of Solomon to back up this odd claim. Creepy and out of context in my humble opinion. I thought the writing was dis-jointed and often jumped around. It was confusing to tell which author was speaking at the time, John or Stasi.I noticed in reading other's reviews that this is an either \\"love it or hate it\\" type book. I guess I fall in the category of hate it. I do not think it's theologically sound and although there are some good points to be found, overall it does not send a good message to women.So now my dilemma is, what do I do with my book that I really can't recommend to other's?Disclaimer: This book was provided to me free from Thomas Nelson in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read several different types of reviews, either one way or the other. Hating or loving this book. Buy, for me personally I am going to take it like it is. This is a book that uplifts women and helps them to truly understand the women that God initially created. A very deep and insightful book. It will make you think about who you are in Christ and it will cause you to look at your life. I love books that make me do that.If you are a Christan that watches very few secular movies, then the comparisons and references to fictional characters is will be lost to you. Eldridge gives a lot of references to the secular movies and fiction. I get where the thought was in the reference, the author is trying to tie in the secular worlds way of relating, because so many of US are part of the worlds culture. As Christians we watch t.v. and watch movies at the theatres. So, for those Christians bashing Eldridge for his references, please take the speak out of your own eye! Some Christians will get the references and some wont... Google what you don't get.This is just a rehashing of Eldridge's Wild at Heart. But, it is pertaining to the female audience. I do believe that God gave Eldridge a insight into female and male. Yes, I believe that they are trying to sale these books in many different ways and it might start to look like mass production. But, I will stick with Jesus and take from these books what He reveals to my heart and then I will pass this book on to another female.

Without disregarding the \\"individual\\", the book delves into commonalities shared by women through God's design. Topics include woman's purpose, fulfillment of her desires, the worst enemies of her desires, paths to healing and encouragement to use womanhood to support the body of Christ.I LOVE this book. The first time I read it, my heart was opened to the mysterious of myself as a women. I discovered many of my \\"quirks\\" were really part of God's design; some of my \\"weaknesses\\" were actually strengths. I learned how to heal from hurts I never realized were an assault against my God-given womanhood. Now, I am encouraged to grow in my beauty as a woman, in spirit, soul and body; to live boldly for God's purpose for me.I really appreciate all John & Stasi's work, for many reasons, but one is simply for the fact they write together. Their shared work provides a well-rounded approach to all the topics. They are well grounded in Scripture as well, speaking life and hope into their readers while discussing the hard topics.

Sadly, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with duty and demands. Many Christian women are tired and struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a \\"good servant,\\" a nurturing caregiver, or a capable home manager.By revealing the core desires every woman shares- to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty-John and Stasi Eldredge invite women to recover their feminine hearts, created in the image of an intimate and passionate God.Join us as we journey into the deep mysteries of our feminine souls in order to recapture our hearts.My Review:When I first saw this book available for review on BookSneeze I was very excited. I had heard excellent things about it. I have to admit I have had a hard time getting into it. Usually once I get stared reading a book I can't put it down. That wasn't the case with Captivating. The writing style is very accessible and there is an abundant use of good quotes and stories which make the book easy to read.John and Stasi remind us that women think, feel, and process differently. In theory, I agree with the authors intentions. The use of scripture often times seemed out of context.I wish they would have done more to describe who I am as a woman loved by God rather than a woman trying to be the princess in a fairytale trying to be found by my prince.The Authors:John Eldredge's BiographyJohn Eldredge is an author (you probably figured that out), a counselor, and teacher. He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own heart in his love, and learn to live in his Kingdom. John grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles (which he hated), and spent his boyhood summers on his grandfather's cattle ranch in eastern Oregon (which he loved). John met his wife Stasi in high school (in drama class). But their romance did not begin until they each came to faith in Christ, after high school. John earned his undergraduate degree in Theater at Cal Poly, and directed a theater company in Los Angeles for several years before moving to Colorado with Focus on the Family, where he taught at the Focus on the Family Institute.John earned his master's degree in Counseling from Colorado Christian University, under the direction of Larry Crabb and Dan Allender. He worked as a counselor in private practice before launching Ransomed Heart in 2000. John and Stasi live in Colorado Springs with their three sons (Samuel, Blaine and Luke), their golden retriever (Oban), and two horses (Whistle and Kokolo). While all of this is factually true, it somehow misses describing an actual person. He loves the outdoors passionately, and all beauty, Shakespeare, bow hunting, a good cigar, anything having to do with adventure, poetry, March Madness, working in the shop, fly fishing, classic rock, the Tetons, fish tacos, George MacDonald, green tea, buffalo steaks, dark chocolate, wild and open places, horses running, and too much more to name. He also uses the expression \\"far out\\" way too much.Stasi Eldredge's BiographyStasi Eldredge loves writing and speaking to women about the goodness of God. Stasi received her Bachelors Degree in Sociology from San Diego State University which she attended primarily because it was close to the beach. She became a Christian her junior year in college and dove into the ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. After graduating, Stasi joined Youth for Christ heading up a ministry to pregnant teenagers and teen mothers. She has been active in ministry. She spent her childhood years in Prairie Village, Kansas for which she is truly grateful. Her family moved to Southern California back in the really bad smog days when she was ten. She loved theatre and acting and took a partiaever since including theatre ministry, crisis pregnancy center ministry, women's ministry and children's ministry. The Eldredge family moved to Colorado in 1991.Stasi loves the joy and freedom that comes from knowing the passionate, stunning love of Jesus Christ and lives to see others come to know him more deeply. She loves worship music, time to bake, celebrating life, getting lost in a good novel, baths, walking in the woods, hearing her son's laughter, the sound of wind in the trees, a good cup of coffee, the smell of the earth after it rains, a powerful turn of a phrase, animals in the wild, gardens, freshly mowed grass, family traditions, cherished friendships, the Tetons, rivers, mountain lakes, the grace and beauty of horses, the affection of her dog and most of all her family and her God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"John and Stasi Eldredge revise and update this runaway bestseller.What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating is doing for women.

This is the updated and expanded version. I never got around to reading the original that came out several years back. John & Stasi Eldredge team up in writing this book geared towards women. It takes the reader through 3 things a woman's heart longs for: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure and to unveil beauty. Stasi Eldredge weaves in stories of her life experiences and does a good job of utilizing Scripture. John Eldredge chimes in here and there to provide a man's perspective and experiences.I have to admit that I was not captivated by Captivating. I have had a great deal of trouble getting into the book and finding interest. I believe in the message of the book. I love that it is not another woman's book that emphasizes doing more, more, more! I value the use of Scripture. I just have had trouble turning the pages for some reason. I am still in the first half of the book. I do plan on working my way through it. Maybe my assessment will change as I get through the content.

This book used very descriptive language and immediately had my attention to find out why we as women have a desire to be captivating. This book was about discovering who you are a woman and explored this by diving into many deep and sometimes disturbing stories. They used many excerpts from well known movies, books, poems, quotes and Bible passages to help the reader understand certain concepts related to discovering the beauty within. They kept going back to the questions- Am I captivating? Do I have a beauty of my own? These were not shallow questions and were answered quite humbly and thoroughly.I really liked most of the content of this book and I think it has a message for all women to embrace their femininity as God planned. However, since both John and Stasi wrote this book, I was confused at times who was actually writing in parts of the book. I was also confused whether they were emphasizing being captivated by a man or God. Overall, I think it has a timely message for every woman and many would benefit from the healing prayers included."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There is so much to this book that it's hard for me to summarize briefly. It's about what God created women for and how to get back to WHO God created you to be. This isn't your typical how-to-be-a-woman-of-God book in that it doesn't offer a list of what you should be doing, rather it gets to the roots of WHO you are, WHO God created you to be, WHY you are the way you are. To take it from the back cover: \\"The message of Captivating is this: Your heart matters more than anything else in all of creation.\\"I, honestly, was somewhat skeptical coming into reading this book, but it sounded interesting so I gave it a try. And it is GOOD. I couldn't believe how quickly it drew me in - for this type of book that is R-A-R-E! I found myself just drinking this book in. This book was talking to me Stasi gets me. This is a powerful, amazing book. It was a real eye-opener in so many ways. It helped me see how Satan has been tying me down, cutting me off from God's power and love. It made me rethink a LOT of things. I intend to re-read this book somewhat regularly - every year or two - because I think this is something that is constantly a work in progress, and regular refreshers will help keep me progressing in the right direction.

I also, believe that it does give a great over-all explanation of what a girl wants. Seriously. You just have to be willing to delve deeper while reading. Warning: This book can be rather emotional at times.\\"Every woman was once a little girl. And every little girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams.

My reasoning was that if no one wants me romantically, why bother keeping those sections of the museum open? It's less painful that way...Or so I thought until I started reading Captivating.We can try to deny our innermost feelings and longings, but we can't eliminate them completely without killing our souls in the process. This book reminded me of that.Captivating isn't about marriage, although the topic is discussed. Addressing both single and married women, the book talks about how God designed women to be, and part of that is a core desire to be wanted, pursued and romanced. Not the degrading, soul-killing, thinly veiled lust for sexual gratification the world calls romance, but a sacred romance that comes from being appreciated and wanted for who we are both inside and out.Not casual reading or a quick fix, is an excellent tool to help you heal emotionally and see yourself in a way that's vital to your wellbeing. I highly recommend it for both women and the men who want to understand their women better.Disclosure of Material Connection: I receive the books I review free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

This version is just a little bit sharper and a little more relevant. The additions are barely noticeable, but, if you've read it before you may notice some of them.What I really enjoy about Captivating is how it draws parallels between the needs of a woman's heart and that of God's heart. I enjoyed this book in 2005 and I still enjoyed it in 2010. John and Stasi are honest and very aware of how the church (and other Christian books) have treated women for years. Maybe you won't agree with everything in Captivating, but there will at least be nuggets that will change you.Full disclosure: Thomas Nelson provided me with a free review copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review.

This is a different concept than what many women hear in the world and in the church community even. John and Stasi touch on several hard topics, such as healing a wounded heart and even how a woman's heart is supported and supporting of a man's heart. From the time we are very little, we're always trying to play princess and have someone notice that we are beautiful, and in this book, John and Stasi say that that's okay and completely normal. We were built for that. This book was definitely not very preachy, but there were times that a background knowledge of the Bible was helpful.

The confirmation was life-changing, providing a launching point to move forward in spiritual and emotional growth.In the chapter entitled, \\"Wounded,\\" they write,\\"Our wounds strike at the core of our femininity. The damage done to our feminine hearts through the wounds we received is made much worse by the horrible things we believe about ourselves as a result.

The book promises to reveal what it means to be a woman and how to live the life of a woman as God intended on a day to day basis.The thesis of the work is a philosophy of gender reasoned as follows:1. Gender is imprinted at the spiritual level on the soul and not just in our physical form and genes.According to the authors, this principle is suggested by the contextual language of the versus in Genesis describing creation. Specifically, the verse dictating that God made mankind, MALE AND FEMALE, in his image. The authors argue that based on this inclusive language, both men and women represent the spiritual image of God and so it follows both genders display/embody attributes of God at a spiritual level.2. Women reflect the following attributes of God: romance, adventure, and beauty.Using numerous scripture references, the authors do a good job of demonstrating that romance (the call to pursuit; the quiet whisper that says I am here for you when you are ready, pursue me), adventure (intrinsically linked to grand, meaningful action), and beauty (the restful respite that takes your breath away and makes you feel at ease like a beautiful garden or gentle river or fresh cut flowers) are all attributes of God. However, I think John and Stasi fail to lead the readers through any well reasoned, logical proofs on why these three attributes are specifically tied to women. Instead, they merely provide examples of women who embody these attributes and use parenthetical questions such as \\"(don't you agree?)\\" to push the reader to accept their conclusions.Do I agree with this premise? It does seem that I've been imprinted to the depths of *my* soul with a desire to be pursued, with a quest for adventure, and with a passion to be beautiful inside and out. But I'm not every woman, and I'm not sure I'm at all comfortable prescribing these desires for all women as ordained by God. It's especially hard at times to reconcile the desire to exemplify beauty and respite as Godly with the current push of the Western world for women to be harder and aggressive. When I was a younger woman and wanted to be pleasant and gentle and restful to others I accepted the desire as part of who I was. When I was in my 20s, business classes (and women's studies) taught me that being pleasant, gentle, and restful are qualities women are merely trained into by a sexist oppressive culture and that it would do us good to free ourselves from the shackle of these desires. Studies are often trotted out to show the #1 reason men succeed over women in the business world is because they aren't constrained with a desire to be pleasant, gentle, and restful to others and that when women adopt the posture and attitude of men they too outpace the rest of their female colleagues in rank and pay (but sadly they experience more marital and relationship discord and are not well liked). And now here comes John and Stasi asserting that being pleasant, gentle, and restful to others are the very embodiment of God within us. Are they right, or are they fools and tools of the patriarch?3. Women are most fulfilled and most useful in serving God's kingdom when they cultivate and embody these feminine attributes of God.According to the authors, women are uniquely qualified to draw others into the kingdom and enrich the lives of others in discipleship when we cultivate these attributes I've detailed above. We can move hearts and mountains with our inviting hearts, our adventurous spirits, and our gentle and soothing beauty. Not only are we most effective when we focus on romance, adventure, and beauty but we are most joyful and fulfilled. Again, in lieu of providing reasoned arguments as to the validity of this premise, here the authors simply provide examples of women who are working life in line with this philosophy and suggest readers give it a try to see what fruit it bears. They also caution that by ignoring this principle and showing neglect in providing careful cultivation, these attributes will remain, as they are part of our souls, but they will grow weedy and untamed, resulting in a personality that is to either extreme of the attribute (aggressive and off putting/needy and clingy and desperate; reckless/listless and uninspiring; vain or harsh/frumpy or uninviting).The authors acknowledged that cultivating these feminine attributes can be a challenge. First, since such cultivation will further God's kingdom, evil forces will actively oppose our progress. Additionally, as mentioned above, there is currently a counter-cultural backlash pushing women to abandon these attributes and cultivate a more masculine attitude to get ahead. Finally, there is a very real fear and danger that offering these qualities to the world (and displaying vulnerability) will get you stomped on and abused. Try telling sexual assault victims that to be fulfilled they need to cultivate allure (not sexual, but personality), respite, and gentleness. There are some brief words on proper context (the author's aren't suggesting while being beaten a woman smiles and radiates beauty) but otherwise the readers are challenged to find a way to embody these attributes no matter the evil that should oppose them, no matter the western world social or business consequences, and despite the vulnerable risk it comes packaged with.-------------------------------------------------------------------An additional idea the authors offer is that Lucifer has a special hatred of women, stemming from his envy of her beauty and his opposition to her relationship building, that fuels much of the historical oppression and degradation of women in our world. The authors detail the scripture references to Lucifer's beauty as they construct the foundation for this conclusion. There isn't really a call to action suggested by this theory; the authors simply want to make women aware of the greater context of women's issues with regard to spiritual warfare. I like conspiracy theories so this premise appealed to me. Is it possible that women have been oppressed from time eternal not just because we are, on average, physically weaker but because there is a demonic plot working against us? Interesting to ponder.Outside of the content of the book, the writing itself is average. It's written in an easy, conversational format."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"With much respect to the authors of Captivating, there are several aspects of this book that make it hard for me to recommend it. The book does bring up some valid, true points about a woman's deep desire to be found beautiful and captivating. The solution to this desire presented in Captivating doesn't come from the true Word of God, however. Why? Because it keeps \\"self\\"alive. Captivating tries to convince us that we can look inward and find worth, beauty, and value within ourselves. It keeps the focus on us; on our feelings, our attributes, and our beauty. The problem I have with this notion is that beauty isn't from us. The true beauty that women should want to possess comes from Christ and Christ alone. Christ in us is beauty in its purest form. The Bible makes it very clear that we weren't born into beauty. We were born into sin. God made us wonderfully and beautifully but us as human beings, by nature, we are sinful. The authors of Captivating, in my opinion, missed this part of scripture. Captivating says, \\"We want you to hear clearly that beauty is an essence every woman carries from the moment of her creation. The only things standing in the way of our beauty are our doubts and fears and the hiding and striving we fall to as a result\\" (Captivating). From the very moment the original sin was committed, human beings are born into sin. It's Jesus in us that makes us beautiful. Our self-loving nature wants us to buy into the idea that in and of ourselves we are important and captivating. Yet God's word is based on the truth that Christ loved us even while we were still sinners. That's not to say we don't have any value at all. God sees us as valuable but that's not because we possess anything worthwhile of ourselves. It is because God Himself is Love. HE longs to rescue us from our ugly, sinful selves. To be clear, I am I not saying that no one should read this book. Captivating does offer some valuable insight. However, it's absolutely essential to keep in mind that we alone are nothing without Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In their book Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, John & Stasi Eldrege share their journey in discovering and healing a woman's soul.

Instead we see a follower of God following the world."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"One of the reasons this book has been so embraced by the Christian community is because it does unveil a profound truth that each of our hearts identify with. That truth is that our passion for adventure and love is interconnected with the heart of our heavenly Father and His love for us. But that is the only element of truth you will see in this writing. No one wants or likes to believe that they could be taken in by a false teacher. It's a personal blow to our pride to admit we are capable of being duped.False teaching always has 2 fundamental elements that make it a successful false teaching. 1)It contains a biblical truth that your heart can identify with 2) It appeals to our sin nature...usually \\"self\\" is involved.This book is all about \\"self\\" as a woman. There is a continual admonition to think extremely highly of yourself as a woman. To actually look at yourself as the \\"crown of creation\\" So many of the things Stasi appeals to us to think and feel about ourself, is nothing more that an appeal to exalt ourself above others. She even condemns the idea of being a servant.....which is characteristic of all of the teachings of Jesus. Jesus says if we want to be great that we must be a servant.I could write a book on all of the points I found in this book that are anti-biblical. I admonish you as a reader....if you choose to read this book inspite of my warning....to read it with great discernment.I have read a few of the writing of the Eldredge's and was quite taken back at the theology in this book. It caused me to really rethink what I've been reading.

God is so many things to me: Father, Savior, Lord, King, Shepherd... but not Lover. He is the bridegroom of the church, yes. But He isn't MY bridegroom. He loves me dearly, yes - but not as a lover! This is not a new heresy - it's been around since the mystics of the middle ages - but it is a heresy. And it makes sense, because otherwise God would be a polygamist and so would every person who gets married here on earth - whenever you had sex with your spouse, you'd be cheating on God! That's not at all what He has in mind for us. He gave us marriage as a blessing, not a curse, not an invitation to sin!I think the Eldredges realize this, because there is actually very little of the Bible in their book. Instead, they rely on pop culture references to make their points, which, while interesting and relevant, don't bring very much Christianity into the picture. The result is that worldly desires are held up as God-given, rather than analyzed in light of the Bible. This book does not promote humility before God, but a sense that you deserve God's love.So, although it saddens me to do it, I have to give this book the lowest rating and warn anyone who is considering it: this book will not help you in your walk with God, but mislead you down a very wrong path."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Maybe I am not the type of woman this book is geared toward. I don't have feelings of abandonment by the men in my life, I don't walk around internally screaming \\"Look at me! Am I beautiful?

My excitement was short lived as I was quickly disappointed that it did not live up to all of the hype. The general goal of this book is to encourage and teach women how to set their heart free. Through the demands of life, women seem to lose sight of their childhood desires to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty and the authors of this book try to encourage women back to a place of accepting that they were created in the image of God.In the first few chapters, I thought that maybe this book could go somewhere, but sadly after that I felt as though the authors, John Eldredge & Stasi Eldredge, became a little repetitive and in between the main points was a lot of fluff. My other issue with this book was that I had expected it to be much more biblical in nature and that it would use scripture to support its ideas, but the use of scripture paled in comparison to the use of movie references and when scripture was used, it was not always used in its proper context.Overall, this book took a long time to get through and in the end, I felt like I had gotten very little out of it.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

Reading Wild at heart helped me see and understand men better. But little did I realize the impact and exactness that Captivating would captivate and pinpoint the issues of my own heart, as well as the hearts of many close friends.I read this book on my lunch break and every day, I look forward to my lunch break where I can spend some quality time with myself and just allow my spirit to take in what is to be revealed that day. Little did I know that these lunch sessions would turn out to be little self-restoration sessions where I learned so much about myself. It even revealed issues that I did not realize that were not resolved and/or had.Captivating is the book for women.... not a certain group or age, but the whole of women in this world, all cultures, countries and colors should read this book. I am already half way through the book and have already encountered so many eye-opening things and growth in my own heart. I look forward to the healing and restoration of my own heart as I finish the book and continue in my journey that God has for me.Do not pass up this book.

I'm not sure what to say to my friend about this, but after reading this book, it's clear that her mother doesn't know me very well. There wasn't much in \\"Captivating\\" that I could relate to.- No, I'm not interested in being a fairy-tale princess. I'm a hard-working honor student in a pre-med program. I was hoping for a book that would help deepen my walk with Christ and help me better understand how to use my gifts to emulate Christ's example of service to others. This book wasn't it.- I'm not carrying around unresolved issues with my father. I have a good relationship with my Dad who, while not perfect, has always helped me to dream big and always lets me know he's100% behind me.- I don't dream about being rescued or sitting behind some man on his Adventure Horse. I was raised to identify a goal and go after it, not to sit around waiting for someone else to take charge. And I'm not interested in being a side-kick or a helper; when I'm ready to marry, I'll be looking for a man who's seeking a partnership of equals.- I don't need to be convinced that God loves me. I already know God loves me; I've never had any doubt about that. I'm not looking to mimic a Hollywood romance where I'm Kate Winslett and Jesus is Leo DiCaprio. I don't see Jesus as a Fantasy Lover, I see Jesus as a life-saving inspiration with an important message for us all.- I don't need 300 pages of flowery words telling me how \\"special my heart is\\" or how beautiful my soul is. I'm not interested in navel-gazing, I'm interesting in making a difference in the world.This book seems to have been written for a small subset of women who have serious self-worth issues relating to deep wounds they've suffered. My heart goes out to these women, but I'm not even sure this book will help them. If you're that wounded, counseling will probably help a lot more than regressions back to 'Daddy's little girl'. For the rest of us who aren't in need of 'rescue' and find the notion of Jesus as fantasy lover to be a bit too weird, this book misses the mark."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have to admit, I wrote a scathing review at one time for this book. Although there are imperfections, as with ANYTHING outside of God's Word, the Eldredges have shown me ways to allow God to work in my life that I would never have thought I was closed off to. In fact, that was my main argument before. I was much more of a Tomboy and thought that was a good thing, a REALLY good thing and didn't understand the beauty/princess thing at all. I too wanted my OWN adventure and didn't want take my husband captive. I hated the secularization of their message with movies and songs, the scripture and meat as well as the idea that if I, as a child of God, am the Bride of Christ, then He is my Bride and being loved by Him would be a part of my desire. The idea of Jesus as Lover was sacrilegious to me.As I watched more and more wonderful women in my life read and love this book, I had decided to read it again and finish it this time in order to be able to refute every argument. I began with understanding that the secular movie references would help reach non-church goers/unbelievers in ways that most Christian literature could not and that every reference to beauty had nothing to do with outward beauty, but the beauty of God within each of us. As I understood fully the idea that God uses marriage as a picture to help us to understand His relationship with us then allowed the picture of being loved by Jesus in this way to make sense, this was not intended to be sexual as I along with many others mistook it.I now see that my hatred for this book had to do with the work I did not want to allow to happen within my heart. I allowed myself to remain closed off and angry that it was striking a cord missing the great healing that I believe God wants to do in every woman's life through this book.I now understand my role has helpmate and woman within my marriage and family in ways I never could before. I am thrilled to be alongside my husband on this adventure and will gladly be giving this book to any woman in my life who is willing to set aside their prejudices and the imperfections of human writing that any book has so that they too can enjoy the freedom of walking in the role that God intends for them."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I expected a lot more from this book since it was recommended by so many Christian friends. I just didn't get it. I understood what the author is saying, however I outgrew most of this by the time I graduated high school. Are there really grown women out there secretly waiting for princes to sweep them off their feet? I know that God created me to be feminine, fun, and nurturing, but I don't dwell on these qualities. Perhaps that's why this book didn't connect with me. I'm not really interested in overanalyzing my inner and outer attributes."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My Bible study leader recommended this book, saying that it is a \\"life-changing book.\\" Upon finishing \\"Captivating,\\" I found it to be anything but. There were a few passages here and there in which I liked; although, I found the majority of the book to be watered-down and lacking of substantiated biblical support. Rather than backing up their claims with Scripture, John and Stasi Eldredge support their arguments using the plots of movies (i.e. Lord of the Rings). What is the problem with this? Movies are fictional. They are not real.All in all, I do NOT recommend this book. It is watered-down and deficient of solid biblical truth. Several of my friends have also been disappointed with the content of this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read everything that John Eldredge has written and have found each of his books enlightening and wonderful. That being said none can top this book in reaching women on a deep heart level. The female version of WILD AT HEART, this book explores the deepest longings of women to be seen as beautiful and to be desired for the person they are. Co-written with his wife, Stasi, for the female perspective it gives a full picture of the relationships between men and women.For that reason (and many others), men in particular would benefit from reading this book in order to understand the women in their lives. As the authors write at one point, \\"Women are a mystery to be enjoyed, not a problem to be solved.\\" This directly addresses the problem most women find in their relationships as they are labeled too much of this or not enough of that (too emotional, too needy, not smart enough, not independent enough.) This book helps both sexes explore how the differences between men and women can be understood and appreciated in a way that edifies both.At the heart of this book are the principles at the center of each Eldrege book: that there is a battle for our hearts and that we must fight to regain the person that Christ died for us to be. Take the time to read this book and work through the guided journal when it comes out in July. I promise it will be a life changing journey that will open your heart more deeply to Christ and the ones you love."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is beautiful. Take your time to read the book. Let God speak. When she poses questions, take time to let them sink in, what is your heart saying in response? What is God saying? Remember that as you read that it is opposed by the Enemy. If you don't know this already, you will once you finish the book. The Enemy does not want your heart to be alive. Don't let him keep you from all God has.One thing should be said. In the book she delves into the wound, much like Wild at Heart. When she presented these concepts in the Ransomed Femininity retreats she made something clear that was not as clear in the book. YES, each woman does have a wound. NO, it does not have to be something that the world would recognize as tragic, just something \\"tragic\\" to you. Something that has tainted the way you look at the world, yourself, and God in some way. In the retreats she stated that when looking at your wound that your urge would be one of two. You would either thing that it was not a big deal, dismiss it, or you would consider it so large and become so engulfed by it that you would not truly believe God could redeem it. Be aware of your heart's response when reading about the wound and respond accordingly. I pray you are blessed!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating was a a bit confusing and I don't agree with a lot of what is communicated in this book. First of all, John and Stasi keep changing around who is talking about what. That was really confusing for me. They kept saying (Stasi here) or (John here). I didn't know who was who half the time. Also, it really confused me when Stasi said she was okay with taking prescription drugs for her depression and doesn't see anything wrong with it, and then compared it to someone taking medication for diabetes! Not exactly the same thing.....I think maybe if she suggested diet and excercise, that might have been more fitting? Also, it was a little uncomfortable when they are taking about calling the evil spirits away from Stasi when she was having dizzy spells...and why didn't her husband know she was having those for so long? That was weird.I understand that all people and Christians are different and have different views, but I DEFINITELY did not connect to the whole twirling princess thing. I never have wanted to be a princess nor have I ever desired to be treated as one.I do like how Stasi is very open to putting it all out on the table, but do you really have to go that far? I think some things are left better kept between you and God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I found this book enchanting and exhilirating, but I don't think it is truly for everyone. Most women I know would benefit from exploring what makes us uniquely feminine, but I have known many women who are far too independent and motivated to enjoy exploring that side of themselves. I would recommend this book for any woman who is recovering from an abusive relationship or has a broken relationship with her parents, spouse, or boyfriend. If you read the whole book, it does encourage independence and discourage doting on a man to make us whole, but most people who would be bothered by the sweet, feminine portrait of a woman that is described may not make it far enough to see that message."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is the first book I have had the privilege to read in quite some time. I have heard how incredible John Eldredge's books are, and now I can understand the hype. I just finished the last chapter (I have also been doing the workbook), and I am so excited with what God has shown me through this book. I do not agree with everything they say, or all of thier viewpoints, but I recieved a lot of healing and revelation from this book. I would highly recommend it to any woman of God who has been wounded (haven't we all?), or is wanting a fresh outlook on who she is in God. Most other christian womens books I have read made me feel so damaged, so far from hitting the \\"mark\\" as a christian woman, this one gives a better understanding of what we were created for as women, not in a condemning way, but for once in an uplifting manner that can bestow hope. My favortie chapter is called about being a warrior as a woman, awesome. This is the first time I personally have read about women being described this way, that sealed the deal for me! I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you are looking for a book of fluff and childhood memories dredged from your past, skim through this book. Do not link it to a Bible study because it is not remotely associated with God's truth. For a new Christian this is dangerous territory because you may see your own husband as not measuring up. Well who can measure up to God's fulfillment as our bridgegroom and Lord? I am disappointed that I was duped into buying this book because of the Eldredge name. There are slim references to Scripture and for me it doesn't measure up."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Dear Whomever May Be Concerned,Today I finished my girlfriend's favorite book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge. There are three things that I have learned in the past two hours of reading and thinking. #1 My girlfriend is an amazing girl and I'm pretty much the luckiest guy on Earth to have her. #2 Guys suck at understanding girls. Being one of those guys who thought he understood girls in high school (arrogance is quite embarrassing) I just would like to say to every guy out there. \\"WE SUCK AT UNDERSTANDING GIRLS.\\" Growing up I thought because I understood the two concepts \\"Girls like bad boys.\\" And \\"Nice guys finished last.\\" I could fully understand the concept of the girl's mind. Man was I wrong. #3 The women's heart longs to be romanced. As guys' we FAIL. Epic giant fail. I look around and I see more guys in my generation looking at porn and degrading women in their mind than I see men buying girl's roses and trying to win their hearts.Men were created in God's image but women were taken from men therefore also created with God's image. Often times we make women feel like they are not skinny enough or too emotional but sometimes we need to be thankful that they exist! God knew exactly what he was doing when He made women. Kiss your mom on the cheek. Tell your girlfriend she's beautiful. Treat the women around you with respect. Stop looking at porn because it degrades women and turns them into objects rather than sisters in Christ. Most importantly start meditating on the fact that the heart of a women is a reflection of the heart of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was intended as a complement to John Eldridge's best seller for men, \\"Wild at Heart,\\" which was predicated on the notion that \`in the heart of every man is a desperate desire for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue.' According to \\"Captivating,\\" \`every little girl has dreams of being rescued by her hero, of being swept away into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess.' As someone raised in the Baptist church, I know that Christians have always had a huge thing for medieval knight/princess metaphors. The fact that such chivalric traditions were developed about a thousand years ago and are completely irrelevant to modern-day conduct for a number of reasons is almost always overlooked.For Christian women, this book does have some good take-home messages: commitment to faith, and the danger of expecting your husband to meet all your primary needs (when \`only God can tell you who you are'). The authors are correct in that many women never do fulfill their potential. My issue is that this book sends women in the wrong direction to find that answer, while at the same time making the contradictory statement that as a woman, your natural purpose is to be a beautiful damsel deserving of rescue (whether by God or by a man). So, not much room for actual self-confidence and independence.I am surprised that this book is as popular as it is with Christian women, because there is really very little theology explored (but much assumed), and the book uses an eclectic mix of source material for quotes: popular movies, songs, and books. For example, to substantiate a statement he makes about men, John Eldridge writes: \`I want you to think of the films men love, the things they do with their free time, and especially the aspirations of little boys, and see if I am not right on this.' Here Eldridge is basing an entire argument off a generalization (much like his previous books for men) that every member of the male sex loves action movies, violence, and aggressive sports. And if they don't like these things, there must be something wrong with them, like not having enough good role models as children or something.The part I found most grating was in Chapter 3, when the authors argue that children ask one fundamental question, but they are different questions depending on whether the child is a boy or a girl (of course, gender socialization is completely glossed over): \`Little boys want to know, Do I have what it takes?...Little girls want to know, Am I lovely?' This level of gender essentialism should be appalling to both seculars (it's inherently sexist) and Christians (it's not even Biblically supported). Not to mention the fact that this means both boys and girls should be taught to only derive meaning from what others think of them (for boys, their achievements and for girls their beauty). The conclusion is that \`the essence of a man is [active] Strength' and \`the essence of a woman is [passive] Beauty.' Because that's a healthy worldview.Another fury-inducing passage regards a time when Stasi felt she was under a spiritual attack: \`As women we long for someone strong [of course not a stronger, self-respecting version of ourselves!] to stand between us and the vicious assaults of our Enemy...John began to take his authority over me as my husband and forcefully commanded the minions of Satan to release me...' Basically, Stasi puts her husband between herself and God. It's been a while since I've been to a Bible study, but I can tell you that nowhere in Scripture are women encouraged to abandon their personal responsibility in this way, and ironically, the chapter opens with a quotation from Isaiah 63:1 as an illustration of \`our Warrior God, a God who comes through for us.' If Stasi knows this God, why does she need her husband to fight evil on her behalf?Ultimately, this book is a mess, and you will certainly not gain any insight into a \\"woman's soul.\\" Like many Christian books attempting to address gender-related issues, the research is clumsy and even non-existent in places. Conclusions are based on general observations and outdated assumptions, and as such do not allow room for women as individuals to ask their own questions, make their own paths, approach their beliefs head-on, or develop healthy senses of their role in society. It sickens me to hear that so many young adult \\"Bible studies\\" for girls are centered around garbage like this."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I purchased this book because I loved reading Wild at Heart so very much. I am female, so reading this book seemed like a logical step. I love what the Eldredges are doing, and I don't have anything negative to say about them at all. What I can say is that I much preferred Wild at Heart over Captivating. I didn't get near as much out of this book as I was hoping to.That said, there is nothing saying that it wouldn't be great for another woman out there. It may just be \\"me.\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm sure there are scores of Christian women out there who might have a problem with the premise of the Eldredge's book \\"Captivating\\". It very nearly goes against every notion that little girls were taught in Sunday school of women being the downfall of human kind and of their subsequent subordination to man. But speaking as a woman who has lived through the worst kinds of abuse, neglect, poverty, and loss, this book restores by leaps and bounds the self esteem a very large part of the world's female population.Do I buy into all of the theological misrepresentations contained in its pages such as their view of Mary the mother of Jesus? Not really, but to dwell on those would be to miss the point of the book completely. This work is a celebration of God's last creation, Woman. Some of the passages that I found to be the most powerful I will quote here:\\"How many of you see God as longing to be loved by you? We see Him as strong and powerful, but not as needing us, vulnerable to us, yearning to be desired (pp. 28-29).God longs to be desired. Just as a woman longs to be desired (pg. 29).It might come as a surprise that Christ asks our permission to come in and heal, but He is kind, and the door is shut from the inside, and healing never comes against our will. In order to experience His healing, we must also give Him permission to come into the places we have so long shut to anyone\\" (pg. 100).Some might find fault with this view of God but if we are created in His likeness as it states in Genesis 1:26, then I think it's safe to assume that the One in whose likeness we are created would experience many of the same emotions that we as humans experience; the chief of these being the need to be wanted and loved. It's a powerful thought. One that can change a life.All in all I found this book uplifting. I would definitely recommend it to any woman who is in need of a new, biblical view of themselves and of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book Captivating is written by John and Stasi Eldredge. I have always been pleased with the quality of books that this couple has put out, and Captivating is no exception.The theme of this book revolves around the \\"Heart of a Woman\\", and the three desires that a woman has: to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures, and to display beauty. These three area's make up the core of this book. The Eldredge's use common movies, music, and books to make their point, and show that most women tend to run around in circles, causing confusion and unrealistic expectations.Captivating references that woman today are either controlling or needy, illustrating that women feel that to be in control is power, or to be needy, is the result of being out of control. The book goes on to point out, that true balance is when a Godly woman sees God as the Ultimate lover, friend, father, guide, the Alpha and the Omega, all of that.. The book encourages women to form close, intimate relationships with one another, like Ruth and Naomi did.In this wild and crazy world, the goal is to become stable and under the guidance of our Heavenly Father, using simple methods, and practical advice.I would recommend this book for any woman. from all walks of life, as well as couples, and men, so that they will understand, where a woman is coming from.I love blogging for Book Snooze, an affiliate of Thomas Nelson Publishing, I received a copy of this book for my review."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Captivating\\" is the companion book toWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul, written specifically for women. It seeks to explain and restore godly femininity. From the blurb:\\"Your heart matters more than anything else in all creation. The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to come now as the Hero of your story, to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.\\"It took me a long time to read this book. In the introduction, the authors say, \\"As a new Christian, the first book I (Stasi) picked up to read on godly feminity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again.\\" Funny, that's how I felt about \\"Captivating\\". The authors claim, \\"There is no 'one size fits all' pattern for God's women,\\" then proceed to build a book based on a one size fits all description of femininity. They never explain it, they just assume that you have the same views they do. I found the generalisations really irritating. Things such as, \\"[Men] are the less complicated of the two genders... Both men and women know this to be true\\", or, \\"Whatever else we know about women, we know they are relational creatures to their cores. While little boys are killing one another in mock battles on the playground, little girls are negotiating relationships... This is so second nature, so assumed among women that it goes unnoticed by them. They care more about relationships that just about anything else.\\" If you hold these same beliefs, you won't have a problem with them, but I found it difficult to stomach such bold-faced generalisations that seem to be accepted as fact.In a word, this book was \\"American\\". There are more references to movies than to the bible. The authors seem to assume that all their readers will come from the same cultural background as they do. As someone who doesn't, I found many of the references and assumptions incomprehensible.I know I am giving the impression that I didn't like this book, but once you get through all the annoying sexism and purple prose, there are actually some gems to be found.

I have to say I was a little disappointed with this book after reading its male counterpart, Wild at Heart, written by John Eldredge. While that book is more level and matter of fact, Captivating is true to its female roots with more emotion and unnecessary words and stories. Maybe not unnecessary, just excessive. It discusses how women have hopes and dreams that are lost in reality. But it also explains how a woman was designed and what she is to become through God's purpose for her.Captivating appears to be a book you either really love or really don't like. It doesn't have a lot of \\"meat\\" and is more of a \\"skimmer\\" book. I was able to skim through the entire book and still understand its message. For me, I didn't particularly like Captivating, so I encourage you to read it and decide for yourself if it's noteworthy."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has a really good message. The message is to become a good Christian woman by finding your true beauty within yourself and by filling your heart with God. The book talks a lot about beauty and finding your true beauty through God because we were made in God's image. I think the authors definitely got to the point, but it seems to circle around a lot. They rambled a lot and kept restating what they had already stated but with different words. It was a little bit repetitive. I think the book could have been summed up in a shorter book. Do not get me wrong, this is a good book especially for girls/women who are struggling with their inner beauty and are trying to find out who they really are. It is a good book for those who seek to be a godly woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A couple of months ago, Thomas Nelson Publishers sent me the book Captivating (Revised and Expanded): Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John & Stasi Eldredge. I had given my mom the first version of this book as a birthday present a while back, but I had never gotten around to borrowing and reading it. Many of the men in my life have read John's book Wild at Heart and gave it rave reviews, so I was excited to read this female version.While the title may be Captivating, I did not find the book to be. It was an extremely slow read and took many months to finish. The premise of the book is to reveal the inner desires of a woman's heart. According to the Eldredges, a woman desires to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty. They go through each of these points in great detail showing us how all women have these desires deep down even if they don't realize it. In their opinion, we have misconstrued ideas of beauty and romance because of some hurt we had in our past. They stated that they wrote this book to let you know that healing of your feminine heart is available and to let you know that it is available.Overall, the book made some great points but they just took a long time to getting to their points by using lots of movie quotes and antidotes. I felt like they could have made their point much faster and clearer if they had made their chapters more concise.

That's what makes a woman come alive.\\"Reactions: What an amazing book! It really touched something in me and helped me realize how much shame I was carrying around needlessly. The Eldredges take it back to the very beginning and put a whole new light on Eve - one I had never thought of or realized before. I always thought of the apple incident when I thought of Eve, but no longer. Eve was created as a perfect woman to complete man and the world! What an empowering feeling! They also encourage women to find, or should I say dig out, their inner dreams that have been buried for years. What a wonderful, life changing book.

There are a lot of key factors that Stasi brings up from childhood to adulthood that are things we as women need to deal with to have a healthy relationship with God, husbands and our own children.This book has been pivotal for a friend who was quite depressed as well as for me thinking everything was hunky-dorey even though I was projecting things on my husband that weren't really there. It has strengthened both my friend's and my marriage and has taught me many things to continue focusing on for our future together.

John and Stasi Eldredge want women to know that they are beautiful. They seek to uncover the truth about who a woman was created to be before the fall of Eve and how a woman can be redeemed, to be free to be the women she was created to be: captivating, feminine, beautiful.In theory, I agree with the authors intentions. In practice, I do not think that the Eldredge's do this topic justice. As I read the book I couldn't help but think that as a woman I was incomplete unless I was married. The use of scripture often times seemed out of context. While there were some good points and ideas to think more about, I wish they would have done more to describe who I am as a woman loved by God rather than a woman trying to be the princess in a fairytale trying to be found by my prince. I think the book is worth reading if you can get your hands on a free copy, but read with an open and discerning mind.**Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

The opinions below are my honest opinion and I received the book as a complimentary copy from Thomas Nelson Publishing.I have wanted to read this book since it came out several years ago, but never did get around to it. I was thrilled to receive this copy from Booksneeze to review and this is also the revised and expanded edition. Captivating is a wonderfully written book about us as women in today's society. It's about how our dreams as little girls and even as women have been destroyed or wounded and how the Lord wants to revive those dreams in our hearts and make us Captivating. It's about how God pursues our hearts as women and is very encouraging to any girl or woman seeking to find purpose in her everyday life.I personally loved this book. As a stay at home mom, I often times get bogged down in day to day chores and taking care of the home and children that I forget about my dreams and my soul. Captivating made me realize I am worth far more than just cleaning house, making meals, and changing diapers. My God wants to pursue me and my life and heart to make me into a Captivating woman for Him. I would highly recommend this book to any of the women at my church, in my family, or in my playgroup. Wonderful book that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"It casuses my heart to feel sad for those who's responses to this book were 'I can't relate' 'leaders beware' 'I hated it'It is the complete opposite of the 30+ women who read this book together at our church. Some reviews said it was for weak women, they don't have a problem with men. We did not see it that way at all. Many of us at one time or another have been hurt. We live with imperfect humans who let us down at some point in our lives. Some have received healing and are walking tall in their faith, in their lives, in their relationships, but we still need to know how others might being hurting.I have never been molested but many of my friends have. Who am I to say that learning about others hurts does not pertain to me. We are called to love and serve others. This book open my eyes to where I was and confirmed where I am today. 'I am a woman at rest who invites others to rest' this book just confirmed and re-afirmed what the Lord has already done. And it challenged me to help other find that same rest...But as we read this book outloud as a group you could see and feel the different responses. The wounds, hurts, and healings that were represented in just this small group of women. Reading it was freeing to so many. It opened doors for healing to take place. Questions to be answered. The description of creation, ending with the climax of woman being created, was a beautiful love note from God to me, to us as women. I shared it with my husband who was moved by the thought and the visiual picture painted in their words.My heart saddens for the women who have read this book and don't come away from it feeling loved and charished by their creator. Nothing can take place from scripture and God's true love letter to us, but Capitvating just opens up scripture and helps, for so many, to make it personal to them.We read Capitvating 2 years ago as a womens group and they are asking to go through it again. It helps to remind us of who we are, what we were created and destined to be. Every woman and the men in their lives should read Capitvating.Be encouraged today in who you are and know your Father created you for a special purpose.

I'll start by summarizing some obvious observations:1. He uses Hollywood movies (in excess) to illustrate spiritual points.2. He rarely uses Scripture and when he does, it's weak and/or out of context.3. His views are incredibly shallow - all men (and women) appear the same in his universe.4. His theology is incredibly weak as a result.5. Isn't it interesting how the three points match up so well with three points in WAH and WTD ?A large number of 5-star reviewers admit that this is the very first book they've read in a long time, and sometimes it's their first book period. With little else to compare, it's easy to see why there is so much high praise and so little criticism. There are many books better than this - I would recommend some Phillip Yancey, and Henri Nouwen.One previous reviewer summarized it best - \\"Pop phychology posing as theology\\" ... case closed.

You are NOT someone whose worth rests on your beauty and ability to have men contend for your favor! It's prefectly OK if you want to sweep a lovely man off HIS feet!This book is, above all, sexist. There are many things wrong with it, but the huge problem is that it uses Christianity as a pretext to reinforce a woman's role to sit there, quietly, beautifully, and sweetly, waiting to be \\"fought for\\". Women need to be told that they are strong, that they are more than just beautiful and desireable--NOT that they need to be more like the girls in the 'chick flicks' (which, by the way, every woman loves).On top of this, their most concrete evidence comes from movies. Yes, movies. And not even good ones, guys--I'm talking Titanic-like movies. In case you were expecting one, a sociological study this is not (let alone based on any empirical evidence whatsoever).It seems that Stasi decided that she would write a self-affirming book, telling women that they are all sweet, beautiful, submissive objects to be fought over and swept of their feet--precisely because that is what she is."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A must read for every woman to help her see that she is not alone and that there is a way to heal from her wounds.

Reach for your bible and look up women like Tamar and Mary Magdalene and Abigail. Study their character. \\"Bad Girls of the Bible\\", the new \\"Lost Women of the Bible\\", \\"Intimate Issues\\" by Lorraine Pintus, and \\"Every Woman's Battle\\" and many of the myriads of \\"women-in-the-bible\\" devotionals can bring in a deeper discussion. I am a strong, competent, motivated and independent woman-but read woman, not MAN. I'm not wired like a guy and thank goodness.The book is sweet in tone, but if you're willing to be a little tender and dig objectively, you may learn a little something.

However, after reading Eldredge's excellent book Wild At Heart (which is geared towards men), I wanted to get the other perspective as well. I'm glad I did. Captivating is a must read for any man that wants to understand the heart of a woman. I especially recommend it to any men that are raising a daughter. You'll begin to understand the natural feminine desires of your little girl's heart in a way that you never have. Also, it will help you to become more \\"in-tuned\\" to your wife's needs as you share your life journey together.Edredge and his wife devote most of the book to teaching women how to overcome hurts from their past and how to reclaim the desires and dreams they once had as little girls. For these are the same dreams and desires that God placed within their hearts long ago and wants to see them fulfilled. The authors go on to explain how God wants to be our one true lover that will never fail us. We just have to open ourselves unconditionally up to Him.Like I said, even though this book is geared toward women, I think that men will get just as much out of it. As a matter of fact, I think it's more important for men to read this than women."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Wow how this book opened my eyes to God's wondrous work in creating me.

And Wow, it's not too late to make some changes way down deep in my own feminine, Christian heart.I so enjoyed reading this book and reading Stasi's own personal story and testimony. John's comments along the way confirmed that this is not just a women's crazy idea about life, but indeed thoughts based on the Bible and personal experience in marriage counseling.The main thrust of the book is considering what is your own soul question. Am I lovely? Am I strong? Am I able? It is definitely a book of searching and considering how each one of us have been living in light of the freedom that God wishes to extend to us all - freedom to live up to the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and to live entirely for Him setting aside all of our hurts and past wounds.I felt deeply refreshed having read this book and am hoping to get the companion book for men - Wild at Heart - for my boys and husband to read soon.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Well, I just finished this book in record time.

Before I had finished, I had ordered a copy for my mom, called two friends to see if they owned it (they did!) and started planning use for my women's group. Now, the women's group was an incidental, since I ordered the wrong book for my mom (study guide instead of actual book) but I know that it will hit so many women no matter where they are at.One friend said it really helped pull her from her depression and helped get her back on track with her family and God. No, it's not a replacement for the Bible, but a lot of us have a hard time focusing in on where the bible meets current day life. Oddly, as I finished the book Saturday night, then went to church the following morning, our pastor hit on some of the very topics in the book!

However, I just could not connect with the book itself. I'm not sure what is to blame- perhaps because I am only in my 20's and still growing up. Maybe I have not had enough life experience to really grasp the message of this book. Whatever it was, I can say that I enjoyed reading, but struggled to pay close attention.The main idea of this book is that women are created in God's image, and that means we are beautiful inside and out. The authors encourage readers to look past the fear, failures, disappointments, and heartbreaks to see the beauty that lies within them. It is indeed a strong message that each of us need to hear, and to put into practice. The authors make several strong points throughout the book, it just takes time to dig in and find those truths.

The book describes how as women we are designed to share God's beauty and life-giving qualities with the world. Unfortuately, too many women are too wounded or busy or unattached from God and fail to reveal their captivating qualities. The authors describe an ideal where women are fully living out their feminine uniquenesses while not being helpless and weak, but instead serving God and loving others as \\"warrior princesses\\". It contained many anecdotes, many personal ones shared by the authors, which kept the writing very relational.The authors write in tandom, and at times it was confusing trying to discern who was writing. I have read a book by John Eldredge before. His writing evokes passion and encourages the reader to connect with God on a heart-level. I would give this book a rating of 4 out of 5.

The description sounded so interesting.The beginning of the book did indeed draw me in. I read a few things that didn't seem quite right, but knew that with all books, you can't take everything you read as gospel.I kept waiting for the book to \\"get to the point\\". Perhaps it's because I don't \\"suffer\\" from most of the things Stasi touched upon. Or perhaps it just wasn't speaking \\"to me\\". But, I felt a little lost about 3/4 of the way through the book.Small note, but I did find a few grammatical and spelling errors. There were a couple of sentences that didn't make any sense....as if the beginning or ending was left off.I think this book would address a real need, but the message is lost in the delivery. It was hard to know who was writing...either John or Stasi. Perhaps if they had two different font colors or font types for each of them would help. But, as a reader, you are left wondering who is talking at times.I wonder what the original edition was like, and may read that version as well, just to find out.Like I said, I do feel this book does address some actual issues present in women's lives. I just don't feel that they are as present in everyone's lives as the authors seem to feel. I will say that the needs of men versus the needs of women is right on. I will also say that so much more could have been expounded upon regarding the different types of women. So much more could have been written to show women how destructive being an emasculating or desolate woman can be. Or how to be more of an alluring woman.

Even though the first publishing was in 2005, my soul has needed this for, well, longer than I can remember.John and Stasi Eldredge are truly blessed with God's words to women who are hurting, broken-hearted, and probably even several out there who think they are doing just fine in their lives. Using their own personal stories of pain, heart-break, rebellion, and spiritual warfare, John and Stasi present an upfront message of life, hope and most of all, grace to those who have experienced pain and suffering in their own lives.

It is like getting two years of counseling for about thirteen dollars. What a deal!\\" Yeah ... I should get that journal!Oh ... and fellas ... don't think this book is just for women. There is plenty of information in this book that would give you a glimpse into how it feels to be a woman. But if you want to read a really good book, John and Stasi have Wild at Heart for you.In the appendix, there are prayers for several things. I personally have taken the \\"A Daily Prayer for Freedom\\", typed it up, and will print it out so I can read it each morning. It's long, but fully packed with the armor you will need to get through each day in the Spirit. I challenge you to do the same after reading Captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you're connected with God and have accepted Jesus in your life, this book is a confirmation of what you believe. If you're reading to find answers, this book will open your eyes to truth."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I tend to avoid books when they are on the bestseller list; it's kind of a reverse snobbishness, I guess. So I avoided Captivating the first time around, despite the fact that I'd read The Sacred Romance (by John Eldredge and Brent Curtis) and loved it, and despite the personal recommendations I received.I can't, thus, tell you much about how this revised-and-expanded version is better than the original. But I can tell you that, if you are a woman this is a book worth reading. Not if-you-are-a-woman-and-a-Christian, just: if you are a woman.Why? Not that the Christian thing doesn't matter, but that every woman struggles on some level with the issues that the Eldredges talk about. Their philosophy and, yes, their solutions are Biblically based; for non-Christian women, I can understand that might be a turn-off. But I urge you anyway: stride through the Scripture quotations and sit still for the stories and the truths that aren't tied up in church-speak.And for Christian women, this book can help you step out of the easy answers so often given via church-speak and deal with the hurts it's quite possible to hide but impossible to truly forget.The heart of this book is about remembering, about dealing with the lies that tell us to forget-about-it, quit-making-things-such-a-big-deal. This book helps us to understand why some things are a big deal, and should be, and how we need to look at them and find out what they're telling us. As we acknowledge, and remember who we really are, we can let go not in self-denial or resentment, but in true freedom.That's a good read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A few years ago I read a book about a brand new concept for Christian women, Captivating by Staci Eldridge. It was a radical shift in my thinking about who I could be as a wife, mother, and to be fully engaged in life's greatest adventures. I was surprised to see that there was a new and revised version of the same book that shown a light on my life a few years ago. Naturally I couldn't resist the temptation to see what new thoughts awaited me between the pages. Still Staci Eldrige has a way of taking your innermost thoughts and affirming that you're not crazy for thinking that there must be something more. Captivating, ISBN 978-1-40020282-9 still proves to be one of the best books for women giving them hope in the hurting and confidence in the midst of a changing life. Captivating shows you that you don't have to settle for a boring life. Make yours a life that you were meant to live...not just a life that will make do. Here's what someone asked me recently...\\"What's inhabiting my life that's inhibiting my dreams?\\" That's what Captivating will challenge you to discover. Great read!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently received the book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge to review for Thomas Nelson Publishing Company.What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating is doing for women. Setting their hearts free. This groundbreaking book shows readers the glorious design of women before the fall, describes how the feminine heart can be restored, and casts a vision for the power, freedom, and beauty of a woman released to be all she was meant to be (book description)It is God's design that we see Him as Daddy, Papa, Lover....that we truly feel romanced and loved by Him, no matter what our past or present circumstances are. Unfortunately many women have not had the honor of knowing Him this way. They stay locked up in a prison of lies.This book seeks to see women set free and walking in the true beauty of their soul, their inner woman, the \\"warrior princesses\\" that they were intended to be! If you allow it to, it can help bring you to a place of wholeness, if you're willing to come into agreement with God and how He sees you!This is a book that cannot simply be read through one time. I think it is one that must be read over and over, read slowing and with a heart open and ready to receive.I would have loved to have seen some discussion questions or \\"thought provokers\\". I'm not a fan of \\"written out, pray this prayer\\" type thing. There were parts of the book that I didn't necessarily agree with, or maybe I just needed to read it a few more times to understand it better.Overall I think it is a worthy read!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Everyone woman is an amazing creation an gift from God to this earth, and it's sad that too many women do not view themselves this way. Captivating, by John and Stasi Eldredge, is written to address this very issue and many of the other main issues that plague women's hearts. This book draws attention to the unique beauty that God created women to be, and the important role that she was made to play in His story. The writers also deal with the wounds that women receive from the ultimate enemy, shining light on this war that rages against God's daughters, and showing that there is victory to be had on the part of the women of the Kingdom. Sadly, it all too true that there has been a major war against the soul of women from the beginning of time. Looking at the women in my life, and even myself, it is easy to find the ruins of this war that are left as scars on the hearts of us all. Women have these eveidences in varying areas and degrees, but no doubt every woman is in a battle, and so few even realize it for what it is.This has probably been one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it three times now, and each time my eyes are opened to who I really am to God, and how the Enemy does everything he can to tell me otherwise. I highly recommend this book to every women out there, no matter her age and place in life. This book holds truths that women need to have their eyes opened up to so that they can receive the freedom to be the beautiful daughters that God created them to be. This is seriously a MUST read."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There is a longing within the soul of every woman to be beautiful, to be sought after, to be captivating. In this book, John and Stasi Eldredge, in their heart-to-heart fashion, lead each woman into her own personal revelation of true and everlasting beauty.I must admit I thought this was going to be just another feel-good, self-help book. I didn't need it, but perhaps some of my readers would be interested. I was pleasantly surprised.The Eldredges are on a three-fold mission: to lead women into a genuine and deep relationship with Christ, to help them see what each was uniquely created to be, and to encourage them to unveil their own personal beauty to the world around them.They begin by defining what it means to be a woman, and I really appreciate their balance. For instance, this quote from Chapter Two:\\"Rather than asking, 'What should a woman do--what is her role?' it would be far more helpful to ask, 'What is a woman--what is her design?'...\\"Isn't that rich?Though I could not agree with everything doctrinally nor medically, one must take what is profitable and leave the rest. And there was way too much which was eternally profitable for me to lay this book aside. In fact, I plan to read it again very soon. I hope you will, too.(Thomas Nelson has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book.)"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The subtitle says it all when it comes to this book's goal: \\"Unveiling the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" The book didn't so much unveil as it did remind. It would be the understatement of the century to say that men and women are different. (Remember Mars and Venus?) Man's typical understanding of woman is the source of many a comedian's jokes, but more significantly it's the root of many of our world's problems.John and Stasi remind us men that women think, feel, and process differently. Being cherished isn't a desire that's on the top of my radar screen, but the Eldridges remind me that a woman want to be cherished. Remember dress up games and fairy tale endings? Life in the real world hasn't crushed that innate feminine instinct.Here's a great quote that sums up a lot of the authors' intent: \\"If we could read the secret histories of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostilities.\\"The book is a great conversation starter. It would be healthy for couples to read this alongside \\"Wild at Heart\\" to deepen our understanding of each other. The book is likely guilty of sweeping generalizations at times, but these don't weaken the spirit of the book. Bottom line: it's worth the read. Not earth shattering, but if it leads to more open communication between men and women, it could be life changing.(Disclosure: I received a free reviewer's copy of the book from [...]. I'm allowed to review however I want...I don't get fired for hating a book!)"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A couple of weeks ago, I received a copy of Captivating: Unveiling the Mysteries of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge to review. I dove into it right away; I had read Wild At Heart by John Eldredge, and learned so very much about my husband while reading it! I was extremely excited for a woman's counterpart to the book.And I must say, I was not at all disappointed. Captivating touches on the very essence of being a woman, of being a daughter of Eve. It shows not only the when we were created, but the why, and in a way that shows God's incredible, intense love for us as women. It attempts to unveil the secrets to the feminine heart (if you can... it does a pretty good job, though!), and shows us how to start healing our wounds, by first and foremost, making God the hero in our fairy tale. It's a book about being uniquely feminine, to truly be an ezer kenegdo (commonly translated helpmeet, but being, oh, so much more than that!). It also shows something I've been missing in other books on godly femininity. It shows me how to put into perspective longings that my heart has had, and how those longings directly come from God, and are there to bring me always back to Him.Overall... a book I highly recommend!!One of my favorite quotes from the book says, \\"This book is not about what you ought to do, or who you ought to be. It's about discovering who you already are, as a woman. A woman who at her core was made for romance, made to play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure, and who really does possess a beauty all her own to unveil. The woman God hand in mind when He made Eve... and when he made you. Glorious, powerful, and captivating.\\"Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

The premise of the book is based on the presupposition that, \\"Every woman in her heart longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\"We, as women, want to be a part of something. We want to be found valuable, irreplaceable, and beautiful. Stasi, through personal anecdotes, addresses the fact that the world has quelched these desires. In varying degrees, we've had wounds inflicted on us from childhood that lead us to believe that the opposite is true: that we aren't valuable, that we aren't beautiful, that no one needs us. We have been led to believe that in order to fix this hurt, we must be \\"good Christian women,\\" we must follow a list of neatly scripted bullet points and how-to's. Unfortunately, these \\"how to's\\" tend to focus on our exterior actions, and not on the heart of the issue.Captivating reminds you to pay attention to your heart.

However I came on to this website to order a copy of this book for a Christian friend of mine in the US, and decided to read some of the reviews before ordering! Having done so I felt compelled to have my say!!!!I did this book as a study with a Ladies Fellowship in Germany and to be honest the first chapter did put me off a little. (I thought it was a bit corny...) However, once I got into the book, I honestly couldn't put it down and was actually quite disappointed when I got to the last page. I found it quite compelling to read, but I don't suggest that you take this book as \\"gospel\\" (no pun intended) and to be fair, I don't believe the author intends for that either. All books like this are basically based on some other person's opinions and experiences. I thought it was a bit different from some of the other Christian books I've read recently, and I didn't get on board with every single area of the book, (I also thought of Jesus being a \\"lover\\" a bit weird, although I understood where she was coming from. I do agree with a loving and intimate relationship with him, so maybe she didn't quite hit the mark in describing that particular area) however it did provoke quite a lot of discussion in our group which was fab and very stimulating and enjoyable.I has made me think of my relationship with the Lord differently and has encouraged me on my journey as a Christian women who is not SUPER-CHRISTIAN-WOMAN! I don't see it as a substitute for scripture, but what book is? Read it and don't take it too seriously, see it for what it is."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I was a little girl (okay, not that little, but younger than I am now), I would imagine myself being a lawyer or a Jedi. I would save the world from criminals, uphold the ways of the Force, and travel the world (or the universe on my own starship). Eventually, the hero of my dreams (either detective or Luke Skywalker) would tell me how beautiful I was and marry me. Together, we would live happily ever after. Fast forward over a dozen years and the story is much different. Today, I have a less-than-glamorous job, no significant relationships with men, and little hope that anyone outside my family will ever call me beautiful.My story is one that many women can relate to. In this book, John and Stasi acknowledge the way that women feel and encourage them to rise above it. Women are not called to mediocrity, is their cry. Women are meant to be beautiful, to be loved and to love, and to be involved in adventure and the way this can be achieved is by a meaningful, intimate relationship with the one who started it all: God, the ultimate lover.What I Liked:When I first started this book, I couldn't get into it. When my church group encouraged the ladies to read Captivating while the men read Wild at Heart, I took up the challenge--this time with better success. The entire novel absorbed me--particularly Chapter Two: \\"What Eve Alone Can Tell\\". In this chapter, John and Stasi gave me a picture of my femininity that I had never, in my wildest dreams, pictured before. Here, they assert that Creation was not complete without woman. For me, that was the most jaw-dropping moment of the book. \\"Creation is not complete without me?!?!\\" Woa.Furthermore, John and Stasi give plenty of examples--Biblical, pop culture, and real-life men and women--of what they mean. In describing God and how he wants to love us, they use examples from movies that many women have seen: Titanic, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, and Sense and Sensibility to name a few (none of the movies are endorsed, only the imagery is used). When describing how parents influence a daughter's image of herself, several women's life stories are given. This real-life approach is also given when describing interactions with men, interactions with God, and interactions in the world and lends the whole book great authenticity.But most importantly, John and Stasi made me realize how valued I was as a woman and how important it was for me to let go of all the chains and grudges and burdens I have been holding on to. In this manner, the book was a success and a delight.What I Did Not Like:Towards the end, the book begins to read like a to-do list, i.e. \\"So in order to feel better and be more beautiful follow the steps below\\". I hate this because I am the type of person who wants to do the items and conquer each before moving on in the book. But when you are just reading through a book (and don't plan on doing a step, waiting a few weeks/months, going to the next step, repeat), such a tactic does not work. And if I just read all the steps one after another without doing each one, I tend to get overwhelmed with all the \\"to-do\\" work I have in front of me.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:In relating a prior conversation, a woman says an expletive.John and Stasi relate others' (and Stasi's) failed relationships. These include rape, sexual assault, physical abuse, verbal abuse, and other forms of domestic violence. Definitely not for younger teens; preferably for older teens and adults.Overall:Wow. Wow. What else can I say? I've learned so much about myself in the few days this book has taken to read that I never knew in all the years before. I know why I feel the way I do--and that many other women feel the same way. I understand how my parents influence the way I do things today. And I understand that God loves me in a special way--a romantic way that church never talks about.Are you a lonely woman, looking desperately for someone to love and love you? Are you bored out of your mind in your job? Is someone calling you beautiful? This is a book that will show you that there is someone to love, to call you to adventure and who is calling you beautiful. A must read book.Brought to you by*C.S.

It sets women free.In a society that professes equal rights for women and liberty for all, women often are spiritually imprisoned. Why? We believe the lies fed to us by the media and wounds dealt to us through our lifetimes. It compounds and keeps us from being the women we are meant to be; the woman God needs us to be. The world needs our beauty and strength.The authors do a brilliant job of driving their points home and tells us how God loves us through the use of the word of God. They point out the enemy's use of the blows we are dealt in life to keep us from God and hinder our progress in life.The authors use abundant scripture and anecdote to write this book. It is entertaining and touches the feminine heart. It shows us that we can be who we are and should embrace our personal style and talents. It also tells us how we all have beauty to unveil. (This is opposite of what the world tells us, isn't it?)Of course, this is not the Bible so it is not perfect. For example, I do not agree with the author's implication that women are not intended for leadership. I have never been able to find Biblical evidence for this assertion.

The authors seemed to make huge statements without backing them up with scripture. There was hardly any scripture used, and when it was, it seemed off topic or out of context.We started using the companion book for our discussions, but quickly turned to writing our own discussion questions. The questions were poorly written, and most of them were simply yes/no. We began writing questions challenging each other to find scripture that illustrated certain points that the Eldredges were trying to make. We were able to easily find more adequate scriptures, and we started to wonder if the book had been written in a huge rush and they hadn't had time to look for better scriptures (too much time watching movies, I guess).There are so many better books out there. This was weak and fluffy and seemed to focus more on what fantasy and movies have to say about love and beauty than what the Bible says. The problem with fantasy and movies is that life doesn't happen that way. And I was so sick of Lord of the Rings by the end of this book, I didn't even want to hear about it anymore!"},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"First off, I really wanted to like this book. My mother raved about how wonderful it was and gave me a copy of my own, telling me how it brought her to tears and moved her. I dove into it, thinking I would find beautiful truths to nurture my soul.However, I came away pretty disappointed.First off, the good things - the book captured me in explaining ways in which women are image-bearers of God. I did gain some insight from this. However, the negative in this book shadows the positive.Many other reviewers have spelled out the sloppy theology in this book, so I won't elaborate too much on that here. However, the biggest complaint I had with this book is the way in which it treats women who don't base their lives on a man's approval. Stasi and John talk a lot about women who want to be seen as beautiful, women who want to be romanced; and while those desires are all fine, they simply don't define every single woman. This book forms a one-size-fits-all mold for femininity, and then calls that mold \\"Biblical femininity,\\" leaving single, unglamorous, less-than-romantic women like myself to wonder, \\"Do I just not measure up?\\"Thankfully, John and Stasi don't make the mold - Christ does. He recognizes that each women is a unique individual with unique desires. I think this book would have been much better had it simply been a tale of Stati's journey to discover the kind of woman God wanted HER to be, rather than trying to fit her specific experiences to all women.For a more theologically sound, less rigid look at God's design of/plan for women, I highly recommend Jonalyn Fincher's \\"Ruby Slippers,\\" also published by Zondervan. I trust and agree with many of Zondervan's publications - but sadly, this one really missed the mark."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Due to too many generalizations about what a woman is and should be, rather than a solid scientific approach to unveiling a woman's heart, soul, or mind. While I found the writing a bit lyrical at times, I was disturbed about how easily contemporary stereotypes are supported. \\"Beauty is inviting\\" seems to both provide an excuse for bad behaviors thrust upon women, while suggesting that a truly beautiful woman wouldn't thwart advances. Considering the current rates of rape in this country, this line of thinking seems a bit irresponsible. Further, the assertion that women of power are somehow less beautiful is disturbing, untrue, and simply unfounded. Ultimately, this is where I gave up on the book.I was looking for a considered and supported book, but in return found a book full of personal convictions, weakly supported by Bible passages (which seemed twisted to bolster the authors' points), and generalizations about who and what a woman is and should be. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Captivating: unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is designed to address the life of a woman and the role she has to play. It was written to do for women what John Eldredge's Wild At Heart did for men. It also says that God longs to have a personal relationship with us. However this book misses the mark in making these two points. Here are some of the problems that make this book spiritually unprofitable---Generalizations. In the first chapter the Eldredge's state that \\"every woman in her heart longs for three things: to be romanced, to play and irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" In the rest of the book they attribute why women don't get these three things to the fact that their \\"Question\\" hasn't been answered. They say that every woman is asking the question \\"Am I lovely?\\" Stasi seems to take her personal experience and personal desires and attribute them to every woman. She comes from a troubled past of depression, eating disorders, abuse and sexual promiscuity--this helps the reader understand some of where she is coming from, but for her to make her own experience out to be the problems with all women is not accurate by any stretch.-Problems with Proverbs 31. Several times this book voices a problem with Proverbs 31. Speculating about \\"church women\\" and their model for femininity, they say,\\"We're all living in the shadow of that infamous icon, 'The Proverbs 31Woman,' whose life is so busy I wonder, when does she have time forfriendships, for taking walks, or reading good books? Somehow shehas sanctified the shame most women live under, biblical proof thatyet again we don't measure up. Is that supposed to be godly--thesense that you are a failure as a woman?\\" (p.6)The truth is that we are failures, all of us, men and women alike. That's why we need Christ to save us and make us new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), set apart to do His good works (Eph. 2:10). We don't need to feel good about ourselves or our efforts to measure up, that is the whole reason we need Christ--we don't measure up. As believers our time on this earth is a life-long pursuit for Christ likeness. If we think the Proverbs 31 woman makes us feel bad to compare ourselves to, how do we feel when we look at ourselves compared to Jesus, who is perfect? We shouldn't be resentful toward God's Word, but should humbly accept what God calls us to and strive wholeheartedly to that end.-Movies. Conclusions drawn from feelings/emotions and movies seem to be more valid than Scripture. I was surprised at how many movies they used for examples and illustrations for their points rather than looking to women in the Bible. Not only that, many of the movies they reference seem inappropriate.-Taking Scripture out of context. The Eldredges constantly refer to the book Song of Songs to make their points. Even though this book clearly and specifically accounts Solomon's relationship with the Shulamite maiden, this book uses verse after verse as God speaking to women.For example, in the introduction of chapter seven Stasi tells of a walk she took one night in which she admired creation and complimented God saying, \\"It's beautiful, Lord! The stars are amazing!\\" Apparently she \\"heard\\" a response, \\"I'm glad you like it, my Darling.\\" Stasi continues with her narrative, \\"I stopped dead in my tracks. I blushed. Did the God of the universe just call me 'Darling'?\\" She tells how later she was reading Song of Songs and was amazed to have some sort of confirmation in chapter one verse fifteen, \\"How beautiful you are, my darling.\\"Many other times the Eldredges make big statements without any Scriptural foundation at all. Two of the more troubling ones are:\\"For the root of all holiness is Romance\\" (p. 113)\\"You. You are meant to fill a place in the heart of God noone and nothing else can fill. Woah. He longs for you.\\" (p. 120)-Confusing Biblical love with romance. Biblical love is defined as: patient, kind, not having envy, not proud, rude or selfish, doesn't get upset easily, doesn't think evil but rejoicing in truth, love bears all things, hopes and endures. Romance can be defined as: an emotional attraction, excitement, adventure and seeking to gain one's favor with flattery.-Assuming our desires are good. Throughout this book, the Eldredges seek to address women's desires, may they be for acceptance, beauty, adventure or romance...they assume that all desires we have are God-given. They talk much about the core of a woman's heart and the longings and desires that are there, but they never address the reality that our hearts are wicked and terribly deceived. Jeremiah 17:9 says, \\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?\\" At one point Proverbs 4:23 is quoted which says, \\"Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.\\" The conclusion they make from this verse is that,\\"Your feminine heart has been created with the greatest of all possibledignities--as a reflection of God's own heart. You are a woman to yoursoul, to the very core of your being...When he created you as his woman--that journey begins with your heart. Another way of saying this is thatthe journey begins with desire.\\" (p.8)I can have lots of desires that are self induced longings for things that God may not want there. Proverbs 3:5 gives a similar exhortation on this matter of the heart and desires: \\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding...\\" We should never assume that we have anything good in us and especially not that our own desires for things are somehow right simply because they exist. That is why I'm exhorted to guard my heart with diligence, it isn't right or good, but deceitful and wicked.-Vague on sin and salvation. The Eldredges do talk about God and mention salvation, but fail to do so in a clearly defined or Biblical light. In chapters three and four we are given an account of the creation and the fall where sin or salvation are referred to as \\"fallen Eve\\" or \\"redeemed Eve\\". Sin is often referred to vaguely as having \\"fallen from grace\\", \\"goes bad\\", \\"fails\\" or is not \\"not measuring up\\". The distinction of a woman being spiritually alive or spiritually dead is unclear. The Eldredges state that Satan hates women, because of her \\"beauty and power\\" (p. 85) making it seem as though the spiritual battles we face are between Satan and his evil forces and specifically women rather than believers.Another particularly troubling part claims that Christ has saved us so we can be ourselves.\\"Now the Son of God has come to ransom you, and to heal yourbroken, wounded, bleeding heart, and to set you free from bondage.He came to restore the glorious creation that you are. And then setyou free...to be yourself.\\" (p. 95)I'm very concerned about this claim, because Biblically the whole reason we've been set free from sin and death specifically is so that we can not be ourselves, but instead be like Christ. That's why in 2 Corinthians 5:17 it says that \\"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\\"There are so many other issues in this book that I could address--assaulting spirits, taking medication for depression, Christian psychology, and the chapter called \\"Arousing Adam.\\" But the fundamental problem with this book is that it is woman-centered rather than God-centered. The Eldredges try to exalt women to a position that is nowhere found in Scripture.\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman.In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam,but with Eve... Given the way creation unfolds, how it builds toever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt thatEve is the crown of creation? Not an afterthought. Not a niceaddition like an ornament on a tree. She is God's final touch, hispiece de resistance... Look out across the earth and say to yourselves,'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me.Creation reached its zenith in me.'\\" (p. 25)\\"There is something uniquely magnificent and powerful about a woman.We tried to reveal the immeasurable dignity, the holiness of yourfeminine heart by showing that it is God who longs for Romance...it is God who reveals beauty as essential to life. You are the imagebearer of this God. That is why you long for those things too. Thereis a radiance hidden in your heart that the world desperately needs.\\" (p. 42)\\"But most especially, he [Satan] hates Eve. Because she is captivating,uniquely glorious, and he cannot be. She is the incarnation of theBeauty of God. More than anything else in all creation,she embodies the glory of God. She allures the world to God. (p. 84)\\"You see, ultimately, a woman invites us to know God.\\" (p. 137)This book tries to make God out to be a \\"lover\\" and our \\"Romancer\\" rather than teaching us to love Him with all our heart. If you are looking for a book that can help you grow as a godly woman, I would recommend several other authors whose books present a Biblical study of what God calls us to as women: Elizabeth Elliot, Elizabeth George, Martha Peace and Beth Moore. Some books that I've enjoyed in my pursuit to being a godly woman would include: Feminine Appeal by Carolyn Mahaney, Twelve Extraordinary Women by John MacArthur, Attitudes of a Transformed Heart by Martha Peace and Becoming a Woman Who Pleases God by Pat Ennis and Lisa Tatlock. I would encourage you to read any of these books and stay away from Captivating. The heresy the Eldredges are teaching in this book is not edifying for anyone to read. If you know someone who is reading this book, I would encourage you to talk with them about these problems. We need to exercise Biblical discernment and enjoy the relationship with God that He defines in His Word."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],E={key:0},R={key:1};function G(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",W,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",E,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const B=u(H,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-917f1043"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/31.md","filePath":"people/31.md"}'),P={name:"people/31.md"},D=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,D as default};
